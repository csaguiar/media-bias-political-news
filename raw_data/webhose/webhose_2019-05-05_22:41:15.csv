HAHA! Ocasio-Cortez Has Sad Excuse After Getting Called Out for CRINGEWORTHY Fake Southern Accent,ilovemyfreedom.org,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://ilovemyfreedom.org/haha-ocasio-cortez-has-poor-excuse-after-getting-called-out-for-racist-fake-southern-accent/,"HAHA! Ocasio-Cortez Has Sad Excuse After Getting Called Out for CRINGEWORTHY Fake Southern Accent April 5, 2019 J.R.
While speaking at Al Sharpton’s National Action Network’s annual convention, Democrat Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY) put on a horrible southern accent.
It was b d. In fact, she made Hillary Clinton sound like a born and raised southerner.
Some people called AOC’s speech racist, considering the audience was predominantly black and she had never spoken this way in public before.
Check it out… Rep. Ocasio-Cortez: ""I'm proud to be a bartender. Ain't nothing wrong that. There's nothing wrong with working retail…There is nothing wrong with preparing that your neighbors will eat.""
""There is nothing wrong with being a working person in the United States of America."" pic.twitter.com/VTzLpybKfw

YIKES! That’s pretty sad.
It’s also abundantly clear she was trying to put on an accent.
AOC then sent two tweets, obviously mad for getting called out…
Folks talking about my voice can step right off. Women’s March & Kavanaugh speech, same.
Any kid who grew up in a distinct linguistic culture & had to learn to navigate class enviros at school/work knows what’s up.
My Spanish is the same way.
These conspiracy mills are .
https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1114294594282434560
As much as the right wants to distort & deflect, I am from the Bronx. I act & talk like it, *especially* when I’m fired up and especially when I’m home.
It is so hurtful to see how every aspect of my life is weaponized against me, yet somehow asserted as false at the same time. As much as the right wants to distort & deflect, I am from the Bronx. I act & talk like it, *especially* when I’m fired up and especially when I’m home.

Remember Hillary’s southern accent?
Ocasio-Cortez’s “Green New Deal” is projected to cost $93 trillion. That’s quite a lot of cash to spend on a socialist’s fantasy.
Americans need not fret, at the moment, as even Democrats aren’t in favor of AOC’s wild plans.
What’s weird is they let her know it in a very interesting way. While four Dems sided with Republicans, 43 Dems voted “present.”
In other words, not one member of the Senate voted “yes.” U.S. Senate fails to advance resolution calling for debate on #GreenNewDeal .0 – Yea "

Federal and state officials in Louisiana are investigating suspicious fires that destroyed three predominantly black churches in 10 days in one mostly rural parish, authorities said on Saturday. Investigators have not concluded whether the three fires at Baptist churches in St. Landry Parish, about 100 miles (160 km) northwest of New Orleans, were connected, said Ashley Rodrigue, a spokeswoman for the Louisiana Fire Marshall's Office.They also have not determined whether the blazes, which occurred between March 26 and Thursday, were intentionally set, she said in an email. At a news conference on Thursday, State Fire Marshall Butch Browning was asked if investigators were treating the fires as potential hate crimes.""If the hate crime definition was violated, we will certainly vet those things out,"" Browning said.The number of hate crimes in the United States increased 17 percent in 2017, the third consecutive year such attacks rose, according to FBI data released last fall.Investigators probing the St. Landry Parish fires were awaiting lab results but view the three blazes as ""suspicious,"" Browning said at the news conference.Without giving details, he said certain ""patterns"" had been discovered, but that it was too early to say whether a single individual had started the fires.""There certainly is commonality and whether that leads to a person or persons or groups, we don't know,"" Browning said.The fires destroyed St. Mary Baptist Church in the community of Port Barre, and Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas, the parish seat.The FBI and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have joined in the investigation, Browning said.Investigators have concluded that a fourth fire last Sunday, more than 200 miles outside St. Landry Parish at a predominantly white church in Vivian in northwest Louisiana, was intentionally set, state fire officials said in a statement.That fire, inside the sanctuary at Vivian United Pentecostal Church, was relatively small and burned itself out. No one has been arrested in connection with any of the church fires, which have not resulted in any injuries, officials said.

""It is crucial to ensure the responsibility of our government and elected officials,"" Neal stated in a public assertion in regards to the letter. ""To maintain confidence in our democracy, the American people must be assured that their government functions properly, as the law intends.""
Kennedy was clearly not inclined.
""I can't believe he thinks the American public will fall for that,"" Kennedy stated. ""It must really suck to be so stupid. This is very simple: Mr. Neal wants to criticize the president. He doesn't think the president should be president. Well, you know, words can't express how much I don't care. It's not Mr. Neal's call. The American people have chosen Donald Trump as president. ""

His contributions to charities have additionally been investigated.
In a letter to the Ministry of Finance on Friday, Trump's lawyer, William Consovoy, argued that Neal's request served no ""legitimate purpose of the commission"".
""President Neal wants to return tax returns from the president and information because his party has recently taken control of the house,"" the letter stated. ""The president is their political opponent and they want to use the information to harm him politically.""

Former President Barack Obama offered some criticism for progressives at an Obama Foundation event in Berlin on Saturday.
Obama spoke to young leaders in the audience about civic engagement and said at one point, “One of the things I do worry about sometimes among progressives in the United States––maybe it’s true here as well––is a certain kind of rigidity, where we say, ‘Oh, I’m sorry. This is how it’s going to be.'”
He even said they end up forming a “circular firing squad” and going after allies because “one of them is straying from purity on the issues”:
“When that happens, typically the overall effort and movement weakens. So I think whether you are speaking as a citizen or as a political leader or as an organizer, whether you’re in the non-profit space or civic space, or you’re in the political arena, you have to recognize that the way we structure democracy requires you to take into account people who disagree with you.”

London, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Ashley Barnes went from zero to hero as Burnley boosted their bid for Premier League survival with a crucial 3-1 win against Bournemouth on Saturday.
Sean Dyche's side made the worst possible start at Dean Court when Barnes headed into his own net as he tried to clear under pressure from Bournemouth 's Nathan Ake in the fourth minute.
However, Burnley were gifted an equaliser in the 18th minute as Bournemouth keeper Asmir Begovic let Ashley Westwood's corner go straight through his hands and Chris Wood nodded in at the far post .
Inspired by the New Zealand forward's 11th goal this season, the Clarets struck again two minutes later, with Westwood firing home after Chris Mepham failed to clear Dwight McNeil's cross.
Burnley were well on top and Barnes struck at the right end in the 57th minute.
Once again Begovic was guilty of poor handling, allowing the ball to slip to Wood, who laid it back for Barnes to slot into the empty net.
Burnley are eight points clear of the relegation zone, and although third bottom Cardiff have a game in hand, Dyche's men have taken a major step towards staying up.
Leicester powered to a 4-1 rout of relegated Huddersfield as Brendan Rodgers' side moved into seventh.
Youri Tielemans put Leicester ahead at the John Smith's Stadium with his second goal since joining on loan from Monaco .
The Belgian midfielder netted with a deflected strike from the edge of the area after Huddersfield were unable to clear Jamie Vardy's miscued shot in the 24th minute.
Vardy doubled Leicester 's lead three minutes after half-time, collecting Ricardo Pereira 's cross and slotting home after rounding keeper Ben Hamer.
Huddersfield midfielder Aaron Mooy reduced the deficit with a 52nd minute penalty controversially awarded for Caglar Soyuncu's challenge on Karlan Grant.
James Maddison put the result beyond doubt with a fine free-kick in the 79th minute.
Bottom of the table Huddersfield, playing their first home match since relegation was confirmed, endured one last blow when Vardy stroked in an 84th minute penalty after the England striker was brought down by Terrence Kongolo .
Luka Milivojevic extended his superb penalty record as Crystal Palace won 1-0 at Newcastle to climb 11 points clear of the bottom three.
Newcastle defender Florian Lejeune was stretchered off with his left knee heavily strapped after a nasty second half collision with Andros Townsend that left him needing a hospital scan.

Paris, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Brazilian football legend Pele, who has been in hospital in Paris , will return to Brazil on Monday, his advisor told AFP on Saturday.
""We're going back to Sao Paulo on Monday,"" said the advisor, without providing any more details.

The hospital has not said when the 78-year-old will be discharged.

Dinard, France, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :EU foreign ministers on Saturday upped pressure on Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar to halt his offensive on Tripoli , urging the strongman to commit to a political solution.
Khalifa's dramatic bid to take Tripoli came as a meeting of Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers was being held in northern France with the club issuing a statement on Friday urging an immediate halt to "" all military activity and movements toward Tripoli "".
Several European ministers on Saturday warned Haftar not to countenance any further military action, saying that this could destroy a UN-backed peace process.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the Tripoli operations as ""untimely initiatives"" that could further destabilise Libya .
""There is a fundamental principle in Libya . There will be no military victory. The solution can only be a political solution,"" he added.
He said that France and Italy , the two European powers with the most influence in north Africa , were ""on the same wavelength"".
""It is important that all of the international community takes the same line,"" Le Drian added.
Experts say Haftar had had backing from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Saudi Arabia , as well as France , which is seen as his closest ally in Europe .
- 'Overcome past differences' - Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi said that the G7 statement, which was also echoed by the UN Security Council, showed that the international community was not prepared to tolerate military action.
""We think the military initiatives are not the best ones to grant peaceful developments in Libya and a constructive path forward for stabilising the country,"" he said.
Asked if sanctions could be imposed against Haftar were he to fail to comply with the demands of the international community, he replied: ""We have stated quite clearly what our position is and we very much hope that he (Haftar) will take it into consideration. If this will not happen, then we can see what can next be done."" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said there should be pressure on all the actors in Libya ""especially general Haftar"".
He said it was important to ""make sure that there is no further military escalation"".
The growing international pressure on Haftar came as fresh fighting flared Saturday south of Tripoli between the pro-government forces and Haftar's troops.
On Friday Haftar's forces were pushed back from a key checkpoint west of the capital, less than 24 hours after seizing it during the lightning offensive towards Tripoli .
Despite the flare-up, UN envoy Ghassan Salame insisted Saturday that talks planned to be held next week in Libya would go ahead.
Le Drian expressed particular frustration over the escalation given that Haftar and the head of the Tripoli-based government , Fayez al-Sarraj, had come to agreements earlier this year in talks in Abu Dhabi .
""They need now to overcome their past differences in the interest of the Libyan people. The Libyan people have had enough of this violence,"" the French minister said. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
Fantastic Fekitoa halts Toulouse's record run,www.urdupoint.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/miscellaneous/fantastic-fekitoa-halts-toulouses-record-run-587790.html,"Fantastic Fekitoa Halts Toulouse's Record Run Sumaira FH 6 minutes ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 11:20 PM
Paris, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Former New Zealand international Malakai Fekitoa scored twice as Toulon ended Toulouse 's record 14-match unbeaten run in the French Top 14 with a 25-10 victory on Saturday.
Fekitoa, 26, dotted down after JP Pietersen's early try as the home side controlled a match played in greasy conditions at Marseille 's Velodrome.
Toulouse failed to make the most of a one-man advantage for the final 25 minutes after the home side's prop Florian Fresia was sent off for punching Lucas Tauzin.
The league leaders' last loss was against champions Castres in September . Their recent good form has propelled them to the top of the table and into a European semi-final, where they will face Leinster on April 21.
Toulon's Trinh-Duc opened the scoring on four minutes with a penalty goal before Romain Ntamack replied with one of his own six minutes later.
The visitors made the most of their domination as South African Pietersen, playing at full back, crashed over for his third try of the season.
Toulouse struggled as a soap-bar ball at the Velodrome restricted their free-flowing off-load game.
The home side made the most of a Toulouse handling error on 32 minutes.
Ex-All Black Fekitoa picked up the loose possession in his own half and passed wide.
Fiji winger Josua Tuisova made a break before finding Fekitoa on his inside for a try that stretched the advantage to 15-3 after Trinh-Duc's second succesful conversion.
Toulon were down to 14 seconds before the break as Tuisova was sin-binned for a high tackle on centre Theo Belan.
The slow second half sparked into life after 15 minutes. A powerful tackle by Toulon 's Wales scrum-half Rhys Webb provoked a scuffle.
Webb's teammate Fresia went face-to-face with Toulouse 's Tauzin and punched the winger to earn a red card.
Despite being down a man , Toulon continued to dominate.
Fekitoa, who is leaving for Wasps after the season, went over for his second try with 17 minutes to go.
He ran a powerful line, collected a Webb pass from the base of a scrum and touched down. Before Saturday he had only scored one Top 14 try all season.
France fly-half Anthony Belleau added a three-pointer five minutes later put Toulon 25-3 ahead.
Toulouse denied Toulon a bonus point with a 77th minute Pierre Pages try .
The game ended with the 50,000 crowd performing Mexican waves in the drizzling rain.

Augusta, United States, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Striking blows for gender equality with every swing, women players competed for a trophy for the first time Saturday at former men-only enclave Augusta National Golf Club, home of the Masters.
At a club that opened in 1933 but didn't admit its first women members until 2012, LPGA legends Pak Se Ri, Annika Sorenstam, Lorena Ochoa and Nancy Lopez hit ceremonial shots off the first tee to launch the historic final round of the inaugural Augusta National Women 's Amateur.
""It's just exciting to be a part of history,"" Lopez said. ""A day of history for us, for the amateurs that are here and for Augusta National."" A field of 72 played the first 36 holes at nearby Champions Retreat before the event moved to the famed Masters layout, with the top 30 advancing to the last 18 holes at Augusta National.
""It's a dream come true. I'm so happy for them,"" Sorenstam said. ""This has huge potential to not just inspire young girls but golfers, other women in sports and women in business ."" American Anna Redding , a University of Virginia senior, was the first competitor to tee off, eight strokes adrift of US leader Jennifer Kupcho, a Wake Forest University senior.
World women 's amateur number one Kupcho teed off on 5-under par with a one-stroke lead over Mexico 's Maria Fassi, a University of Arkansas senior, and American Kaitlyn Papp.
""They know how special it is,"" Ochoa said. ""Hitting that first tee shot is probably going to be the highlight of their career."" Augusta National's all-male status led to a 2003 protest across the street from the club but it was not until August 2012 when businesswoman Darla Moore and former US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice were named the club's first women members.
Another move was 2014's debut of the Drive, Chip and Putt Championship, where young girls and boys won titles with a decisive putt on Augusta National's famed 18th green -- three Women 's Amateur players having taken part as youths.
Pak struck the first ceremonial tee shot followed in order by Ochoa, Lopez and Sorenstam, handling the duties in a similar fashion to how Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and the late Arnold Palmer have done at the Masters.
""First time in a long time I get nervous,"" Pak said. ""I have honor to lead .""""For them to kind of make us like Arnold, Jack and Gary , it's a real big honor to be here and hit that first shot,"" Lopez said.
Nicklaus tweeted his appreciation for women playing at Augusta , writing, ""Always considered Augusta National GC & @TheMasters the best at balancing respect for golf's history & tradition with innovative ways to grow our game. Inaugural @anwagolf is the latest great example."" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

The Hague, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :A campaign by the Dutch railway infrastructure operator to shock young people into responsible behaviour near rail tracks using ripped clothes to symbolise the mangled garb of victims hit by trains unleashed uproar on Saturday.
Operator ProRail said it used the controversial images to show the potential consequences of straying too close to railay lines.
But their ""Vict_m Fashion - created by accident "" strapline, accompanying ripped clothing was widely branded as shocking.
""I have expressed our surprise, displeasure and horror to the management of ProRail,"" the head of Dutch rail operator NS Marjan Rintel told ANP news agency, while drivers and politicians were also highly critical.
ProRail, which manages Dutch track infrastructure, launched the campaign Thursday, showing replicas of badly ripped garments -- some missing an entire shirt sleeve or trouser leg.
Other photos show shredded shoes and dresses. ProRail says the shocking images are necessary ""to wake young people up and give them a shake. "" The company said: ""Sadly, bad things still happen too often on and around railtracks because of lack of attention and recklessness,"" ProRail said.
It added it had ""deliberately"" set out to shock in a campaign aimed at 12- to 18-year-olds.
Deaths on and around Dutch railtracks have steadily risen in recent years from six in 2016 , to 12 in 2017 and 17 last year with minors among the fatalities.
ProRail said many accidents are down to people's attention being fixed on their smartphones.
While NS notably said it felt the nature of the campaign went too far, minister of infrastructure, Stientje van Veldhoven was slightly more measured in his criticism.
""Everyone favours less dangerous behaviour around railway tracks. And communication on this subject is important.
""But the campaign as it has been organised is unduly harsh for drivers (notably those who have witnessed accidents) and the relatives of those killed on the tracks,"" the minister said."

Dinard, France, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :France's foreign minister on Saturday urged Tokyo to ensure consular protection and the presumption of innocence in talks with his Japanese counterpart over the case of Carlos Ghosn, after the re-arrest of the former Nissan and Renault boss in Japan .
Jean-Yves Le Drian said he had talked about the Ghosn case with Taro Kono on the sidelines of the meeting of Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers in the French resort of Dinard.
Their talks came a day after a Japanese court ruled Ghosn must remain in custody until at least April 14 following his re-arrest in Tokyo .
""I of course spoke about the the Ghosn case with my colleague,"" Le Drian told reporters after the end of the G7 meeting.
""I told him two things: That France respects completely the sovereignty and independence of the Japanese judiciary. And I also reminded him of our attachment to the presumption of innocence and the full rights of consular protection."" Ghosn spent 108 days in detention in northern Tokyo before being dramatically released on bail of around $9 million on March 6.
But his re-arrest last week came as authorities look into new allegations that Ghosn transferred some $15 million in Nissan funds between late 2015 and mid-2018 to a dealership in Oman .
In an interview with French television recorded just before his latest arrest, the businessman, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese nationalities, called on the French government ""to defend me,"" and press the Japanese authorities respect the presumption of innocence.
Ghosn had long been lauded as the architect of the alliance between Renault and Nissan -- and later Mitsubishi -- before his shock arrest in Tokyo in November ."

Benghazi, Libya, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Forces loyal to Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar said Saturday they had been targeted by an air strike, as fresh fighting flared south of Tripoli .
""We strongly condemn the air raid... in the Al-Aziziya region"" by a plane, which had taken off from western Misrata, said the media office of Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA).
Forces in Misrata are mostly loyal to Libya 's internationally-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), which has been battling Haftar for control of the war-torn north African country.
Pro-government forces in the capital Tripoli confirmed they had targeted Haftar's men with ""intensive strikes"".
The air strikes came as fresh fighting flared Saturday south of Tripoli between the pro-government forces and Haftar's troops despite calls from the international community to halt the military offensive.
Haftar's forces are battling for control of an area some 30 kilometres (18 miles) south of the capital near Tripoli 's international airport , which was destroyed in 2014.
On Friday they were pushed back from a key checkpoint west of the capital, less than 24 hours after seizing it during a lightning offensive towards Tripoli .
Late Friday Haftar's men also briefly seized the airport , before being ousted.
Haftar on Thursday ordered his troops to advance on the capital.
""The time has come"" to take Tripoli , he said in an audio message, pledging to spare civilians and ""state institutions"".
Dozens of militia have proliferated in Libya since the NATO-backed 2011 overthrow of dictator Moamer Kadhafi and are variously aligned with either the unity government or the rival administration in the east backed by Haftar.
Tripoli residents have expressed concern that large-scale fighting could break out and began stocking up on food and petrol .
On Saturday large queues formed at petrol stations and supermarkets, an AFP journalist said.
""We must store everything we need for the family , just in case, especially those with young children,"" said Farida, a mother pushing a full shopping cart.
""You never know how long it will last,"" she added.
Despite the flare-up, UN envoy Ghassan Salame insisted Saturday that talks planned to be held next week in Libya would go ahead.
""We are determined"" to hold the talks ""as scheduled "" unless prevented by serious obstacles, Salame told a press conference.
""We want to reassure Libyans that we will stay alongside the Libyan people to make the political process a success without resorting to escalation.""Since the toppling of dictator Kadhafi, Libya has been divided between an array of armed groups.
And the internationally-recognised unity government , born out of UN-backed talks, has struggled to assert its control."

""Julian Assange believes that he is entitled to full compensation for his legal costs in accordance with the current legislation. Partly because the condition of 'exceptional reasons' is met, partly because errors and omissions by the prosecutor's office incurred additional costs,"" Samuelsson said in an interview with the SVT broadcaster.
Assange gained fame after a number of publications, exposing classified documents about US military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and about the conditions of Guantanamo camp prisoners. In 2010, WikiLeaks founder, who has been targeted by US officials for leaking the documents, came to Sweden , where he intended to get protection. However, he was soon accused of sex crimes in Sweden , but denied any involvement in it. A Swedish court declared him on the international wanted list, after which Assange was detained in London , but was soon released on bail. He has been living in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since 2012."

He challenged the PML-N leadership to have a debate on the performance of first eight months of their last government and that of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.

ISLAMABAD, Apr 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Kerry Logistics Network Limited of Singapore and Laotian Sitthi Logistics Saturday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for establishment of a joint venture to�develop a dry port in the Vientiane Logistics Park in Laos .
The signing ceremony was attended by Deputy Prime Minister of Laos , Sonexay Siphandone,�as the guest of honour. The move is part of Kerry Logistics' development strategy to seek accelerated growth in ASEAN by developing an integrated Greater Mekong Region platform covering Thailand , Cambodia , Myanmar and Laos , said a message received here.
The dry port would be developed over an area of around 35 hectares, to be developed in phases for the transfer of cargoes at Vientiane , which connects the railway lines between China and Thailand from Kunming to Bangkok .
The dry port is not only expected to help attract investment to Vientiane and its surrounding areas, but also turn the city into a major economic hub along the Belt and Road trade routes.
George Yeo, Chairman of Kerry Logistics, said, ""We at Kerry Logistics are proud to play a�role in the development of Laos and what will become an important economic corridor between China and Southeast Asia . We are fortunate to have in Sitthi Logistics a strong local partner. Together with Sitthi Logistics, we will work hard to make the dry port project a success and an asset to the Laotian economy."" Under the MoU, Kerry Logistics will provide management expertise, while Sitthi Logistics will provide local support. The facilities will allow the logistics industry to transport goods by road and rail and create an efficient logistics system to accommodate a range of industries and facilitate distribution along the economic corridor between China and Thailand .
To enable the Laotian economy to benefit from the Kunming-Bangkok rail and to fully utilise the plentiful resources and labour in Laos , the Lao government is introducing economic incentives and conducive regulations for the building of an efficient logistics centre in Vientiane .
In 2018 , Kerry Logistics completed the first phase of the inland port in Mandalay and the inland port in Yangon.�With stronger growth anticipated to persist in Asia , particularly in Southeast Asia and India , Kerry Logistics will continue to leverage its established network in Asia to take advantage of the booming intra-Asia trade and maintain its business growth in Asia .

NAB, he said, was taking action against Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) leader Hamza Shehbaz for his corrupt practices on its own. Had the government behind it, the opposition leader would have been arrested in a few minutes, he said talking to a private news channel.
He said Hamza should tell the nation that who were Manzoor Ahmad and Mahboob Ali and why they had remitted hundreds of thousands Dollars to him. NAB had all the documentary evidence in that regard. Complete money trail was present as the amounts were transferred through swift messages (among banks), depicting the relation of the sender with the receiver.
Shahzad Akbar alleged that the PML-N leadership were expert at using the institutions for their own petty objectives, citing the Model Town incident, in which some 16 persons, including women , were killed by the police in 2014.
He said NAB had the authority to arrest anyone, including Hamza, if it had proofs of their involvement in corruption or money laundering.
The SAPM said NAB had also issued notices to Shehbaz Sharif and his other son Salman Shehbaz, but they did not join their investigation. Similarly, Hamza had also not heeded to the notices issued to him for questioning about having assets beyond sources of income.
He said Salman Shebaz had fled abroad when the first notice was issued to him. Were the corruption charges against him baseless he should have come back to country to prove his innocence, he added.
Shahzad said Hamza had set a bad example by not tendering arrest and instead getting temporary bail from the court . He had already been handed over a questionnaire, which he had not responded as yet.
He said whenever NAB took action against the corrupt, they started making hue and cry, besides blaming the government .
To a question, he said the government had establish an asset recovery unit, which was not a mentally torture cell. The unit collected proofs of corruption and pursue the cases against the corrupt in foreign countries who had stashed looted money there, he remarked.
He said he had nothing do with NAB and he was ready for forensic audit of the cell headed by him. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) The foreign ministers of Group of Seven (G7) member countries expressed concern on Saturday over the presence of Russian military personnel in Venezuela .
The two-day meeting of G7 foreign ministers started on Friday in France 's seaside resort of Dinard. This meeting comes as preparation for the 45th G7 summit that will be held in Biarritz in late August .
""We call for urgent humanitarian access to the country to be provided in accordance with international humanitarian principles to help address the basic needs of crisis-affected people. We are alarmed by the deployment of Russian military forces which threatens to exacerbate the already dangerous situation,"" the minister said in a joint communique.
The political crisis in Venezuela recently entered its third month. The turmoil began in January , when US-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido proclaimed himself Venezuela 's interim president. Maduro, supported by China and Russia , among others, accused Guaido of plotting to overthrow him with backing from Washington .
In March , a group of Russian military personnel arrived in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas to take part in talks on defense cooperation with officials. During the consultations, Russia repeatedly stressed that their presence was fully legitimate and in accordance with the defense agreement between Moscow and Caracas . Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov later said that these servicemen were simply carrying out maintenance of earlier supplied military equipment."

Let me explain: if you want to travel to the next millennium, it is sufficient to build a fast starship, travel fast enough back and forth, and in a few days (of yours) you can definitely be back here on Earth a millennium in the future. The science of this is completely uncontroversial and clear. The only problem is finding the money for such a starship. If instead you want to travel to a millennium ago, things are more complicated. The reason is that you have to beat the entropic arrow of time. This is not impossible, because the arrow of time is statistical, therefore it is just a matter of probability and improbability.

SHARJAH, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 06th Apr, 2019) In the presence of Sheikha Bodour bint Sultan Al Qasimi, Vice President of the International Publishers Association,IPA, and Founder and Chairperson of Kalimat Foundation for Children's Empowerment,KF, has distributed 2,000 books to 11 libraries across Italy . The books belong to a mix of genres including literature, culture, and sciences and are targeted mainly at Arab immigrant and Arab refugee children and young adults seeking asylum in Italy .
Sheikha Bodour Al Qasimi, Founder and Chairperson of KF, visited the Kahoula Library in Bologna where she met with representatives from different entities including the Ministry of Education , Italian board on Books for Young People, Bologna Municipality, and Bologna Children's Book Fair.
The visit was attended by Abdullah Hassan Al Shamsi, Consul-General of the United Arab Emirates in Milan; Rana Al Dhaheri, Second Secretary of the UAE Embassy in Rome; Carlo Gallucci, Publisher; and Mohammed Matroushi, a library donor.
KF’s first book distribution initiative of 1,100 books was held in cooperation with the Italian Board on Books for Young People, comprising 90 Arabic and 10 Italian–Arabic titles. These books have been published by the Gallucci-Kalimat publishing house, which was formed after Gallucci Publishing and Kalimat Group signed a partnership to establish this joint publishing house at the Rome Book Fair 2018 .
Kalimat Foundation distributed 900 more books during its participation at the Bologna Book Fair 2019 , raising the total tally of donated books to 2,000. The move aims to support Arab immigrants, refugee children and young adults to instil a reading habit in their native tongue , learn more about their culture and heritage, and offer them a stronger sense of identity and belonging in an environment that may make them feel distant or uprooted.
Highlighting Kalimat Foundation’s successful efforts in bringing children and books together irrespective of their circumstances in yet another country, Amna Al Mazmi, Kalimat Foundation’s Manager, noted that the distributed books in Italy were carefully selected to promote both the readership’s literary knowledge and their academic expertise.
""Kalimat Foundation decided to distribute those books in Italy because it hosts a large number of young Arab refugees , who do not have access to Arabic language books. The initiative aligns with the foundation’s firm belief in children’s right to education and learning through books,"" she added.
According to a study by the Ministry of Education in Italy , one out of every six students of foreign decent come from an Arab background, which makes them the majority of the non-Italian students in Italy 's schools.
Since its inception in April 2016 , Kalimat Foundation has been engaged in an extensive programme of launching and implementing initiatives that facilitate the provision of public libraries and refugee camps with books. It seeks to give children in disadvantaged areas access to sources of knowledge, in keeping with its dedication to ensuring every child’s right to read. KF believes in the positive impact of books on creating a future knowledge-based Arab generation that has a broad understanding of its own and of global cultures.

ISLAMABAD, Apr 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain�on Saturday expressed the commitment that the accountability process would reach its logical conclusion, laying the foundation of a prosperous Pakistan .
Addressing a press conference here, he said the recovery of national wealth plundered by the corrupt elements, including the Sharif brothers and Asif Zardari , was imperative to improve the country's economy.
The Sharif family wanted that the law should follow their whims and they should not be held accountable for the national wealth they had plundered, he said.
He said Pakistan 's total foreign debt from 1947 to 2007 was only $37 billion , which was judiciously utilized to execute many mega projects, including the development of Islamabad as the capital, construction of Mangla and Tarbela dams, Navy bases and Gwadar Deep Seaport, but from the year 2008 to 2018 it touched the whooping $ 97 billion mark.
The question, he said, arose as to where the whooping amount of $60 billion . The big chunk of that amount was misappropriated by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and former president Asif Ali Zardari , who remained in government during the period (2008-2018), he added.
The people would have to endure price hike and economic crunch till the recovery of the looted money from the two former rulers, the minister said.
Referring to the massacre of innocent workers of Pakistan Awami Tehreek ( PAT ) in Model Town Lahore in 2014, he said the behaviour of the then Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) government was totally different as compared to the today's regime.
� �Now in the same Model Town, PML-N leader Hamza Shahbaz had confined himself in the basement of his house to avoid arrest and that too by making women and children as a shield, he added.
Fawad said it was time now to have discrimination between an act of crime and politics . The nation should not suffer anymore. The opposition leaders were out to conceal the public money misappropriated by them.
Hamza Shehbaz, he said, was being arrested in light of statements of two witnesses. Evidence of wrongdoings by Shehbaz Sharif and his family was available.
Hamza should better cooperate with the National Accountability Court ( NAB ) and surrender himself before law, which otherwise would take its own course, he added.
He said when the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) came to power last year, the country was on the verge of bankruptcy due to the loot and plunder of Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari . Now Pakistan was moving towards economic stability owing to positive measures taken by the incumbent government , he added.
The PTI government , he said, had taken bold decisions for economic stability.
To a question, the minister said the opposition posed no threat to the government .
Fawad said the PTI government had eased visa restrictions for promoting tourism in the country. The contours of amnesty scheme for declaring assets abroad were being finalized, he added.
He said so far two thirds economy of the country was undocumented. The next budget would be industry-friendly as the export sector had already been provided subsidy of Rs 45 billion , he added.
The minister said a crackdown had been launched against the people hoarding Dollars , which had brought the value of rupee down.
He criticized PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb for issuing baseless statements.
Responding to a question, Fawad said the government had nothing to do with NAB activities.
He said it was Prime Minister Imran Khan who had raised voice against former MQM chief Altaf Hussainn for his terrorist activities during his prime time. Today's Mutahidda Qaumi Movement ( MQM ) had changed and was totally different from its past, he added. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

The situation in Libya escalated on Thursday as Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, commander of forces loyal to East Libya-based government , ordered an offensive to retake Tripoli from the forces of the UN-backed GNA. The LNA has already recaptured a number of settlements on its way to the capital, while leader of Libya 's UN-backed government Sarraj has ordered its troops to use force if necessary.
The escalation caught UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on his trip to Libya as part of the UN-led efforts to boost the political settlement of the Libyan conflict. On Friday, Guterres met with Haftar and then left Libya .
LNA spokesman Ahmed Al-Mismari said on Friday that Haftar's army was carrying out an offensive on Tripoli in several directions at once but has not yet entered the capital. He stated that he could not yet name the date of the end of the operation, but confirmed that the offensive would continue until all objectives were achieved."

Game Jam Winner Spotlight: Permanence,www.techdirt.com,Leigh Beadon,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190406/11241741945/game-jam-winner-spotlight-permanence.shtml,"from the like-it's-1923 dept Sat, Apr 6th 2019 12:00pm — Leigh Beadon
Well, here we are at our final spotlight post for winners from our public domain game jam, Gaming Like It's 1923 . It's the winner of the Best Analog Game category: Permanence by Jackson Tegu .
Permanence is probably the most intriguing and unusual of all the submissions we received, and it piqued the curiosity and imagination of many of our judges. It's also just about as analog as a game can be: it takes the form of a book. Indeed, the instructions advise (somewhat apologetically) that you professionally print and bind the included PDF to create a real book to hold in your hands — but in a pinch, a basic print-out will suffice.
But this isn't a book of instructions... not quite. Nor is it a book to simply read... not quite. Rather, the book is the instructions, the game, and the story all at once. It is designed to be played by seven people, but not all at once — each player will, on their own time, take their journey through the book. And they won't leave the book the same as they found it: each player is instructed (poetically) to ""free their traveler from the page"" with scissors, and then to leave behind their traveller's ""attachments"" as small bookmarks between the pages. All this throughout the course of a meditative roleplaying journey based on two 1923 works that have entered the public domain: the painting Metempsychosis by Yokoyama Taikan, and poems from the book The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran.
If you're still feeling a bit unclear on what exactly Permanence is, don't be discouraged — it is a game to be discovered via play, not mastered beforehand. Its unique and creative approach made it a shoe-in for Best Analog Game, and the only way to understand it is to print it out and give it a try. You can download it now from its page on Itch !
And with that, we wrap up the series of winner spotlights for our public domain game jam. Once again, a huge thanks to everyone who participated, and who played the games that were submitted — we never expected such a great response, and we're thrilled with how it went. You can still check out the full list of winners and the collection of other entries at any time, and if all goes according to plan with the finally-expanding public domain, we'll be back with another edition next year!"
