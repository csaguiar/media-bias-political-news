"Canada Releases 'Gay Coin' to Celebrate LGBTQ2 Anniversary, Christians Call It 'An Affront to Our God'",www1.cbn.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/canada-releases-gay-coin-to-celebrate-lgbtq2-anniversary-christians-call-it-an-affront-to-our-god,"Canada Releases 'Gay Coin' to Celebrate LGBTQ2 Anniversary, Christians Call It 'An Affront to Our God' 04-26-2019 Christian Ellis 'Gay Coin' (Photo: Royal Canadian Mint Commemorative Coin)
The Royal Canadian Mint has released a commemorative one-dollar coin (known as a ""loonie"") to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the partial decriminalization of the LGBTQ community.
Conservative Christians have called the new coin a highly offensive attack against God.
In 1969, Canada's Parliament passed legislation to partially stop the criminalization of homosexual activity, protecting private activity between two individuals 21 and older. New $1 #Equality coin marking 50 years since Canada took the first step towards decriminalizing homosexuality is unveiled by @Bill_Morneau @MarLemay1 @R_Boissonnault #RightToLove https://t.co/5zW3sSuVAp
— Royal Canadian Mint (@CanadianMint) April 23, 2019
""Marking 50 years since a landmark decision that began a process of legal reforms to recognize the rights of LGBTQ2 Canadians is a powerful way to recognize Canada's profound belief in equality and inclusion,"" said Marie Lemay, president and CEO of the Royal Canadian Mint.
The addition of ""2"" to LGBTQ is for ""two spirit"", an indigenous concept that believes a person has both a masculine and feminine spirit.
""It is an opportunity to reflect on a landmark event in our country's history, and a reminder of the progress still to be made as we work toward inclusion and equality for all LGBTQ2 Canadians,"" stated Randy Boissonnault, a special adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Though the country has been progressive in LGBTQ rights, some gay activists say the country hasn't gone far enough.
On the other hand, conservative Christians are opposing the new coin and what it represents for their country. NBC News reports the Christian organization Citizen Go started a petition opposing the release of the new loonie, garnering over 57,000 signatures.
The petition states, ""This is highly offensive to many Canadians, particularly those who are Christian. This is nothing less than an attack on our faith and an affront to our God.""
""When we first heard about it, we were outraged,"" said David Cooke, executive director of Citizen Go's Canadian branch. ""This is a moral issue, this is a sin issue in terms of homosexual practices.""
""I can't have it in my possession,"" he added. ""This is promoting something that goes against my beliefs.""
""Grown adults have a right to do whatever they like in the privacy of their own bedroom, but there is no business for the government putting this on money,"" he continued."
'I Think There's...Fear': Abby Johnson Responds to Washington Post Editorial's Misrepresentation of Abortion Numbers,www1.cbn.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/i-think-theres-fear-abby-johnson-responds-to-washington-post-editorials-misrepresentation-of-abortion-numbers,"'I Think There's...Fear': Abby Johnson Responds to Washington Post Editorial's Misrepresentation of Abortion Numbers
A Washington Post editorial on abortion recently reported that most Americans identify as pro-choice and claims that ""public support for abortion rights is at its highest since ...Roe v. Wade.'""
The editorial, released April 23, cited a poll that showed that 67 percent of voters say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases.
But Abby Johnson, the former Planned Parenthood abortion clinic director whose life story is the subject of the hit movie, ""Unplanned,"" pushed back against those claims.
""It's interesting,"" Johnson said in an interview with CBN News. ""I think there's a little bit of fear, actually, within the pro-choice community. I mean, there was a recent Marist poll that came out a couple months ago that showed that in one month, in that one-month time period, there was a 14 percent jump in Democrats who were pro-life. So, before the whole late-term abortion debate in New York had taken place, 20 percent of Democrats identified as pro-life. One month later, a poll showed that 34 percent of Democrats identified as pro-life.""
She continued, ""I think that's scary. They're losing their constituency. They are losing their supporters. People are researching on their own. They're looking at what abortion really is, and I think that they are losing ground. They're losing momentum. And particularly among young people, particularly among Millennials. There have been studies shown that when Millennials are presented with the truth of abortion, they're more likely to change their minds and become pro-life. And that has got to be scary for the pro-choice movement right now.""
Johnson also shared her reaction to the box-office success of the ""Unplanned,"" which has made more than $17 million despite having a budget of only $6 million and major obstacles from Hollywood.
""The critics thought we would make like $40,"" Johnson commented. ""We're excited and we're working to get the film out on DVD as quickly as possible. We're probably looking at about three months for that to happen. But they're trying to expedite that as quickly as possible because we know that churches and different youth groups and different organizations are really wanting to be able to show the film and so DVD would be a great way to do that.""
She believes the time is right for such a film.
""I think it's about timing right now,"" she said. ""We've seen a lot of pro-life movies sort of come and go. And people have said what's the difference with ""Unplanned?"" And I really think it's about timing. We look at what's happening in just these crazy laws that are being passed all across the country. Late term abortions, infanticide laws, and I think people are just ready. I think they were ready to see the truth. I think people were seeking truth on the issue of abortion. And I hope this film will be a really powerful tool that people can use moving forward to show the truth of abortion and show also the powerful, redemptive nature of Christ.""
And it's not just the general public whose minds are being changed by ""Unplanned.""
""We just want people to understand that this is a very powerful tool. It's not about me,"" she said. ""I hope this brings about more testimonies from women and certainly we're seeing abortion clinic workers leaving their jobs at a rate we have never seen before. And so we're very encouraged by that as well,"" said Johnson."

The United Nations has called the exodus of refugees from Venezuela ""unparalleled"" in the modern history of South America. More than a million of the country's four million refugees have fled to the neighboring nation of Colombia, but that's where tens of thousands of them had a life-changing encounter with Jesus Christ over Easter weekend. A broken economy magnified by a political crisis and power outages is forcing millions of Venezuelans to flee their country. CBN News contributor Chuck Holton has visited the area and described the desperate situation for those crossing into the border town of Cucuta, Colombia. ""These guys are bringing products either into Colombia to sell or back into Venezuela, things that aren't available there, things like tires, medicines. Coming across from Venezuela we're seeing a lot of scrap metal that they sell over on the Colombian side, we see things like copper wire because people are ripping the wire out of the walls and wrapping them up and bringing them over here to sell just to get enough money to eat,"" Holton said.
Cucuta is on one of the main escape routes for desperate Venezuelans. Prostitution by Venezuelan girls is rampant. Leonel Castillo and his wife work with their church to help them. ""The wealthiest Venezuelans have already escaped to Spain or Miami, the middle class is going to Ecuador or Chile. But the poorest are coming to Cucuta,"" Castillo said. Venezuelans have been suffering under one of the worst humanitarian disasters in modern times, but this week tens of thousands of refugees received the ultimate gift of hope. It was called the ""Festival of Hope,"" and Franklin Graham's team chose the strategic location to share the gospel to Colombians and Venezuelan refugees as well.
""Tonight if you're here and you don't know Jesus Christ as your savior,"" Franklin Graham preached, ""tonight you can be sure.""
Graham told CBN News, ""The physical needs, I think, of the people. God sometimes uses that to open up the hearts spiritually."" Christian ministries like Graham's Samaritan's Purse and CBN's Operation Blessing have sent teams to provide food, hygiene kits and medical care to the refugees. As the humanitarian crisis worsens – the US and other nations are increasing pressure on the Maduro government and his allies: Russia and Cuba. Graham considers the Cuban officials and military personnel who are propping up leader Nicholas Maduro a big obstacle to change. ""The Cubans have taken control of the country. They've taken control of the government. They've taken control of the military. It's almost as if Cuba has annexed the country,"" Graham told CBN News. As the Venezuela crisis deepens, the US and other nations aren't ruling out military force. Graham says he hopes and prays for a solution that does not involve military force and more suffering for the Venezuelan people."
Kansas Supreme Court Strikes Down Ban on 'Gruesome' Dismemberment Abortions,www1.cbn.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/kansas-supreme-court-strikes-down-ban-on-gruesome-dismemberment-abortions,"Kansas Supreme Court Strikes Down Ban on 'Gruesome' Dismemberment Abortions 04-26-2019
The Kansas Supreme Court ruled Friday blocking a 2015 ban on dismemberment abortions.
The decision prevents the state from enforcing a previously passed law that greatly limited second-trimester abortions.
The Unborn Child Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act (SB 95) was the first in the nation to ban the procedure known as ""dilation and evacuation abortions.""
""Dismemberment abortion kills a living unborn baby by tearing her apart limb from limb,"" said Ingrid Duran, the National Right to Life director of state legislation. ""It is unconscionable that the Kansas Supreme Court would allow living unborn babies to be killed in such a gruesome manner.""
Now the state's highest court has ruled the state's constitution protects abortion rights.
Pro-life advocates are now calling for an effort to amend the state constitution to add an abortion ban that could withstand a court ruling.
National Right to Life says all the evidence is clear that unborn babies, so far along in their development, should be treated as human life.
""Before the first trimester ends, the unborn child has a beating heart, brain waves, and every organ system in place,"" Duran added. ""Dismemberment abortions occur after the baby has reached these milestones."" "
Broken Immigration System: How Did a Convicted Palestinian Terrorist Become a US Citizen?,www1.cbn.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/national-security/2019/april/broken-immigration-system-how-did-a-convicted-palestinian-terrorist-become-a-us-citizen,"Broken Immigration System: How Did a Convicted Palestinian Terrorist Become a US Citizen? 04-26-2019 Emily Jones Green Card AS
A Palestinian terrorist who was convicted for attempting to blow up a bus somehow managed to become a United States citizen.
CNN reports that Vallmoe Shqaire and an accomplice conspired to bomb an Israeli bus in 1988. The Jordanian-born Palestinian was serving under orders from the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Court documents show they successfully detonated a bomb near the bus, but it caused no injuries.
Shqaire was later arrested by Israeli security forces and sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1991.
He never served the full sentence and was released after four years following agreements during the Oslo Peace Accords.
Shqaire left the Middle East and was granted a visitor's visa into the US in 1999. He later went on to marry a US citizen, which allowed him to get a green card. They divorced in 2002, but Shqaire quickly remarried and he was given permanent residency.
He was granted full US citizenship in 2008 without ever disclosing his terror ties.
Shqaire tipped off US investigators after they discovered he was sending repeated money transfers to the Palestinian city of Ramallah in the West Bank.
His money transfers were considered a ""subject of interest"" to the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Los Angeles in 2011.
Shqaire was never charged for the money transfers but was convicted of grand theft in 2011 in connection to a credit card fraud scheme.
He was charged in September with illegally obtaining his American citizenship by intentionally withholding his criminal record from US authorities.
""By concealing his violent, terrorist conduct, defendant circumvented the procedures our immigration system depends upon,"" prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memorandum, CNN reports.
In January, Shqaire entered into a plea deal subjecting him to the possibility of prison time and agreeing to the loss of his citizenship and deportation.
Shqaire is currently free on bond and is living in the Los Angeles area. He awaits his sentencing which is scheduled for Friday.
According to US law, someone with Shqaire's terror connections would not be granted entry into the US, let alone citizenship. His case reveals just how fragile the US immigration system can be.
""Somebody dropped the ball,"" Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University told CNN.
Shqaire is at least the second convicted terrorist to become a US citizen after the 9/11 terror attacks.
In 2017, Rasmeah Odeh was also convicted of illegally obtaining US citizenship, after lying about her involvement in two terror attacks against Jews in Israel. One of those bombings killed two people."
"Nicole Kidman Says Her Friends ‘Tease’ Her for Believing in God, Raising Her Kids in Church",www1.cbn.com,,04-25-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/nicole-kidman-says-her-friends-lsquo-tease-rsquo-her-for-believing-in-god-raising-her-kids-in-church,"Nicole Kidman Says Her Friends ‘Tease’ Her for Believing in God, Raising Her Kids in Church 04-25-2019 Tré Goins-Phillips, Faithwire Nicole Kidman (AP Photo)
Actor Nicole Kidman admitted during a recent interview with Vanity Fair that her friends often “tease” her for believing in God and choosing to raise her children in church .
The Oscar-winning celebrity, married to country singer Keith Urban, told the magazine faith has played a pivotal role in her life, but said she has “a lot” of friends who poke fun at her religious convictions. She revealed she and Urban often take their kids — 10-year-old Sunday Rose and 8-year-old Faith Margaret — to church.
From Shame to Surrender: ‘Jesus Culture’ Lead Singer Shares Her Journey
“That’s how we are raising our children,” Kidman said. “Keith has his own beliefs, but he comes, too. I had a very Catholic grandmother, and I was raised praying, so that had a massive impact.”
Previously married to well-known Scientologist Tom Cruise, Kidman, who has two children with the “Mission Impossible” star, both of whom are believers in Scientology, said she doesn’t shy away from her younger children asking questions about God.
Though she encourages them to have faith, she said she doesn’t endorse “absolutism.”
“I wouldn’t say it’s absolutism; there’s constant questioning,” Kidman explained. “I’m a willful, feisty girl. For me, it’s very important that I don’t have judgment. My dad would always say, ‘Tolerance is the most important thing.’”
Interview: ‘This Is Us’ Star Chrissy Metz Opens Up About Personal Reason She Believes in Miracles
It’s not clear how deep Kidman’s faith runs. In 2018, she told Allure she’s “spiritual in the sense that I absolutely believe in God.”
The 51-year-old actor ventured into issues of faith last year, when she played the pastor’s wife in the controversial film “Boy Erased,” which chronicles the experience of a son confronting his Christian parents about his sexual orientation. Years earlier, they sent him to a traumatizing conversion-therapy-type program.
While the movie certainly deals with issues of faith, it never offers a robust Christian perspective on sexual ethics. A review from Movieguide found the film correctly addresses some bad theology, but ultimately “endorses immoral behavior.”
Kidman, speaking of her role in “Boy Erased,” said, “The mother is struggling herself, and there’s a truth to it. She changes. She’s the one that changes, and I love that. I think that’s really beautiful.”"
Real-Life Miracle: Mom 'Prays Son Back to Life' After Drowning Death | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,"Billy Hallowell, Pureflix.com",04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/real-life-miracle-mom-prays-son-back-to-life-after-drowning-death,"Hollywood film producer DeVon Franklin recently spoke out about his new hit film, “Breakthrough,” revealing that the movie, which stars actors Chrissy Metz and Topher Grace, is based on the true story of a teenager who died and then came back to life after his mother uttered an impassioned prayer to God.
“‘Breakthrough’ is a true miracle story of a mother who prays her son back to life,” Franklin said on a recent episode of PureFlix.com’s “Pure Talk.” “He died, John Smith, when he was 14 years old. He fell through a frozen lake.”

Smith was submerged for 15 minutes on January 19, 2015, when he fell through the ice while standing on Lake Sainte Louise in Missouri. Doctors proceeded to work on Smith after his harrowing rescue, but Franklin said they tragically concluded they had done all they could and believed the boy wouldn’t survive.
That’s when the boy’s mom, Joyce (portrayed by Metz in the film), went into the hospital room — and something incredible happened.

Watch Franklin discuss the amazing miracle behind “Breakthrough” — and the ways in which he approaches faith films:
“She goes into the emergency room. There’s her son … laying dead on the table,” Franklin said. “Instead of saying goodbye, she speaks life. She goes over to his feet, puts her hands on his feet and says, ‘Holy Spirit, bring back my son.’ Next thing you know, John Smith came back to life.”
Doctors were still convinced that Smith wouldn’t recover, considering how long he had gone without oxygen. But, to their shock, he not only recovered, but today it’s as if he never went through the deadly ordeal.
Franklin, who previously produced “Miracles From Heaven” and “Heaven Is for Real,” said he was attracted to the “improbability and impossibility” of the entire ordeal.

The filmmaker believes that the film sheds light on the importance of prayer, and that the story has expanded and deepened his own Christian faith.
“If she did not go in there and pray he would be dead right now,” Franklin said. “That is what brought me to it … she didn’t allow death to stand in the way of speaking life.”
Franklin said that the physicians who treated Smith remained dumbfounded by the teen’s miraculous recovery.
“Both doctors who treated John said they had no hope that he would recover,” he said. “They are like, ‘It’s nothing but God.’”

Bethany Christian Services Agrees to Place Kids in LGBT Homes After Michigan Settlement,www1.cbn.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/bethany-christian-services-agrees-to-place-kids-in-lgbt-homes-after-michigan-settlement,"Bethany Christian Services Agrees to Place Kids in LGBT Homes After Michigan Settlement 04-26-2019
There's been a major development involving an international faith-based foster care and adoption agency. Michigan-based Bethany Christian Services announced this week it will place children in LGBT homes.
Bethany changed course after a recent legal settlement.
The international agency is responsible for around eight percent of Michigan's more than 13,000 foster care and adoption cases centered around kids from troubled homes.
The nonprofit organization issued a statement, saying, ""We are disappointed with how this settlement agreement has been implemented by the state government. Nonetheless, Bethany will continue operations in Michigan, in compliance with our legal contract requirements.""
Michigan's Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel announced the settlement last month after homosexual couples sued in 2017.
The settlement bans faith-based agencies like Bethany from refusing to place kids in LGBT homes for religious reasons if the agencies have accepted the children for referral from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.
The Associated Press reports that of the faith-based agencies in Michigan, who are known not to serve LGBT couples or individuals, Bethany does more work for the state than any other. Bethany handled more than 1,150 cases as of February.
AP reports Catholic Charities had a caseload of more than 400, and St. Vincent Catholic Charities had 80 cases. Michigan State Human Services Department Spokesperson Bob Wheaton said the department was glad it will ""be able to continue its long-standing partnership with Bethany in providing services to children and families.""
Attorney General Nessel tweeted last weekend, ""Having more adoption agencies which don't discriminate equals more children adopted into loving, nurturing ""forever"" homes. Thank you to Bethany Christian Services!"" Having more adoption agencies which don’t discriminate =‘s more children adopted into loving, nurturing “forever” homes. Thank you to Bethany Christian Services! https://t.co/H55Gs1ZktW
— Dana Nessel (@dananessel) April 20, 2019
The AP reports that Nessel is a lesbian and as a private attorney battled to overturn Michigan's ban on same-sex marriage.
Christianity Today reports that Bethany, which has been in existence for 75 years, made it clear its mission and Christian beliefs have not changed. The change will not have an impact on infant adoptions, international adoptions or foster placements in the 34 other states where Bethany serves.
At least two agencies are still fighting the Michigan settlement in court. Catholic Charities West Michigan filed a lawsuit against Michigan's new rule.
Also, St. Vincent Catholic Charities filed a lawsuit in federal court, claiming the settlement violates the US Constitution and federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act."

Lindell, who is the CEO and inventor of MyPillow, helped finance “Unplanned,” a film about abortion clinic director-turned pro-life advocate Abby Johnson’s life that has been sparking headlines and is currently in theaters nationwide .

He poured $1 million into the production, telling PureFlix.com’s “Pure Talk” that he got involved after producers reached out and revealed their plans. Lindell was so moved by Johnson’s real-life story that he prayed over it and instantly decided to fund the movie and film a cameo.
“I said, ‘Are you short any money?’ And they said, ‘Yeah, we’re short about a $1 million and ... I just felt right there through the holy spirit — ‘Send this money,’” Lindell explained.
He also shared details of his personal faith journey, revealing that he was a drug addict for nearly three decades before finally stopping in 2009.
“I was a crack cocaine addict,” Lindell said. “I was a very functioning cocaine addict.”
Watch Lindell share his amazing journey:
He was so bad, in fact, that his drug dealers staged an intervention in 2008 and refused to sell to him. They cut him off, and a year later he was done using.
“I got freed of all of my addictions January 16, 2009, but at that point I didn’t do a full surrender to Jesus,” he said. “I didn’t give a full surrender until February 18, 2017, so there’s quite a story in between where God was still chasing me.”

Now, Lindell travels the country and speaks about his Christian faith and the values that stem from it. He views MyPillow as a platform through which he’s able to have a positive influence — and “Unplanned” is just his latest effort to achieve that goal.
“I really believe you’re not just saving the unborn and the babies, but the peoples’ hearts are changing and healing,” he said of the impact of “Unplanned.” “It was God. Everybody who was involved in that movie, God put them there.”

"US Economy Grew at Strong 3.2% Rate in First Quarter, Exceeding Expectations",www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/us-economy-grew-at-strong-3-2-rate-in-first-quarter-exceeding-expectations,"WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. economy grew at a solid 3.2% annual rate in the first three months of the year, a far better outcome than expected, overcoming a host of headwinds including global weakness, rising trade tensions and a partial government shutdown.
The advance in the gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic health, marks an acceleration from a 2.2% gain in the previous October-December period, the Commerce Department reported Friday. However, about half the gain reflected two factors not expected to last - a big jump stockpiling by businesses and a sharp contraction in the trade deficit.
Still, the GDP gain surpassed the 3% bar set by President Donald Trump as evidence his economic program is working. Trump is counting on a strong economy as he campaigns for re-election.
It was the strongest first quarter growth rate since 2015. In recent years, GDP has been exceptionally weak in the first quarter. There had been fears growth could dip below 1% this year due to a variety of adverse factors such as the December stock market nosedive, rising weakness in key economies overseas, the U.S. trade war with China and a 35-day partial government shutdown that ended in January.
But the economy shrugged off those concerns, helped by an announcement in early January from the Federal Reserve that after raising rates four times last year, it was declaring a pause on further rate hikes. That spurred a stock market rebound by easing concerns that the central bank might overdo its credit tightening and send the country into a recession.
Still, economists believe the current April-June quarter will not match the first quarter's performance. Many are looking for GDP growth to slow to around 2% in the current quarter.
In the first quarter, inventory rebuilding added 0.7 percentage point to growth, while a falling trade deficit boosted growth by a full percentage point. Analysts think both of those factors will reverse in the current quarter.
Consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of economic activity, slowed to growth at a rate of just 1.2% in the first quarter. In particular, spending on durable goods fell at a rate of 5.3%, the biggest decline in a decade, led by a sharp drop in light truck sales.
Government spending was up 2.4% as a big 3.9% gain in state and local spending, reflecting increases in highway construction, offset a flat performance for the federal government. The government estimated that the 35-day partial federal shutdown trimmed 0.3 percentage point from growth in the first quarter after trimming fourth quarter growth by 0.1 percentage point.
For the year, economists believe GDP will expand 2.4%, down from last year's 2.9% gain, as the boost from the 2017 tax cuts and increased government spending over the past two years start to fade.
The consensus view of private forecasters is well below expectations of the Trump administration which contends that its economic policies have broken a decade-long period when GDP gains averaged 2.2% annually. The administration is predicting growth will top 3% in coming years.
There are factors that could help lift growth in coming quarters. The global economy appears on better footing, given improvements in such major economies as China, and a trade war between the world's two largest economies that appears closer to being resolved than it did at the start of the year.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said he expects growth for this year to be around 2.2%, close to the average for the past 10 years.
""We got a temporary boost to growth last year because of the tax cuts but that money has been spent so we are back to the kind of growth we have had,"" Zandi said. ""I think we are back to the 2% world we have been in since the recession ended.""
The current recovery from the Great Recession of 2007-2009 is currently the second longest in history and will become the longest if it lasts past June.
But it has also been the slowest in the post-World War II period, a development economists attribute to slower growth in the labor force and weak gains in productivity.

"'God Was Definitely With Us': Family Prayer Answered Amid Tornado, Churches Help Rebuild",www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/god-was-definitely-with-us-family-prayer-answered-amid-tornado-churches-help-rebuild,"Severe weather, including several tornadoes, have ripped a path of destruction across the South killing at least five people.
A twister tore the roof off a barn with its powerful winds in Ohio. Multiple tornadoes touched down in Louisiana in towns of Converse and Ruston.
A pastor's wife and her son encountered Converse's tornado at their church parsonage. They began to pray for protection as their house was shaking when a pine and oak tree fell on the ground, missing their house by one foot.
""God was definitely with us last night,"" stated Dawn, the mother, according to Baptist Message. ""I normally don't get scared, but last night felt different. Noah was a rock; he was more calm than me. He said 'Mama let's pray.' So we did.""
They are grateful to the Lord as their lives were spared and their church only had a broken window.
""When things like this happen, you remember what is important,"" Dawn said. ""Don't sweat the small stuff.""
In the small town of Ruston, a 136 mph tornado struck with deadly force. A different mother and son were killed there, and prayers are being requested for their heartbroken family.
Local churches are working to help those affected by the storm. Rolling Hills Ministry Disaster Relief team members prepared meals for those who were impacted.
And Foundry Church in Sterlington has been collecting tarps while First West and Christ Church have partnered to send cleanup crews into neighborhoods.
Louisiana Gov. Jon Bel Edwards, who has declared a state of emergency, has praised the faith-based community for helping with clean-up.
""What we've seen up to now in the Ruston area and really all across the state of Louisiana has been Louisianans stepping up and doing what they do best and that is being neighbor to one another,"" stated Edwards. ""Especially the faith based community has been tremendous, the number of groups that are here cooking for first responders and for those whose homes have been damaged."""
Bethany Christian Services Agrees to Place Kids in LGBT Homes After Michigan Settlement,www.cbn.com,Mark Martin,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/bethany-christian-services-agrees-to-place-kids-in-lgbt-homes-after-michigan-settlement,"There's been a major development involving an international faith-based foster care and adoption agency. Michigan-based Bethany Christian Services announced this week it will place children in LGBT homes.
Bethany changed course after a recent legal settlement.
The international agency is responsible for around eight percent of Michigan's more than 13,000 foster care and adoption cases centered around kids from troubled homes.
The nonprofit organization issued a statement, saying, ""We are disappointed with how this settlement agreement has been implemented by the state government. Nonetheless, Bethany will continue operations in Michigan, in compliance with our legal contract requirements.""
Michigan's Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel announced the settlement last month after homosexual couples sued in 2017.
The settlement bans faith-based agencies like Bethany from refusing to place kids in LGBT homes for religious reasons if the agencies have accepted the children for referral from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.
The Associated Press reports that of the faith-based agencies in Michigan, who are known not to serve LGBT couples or individuals, Bethany does more work for the state than any other. Bethany handled more than 1,150 cases as of February.
AP reports Catholic Charities had a caseload of more than 400, and St. Vincent Catholic Charities had 80 cases. Michigan State Human Services Department Spokesperson Bob Wheaton said the department was glad it will ""be able to continue its long-standing partnership with Bethany in providing services to children and families.""
Attorney General Nessel tweeted last weekend, ""Having more adoption agencies which don't discriminate equals more children adopted into loving, nurturing ""forever"" homes. Thank you to Bethany Christian Services!""
Having more adoption agencies which don’t discriminate =‘s more children adopted into loving, nurturing “forever” homes. Thank you to Bethany Christian Services! https://t.co/H55Gs1ZktW
— Dana Nessel (@dananessel) April 20, 2019
The AP reports that Nessel is a lesbian and as a private attorney battled to overturn Michigan's ban on same-sex marriage.
Christianity Today reports that Bethany, which has been in existence for 75 years, made it clear its mission and Christian beliefs have not changed. The change will not have an impact on infant adoptions, international adoptions or foster placements in the 34 other states where Bethany serves.
At least two agencies are still fighting the Michigan settlement in court. Catholic Charities West Michigan filed a lawsuit against Michigan's new rule.
Also, St. Vincent Catholic Charities filed a lawsuit in federal court, claiming the settlement violates the US Constitution and federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act."
'The Porn Industry Is Modern-Day Slavery': How Pornography and Sex Trafficking Are Linked,www.cbn.com,Luke Gibbons,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/the-porn-industry-is-modern-day-slavery-how-pornography-and-sex-trafficking-are-linked,"To most people, sex trafficking is a problem that exists in distant foreign countries. You may think, “But it certainly isn’t something that would involve me, is it?”
If you view pornography, then the answer is “Yes.” The truth is, porn and sex trafficking have strong links, even in the United States, where the sex trafficking industry is worth $3 billion a year.
How big is the sex trafficking problem? The University of New England reports it is the third largest criminal business in the world, behind only drugs and weapons.
On April 11, 2018, the White House provided these statistics:
Sex trafficking is a global form of modern-day slavery in which individuals are coerced to perform commercial sex acts against their will. Per the International Labor Organization, 4.8 million victims were in forced sexual exploitation. Over 99 percent of trafficked individuals trapped in forced sexual exploitation are women. Over 21 percent of those trafficked for sex are children. In Fiscal Year 2017, the Department of Homeland Security investigated 833 human trafficking cases. This resulted in 1,602 arrests and 578 convictions, and identified 518 victims of human trafficking. Since 2007, the National Human Trafficking Hotline has received reports of 22,191 sex trafficking cases in the United States. Of the nearly 25,000 runaway children reported to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, one in seven were likely victims of child sex trafficking. So How Is Pornography Connected? According to journalist John-Henry Westen, “As long as America’s men are being trained to think that violent, disturbing pornography is sexually acceptable, an enormous clientele for sex traffickers is being created every day in homes, college dorms, and apartments across the nation.”
The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) defines sex trafficking as “the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision or obtaining of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act.” It also includes “inducing commercial sex acts by force, fraud or coercion.”
A “commercial sex act” means “any sex act on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person.” Since porn performers are given money and other items of value, the definition certainly applies to the pornography industry.
But are porn performers coerced or induced by force or fraud? Aren’t all the scenes done by consenting adults?
One former porn actress testified, “Women are lured in, coerced and forced to do sex acts they never agreed to do… [and given] drugs and alcohol to help get [them] through hardcore scenes…The porn industry is modern-day slavery.”
Sex traffickers use pornography in many ways. They force their victims to watch porn to desensitize them. Even to train them in sex acts they will be forced to perform. They also video the victims and sell and distribute the pornographic films on the internet and other outlets.
“But I’m Just Watching A Few Porn Videos On My Computer.” You may think that watching a little porn alone at home doesn’t have an impact on sex trafficking.
Dr. Mahri Irvine, Adjunct Professional Lecturer at American University, said, “I really wish that people who watch porn knew more about that. Because I think they believe that they’re engaging in this activity in a very passive way. And they’re like, ‘Oh, I’m doing it in the privacy of my own home and this is just a video that I’m watching’. And they’re not associating it with the fact that pornography is very often the filmed rape of sex trafficking victims.”
Noel Bouché, Executive Director of pureHOPE, explained, “While pornographic content includes trafficked victims from around the world, porn consumers aren’t told anything about the performers, including which ones may have been trafficked from an early age. Regular users of internet pornography are likely consuming pornography that includes adult and child victims of sex trafficking.”
On Redeeming Love’s blog, Katie Tomkiewicz summarized, “Various studies show that when pornographic content is viewed, the viewer’s mind becomes increasingly calloused to the brutalities of the sex-trafficking industry, which include rape, coercion, sexual violence, and the general idea that women are objects existing for the purpose of providing sexual pleasure.”
She continued, “The psychological effects that pornography has on the mind cannot be denied; the harm done to both the viewer and the viewed cannot be denied. It is critical to address today’s pornographic culture for what it is: a hub for sex-trafficking and a gateway drug for future pimps and johns.”
Freedom Is Possible Perhaps you were not aware that pornography and sex trafficking were so closely linked. You certainly thought your porn habit was a harmless pastime that didn’t affect anybody.
But now you know. And it’s not just sex trafficking victims that are impacted by porn viewing.
Pornography viewing affects you, your family, your friends, and all areas of your life. And it also affects your relationship with God.
But there are men and women just like you who are making a stand and breaking free from their struggle with pornography.
Joshua Jorstad is one of more than 750,000 men who have started their journey to freedom through a powerful small group course called the Conquer Series .
“Because of the Conquer Series , I started my journey to be free from porn! I am officially a year and a half clean and have been loving the change. Ultimately, it was God who changed my heart, but your resources helped a bunch!”

"Canada Releases 'Gay Coin' to Celebrate LGBTQ2 Anniversary, Christians Call It 'An Affront to Our God'",www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/canada-releases-gay-coin-to-celebrate-lgbtq2-anniversary-christians-call-it-an-affront-to-our-god,"The Royal Canadian Mint has released a commemorative one-dollar coin (known as a ""loonie"") to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the partial decriminalization of the LGBTQ community.
Conservative Christians have called the new coin a highly offensive attack against God.
In 1969, Canada's Parliament passed legislation to partially stop the criminalization of homosexual activity, protecting private activity between two individuals 21 and older.
New $1 #Equality coin marking 50 years since Canada took the first step towards decriminalizing homosexuality is unveiled by @Bill_Morneau @MarLemay1 @R_Boissonnault #RightToLove https://t.co/5zW3sSuVAp
— Royal Canadian Mint (@CanadianMint) April 23, 2019
""Marking 50 years since a landmark decision that began a process of legal reforms to recognize the rights of LGBTQ2 Canadians is a powerful way to recognize Canada's profound belief in equality and inclusion,"" said Marie Lemay, president and CEO of the Royal Canadian Mint.
The addition of ""2"" to LGBTQ is for ""two spirit"", an indigenous concept that believes a person has both a masculine and feminine spirit.
""It is an opportunity to reflect on a landmark event in our country's history, and a reminder of the progress still to be made as we work toward inclusion and equality for all LGBTQ2 Canadians,"" stated Randy Boissonnault, a special adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Though the country has been progressive in LGBTQ rights, some gay activists say the country hasn't gone far enough.
On the other hand, conservative Christians are opposing the new coin and what it represents for their country.
NBC News reports the Christian organization Citizen Go started a petition opposing the release of the new loonie, garnering over 57,000 signatures.
The petition states, ""This is highly offensive to many Canadians, particularly those who are Christian. This is nothing less than an attack on our faith and an affront to our God.""
""When we first heard about it, we were outraged,"" said David Cooke, executive director of Citizen Go's Canadian branch. ""This is a moral issue, this is a sin issue in terms of homosexual practices.""
""I can't have it in my possession,"" he added. ""This is promoting something that goes against my beliefs.""
""Grown adults have a right to do whatever they like in the privacy of their own bedroom, but there is no business for the government putting this on money,"" he continued."

More than a million of the country's four million refugees have fled to the neighboring nation of Colombia, but that's where tens of thousands of them had a life-changing encounter with Jesus Christ over Easter weekend.
A broken economy magnified by a political crisis and power outages is forcing millions of Venezuelans to flee their country. CBN News contributor Chuck Holton has visited the area and described the desperate situation for those crossing into the border town of Cucuta, Colombia.
""These guys are bringing products either into Colombia to sell or back into Venezuela, things that aren't available there, things like tires, medicines. Coming across from Venezuela we're seeing a lot of scrap metal that they sell over on the Colombian side, we see things like copper wire because people are ripping the wire out of the walls and wrapping them up and bringing them over here to sell just to get enough money to eat,"" Holton said.
Cucuta is on one of the main escape routes for desperate Venezuelans. Prostitution by Venezuelan girls is rampant. Leonel Castillo and his wife work with their church to help them.
""The wealthiest Venezuelans have already escaped to Spain or Miami, the middle class is going to Ecuador or Chile. But the poorest are coming to Cucuta,"" Castillo said.
Venezuelans have been suffering under one of the worst humanitarian disasters in modern times, but this week tens of thousands of refugees received the ultimate gift of hope.
It was called the ""Festival of Hope,"" and Franklin Graham's team chose the strategic location to share the gospel to Colombians and Venezuelan refugees as well.
""Tonight if you're here and you don't know Jesus Christ as your savior,"" Franklin Graham preached, ""tonight you can be sure.""
Graham told CBN News, ""The physical needs, I think, of the people. God sometimes uses that to open up the hearts spiritually.""
Christian ministries like Graham's Samaritan's Purse and CBN's Operation Blessing have sent teams to provide food, hygiene kits and medical care to the refugees.
As the humanitarian crisis worsens – the US and other nations are increasing pressure on the Maduro government and his allies: Russia and Cuba.
Graham considers the Cuban officials and military personnel who are propping up leader Nicholas Maduro a big obstacle to change.
""The Cubans have taken control of the country. They've taken control of the government. They've taken control of the military. It's almost as if Cuba has annexed the country,"" Graham told CBN News.
As the Venezuela crisis deepens, the US and other nations aren't ruling out military force. Graham says he hopes and prays for a solution that does not involve military force and more suffering for the Venezuelan people."
‘I Was an...Addict’: Inside My Pillow Inventor Mike Lindell’s Amazing Transformation,www1.cbn.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/april/lsquo-i-was-an-addict-rsquo-inside-my-pillow-inventor-mike-lindell-rsquo-s-amazing-transformation,"‘I Was an...Addict’: Inside My Pillow Inventor Mike Lindell’s Amazing Transformation 04-26-2019 Billy Hallowell, Pureflix.com Mike Lindell (Photo courtesy PureFlix)
Millions of Americans know Mike Lindell from his popular commercials for MyPillow, but many people are likely unaware of the iconic pillow magnate’s incredible backstory of overcoming addiction, finding faith and using his massive platform to help transform the lives of others.
Lindell, who is the CEO and inventor of MyPillow, helped finance “Unplanned,” a film about abortion clinic director-turned pro-life advocate Abby Johnson’s life that has been sparking headlines and is currently in theaters nationwide .

He poured $1 million into the production, telling PureFlix.com’s “Pure Talk” that he got involved after producers reached out and revealed their plans. Lindell was so moved by Johnson’s real-life story that he prayed over it and instantly decided to fund the movie and film a cameo.
“I said, ‘Are you short any money?’ And they said, ‘Yeah, we’re short about a $1 million and ... I just felt right there through the holy spirit — ‘Send this money,’” Lindell explained.
He also shared details of his personal faith journey, revealing that he was a drug addict for nearly three decades before finally stopping in 2009.
“I was a crack cocaine addict,” Lindell said. “I was a very functioning cocaine addict.”
Watch Lindell share his amazing journey:
He was so bad, in fact, that his drug dealers staged an intervention in 2008 and refused to sell to him. They cut him off, and a year later he was done using.
“I got freed of all of my addictions January 16, 2009, but at that point I didn’t do a full surrender to Jesus,” he said. “I didn’t give a full surrender until February 18, 2017, so there’s quite a story in between where God was still chasing me.”

Now, Lindell travels the country and speaks about his Christian faith and the values that stem from it. He views MyPillow as a platform through which he’s able to have a positive influence — and “Unplanned” is just his latest effort to achieve that goal.
“I really believe you’re not just saving the unborn and the babies, but the peoples’ hearts are changing and healing,” he said of the impact of “Unplanned.” “It was God. Everybody who was involved in that movie, God put them there.”

The High Cost of Stubbornness,feeds.cbn.com,Beth.Patch,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://feeds.cbn.com/devotions/the-high-cost-of-stubbornness,"The High Cost of Stubbornness Related Content Tim Bishop
“Do you mind if I share some wisdom from the Bible about ?”
I often ask a question like that to people in despair when I chat with them as a coach on an Internet helpline. The word “cutting” commonly fills the blank. Any of us would do well to use that query on ourselves when we encounter a problem. It’s a profound question because it can reveal a person’s state of readiness for a life-changing solution.
People are dealing with weighty issues these days. Whether they have brought their problems on themselves or become victims of the sin of other people, they must find their own way out.
So, I tactfully explore whether we can invite God into our discussion, to see what the Bible has to say about their issue and how God Himself can factor into their solution. Astonishingly, some of them who are already on the brink of ending their lives remain dug in and refuse permission. That rejection may suggest bad experiences with unyielding parents, overzealous peers, or church hypocrisy. Other times, society has already foisted upon them a negative perception of God and the Bible. Some, I learn, fear that they will need to relinquish an addictive sin – the very thing that keeps them in bondage.
Perhaps deep inside, the people in this latter group already know they have wandered from what is right, but they haven’t connected it to their issues. To consider God would make them face something they aren’t willing to change. If we can deny God’s existence or His lordship, then we are accountable to no one but ourselves, so the thinking goes. People want to do their own thing. Submitting to authority is as unpopular now as it was in yesteryear.
Jesus met the same unwillingness to confront the truth. Members of a sect, the Sadducees, were more into hairsplitting than discovering who Jesus was. They tried to trap Him with trick questions, but He silenced them with wisdom and authority, the likes of which they’d never experienced. He saw through them and exposed them:
Then, with the crowds listening, he turned to his disciples and said, “Beware of these experts in religion, for they love to parade in dignified robes and to be bowed to by the people as they walk along the street. And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and at religious festivals! But even while they are praying long prayers with great outward piety, they are planning schemes to cheat widows out of their property. Therefore God’s heaviest sentence awaits these men” Luke 20:45-47 (TLB).
The Sadducees had no interest in Jesus because He threatened their position within the culture. Exploring Him further would have meant changing their ways and giving up some power.
The sound of God’s voice threatens people who are unwilling to submit to Him. Even though His Word would shine light into their darkness and His Spirit’s transformative power would unshackle them, some people aren’t ready to surrender and leave their “discomfort zone” behind. Their stubbornness always shows they have yet to understand God’s love, forgiveness and power. At high cost, evil grips them.
One day, the Bible says, “every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father” (Philippians 2:11 TLB). May the Holy Spirit soften hardened hearts and expose the enemy’s deceptions before it is too late.

"Sri Lankan Woman Left a Childless Widow, Losing Most of Her Family in Easter Church Bombing | CBN News",www1.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/sri-lankan-woman-left-a-childless-widow-losing-most-of-her-family-in-easter-church-bombing,"Before the undertakers could move in, Anusha Kumari wrested herself away from her sisters and flung herself on the three coffins, wailing. In an instant, she was left childless and a widow when suicide bombers attacked churches and luxury hotels in and near Sri Lanka's capital of Colombo.
The toll was highest at St. Sebastian's Church in Negombo. Of the more than 350 people killed by the suicide bombings that the government blamed on Muslim extremists, about a third of them died at the church in the seaside fishing town while attending Easter Mass.
And perhaps no one lost more relatives than 43-year-old Kumari, whose daughter, son, husband, sister-in-law and two nieces were killed.
They were buried three days later near the church on vacant land that has quickly become a cemetery for the victims.
Kumari, who was injured from the blast, left the hospital to bury her family. Afterward, she reclined in a cane chair at her home, hooked up to an IV dangling from an open window. Gauze bandages covered the bridge of her nose and her right eye. There was still shrapnel in her face.
A photo of her children was on the wall, while on the shelf were small statues of Jesus, Mary and St. Sebastian, an early Christian martyr riddled with wounds from Roman arrows.
She could see her son's drum kit on the upstairs landing, a gift from his father after doing well on exams, and a school portrait of her daughter. All day, relatives, neighbors and nuns wandered in and out of the large house, offering food, consolation and prayer.
""You won't believe it, but I had the perfect family,"" Kumari said. ""In 24 years of marriage, my husband and I never argued. All four of us slept in the same room. Now I have lost everything.""
Tears mixed with blood from her bandaged right eye.
""All these people, they have their own families. They'll go home and I'll be alone,"" she said.
A brother-in-law, Jude Prasad Appuhami, said his extended family, one of the oldest and most prominent in Catholic-majority Negombo, marked all the religious holidays and rituals at St. Sebastian's, a Gothic-style church patterned after Reims Cathedral in France.
On Easter, though, he wasn't in church with his 15 relatives because he had to drive a vehicle carrying a statue of Christ for a parade after Mass.
Appuhami arrived midway through the service and heard the blast from the parking lot. He rushed in and was overwhelmed by the sight of so much blood. One of his sisters-in-law, who survived, shouted for him to help their niece.
He found her with her eyes open, picked her up and rushed to the hospital, only to realize she was dead.
Appuhami's wife and 10-year-old daughter, sitting in an alcove to the left of the altar, escaped with minor injuries. His 17-year-old daughter, Rusiri, who was sitting at the front of the church because she was going to do a reading from Scripture, also survived, but she was left with nerve damage that makes eating painful.
On Wednesday, she struggled to grasp what she has seen.
""I don't know how to think of it. It's like a dream,"" she said.
During the funeral at the makeshift cemetery near St. Sebastian's, where mourners had to pass through security checks, a military drone buzzed overhead as the Rev. Niroshan Perera led prayers for the dead.
Perera, who grew up with Kumari's husband, Dulip Appuhami, and his siblings, recalled going as a boy with his friends and family to the church's well, where the faithful believed the water could cure them of diseases.
When the funeral ended, Perera encouraged everyone to go home quickly, fearing another attack.
Perera, who lost 16 relatives and friends in the blast, said he no longer trusted the Sri Lankan government to protect his flock.

God’s Purpose for Masculinity on Full Display in Kingdom Men Rising,feeds.cbn.com,Chris.Carpenter,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://feeds.cbn.com/movies/gods-purpose-masculinity-full-display-kingdom-men-rising,"Chris Carpenter - Director of Internet Programming
Anthony Evans has emerged over the last decade to become one of Christian music’s top male vocalists. But he is also a person who knows a thing or two about having a great spiritual legacy. The son of well-known evangelist Dr. Tony Evans and the brother of evangelist/actress Priscilla Shirer , Anthony is a prime example of someone striving to live his life as God intended.
Anthony plays a key role in his father’s new Fathom Movie event, Kingdom Men Rising , a film that explores the Biblical intentions of masculinity and what it takes to be a true man of God. In theaters nationwide today and tomorrow only (April 29 and April 30), the movie event also features NFL Hall of Famers Tim Brown and Tony Dungy as well as Grammy Award winners Kirk Franklin and Lecrae .
Find a theater near you to view the Kingdom Men Rising live movie event.
Digging a little deeper, Kingdom Men Rising is a powerful documentary that explores what it means to be a real man of God living in a modern age. In the film’s 93 minutes, Dr. Evans challenges men to step actively into lives of purpose that are rooted in fundamentally sound Biblical principles.
I recently sat down with Anthony to discuss the new Fathom event, the definition of true manhood, and why it is so important for men to be emotionally present in their family’s lives.
There have been a lot of projects about being better men and fathers. Why create a film geared toward Kingdom men at this time? What’s different about Kingdom Men Rising ?
We are creating the film now because it goes along with the Kingdom series my Dad has been preaching for the last five to seven years. He has done a series on Kingdom women, Kingdom singles, and now Kingdom men. It's all been part of his journey. In doing the film I believe we have a lot of people who are moviegoers and not necessarily book readers. It's really making sure that the message gets out as broad as it can because it’s a relevant message about changing our culture in general and as it relates to what the definition of manhood is.
Before we get too deep into the conversation, how would you define “Kingdom Men”?
The major thing that's different about the definition of a kingdom man versus just an American male is that being a kingdom man starts off with being submitted. A lot of times in our culture we are taught that as men, part of our being a man is just running your own kingdom. You're the head of it and your accomplishments are the thing that matters most. That is not necessarily a Biblical definition. In fact, it isn’t at all. This film is about turning people back in general to the concept that we have a Maker. When you get something in the mail that has a maker it comes with instructions because the person who designed it knows how they intended it to be. When you put it together the way that the instructions say, you're going to get the biggest and the fullest use out of it. What's happened in our culture now is that we feel like we are the final say and we don't need an instruction manual because we know how it's supposed to work. And then what we end up doing is we're trying to put ourselves together years later because we simply will not go to the Maker to get the instructions on how we're supposed to be doing it in the first place. This movie is about redirecting us to our Maker and our instruction manual, the Bible, and how it relates to our design as men.
To continue on this theme, what defines true manhood or being a true man?
The first thing that defines a true man is being submitted. That's the first step, submitting your will to the will of the One who made you, admitting that His design is going to be best. That literally is it. And then, from that submission, following Him in the direction that He has specifically designed for you to go. My Dad, my brother and I are all built different and God has a very specific path for us that we only get to be on when were submitted to Him.
One major undercurrent that I picked up on in the film is the importance of being known to your family. Why is it so important for men to be emotionally present in their family’s lives?
Feeling connected to your father in general is one of the most important life giving experiences you can have. It’s so important to be emotionally connected. Our emotions are indicators in our lives for a lot of different things, but God has given us a gift of emotions. And to be able to connect those to your father who then kind of helps you define how you're going to be and what your worldview will be like. A lot of our worldviews are defined by our fathers. That emotional connection is the epitome of how that all begins. It's one of the most important things for us to be vulnerable, transparent and authentic with others.
How is pop culture trying to dictate the conversation on manhood? What is it saying?
It's saying that your money, your accomplishments, your success, your status are what you're working for. That is what it's supposed to mean, especially pop culture. It seems all that matters is how much is in your bank account. And then that's it. You are a man based on that. That couldn't be further from the truth because when you allow success to be your definition of manhood, there's going to be a point in all of our lives where we are not successful. For you to lean on success heavily, it's setting yourself up for disaster in general. I really believe that. That's why my dad made this movie. It's a relevant and current way to get a message out that's counter cultural.
Turning in the other direction toward principles of faith, what are the Biblical intentions for masculinity?
I believe the Biblical intention of masculinity is for it to be a conduit by which legacy is set up. Biblical masculinity is a conduit by which God's message gets to reverberate through the generations. And that is not what we are making it about today. It's how big of a deal I am and how strong I am physically. Emotionally I'm cut off because that's me being strong. The generational impact that it leaves is not an impact on how you define yourself. That's the difference.
A lot of well-known men are featured in this film … Tony Dungy, Jon Kitna, Tim Brown, Kirk Franklin, Lecrae just to name a few. Why is it important to feature these guys?
I think it’s important to share different perspectives. When you shoot a film or television show there are usually five or six different camera angles that are used. If you use only one it would be sort of stagnant and dull. Different people provide different perspectives.
For example, my perspective is that of an emotional, artistic person. With Tony Dungy, you're going to get the more traditional American male. But he's also been through a whole lot. You get to see the same thing from six or seven different perspectives. When you can do that, you can obviously take and learn more when you get to see it.
Changing gears a bit, would women receive any benefit from seeing Kingdom Men Rising or is this strictly a guy's film?
No. It's an everybody film because everybody's impacted by this. There are some films that lean toward certain audiences, but then it's an everybody moment. There are certain fans of Marvel movies but they're made for everybody. And I think that's what this is. It's very obvious by the title what it is. But if a woman wants to be encouraged and capture nuggets of truth to talk to her friends about a male then this film is for her. This is a film for husbands to bring his kids too so that the daughter knows what she needs to be looking for in a man. For the son it sets the stage for what he aspires to be. It’s for everybody.
You mentioned earlier that your father has been working on the Kingdom series for a quite a number of years. Furthermore, he has been a well-known evangelist for a long, long time. Do you see this movie as his swan song for his long-standing ministry?
It is one of many. There's so many projects in the works though that I believe are part of that. But yes, this is legacy stuff. This whole Kingdom series is all part of his legacy moment. This movie plays a very vital role in a bigger picture.
After people have seen Kingdom Men Rising , from your perspective what would you like to see viewers take away from the experience? What is your greatest hope for the film?
My greatest hope for the movie is that it's a call to action and not just an entertaining movie. Not just an, ‘oh that was nice’ moment for someone. That's not the point. If my Dad wanted to entertain people he would have just made a regular movie. This is about a call to action. I would love to see lives changed. I hope this movie’s message actually reverberates in the hearts and the spirits of the people who are leaving the theaters. So much so that people who aren’t even at the theater feel the impact because life lives have been changed."

Shazam! is a superhero movie based on the DC comic book character of a young boy who gets magical powers that transform him into a superhero with an adult body. Shazam! is a hilarious, heartwarming, family centric superhero movie that's one of the better structured DC movies in years, but there are some issues parents must note!
The movie opens by setting up its villain. A young boy in 1974, Thaddeus, is driving in a car with his mean older brother and his father, who's disappointed Thaddeus is so soft. While in the car, Thaddeus is all of sudden transported to a dark cave in another realm where he meets The Wizard Shazam. The Wizard explains he's the last of the Council of Wizards who wield magic that keeps the seven demons of the seven deadly sins from wrecking havoc on the world. The Wizard is very old and needs someone to take his place, but the person needs to be pure of heart and able to resist temptation. Thaddeus quickly reveals he isn't pure of heart, and the Wizard sends him back to the car where his brother and father were. When Thaddeus returns, he makes a ruckus about what he just saw, which causes a car accident that injures his father.
Skip to present time in Philadelphia. Billy Batson, a 14-year-old orphan, is constantly running away from foster homes and getting into trouble because he'll stop at nothing until he can find his birth mother. Billy is placed with a new foster family, the Vasquez's, the last couple willing to take him. The Vasquez's are very kind and warm, because they were foster children themselves. The other children that live in the home are Mary, the oldest foster child who's getting ready to go to college, the young computer tech genius Eugene, the quietest of the foster children, Pedro, and the sweet Darla, the youngest of the children who loves hugging each of her foster brothers and sisters. Billy's new roommate is Freddy, a disabled boy Billy's age who's a superhero enthusiast and has a dark sense of humor.
Meanwhile, Thaddeus is now a scientist who's dedicated his life to finding the Wizard so he can get the power that was denied him when he was a boy. When he finally finds a way to the other realm, he accesses the power of the seven deadly sins that consume him and make him extremely powerful.
Back in Philly, Billy is overwhelmed by all these new people who seem to care about him, but he has no plans to let anyone into his heart. One day while running away from some bullies that Billy stood up to, he's transported to The Wizard Shazam's cave. The Wizard is desperate for anyone even remotely pure to take on the powers of Shazam, so he convinces Billy to say his name. All of a sudden, Billy receives the power of Shazam, which stands for ""the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, the courage of Achilles, and the speed of Mercury."" When Billy speaks his name Shazam, he's transformed into a powerful superhero with an adult body.
Billy loves these new powers, but begins to use them selfishly. Will Billy/Shazam be destroyed by the seven deadly sins and Dr. Thaddeus? Can Billy decide to accept this wonderful new family he's been given?
Shazam! is a surprise in many different ways. Unlike many of the other DC movies that are darker and grittier, Shazam! takes a childlike look at the superhero genre that's fresh. Of course, there's many gags of a child in an adult's body, trying to get away with things he shouldn't. Most of the time the situations are very funny, like when Billy as Shazam tries to buy beer with Freddy, but they spew it out because it tastes so terrible. Other times, the moments are inappropriate, like when he goes into a strip club in his superhero body. The camera doesn't go inside the club with him. It just shows him going in and coming out minutes later.
The writing and direction is very good, with strong emotional moments that really make viewers care about the characters. The young cast of foster children, which include a few familiar faces from various TV shows, are absolutely terrific as well. Who really steals the show, however, is Zachary Levi of Tangled and TV's Chuck as the superhero Shazam, and Jack Dylan Grazer as the very funny Freddy.
Positively, there are many strong Christian, biblical themes and messages strung throughout the story. The story's center is all about family, with a strong emphasis on the blessings of foster families. As the movie progresses, Billy learns what it means to be a selfless hero as well, and to use his new powers for good. There are also multiple Christian allusions as well. For example, the main villains are demons of the seven deadly sins, pride, envy, greed, anger, sloth, gluttony and lust, which have their roots as sins from the Bible. Resisting the temptation of sin is also a recurring message. The Vasquez foster family gives thanks before dinner, though they don't end it with an amen, or any mention explicitly to God. The movie is also set around Christmas time, so there are a couple Christmas songs referencing Jesus, and a nativity scene appears in a front yard.
Negatively, Shazam! has a set of problems that parents need to know. There is magic in this movie that receives some attention. While the source of the magic isn't explored, it's clear that Shazam's powers are the same as other pagan myths, such as Zeus and Hercules. That said, there aren't any seances or overt witchcraft (other than a magic 8-ball that the villain used as a boy and symbols he uses to find the Wizard).
There's also a fair amount of foul language for a movie that's centered around children. There are 14 obscenities (mostly ""h,"" ""a"" and ""s"" words), more than a dozen OMGs, and a strong profanity using Jesus Christ's name. The language count was significantly higher than the more adult skewed DC movie Aquaman . Much of the violence is lighter, but there are a few scenes that are on the disturbing side, especially when the seven deadly sin demons frightfully attack people. One man has his head bitten off.
While there's much to celebrate in the movie, and it's a very entertaining ride, there are too many objectionable elements for it to be appropriate for young children. Strong caution is advised for Shazam! . Show Guest Bio:"
‘Friend’ is Not a Verb: Author Explores True Community in New Book,feeds.cbn.com,Chris.Carpenter,04-24-2019,2019,4,http://feeds.cbn.com/books/friend-not-verb-author-explores-true-community-new-book,"Chris Carpenter - Director of Internet Programming
Dialogue from a recent conversation overheard in a workplace break room as two friends scroll through separate social media accounts without making eye contact with one another.
“I can’t believe it! I have more than 1,000 friends on Facebook!”
“That’s awesome. How many of them do you actually know?”
“Maybe half.”
“Maybe half?”
“Yeah. It seems weird that I have all these friends and don't actually know them.”
Despite living in a hyper-connected world we are now more disconnected than ever. People we consider to be our ‘friends’ have seemingly become nothing more than a profile photo that pops up once in a while ‘in our feed’. And it is there that we become envious of our ‘friends’ living lives that seem so much better than ours … but are they?
Author Joe Battaglia believes that true community does not come in the form of scrolling through our social media pages but through real life relationships rooted in love, connection, and acceptance instead. In his latest book, Unfriended , Battaglia provides simple, time-tested advice to find our way back to real relationships with real people.
I recently sat down with Battaglia to discuss whether hyper-connectivity has any redeeming qualities, what authentic community looks line in the 21 st Century, and how Jesus factors into the social media equation.
What was the catalyst for you to write Unfriended ?
I write about things that bother me in culture. Over the past couple of years I've been really concerned about the disintegration of what I consider real community. It just became so much a part of what I look at in life because I come from a very Italian background where life was all about being with people, being with the family, and being with each other.
You begin to see how all this began eroding. The Internet for certain is part of the issue because many young people think that that constitutes a community. And so I thought I really ought to look back into Scripture, which is always my north star. I always try to build my principles of how I live around Biblical principles and use Jesus as my model. As I got into what constituted true community, I found that the intersection of communion and sacrifice are integral to having that true community. I saw much of that lacking in our world today. We keep to ourselves. We stay in communities that we develop online. So we begin to think like the same people. We look like each other. We act like each other.
That has really enabled our culture to become more introspective than the ability to look at the Word. So, I thought, this is wrong. Let me write about it. Let me use Jesus as my model and see what constitutes real community.
Why do you think we are more disconnected than ever? Due to technology shouldn’t we be more connected? Do you think being hyper connected has any redeeming qualities too?
I don't think it really does because it's not about having a connection in some amorphous way. It's all about connecting viscerally with someone. It's all about connecting with who they are, what they feel, what they feel about you, what they feel about life.
That kind of intersection allows us to think about the things that we are, enables us to think about life. It confronts us so that we have to deal with it. And it's often the things that people are unlike each other that draw them together. It is often conflict, which brings people together and not separates them. We have eliminated the very things that enable people to become friends, be involved in someone's life, which is not always pretty. It is often those kinds of things that build relationships, relationships build community, and community builds society. Society builds a culture. When you destroy the very foundation of what constitutes a true society, that's why we see what we have today. Hyper connectivity is not the same as community.
What is your definition of true or authentic community? In practical terms, what does that look like?
It's the opportunity to sweat alongside somebody, sense eternity and their soul, which is very similar to mine. To look into their eyes and see how they feel. Sense their passions that may even correspond to mine and to enable us to enjoy differences because it is the differences in us that can draw us together. All of these elements are what constitutes real community. That enables us to find out about ourselves. That's always what it's about. It's enabling us to know ourselves better in the context of somebody else. And if we deny ourselves the opportunity to intersect with people, then we deny ourselves the very thing that makes us who we are.
In your book you write about the concept of plurality. Why is it necessary to appreciate and encourage differences of opinion, or plurality?
The motto on our coins and our currency is e pluribus Unum, right? We understand that as one from many, literally translated, it's from the many one. It's the same thing.
The Founding Fathers and those who established this country, which was certainly providential, understood that it's really diversity that establishes oneness. Not diversity in the politically correct sense, but the diverse intersection of individuals who help one become strong. I use the metaphor of the redwood trees in California. They're so huge and big you would think they have a really big root system, but they don't. They have a very shallow root system. And the key to them not being toppled over in strong winds or storms is that all the roots are intertwined. They provide a stabilizing opportunity for everybody to stand strong. That's what plurality does. When we intersect ourselves and intertwine ourselves with the roots of others that are there to help us stand, we become stronger and are able to withstand all the things that come against us. I use the parable of Jesus with the woman at the well, intersecting in her life on purpose, a Jewish man going through Samaria intersecting with a Samaritan woman was unheard of, but He becomes part of her life at that point and said something to her that makes her go back and tell people.
The principal here is, unless we go out of our way to be with people unlike us, they won't go out of their way to tell people about us.
Based on what you have been just describing, why should we use Jesus as the model for the kind of community we need?
Number one, He established himself as the one who created community. From the very beginning there was the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In my book, I say this is the first community. He helps us understand the heart of the Father. In John 17 , Jesus in his high priestly prayer could have asked the Father anything on our behalf. But He only asks for one thing … that we are one. Well, why do we think Jesus asked for oneness?
Well, that must have a lot of importance to God and to Him because it is the very thing that embodies the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit from creation. There is a power to being one with someone else. Unless we become one with others and we have this plurality mentality about us, than we are by design interceptors of individuals. We need to be with others different than us and unlike us so that we find out about us and we enable people to grow. Jesus is always a great model because he did that. So I felt why not look to Him as the one around whom I build these principles and am then able to apply them?
As an author, what is the one thing you would like people to take away from reading Unfriended ? What is your greatest hope for the book?
That they buy my book! (laughs) A little levity is good. Seriously though, I hope people take their time and absorb some of the things in there. In the book, I have things that they can do at the end in order to allow themselves to break free from that which has enslaved them to their anonymity or to their online cowardice. I would like my readers to be involved with people, get on the road and do things that will intersect you with people. I always hope that whatever I write helps people to think first before they act because at least you have additional thoughts from which you can then design your own plan. So, I'm not telling you what to do in any of my books. I always say, think about this.
If you've not considered, consider it, and then allow God to help you understand it. And if there is a need to change, then you can change.

"Nicole Kidman Says Her Friends Tease Her for Believing in God, Raising Her Kids in Church",www1.cbn.com,,04-27-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/nicole-kidman-says-her-friends-lsquo-tease-rsquo-her-for-believing-in-god-raising-her-kids-in-church,"Nicole Kidman Says Her Friends ‘Tease’ Her for Believing in God, Raising Her Kids in Church 04-25-2019 Tré Goins-Phillips, Faithwire Nicole Kidman (AP Photo)
Actor Nicole Kidman admitted during a recent interview with Vanity Fair that her friends often “tease” her for believing in God and choosing to raise her children in church .
The Oscar-winning celebrity, married to country singer Keith Urban, told the magazine faith has played a pivotal role in her life, but said she has “a lot” of friends who poke fun at her religious convictions. She revealed she and Urban often take their kids — 10-year-old Sunday Rose and 8-year-old Faith Margaret — to church.
From Shame to Surrender: ‘Jesus Culture’ Lead Singer Shares Her Journey
“That’s how we are raising our children,” Kidman said. “Keith has his own beliefs, but he comes, too. I had a very Catholic grandmother, and I was raised praying, so that had a massive impact.”
Previously married to well-known Scientologist Tom Cruise, Kidman, who has two children with the “Mission Impossible” star, both of whom are believers in Scientology, said she doesn’t shy away from her younger children asking questions about God.
Though she encourages them to have faith, she said she doesn’t endorse “absolutism.”
“I wouldn’t say it’s absolutism; there’s constant questioning,” Kidman explained. “I’m a willful, feisty girl. For me, it’s very important that I don’t have judgment. My dad would always say, ‘Tolerance is the most important thing.’”
Interview: ‘This Is Us’ Star Chrissy Metz Opens Up About Personal Reason She Believes in Miracles
It’s not clear how deep Kidman’s faith runs. In 2018, she told Allure she’s “spiritual in the sense that I absolutely believe in God.”
The 51-year-old actor ventured into issues of faith last year, when she played the pastor’s wife in the controversial film “Boy Erased,” which chronicles the experience of a son confronting his Christian parents about his sexual orientation. Years earlier, they sent him to a traumatizing conversion-therapy-type program.
While the movie certainly deals with issues of faith, it never offers a robust Christian perspective on sexual ethics. A review from Movieguide found the film correctly addresses some bad theology, but ultimately “endorses immoral behavior.”
Kidman, speaking of her role in “Boy Erased,” said, “The mother is struggling herself, and there’s a truth to it. She changes. She’s the one that changes, and I love that. I think that’s really beautiful.”"
"Sri Lanka militants set off bombs during raid, killing 15",www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-27-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/sri-lanka-militants-set-off-bombs-during-raid-killing-15,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) - Militants linked to Easter suicide bombings opened fire and set off explosives during a raid by Sri Lankan security forces on a house in the country's east, leaving behind a grisly discovery Saturday: 15 bodies, including six children.
The gunbattle that began Friday night and the carnage that followed come amid widespread fear of more attacks as officials hunt for militants with explosives believed to still be at large after the coordinated bombings of churches and luxury hotels that killed more than 250 nearly a week ago.
Raids and police curfews have shut down areas of eastern Sri Lanka, and Catholic leaders have canceled Sunday Masses indefinitely. Officials also urged Muslims to stay home for prayers in an extraordinary call by the clergy to curtail worship.
The gunfight came after police tipped off soldiers about a suspected safe house near the town of Sammanthurai, where authorities said the militants detonated three explosions and opened fire.
Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said that some of the dead likely were militants who blew themselves up in suicide bombings. Earlier, the military said at least one civilian had been killed in the attack.
A girl and a woman survived the explosion at the suspected safe house but were critically injured and being treated at a nearby hospital, Gunasekara said.
Photographs taken by The Associated Press show the charred remains of one child and the body of another wearing a green T-shirt with the words ""good boy"" written on the back. The bodies of an adult woman and man were found after the explosion with their clothes burned off.
Meanwhile, the military said security forces had recovered explosives, detonators, ""suicide kits,"" military uniforms and Islamic State group flags in the ongoing raids.
Gunasekara said officers acting on information from intelligence officials also found 150 sticks of blasting gelatin and 100,000 small metal balls, as well as a van and clothing suspected of being used by those involved in the Easter attacks. Suicide bomb vests often are packed with such balls to increase the shrapnel in the explosion, making them even deadlier.
Fear of more attacks has led to increased security at shrines, churches, temples and mosques across the multiethnic country of 21 million off the southern coast of India.
Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith told reporters Friday that church officials had seen a leaked security document describing Roman Catholic churches and other denominations as a major target. Ranjith, who is the archbishop of Colombo, asked the faithful across Sri Lanka to stay home for their own safety.
""We don't want repetitions,"" Ranjith said.
It was an extraordinary request for a Catholic clergyman to make, as churches often remain a refuge. Giovanni Maria Vian, a church historian and emeritus editor of the Vatican newspaper, said he believed it was the first time the church had canceled Masses across a country for security reasons.
In Galle Face, a normally crowded ocean side park in Colombo near some of the hotels that were bombed, only a few people could be seen Saturday. Kiosks were closed, and traffic was lighter than usual, with security officials blocking streets and checking vehicles at barricades.
Yashwant Kumar Singh, 23, a worker from India, said he wants to go back to his homeland because he fears another attack. ""If it only happened on one day, then that wouldn't have been so difficult, but bombs are going off here every day. That is why there is an atmosphere of fear. We are feeling very scared.""

On Saturday, cleaning crews arrived to St. Anthony's Shrine in Colombo, where broken glass still littered a blood-stained floor. They collected debris, tossing it into a truck parked outside as a heavy contingent of security forces stood guard.

On Friday, police confirmed the militant group's leader, Mohamed Zahran, died in the suicide bombing at the Shangri-La Hotel, one of six hotels and churches attacked. Zahran appeared in an Islamic State video claiming responsibility for the coordinated assault, and authorities in both Sri Lanka and Australia confirmed links between IS and the attack.
On Thursday night, Sri Lanka's Health Ministry drastically reduced its estimated death toll from the bombings. A statement said ""approximately"" 253 people had been killed, nearly one-third lower than an earlier police estimate of 359 dead.

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) - Militants linked to Easter suicide bombings opened fire and set off explosives during a raid by Sri Lankan security forces on a house in the country's east, leaving behind a grisly discovery Saturday: 15 bodies, including six children. The gunbattle that began Friday night and the carnage that followed come amid widespread fear of more attacks as officials hunt for militants with explosives believed to still be at large after the coordinated bombings of churches and luxury hotels that killed more than 250 nearly a week ago. Raids and police curfews have shut down areas of eastern Sri Lanka, and Catholic leaders have canceled Sunday Masses indefinitely. Officials also urged Muslims to stay home for prayers in an extraordinary call by the clergy to curtail worship. The gunfight came after police tipped off soldiers about a suspected safe house near the town of Sammanthurai, where authorities said the militants detonated three explosions and opened fire. Police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said that some of the dead likely were militants who blew themselves up in suicide bombings. Earlier, the military said at least one civilian had been killed in the attack. A girl and a woman survived the explosion at the suspected safe house but were critically injured and being treated at a nearby hospital, Gunasekara said. Photographs taken by The Associated Press show the charred remains of one child and the body of another wearing a green T-shirt with the words ""good boy"" written on the back. The bodies of an adult woman and man were found after the explosion with their clothes burned off. Meanwhile, the military said security forces had recovered explosives, detonators, ""suicide kits,"" military uniforms and Islamic State group flags in the ongoing raids. Gunasekara said officers acting on information from intelligence officials also found 150 sticks of blasting gelatin and 100,000 small metal balls, as well as a van and clothing suspected of being used by those involved in the Easter attacks. Suicide bomb vests often are packed with such balls to increase the shrapnel in the explosion, making them even deadlier. Fear of more attacks has led to increased security at shrines, churches, temples and mosques across the multiethnic country of 21 million off the southern coast of India. Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith told reporters Friday that church officials had seen a leaked security document describing Roman Catholic churches and other denominations as a major target. Ranjith, who is the archbishop of Colombo, asked the faithful across Sri Lanka to stay home for their own safety. ""We don't want repetitions,"" Ranjith said. It was an extraordinary request for a Catholic clergyman to make, as churches often remain a refuge. Giovanni Maria Vian, a church historian and emeritus editor of the Vatican newspaper, said he believed it was the first time the church had canceled Masses across a country for security reasons. In Galle Face, a normally crowded ocean side park in Colombo near some of the hotels that were bombed, only a few people could be seen Saturday. Kiosks were closed, and traffic was lighter than usual, with security officials blocking streets and checking vehicles at barricades. Yashwant Kumar Singh, 23, a worker from India, said he wants to go back to his homeland because he fears another attack. ""If it only happened on one day, then that wouldn't have been so difficult, but bombs are going off here every day. That is why there is an atmosphere of fear. We are feeling very scared."" Business was also being hurt. ""All of Colombo city is too empty,"" said Diluka Gayashan, standing outside the juice bar where he works. ""That's the problem. And now the government is enforcing a curfew from 10 at night until early in the morning, 4 or 5. It's not good.""

The man, whose name was not released, fled in a car and called 911 shortly afterward to say he was involved in the Poway, San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit told reporters.
When an officer reached the man on a roadway, ""the suspect pulled over, jumped out of his car with his hands up and was immediately taken into custody,"" Nisleit said. The officer found an AR-type rifle in the front passenger seat. San Diego County Sheriff William Gore said at a news conference that he had no details on motive. Authorities say they were reviewing copies of his social media posts. There was no known threat after the man was detained, but authorities boosted patrols at places of worship as a precaution, Nisleit said. The shooting came exactly six months since a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue killed 11 people in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. An off-duty Border Patrol agent inside the synagogue in the city of Poway, just over 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of San Diego, opened fire as the shooter fled but didn't hit him, Gore said. Minoo Anvari told CNN that she's a member of Chabad of Poway and her husband was inside during the shooting. She said he called to tell her the shooter was shouting and cursing and she called the shooting ""unbelievable"" in a peaceful and tight-knit community. ""We are strong, we are united, they can't break us,"" she said. Four people were admitted to Palomar Health Medical Center Hospital, spokesman Derryl Acosta said. The Authorities said a girl and two men were wounded. Passover began on April 19 and was ending Saturday. In Pittsburgh, a truck driver who authorities say expressed hatred of Jews has been charged in the Oct. 27 rampage at the Tree of Life synagogue. He's pleaded not guilty."

San Diego police say the suspect called 911 and later surrendered to police. The unidentified man said he was responsible for the synagogue shooting.
Witnesses said they were attending services marking the end of Passover when a gunman shouting obscenities entered the synagogue and started shooting a semi-automatic weapon.
Poway Mayor Steve Vaus told CNN that the “shooter was engaged by people in the congregation and those brave people certainly prevented this from being a much worse tragedy.""
Four shooting victims were taken to Palomar Medical Center Poway and one of them, an older woman reportedly died there. Hospital officials said three victims were in stable condition.
Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein was among the injured. Shot in the hand but undeterred, Goldstein proceeded to deliver his sermon, telling the Jewish Orthodox congregants to “remain strong. “
Mayor Vaus told CNN he considered the attack a hate crime ""because of statements that were made when the shooter entered.""
Police are examining a letter and the suspect’s social media posts to determine a motive for the attack.
President Trump expressed sympathy for the victims and tweeted, “Thoughts and prayers to all of those affected by the shooting at the Synagogue in Poway, California. God bless you all. Suspect apprehended. Law enforcement did outstanding job. Thank you. “
Vice President Mike Pence also sent out his own tweet saying, “We condemn in the strongest terms the evil & cowardly Poway today as Jewish families celebrated Passover. No one should be in fear in a house of worship. Antisemitism isn’t just wrong - it’s evil. “

Mystery Disease ID'd as 'Urgent Threat' by CDC | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/mystery-disease-idd-as-urgent-threat-by-cdc,"A mystery disease that's often hard to detect is now being labeled an ""urgent threat"" by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fungus ""candida auris"" hit several countries around the world over the last five years and was recently found in New York, New Jersey and Illinois.
According to the CDC, it is ""multidrug-resistant"" and called a ""mystery"" because it is difficult to identify with standard lab tests. The results have been damaging as it has spread throughout several healthcare facilities without medical officials being aware.
The New York Times reports an elderly man admitted into a Brooklyn hospital last year for an abdominal surgery was found to have the new deadly germ after a blood test was taken. Doctors immediately isolated him in the intensive care unit, but the germ had already spread across the room. The hospital required special cleaning equipment and had to remove some of the ceiling and floor tiles.
""Everything was positive — the walls, the bed, the doors, the curtains, the phones, the sink, the whiteboard, the poles, the pump,"" said Dr. Scott Lorin, president of the Brooklyn branch of Mount Sinai Hospital. ""The mattress, the bed rails, the canister holes, the window shades, the ceiling, everything in the room was positive.""
There weren't any anti-fungal medicines able to stop it. As a result, just like many others who contract the illness it causes, the man died within 90 days.
The CDC reports 587 cases of people having C. auris, with 309 in New York, 104 in New Jersey and 144 in Illinois. In Chicago, some nursing homes have indicated at least 50 percent of their residents have tested positive for the virus.
Researchers have identified certain fungi and bacteria that are morphing to defend themselves against modern medicines.
""It's an enormous problem,"" said Matthew Fisher, a professor of fungal epidemiology at Imperial College London. ""We depend on being able to treat those patients with antifungals.""
The symptoms include fever, aches, and fatigue. However, if the person's immune system is weak, these types of infection often lead to death. Resistant germs called ""superbugs"" have been known to be most deadly to people with weak immune systems such as newborns, elderly, smokers, diabetics and people with autoimmune disorders who utilize steroids that limit their body's defenses.
Unless new, more effective medicines are found, the risk of more infections will drastically increase. The Times reports one study which predicts 10 million people could die worldwide of all such infections in 2050 if scientists are not able to combat the increase of drug resistance.
Some scientists have identified evidence that the massive use of fungicides on crops has been a huge contributor to the increase in drug-resistant fungi infecting humans.

“I remember trying to push his face towards the gas, where the gas was released. And I turned the gas on.”
Casey was a mere 8 years old, when he decided to kill his father using a portable gas heater.
“My mom walked in on it. It freaked her out. She said, ‘What’s going on?’ And I remember turning to her and telling her, ‘Just leave it alone, I’ll take the blame.’ My hope was that he would fall asleep and never wake up,” said Casey.
His dad was a violent, abusive alcoholic.
“He would start literally beating my mom right in front of me. I recall seeing her in a closet with, in her own blood, and there’s nothing you can do.”
“I remember in one occasion him grabbing me by the shoulders, bringing me close to him. And he says to me, ‘Don't ever call me your Dad. Don't ever call me Dad.’ And then I remember just feeling a sense of emptiness. You feel worthless. You feel like ‘Why are you even here?’ I became angry. I became very angry.”
Casey would find purpose in a south-central L.A. gang. He easily became violent, stabbing his first victim at just 11 years old.
He said, “What made it so easy for me to stab somebody is that I put the face of my father on every single one of my victims.”
More victims would follow, as did a lengthy rap sheet. He rose up in the gang world, feared and hunted by rival gangs. At 16, Casey was sentenced to 12 years in a juvenile correction facility for 2nd degree murder and 52 counts of armed robbery.
He ruled the gang infested prison, until he attacked another inmate.
Casey said, “I strangled him almost to death.”
That landed him in solitary confinement at new Folsom State Penitentiary. One day, a Christian woman, Frances, came by to invite him to a monthly Bible study.
“You're crazy. What are you talking about? Bible study?"" said Casey. “And I’m going, ‘She’s nuts. She doesn't know who she's talking to.’ And she says, ‘You know, I'm going to be praying for you, and I'm putting you on my prayer hit list.’ She uses that word. I said, ‘You can do whatever you want, that's fine.’ I said, ‘But I'm letting you know right off the bat, I'm not interested in any of your Bible study or whatever religious thing you’re in.’”
Every month for a year, she came by and Casey declined. But each time, her response was the same.
Casey said, “She would always say to me ‘I'm praying for you and Jesus is going to use you.’""
In his second year of solitary he was awake, lying in his bunk. . .
“When all of a sudden I started seeing what looks like a movie reel. I'm seeing footage that only I know from me growing up. And it starts to go into some details from like the first thing that I ever stole from a 7-Eleven to cars that I stole. To the first stabbing that I partook of,” Casey said.
Then a different scene appeared.
He said, “And I could see this man carrying this cross. And I saw the nails on his hands and his feet.”
The man addressed Casey by a name.
“My birth name’s Darwin. He says, ‘Darwin, I did this for you.’ And I could hear in my cell, audibly, his breath leaving him,” said Casey.
“I hit the center of that floor, and wept. Weeping uncontrollably. And telling God ‘I'm so sorry for stabbing this person and stabbing this person over here. I didn't know what I was doing.’ I didn't know what was happening, but I knew that something had happened here, there was this freedom that I had never experience in my life.”
Casey says Jesus told him to talk to the prison chaplain.
“He said, ‘What happened in the cell is what happened in the cell. God has already forgiven you. This is why you feel so free.’”
He prayed with the chaplain to accept Christ.
Casey said, “It was God dealing with me on a one on one basis, removing that desire of wanting to hurt people. It just went away supernaturally.”
But Casey’s faith would be tested. Now 18, he was released from solitary and a hit was placed on his head for becoming a Christian and leaving the gang. One day, an inmate came to his cell with a knife.
“And he says ‘I can’t do it. I can’t do this to you.’ He says, ‘But whatever you're doing, I'll roll with you.’ And he became the first person I led to the Lord was a guy that was assigned to do the hit.”
The hit was removed and for the remaining five years of his sentence, Casey would lead over 200 inmates to Christ. At age 25, Casey was released.
In time, he forgave his dad, who eventually gave his life to Christ as well. Today, Casey owns a successful sign business and lives in L.A. with his family.
“Coming to Christ was, is, and will always be the best decision that any man could ever make. He is so relentless in His pursuit of us. You might not notice it right away. But God is after the sinner. His favor and His mercy and His grace, it just floors you.” "

“Today we mourn with those directly impacted by today’s tragic synagogue shooting at the Chabad of Poway. Poway is a community close to Turning Point and Shadow Mountain Community Church. Our prayers are with the victims and their families and for all the Jewish people throughout this city, this country, and the world. The Christian community stands firmly and compassionately behind our Jewish brothers and sisters, and we condemn hatred against anyone, especially those with their heads bowed in prayer, as those in Poway were, celebrating the last day of Passover. May God be close to those who have suffered this terrible tragedy.
The Congregation Chabad synagogue shooting was the second mass shooting to occur at a U.S. synagogue within the past six months. Eleven people were killed and seven injured in a mass shooting at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue October 27 th, exactly six months prior to the Poway shooting. "

BALTIMORE (AP) - A gunman fired indiscriminately into a crowd that had gathered for Sunday cookouts on a Baltimore street, wounding seven people including one of them fatally, the city's police commissioner said. Authorities said the gunfire broke out shortly after 5 p.m. on a block in the city's western district lined with brick row homes. Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said a black male approached a crowd on foot and began firing in what he called ""a very tragic, very cowardly shooting."" Speaking at the scene afterward, Harrison said the shooting appeared to be ""extremely targeted"" but he did not immediately elaborate on a possible motive. The shooting comes roughly six weeks after Harrison's swearing-in last month as Baltimore police commissioner, when he promised to make the city safer and lead the department through sweeping reforms required by a federal consent decree. It's a daunting task in one of the country's poorest major cities where there were more than 300 homicides in each of the past two years. Harrison is the city's 14th police leader since the mid-1990s. The commissioner said there were two cookouts occurring on opposite sides of the street Sunday, and that shell casings were found in two different locations in the area, indicating that there may have been a second gunman, or someone firing back at the first shooter, who fled on foot. It was unclear whether the cookouts were related, Harrison said. One man who was shot collapsed behind a Baptist church nearby and was pronounced dead at the scene. Harrison said the six other victims were taken to hospitals, but he didn't release their names and had no immediate information on their conditions. ""It wasn't anything dealing with the church. I want to make that very clear,"" acting mayor Jack Young said. Harrison and Young urged members of the public to help investigators with any information as to a suspect or a motive. ""Someone knows something,"" Young said. ""These things ... they don't happen by happenstance. People know who's doing these shootings."" The Baltimore Sun reported that bullet casings were found scattered on the ground near grills, and a table still had items on it that appeared to be left from a cookout. Police officers could be seen after the shooting placing small orange evidence markers on the ground, just feet from a barber shop. Meanwhile, authorities said they would be seeking to interview witnesses who were present during the shooting. Baltimore has been plagued by drug-fueled violence for decades and it has long been considered one of the nation's most violent big cities. But the corrosive impact of the drug trade and a sea of illegal guns continue to spawn a depressing recurrence of tit-for-tat turf wars and retaliatory attacks in swaths of the city, particularly in the deeply disenfranchised areas of West Baltimore. While city leaders continue a perennial quest to remake the city in the eyes of potential investors and visitors, Baltimore has been in the throes of a worrying increase of violent crime since 2015, when the homicide rate spiked after the city's worst rioting in decades following the death of young black man in police custody.

Outraged Jews and non-Jews alike are saying ""too little too late"" after The New York Times apologized Sunday for publishing a blatantly anti-Semitic cartoon in its international edition.
""We are deeply sorry for the publication of an anti-Semitic political cartoon last Thursday in the print edition of The New York Times that circulates outside of the United States, and we are committed to making sure nothing like this happens again,"" the NYT opinion section tweeted Sunday.

The cartoon depicted a blind President Donald Trump being led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the form of a guide dog. Trump is wearing a black yarmulke and a blue Star of David is hanging from Netanyahu's leash. Shame on you New York Times!

The matter remains under review, and we are evaluating our internal processes and training. We anticipate significant changes,"" the paper continued.
Many were quick to reject The New York Times ' apology.
""Apology unaccepted, @nytimes,"" wrote political activist Andrew Pollack. ""This anti-Semitic cartoon should've been caught long before it was published. This is also the same newspaper who believes President Trump is spreading hate when, in reality, it's them! #FixIt""
Times columnist Bret Stephens issued a strong rebuke to his employer in an op-ed published Sunday evening .
""The Times wasn't explaining anti-Semitism. It was purveying it,"" Stephens wrote. ""It did so in the form of a cartoon""
""Here was an image that, in another age, might have been published in the pages of Der Stürmer,"" Stephens added. ""The Jew in the form of a dog. The small but wily Jew leading the dumb and trusting American. The hated Trump being Judaized with a skullcap. The nominal servant acting as the true master.

""The image also had an obvious political message: Namely, that in the current administration, the United States follows wherever Israel wants to go,"" Stephens said.
The Times released an initial statement that did not include an apology on Saturday, which drew even more backlash.
""The image was offensive, and it was an error of judgment to publish it. It was provided by The New York Times News Service and Syndicate, which has since deleted it,"" the statement said.
Israeli cartoonist Shay Charka mocked the iconic newspaper in a cartoon on Sunday that depicted the newspaper as a blind person being led by a dog labeled ""The Protocols',"" a referenced to an anti-Semitic book that claims Jews are trying to take over the world.

A lone gunman entered the Chabad of Poway Synagogue in San Diego Saturday and opened fire on Jews celebrating the last day of Passover. He killed one woman and wounded several others.
For one family, this was not their first encounter with terrorism. The Dahan family left their neighborhood on Israel's Gaza border years ago in hopes of finding a safer life in America. But this time, instead of rockets raining down, it was bullets.
The Dahan family's eight-year-old daughter Noya and her uncle Almog Peretz were injured in Saturday's terror attack.
CNN reports that Noya was injured by shrapnel. Her uncle, who was visiting from Israel, was shot in the leg while trying to shield her. She was treated at a nearby hospital and released Sunday.
""We're shocked,"" Noya's dad, Israel Dahan, told CNN on Sunday.
The Dahan family thought they were safe after leaving Israel eight years ago. They lived in Sderot, a community near Israel's southern border that faces daily threats of Hamas rockets.
""(We were) under the impression that everything is good here. Today we noticed this is not even close to be regular life,"" Dahan said.
One of the congregants told Fox News how Peretz saved not only his niece, but several other children.
""He grabbed all the kids in his hands and was just running towards the exit [when] he saw another kid over there,"" Danny Almon said. ""He grabbed him and started running and [that's when] the shooter shot him in the leg. He didn't care. He kept on running with the kids.""
Almog Peretz told Israel's Channel 12 that he learned how to run away from terror by running away from Hamas rockets in his hometown of Sderot.
""I was wounded while I was running with the children,"" Peretz said. ""I had picked up a girl and [the shooter] aimed his weapons at me. The murderer was only five or 10 meters from me, not more.""
Unfortunately, this isn't even the first time the family has experienced anti-Semitism in America. Five years ago, someone spray-painted a swastika on their home.
Israeli president Reuven Rivlin said the shooting attack in California is another painful reminder that anti-Semitism and hatred of Jews is still thriving.
""We are again telling the world, there's no community that can say it is clean from anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism destroys every good part, anti-Semitism, racism, the hatred of others and religious war, when we are all praying to God, who is one God to us all, creator of the universe and man,"" Rivlin said.
The attack happened a few days before Israel pauses to observe Holocaust Remembrance Day from Wednesday evening to Thursday evening.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the international community isn't doing enough to combat anti-Semitism. The international community must step up the struggle against antisemitism.

The High Cost of Stubbornness | CBN.com,www1.cbn.com,,04-26-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/devotions/the-high-cost-of-stubbornness,"The High Cost of Stubbornness Related Content Tim Bishop
“Do you mind if I share some wisdom from the Bible about ?”
I often ask a question like that to people in despair when I chat with them as a coach on an Internet helpline. The word “cutting” commonly fills the blank. Any of us would do well to use that query on ourselves when we encounter a problem. It’s a profound question because it can reveal a person’s state of readiness for a life-changing solution.
People are dealing with weighty issues these days. Whether they have brought their problems on themselves or become victims of the sin of other people, they must find their own way out.
So, I tactfully explore whether we can invite God into our discussion, to see what the Bible has to say about their issue and how God Himself can factor into their solution. Astonishingly, some of them who are already on the brink of ending their lives remain dug in and refuse permission. That rejection may suggest bad experiences with unyielding parents, overzealous peers, or church hypocrisy. Other times, society has already foisted upon them a negative perception of God and the Bible. Some, I learn, fear that they will need to relinquish an addictive sin – the very thing that keeps them in bondage.
Perhaps deep inside, the people in this latter group already know they have wandered from what is right, but they haven’t connected it to their issues. To consider God would make them face something they aren’t willing to change. If we can deny God’s existence or His lordship, then we are accountable to no one but ourselves, so the thinking goes. People want to do their own thing. Submitting to authority is as unpopular now as it was in yesteryear.
Jesus met the same unwillingness to confront the truth. Members of a sect, the Sadducees, were more into hairsplitting than discovering who Jesus was. They tried to trap Him with trick questions, but He silenced them with wisdom and authority, the likes of which they’d never experienced. He saw through them and exposed them:
Then, with the crowds listening, he turned to his disciples and said, “Beware of these experts in religion, for they love to parade in dignified robes and to be bowed to by the people as they walk along the street. And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and at religious festivals! But even while they are praying long prayers with great outward piety, they are planning schemes to cheat widows out of their property. Therefore God’s heaviest sentence awaits these men” Luke 20:45-47 (TLB).
The Sadducees had no interest in Jesus because He threatened their position within the culture. Exploring Him further would have meant changing their ways and giving up some power.
The sound of God’s voice threatens people who are unwilling to submit to Him. Even though His Word would shine light into their darkness and His Spirit’s transformative power would unshackle them, some people aren’t ready to surrender and leave their “discomfort zone” behind. Their stubbornness always shows they have yet to understand God’s love, forgiveness and power. At high cost, evil grips them.
One day, the Bible says, “every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father” (Philippians 2:11 TLB). May the Holy Spirit soften hardened hearts and expose the enemy’s deceptions before it is too late.

US National Security Adviser John Bolton says the US did not pay North Korea for the return of college student Otto Warmbier.
Warmbier was part of a tour group that was visiting North Korea in January 2016. The regime arrested him and convicted him on charges of trying to steal a propaganda poster during that trip.
Imprisoned by North Korea for more than a year, Warmbier suffered harsh treatment that put him in a coma. His comatose body was returned home to the US in 2017 where he died a few days later.
During his release, the cruel communist regime reportedly sent the US a bill for $2 million for Warmbier's medical treatment.
The Associated Press reports that a former US official says a US envoy sent to retrieve Warmbier signed an agreement to pay the $2 million on Trump's instructions.
President Trump denies the US paid any money for the release of the college student, calling it ""a fake news report.""
""Did North Korea demand money for the release of Otto Warmbier?"" Fox News' Chris Wallace asked Bolton. ""Did the US official who was there to get him out of the country, Joseph Yun, did he sign a document pledging the money in order to get him out?""
Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Bolton says it happened before he joined the Trump administration, but he's been informed that the US did sign a pledge to pay the money to get Warmbier out.
""Did the US pay any money to North Korea, however it was disguised, after Warmbier was released?"" Wallace asked.
Bolton replied, ""Absolutely not, and I think that's the key point.""
Bolton said the administration has negotiated the release of more than 20 Americans around the world without paying any ransom.
Bolton said sometimes when people leave government service, their recollection of what happened may be different than the reality, implying that the official who told AP about the promise to North Korea may not have been accurate.

WASHINGTON – Southern California is grieving after this weekend's deadly shooting at a synagogue near San Diego. On Sunday night, hundreds gathered for a vigil where the rabbi described the attack and the heroism of his congregants.
""Unfathomable,"" said Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein. ""I faced death face to face.""
Goldstein believes the shooting would have been much worse had it not been for a ""miracle"" – the shooter's gun jammed. The rabbi also credits members of his congregation at Chabad of Poway for risking their lives to stop him.
The youngest victim was eight-year-old Noya Duhan who's family recently moved from southern Israel where her village was subject to rocket attacks from Gaza.
The one fatality in the shooting was 60-year-old Laurie Kaye . Friends say she stepped in front of the rabbi to stop the accused gunman, identified as 19-year-old John T. Earnest.
""He dropped his weapon and he ran out and I chased him out of the sanctuary,"" described Oscar Stewart, an off-duty border patrol agent who opened fire as Earnest drove away.
Police eventually arrested Earnest about a mile from the synagogue.
In an open letter posted online under Earnest's same name, he said he wanted to kill Jews and praised the gunmen accused in both the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting and recent mosque attacks in New Zealand. Police say Earnest was also being investigated in connection to an arson attack at a California mosque.
President Trump called Rabbi Goldstein to offer his condolences and also condemned the shooting at a weekend rally in Wisconsin.
""We forcefully condemn the evil of anti-Semitism and hate which must be defeated,"" said Trump.
With anti-Semitism on the rise in America and worldwide, this weekend the World Jewish Congress called out the New York Times for publishing a cartoon in its international edition showing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leading a blind President Trump.
""The @nytimes has crossed a red line today by publishing a cartoon infused with anti-Semitic tropes,"" tweeted the World Jewish Congress.
Following fierce backlash, the New York Times retracted the cartoon and issued an apology.
""It's like a contagious disease that always under the surface and sometimes it spurs up into epidemic proportions and then sometimes it recedes,"" Michael Rydelnik, an expert on anti-Semitism at the Moody Bible Institute, told CBN News about anti-Semitism.
Earnest has been charged with murder and will also likely face federal hate crime charges.

"'War Footing': Church Canceled Indefinitely, Catholic Leaders in Sri Lanka Dissatisfied With Government Response",www1.cbn.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/war-footing-church-canceled-indefinitely-catholic-leaders-in-sri-lanka-dissatisfied-with-government-response,"'War Footing': Church Canceled Indefinitely, Catholic Leaders in Sri Lanka Dissatisfied With Government Response 04-29-2019 Christian Ellis Sri Lanka Catholic Memorial (Photo: Screen Capture)
Catholic church leaders in Sri Lanka say they aren't satisfied with how the government has handled the investigation following the Easter Sunday attacks that left over 250 people dead.
In an interview with reporters, Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Ranjith shared criticism of the government's efforts, warning citizens may take the law in their own hands if not handled properly. ""All the security forces should be involved and function as if on war footing,"" Ranjith told reporters according to AP .
""I want to state that we may not be able to keep people under control in the absence of a stronger security program,"" he added. ""We can't forever give them false promises and keep them calm.""
He went on to encourage the government ""to implement a proper program in order that the people don't take the law into their own hands.""
Since the initial attacks, more events have happened which have brought even greater fear to the Sri Lanka citizens. Over the weekend, Islamic terrorists, in response to a raid by Sri Lankan security forces, opened fire and set off explosives. The attack left 15 people dead, including six children.
""Their only intention is to kill as many as possible,"" an investigator said. ""That is different than the Tamil Tigers. They wanted to control land. These people want to kill as many as possible.""
The Tamil Tigers was a separatist group the government defeated in 2009 after a 26-year civil war.
Citizens have feared living out their daily lives as the government warns more militants remain on the loose. The Catholic church has suspended mass indefinitely and Muslim women are now required to stop wearing veils in public.
In a vigil celebrating the memory of the victims, and bringing hope to the broken nation, the archbishop led prayers from his home on Sunday. The vigil was televised across the nation and the world.
""This is a time our hearts are tested by the great destruction that took place last Sunday,"" Ranjith said . ""This is a time questions such as, 'Does God truly love us, does he have compassion toward us?' can arise in human hearts.""
All schools are closed till May 6, but Catholic schools may stay closed even longer if the government doesn't do enough to protect the church from Islamic extremists."

In honor of its annual diversity conference, Harvard University's faculty of arts & sciences invited an anti-Christian activist to speak at its ""Decade of Dialogue"" event. Tim Wise, known for his hatred of Christians, pushed the racial divide and condemned Christian belief in his remarks.
In an attempt to garner liberal support, Wise spoke of the nation needing to give reparations for slavery and criticizing President Trump as ""always"" being a racist. He stated the 2016 election showed that ""this country is more sexist and more racist than I realized.""
He went further to condemn the belief that people who put in the effort can be successful.
""Genesis 1:1 in the bible of Americanism"" is the idea that ""anybody can make it in America if you are just willing to work hard,"" he said. ""We all know this is not true.""
His comments are not new as he has been known for making outrageous and denigrating comments regarding Christians.

Study Confirms Obesity Links to Disease and Early Death,www1.cbn.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/study-confirms-obesity-links-to-disease-and-early-death,"Study Confirms Obesity Links to Disease and Early Death 04-29-2019 CBN News
A new study confirms obesity increases the risk of disease and early death.
The study looked at 2.8 million adults in the UK over a period of 18 years. It found that obese people are more likely to have heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat.
Obesity is defined as a body mass of 30 or more – or 30 pounds or more overweight.
The study found people with a Body Mass Index of 30 to 35 have a 70% higher risk of heart failure. And those with a BMI of 30 to 35 are five times more likely to get Type 2 Diabetes.
The study, funded by Novo Nordisk in Denmark, also found that the more overweight a person is, the higher the likelihood of getting a disease.
""With the number of people living with obesity almost tripling worldwide over the past 30 years (105 million people in 1975 to 650 million in 2016), our findings have serious implications for public health,"" said study author Christiane Haase in a report on ITV.com."

(Image credit: CBN News)
Oliver North has announced that he will not serve a second term as president of the National Rifle Association. He made it clear that he was forced out of the leadership of the organization, and there are claims that it's because he tried to oust longtime NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre.
""Please know I hoped to be with you today as NRA president endorsed for reelection. I'm now informed that will not happen,"" North said in a statement that was read by Richard Childress, the NRA's first vice president, to members at the group's annual convention Saturday.
In his own letter to the NRA board, LaPierre claimed North tried to pressure him into resigning. He wrote: ""The exhortation was simple: Resign or there will be destructive allegations made against me and the NRA.""
North had previously sent a letter to the board's executive committee raising questions about LaPierre's handling of finances and seeking to form a crisis committee to look into it.
The organization's board was scheduled to meet Monday to discuss the next steps forward as members said they want answers after North's allegations could endanger the group's nonprofit status, according to The Washington Times .
Meanwhile, the New York Attorney General announced Saturday that she is launching an investigation into the NRA's finances.
The Times reports Attorney General Letitia James has issued document preservation notices to the NRA and some affiliated entities as part of the investigation.
The NRA will ""fully cooperate"" with any inquiry into its finances, William A. Brewer III, a lawyer for the NRA, said in a statement."

On April 12, Landen Hoffman was thrown 40 feet off a railing by 24-year-old Emmanuel Aranda, who is now being charged with attempted murder.
Five-year-old Landen was in critical condition following the incident as he suffered from broken arms and legs, and doctors believed he had sustained severe head trauma. However, a recent MRI revealed he had no brain damage .
Now, Landen has improved from critical condition to alert and conscious, R. Stephen Tillitt, a family attorney said on Friday.
""All praise, glory, and honor to Jesus! He saved our son's life and is healing him in the most miraculous ways. We are so elated to let you know that our son is now alert and conscious and is no longer in critical condition!"" the family said in a statement read by Tillitt.
The family said they are now turning their focus on rehabilitation and they are believing for Landen to be released from the hospital in June.

He's back with a new book about what he calls our ""lost"" Declaration of Independence.
There is perhaps no more powerful sentence in human history than the first line of the Declaration of Independence, penned in 1776: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.""
Pat Robertson talks with Sen. Mike Lee about his new book, Our Lost Declaration , on Tuesday's 700 Club.
Today, though, many Americans don't understand or appreciate the Declaration's gravity. As a result, we've lost touch with much of what makes our country so special: the distinctly American belief in the dignity of every human soul.
In his new book, Our Lost Declaration: America's Fight Against Tyranny from King George to the Deep State , Sen. Lee shares new insights into the events that shaped the ideas in the Declaration of Independence and makes clear how many abuses of federal power we see today are happening because we've forgotten that our leaders in Washington, DC serve us, the American people, not the other way around."

The man said to be Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in the video also claimed the Easter Day bombings in Sri Lanka which killed over 250 people were “part of the revenge” that awaits the West.
The video released Monday by a media outlet run by the extremists, Al-Furqan, shows al-Baghdadi with a bushy grey and red beard, wearing a black robe with a beige vest and seated on the floor with what appears to be an AK47 rifle propped up next to him. He is speaking with three men seated opposite him whose faces were covered and blotted out.
It is his first video appearance since he delivered a sermon at the al-Nuri mosque in the Iraqi city of Mosul in 2014. In that video, he appeared as a black-robed figure with a trimmed black beard to deliver a sermon from the pulpit of the mosque in which he urged Muslims around the world to swear allegiance to the caliphate and obey him as its leader.
Since then, he has only released audio messages through the group’s media outlets.
In the video released Monday, al-Baghdadi acknowledged that IS lost the war in the eastern Syrian village of Baghouz, the group’s last sliver of territory, which was captured last month by the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. The fall of Baghouz marked the militants’ territorial defeat and the end of their self-declared Islamic caliphate over parts of Syria and Iraq.
Al-Baghdadi said that the battle for Baghouz demonstrated the “barbarism and brutality” of the West and the “courage, steadfastness and resilience of the nation of Islam.”
“This steadfastness shocked the hearts of the Crusaders in what increased their rage,” he added.
Referring to the setbacks in battle, he said the “brothers” of the many fallen fighters “will avenge that, as they will not forget as long as they have blood in their veins, and there will be a battle after this one.”
Al-Baghdadi called specifically on his followers to intensify attacks on France.
He made repeated references to current events, including Benjamin Netanyahu, winning the elections in Israel and the fall of longtime dictators Abdelaziz Bouteflika and Omar al-Bashir in Algeria and Sudan.
Most significantly, he praised the recent attacks in Sri Lanka which he said have “pleased the hearts of Muslims,” and said it is “part of the revenge that awaits the Crusaders and their followers.”
The group has claimed responsibility for the suicide attacks on churches and hotels in Sri Lanka, and investigators are looking into the extent of the extremist group’s involvement with the local radicalized Muslims who carried out the suicide bombings.
It is unclear when or where the video was filmed. Al-Baghdadi appeared to be in good health, although he spoke slowly and sometimes haltingly in the video.
With a $25 million U.S. bounty on his head, al-Baghdadi is the world’s most wanted man, responsible for steering his chillingly violent organization into mass slaughter of opponents and directing and inspiring terror attacks across continents and in the heart of Europe.
Despite numerous claims about his death in the past few years, al-Baghdadi’s whereabouts remain a mystery. Many of his top aides have been killed, mostly in U.S.-led coalition airstrikes. He is among the few senior IS commanders still at large after two years of steady battlefield losses that saw the self-styled “caliphate” shrink from an area the size of Britain to a tiny speck in the Euphrates River valley.
The video appeared to be aimed at boosting the morale. He bragged his group carried out 92 attacks in eight countries to avenge the loss of territory in Syria, citing Sri Lanka, Libya, and Saudi Arabia, without offering evidence for his claim.
Although largely seen as a symbolic figurehead of the global terror network, al-Baghdadi’s capture would be a coveted prize for the various players across both Syria and Iraq.
But so far, he has eluded the Americans, Russians, Syrians, Iraqis, and Kurds.
“Our battle today is a war of attrition to harm the enemy, and they should know that jihad will continue until doomsday,” al-Baghdadi said.

"'War Footing': Church Canceled Indefinitely, Catholic Leaders in Sri Lanka Dissatisfied With Government Response",www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/war-footing-church-canceled-indefinitely-catholic-leaders-in-sri-lanka-dissatisfied-with-government-response,"Catholic church leaders in Sri Lanka say they aren't satisfied with how the government has handled the investigation following the Easter Sunday attacks that left over 250 people dead.
In an interview with reporters, Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Ranjith shared criticism of the government's efforts, warning citizens may take the law in their own hands if not handled properly. ""All the security forces should be involved and function as if on war footing,"" Ranjith told reporters according to AP .
""I want to state that we may not be able to keep people under control in the absence of a stronger security program,"" he added. ""We can't forever give them false promises and keep them calm.""
He went on to encourage the government ""to implement a proper program in order that the people don't take the law into their own hands.""
Since the initial attacks, more events have happened which have brought even greater fear to the Sri Lanka citizens. Over the weekend, Islamic terrorists, in response to a raid by Sri Lankan security forces, opened fire and set off explosives. The attack left 15 people dead, including six children.
""Their only intention is to kill as many as possible,"" an investigator said. ""That is different than the Tamil Tigers. They wanted to control land. These people want to kill as many as possible.""
The Tamil Tigers was a separatist group the government defeated in 2009 after a 26-year civil war.
Citizens have feared living out their daily lives as the government warns more militants remain on the loose. The Catholic church has suspended mass indefinitely and Muslim women are now required to stop wearing veils in public.
In a vigil celebrating the memory of the victims, and bringing hope to the broken nation, the archbishop led prayers from his home on Sunday. The vigil was televised across the nation and the world.
""This is a time our hearts are tested by the great destruction that took place last Sunday,"" Ranjith said . ""This is a time questions such as, 'Does God truly love us, does he have compassion toward us?' can arise in human hearts.""
All schools are closed till May 6, but Catholic schools may stay closed even longer if the government doesn't do enough to protect the church from Islamic extremists."

Just about every Christian denomination in every country and culture has a different profile of Jesus. If you do an internet image search for ""Jesus,"" you will likely find a Hispanic Jesus, an African Jesus, and a Caucasian Jesus. And if you did an image search for ""baby Jesus"" online, you'd find a Chinese mother and child, a European mother and child, a Native American mother and child, and many others.
We need to remember that we were created in His image instead of trying to create Him in our image. I don't think Jesus would recognize Himself in any of these baby pictures!
So how will He be recognized? For that matter, how will we recognize the two witnesses from the Antichrist and the false prophet when they are battling it out? These are very important considerations, especially if we don't want to be deceived.
Replacement theology in the Christian view of the Messiah has taken us far off target, and it affects our end-times theology. The common view of the church replacing Israel has caused huge consequences. Many Jews have a hard time believing in a Jewish Messiah that has replaced them. Many other Jews realize the truth that replacement theology is wrong and that the Messiah is still in a covenant relationship with them, as they have come to the understanding of wonderful saving grace.
Being one degree off doesn't seem like a big deal, but after 2,000 miles, it sure does. Well, it is the same way with the Bible. If we are off by one degree in our theology, 2,000 years later we will be way off!
Anti-Semitism in the Church
When Yeshua died on the cross, the sign above Him said ""King of the Jews."" Is He still King of the Jews, or has He become King of Christianity?
The Jews are fine with that. They are happy that Gentiles have a king as long as we don't try to make Him their king. They do not believe in a Christian king but want a Jewish king from the tribe of Judah who keeps God's Word according to what He told Moses.
So now we have to ask ourselves, Are there really two different Messiahs—a Jewish one and a Christian one? Think about this for a moment. All the apostles were Jewish. To them ""pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises; whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen"" (Romans 9:4–5, emphasis added) .
Let's look at another example. Did you know I could show you a verse in your Bible where the apostle John was kicked out of the church? Not only was he kicked out but all the other Jews as well. Even any Gentiles who wanted the Jews to stay in the assembly were kicked out of the ""church.""
It's in every Bible, and it's always overlooked. The Jews were being scattered and persecuted, and the Gentiles who were coming to faith were taking over the assemblies.
In the third epistle of John, he stated that he ""wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not"" (v. 9). He goes on to say that Diotrephes does not accept the brethren (referring to the other Jews) and that he forbids other people to accept them and kicks anyone who does out of the church!
It is incredible how quickly anti-Semitism took over. I bring out all of this because we must realize that having a bias can and will affect our end-time perspective.

A New Way to Church: Justin Bieber's Pastor Launches App to Take Church Global,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/april/a-new-way-to-church-justin-biebers-pastor-launches-app-to-take-church-global,"He's one of the men who helped introduce Justin Bieber to Jesus Christ. Now Pastor Judah Smith is working on the rest of the world, bringing church to your smart phone and tablet in a new way.
Smith and his wife Chelsea, who are lead pastors of Churchome with locations in Seattle and Los Angeles, have launched an app that brings church to the palm of your hand, including sermons, a virtual lobby, a ""Daily Spark"" inspiration, prayer and even community groups.
The Chuchome Global App can be downloaded from the church's website .
Fox News reports Smith said he decided to launch the app after he noticed a growing number of his members said they no longer go to a physical church building. So the pastor duo decided to bring the church to them right on their phone whenever they want.
""We're trying to take church to the palm of your hand,"" Smith said. ""Wherever you go, Churchome is with you.""
Churchome, previously called City Church, was founded by Smith's father in 1992. Smith himself has been preaching for 25 years. He says being able to go to church on your phone, doesn't signal the end of physical church buildings.
""Technology has changed the world and we believe that technology is not a bad thing. It's like money. It's what you do with it. It could be good or evil, and we believe that we have an opportunity,"" he said.

Besides Bieber, the church's celebrity members include pro-golfer Bubba Watson and Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson.
""Russ and I get to spend a lot of time together during the season as I get to do the chaplaincy for the Seattle Seahawks,"" Smith told Fox News.
Smith noted he's really proud of Bieber, Watson, and Wilson whom he calls ""his brothers.""
""To see them share their faith, which is the most important part of their life for those three men, the platform that God has given them has been something that has been so encouraging to me,"" he said.
Bieber and Smith have been friends for several years, after Bieber's mother Pattie Mallette introduced them. Smith says he has learned more from the singer than Bieber has learned from him.
""Watching Justin's journey, as he's grown up in view of the entire world and yet has owned his journey and his challenges and difficulties,"" Smith said. ""I think is an incredible example.""
""Justin Bieber has taught me far more than I could ever teach him about what it means to grow and walk in humility and be someone who really wants to follow Jesus,"" he added.

'Mice Preferred Sugar to Cocaine': Study Confirms Obesity Links to Disease and Early Death,www.cbn.com,CBN News,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/mice-preferred-sugar-to-cocaine-study-confirms-obesity-links-to-disease-and-early-death,"A new study confirms obesity increases the risk of disease and early death.
The study looked at 2.8 million adults in the UK over a period of 18 years. It found that obese people are more likely to have heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat.
Obesity is defined as a body mass of 30 or more – or 30 pounds or more overweight.
The study found people with a Body Mass Index of 30 to 35 have a 70% higher risk of heart failure. And those with a BMI of 30 to 35 are five times more likely to get Type 2 Diabetes.
The study, funded by Novo Nordisk in Denmark, also found that the more overweight a person is, the higher the likelihood of getting a disease.
""With the number of people living with obesity almost tripling worldwide over the past 30 years (105 million people in 1975 to 650 million in 2016), our findings have serious implications for public health,"" said study author Christiane Haase in a report on ITV.com.
On Monday's 700 Club, CBN News Health Correspondent Lorie Johnson talked about ways to improve health and fight sugar cravings that contribute to the obesity crisis.
""They did studies on mice, and the mice preferred sugar to cocaine, that's how addictive it is,"" Johnson explained. ""It gets in your brain, and the dopamine receptors and the pleasure centers.""
""Just like other drugs, you have to go through a withdrawal period where you really want it for a certain period of time. But the good news is after three or four days, a week, two, three weeks tops, you stop craving it so much,"" she said. ""We need to replace the sugar and processed food with fiber.""

The Profound Pro-Life Response to Alyssa Milano's Abortion Promotion,www1.cbn.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/the-profound-pro-life-response-to-alyssa-milanos-abortion-promotion,"The Profound Pro-Life Response to Alyssa Milano's Abortion Promotion 04-29-2019 CBN News Credit: Associated Press
The response to actress Alyssa Milano's call for abortion stories to use on her podcast has been overwhelming, and probably not at all what Milano expected.
A few weeks ago, the ""Who's the Boss"" and ""Charmed"" actress and a pro-abortion advocate posted a tweet asking for women's abortion stories.
""If you'd like to share your personal abortion story on my podcast to help shine a light on the importance of bodily autonomy, please record story on your voice memo app and email it to below address. If you'd like to remain anonymous please say so in your email. #SorryNotSorry"","" Milano wrote.
The actress also re-tweeted a post from her ""Sorry Not Sorry"" podcast account below her original post which reads: ""Nearly one in four women in the United States will have an abortion by age 45. Do you want to share your story on #SorryNotSorry?""
Milano began aggressively speaking out about abortion in March, when Georgia's so-called ""heartbeat bill"" passed the state Senate. 70 of her fellow Hollywood actors and actresses voiced their support of Milano's protest.
However, Milano's tweet drew a variety of responses, especially from among pro-life women as well as men.
One Twitter user responded to the actress, writing: ""My mom was a single mother, unmarried, daughter of a Pentecostal preacher, with a rare blood disease and working in a low-wage factory job. She was encouraged to abort me told she & I would die. She chose life I'm now her caregiver. So there's mine.""

Another user who goes by the name of SuperCoop responded: ""My grandmother was going to abort my mom but changed her mind last minute. Thankfully that means my mom, my two brothers and myself, and my two children all got to be born #sorrynotsorry""
The user then added, ""Oops, forgot my three adorable nieces as well!""
Another woman posted a photo of her now-grown daughter, writing: """"#borntolivenotdie the baby I was told to abort…a miracle!"" #borntolivenotdie the baby I was told to abort...a miracle! https://t.co/MrayGoJZrw pic.twitter.com/DNzZtl5HJn

Another mother wrote about her story from 46 years ago.
""In late 1973 in San Francisco, my mother was told by 3 separate doctors at 3 different facilities to abort because she was 39 (ridiculous), Latina, and this would be her 6th. Was it racism? 'You don't have to tell your husband.' How many babies didn't make it in this situation?""
""She told them she could never kill her child. My mother, frightened by this harassment, stopped going to prenatal visits. I was born at SF General Hospital instead of her regular hospital,"" she added.
Another mother admitted going to an abortion clinic daily for more than a month but just couldn't go through with it.
""I went to an abortion clinic daily for over a month….. couldn't do it! Thank God I didn't because my beautiful daughter is one of my greatest gifts to the world! #IWasRaped #metoo #Infanticide,"" she wrote.
Other users told of their regret for the abortions they did have.
One user wrote, ""It's personal and the most difficult decision I ever made. I would never talk about my story to encourage abortion, I would discourage it, so obviously you wouldn't want to hear my story.""
Another user told of her abortion at the age of 23.
""I had an abortion at the age of 23. I missed out on what a precious gift I chose to give up. I'm thankful for God's grace and forgiveness and for raising my precious baby in heaven. I get to see my child when I get to heaven. What an amazing day that will be,"" she wrote.
Another user told of being raped in an abusive relationship.
""I was raped by a boyfriend while in an abusive relationship. I had an abortion because I was told by Planned Parenthood that it would be okay and I could live my life. I so regret that decision. I ended up on drugs and went down the wrong path. I am extremely pro-life now,"" the user wrote. I was raped by a boyfriend while in an abusive relationship.

BEIRUT (AP) — The shadowy leader of the Islamic State group claimed to appear for the first time in five years in a video released by the extremist group’s propaganda arm on Monday, acknowledging defeat in the group’s last stronghold in Syria but vowing a “long battle” ahead.
The man said to be Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in the video also claimed the Easter Day bombings in Sri Lanka which killed over 250 people were “part of the revenge” that awaits the West.

What's Really Behind the Box Office Success for 'Unplanned'?,www1.cbn.com,,04-29-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/whats-really-behind-the-box-office-success-for-unplanned,"What's Really Behind the Box Office Success for 'Unplanned'? 04-29-2019 CBN News Ashley Bratcher plays the part of Planned Parenthood Director Abby Johnson in ""Unplanned."" (Image credit: PureFlix)
The pro-life movie ""Unplanned"" has done well at the box office. After another weekend, ticket sales are at $17.7 million for the film which deals with the transformation of former Planned Parenthood Director Abby Johnson.
With only a $6 million budget, the PureFlix film started making a profit on its opening weekend after debuting with $6.1 million.
The movie overcame the obstacles of an R-rating by the Motion Picture Association of America and having its ads banned on major television channels.
Johnson, who quit her job at Planned Parenthood after seeing an abortion via ultrasound, now works to help others leave the abortion industry. She spoke with CBN News about the success of the film.
""We've seen a lot of pro-life movies sort of come and go. And people have said what's the difference with 'Unplanned?' And I really think it's about timing,"" Johnson said.
""We look at what's happening with just these crazy laws that are being passed all across the country: Late term abortions, infanticide laws, and I think people are just ready. I think they were ready to see the truth. I think people were seeking truth on the issue of abortion. And I hope this film will be a really powerful tool that people can use moving forward to show the truth of abortion and show also the powerful, redemptive nature of Christ.""
Meanwhile, Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins told CBN News the push across states for greater access to abortions is because abortion advocates are afraid of what could happen in the courts.
""It's this fear that Roe versus Wade and Doe versus Bolton...the two decisions that legalized abortion all nine months in the US Supreme Court... that they're going to be reversed and very soon,"" she said. ""The president of Planned Parenthood, Leana Wen, came out and said she believes that Roe vs Wade will be overturned.""
Several states have passed abortion bills which could lead to a court challenge to Roe v. Wade."

WASHINGTON (AP) - Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein submitted his resignation Monday, ending a nearly two-year run defined by his appointment of a special counsel to investigate connections between President Donald Trump's campaign and Russia. His last day will be May 11. Rosenstein's departure had been expected since the confirmation of William Barr as attorney general. The White House nominated a replacement for the department's No. 2 slot weeks ago. Rosenstein intended to leave around mid-March but stayed on for the completion of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. Mueller last month submitted his report to the Justice Department, and Rosenstein was part of a small group of department officials who reviewed the document and helped shape its public release. After Mueller didn't reach a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed the investigation, Barr and Rosenstein stepped in and determined the evidence wasn't enough to support such an allegation. Rosenstein appointed Mueller in May 2017 following the recusal of then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and oversaw much of his work. His exit leaves the department without the official most closely aligned with the probe as officials grapple with public and congressional scrutiny of the special counsel's findings and the department's handling of the report. He not only supervised Mueller's work for much of the last two years, but also defended the investigation against attacks from congressional Republicans and Trump, who has blasted it as a ""witch hunt."" In so doing, Rosenstein sometimes found himself at odds with Trump but was nonetheless spared the brunt of anger directed at Sessions, whose recusal infuriated the president, leading to his forced resignation last November. The deputy attorney general position is a hugely significant job, responsible for overseeing the daily operations of the Justice Department and the work of United States attorneys across the country.

Utah Senator Mike Lee has written several books about the United States Constitution in an effort to help every American understand the importance of our founding documents. He's back with a new book about what he calls our ""lost"" Declaration of Independence.
There is perhaps no more powerful sentence in human history than the first line of the Declaration of Independence, penned in 1776: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" Pat Robertson talks with Sen. Mike Lee about his new book, Our Lost Declaration , on Tuesday's 700 Club.
Today, though, many Americans don't understand or appreciate the Declaration's gravity. As a result, we've lost touch with much of what makes our country so special: the distinctly American belief in the dignity of every human soul.
In his new book, Our Lost Declaration: America's Fight Against Tyranny from King George to the Deep State , Sen. Lee shares new insights into the events that shaped the ideas in the Declaration of Independence and makes clear how many abuses of federal power we see today are happening because we've forgotten that our leaders in Washington, DC serve us, the American people, not the other way around."

Jeffrey McCall: From Transgender to Transformed by God | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,CBN News,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/january/jeffrey-mccall-from-transgender-to-transformed,"In major cities across the country, Jeffrey McCall organizes freedom marches. These events feature men and women who have left the LBGT life .
One of the speakers is McCall himself, who struggled with homosexuality and drugs until the age of 23 when he decided he was in the wrong body and began living as a woman named ""Scarlett."" As Scarlett, he began drinking heavily and prostituting his body. During those two years, he was secretly watching Jentezen Franklin's sermons on YouTube. Jeffrey surrendered to God soon after hearing God tell him ""You will live for me.""
""I started struggling with same-sex attraction around twelve, and around fifteen years old I acted on it, ""McCall told CBN .
McCall always wanted love. But over the years his sexual encounters left him feeling empty and used.
""So, from 18 to 23, I lived in Nashville, Tennessee. And in those years, my whole identity was in being homosexual,"" he said.
""I just partied and would shop, and that was my life, shopping, partying, and whoever was my boyfriend at the time. I was addicted to drugs. I was taking a ton of Xanax and smoking crystal meth,"" he recalled.
""I'm about 6'4"" almost, and I weighed about 160 lbs. at that time. I was very sick. So, I knew that if I didn't leave Nashville physically, I would die,"" McCall confessed.
He moved to Georgia to attend college. Four years later, he had a degree, and a new identity -- Scarlett.
""The summer after graduating, I did my first drag show. I had grown up around a lot of transgender, transsexual drag queens because I had a family member who did shows,"" McCall explained.
""And after that summer, I started living as Scarlet and I would start dressing and-and I started even dating men as Scarlet. And so, from there, it fed it even more that, you know, this is who I am. I'm in the wrong body,"" he said.
""I thought, you know, I'm going to have the surgeries and transition into a woman and this is what's going to make me happy. And during those years as Scarlet, I was beginning to be very promiscuous, very promiscuous where sometimes it was more than one guy a day. During those years, I also prostituted my body,"" McCall continued.
""That's when the drinking really heavily began,"" he told CBN .
One wild night, McCall got violently drunk and threatened to commit suicide. He spent two days in the psychiatric ward of the hospital.
""Here I was hitting rock bottom. I'm in graduate school. I'm prostituting my body. I'm with all these different guys. I'm drunk every other day, I have nothing, really,"" he admitted.
While living as Scarlett, McCall had a secret. Behind closed doors, he was listening to Jentezen Franklin, the pastor of Free Chapel. It was a church McCall had visited twice while in college.
""He would come on television, or, I would look him up on YouTube. I would listen to him and the Holy Spirit was using it to convict me of sin,"" McCall said.
""And it was around the last semester of graduate school, I was sitting in my room and I was just crying. It was really, really late at night. And I was just weeping. I spoke to God, through my crying and weeping, and I said, ""God, I know people live for you, not just go to church on Sunday, not just play a religious game, like something happened and their life was transformed. And I said, 'Will I ever live for you?' My voice went silent. My thoughts stopped. And I heard God say, 'Yes, you will live for me,' he recalled.
A few months later, McCall made a difficult decision.
""I'm going to throw away the hair, the makeup, the clothes, the shoes, and everything that I have as Scarlett. So, in June of 2016, I threw it all away. I went to a dumpster and I just threw my whole life away. And it wasn't a joke to me. It wasn't something I took lightly. I was planning to transition and have surgeries and change my body. So throwing that away was a huge step,"" he said.
""And I thought maybe I'll just give God a chance. He did speak to me and said I was going to live for Him. And that summer the Lord and I began to try to have a relationship,"" he continued.
""It was almost as if God, that summer, stripped everything I learned from the church, from the LGBTQ community, from everyone and said, 'Everything you've heard, just throw it out and I'm going to lay a clear foundation for you,'"" McCall told CBN .
One night after church, McCall received another message from God.
""I heard the Holy Spirit speak to me. He said, 'You're going to make a video. You're going to make a Facebook live video and cut ties with everything from your past. You need to publicly acknowledge Jesus Christ as your Savior and that you want to cut ties with-with being a drunkard, homosexuality, the life of Scarlet, all of it,'"" he said.
""And I made the video and thousands of people viewed it. And I started getting messages and calls like, 'You can't leave homosexuality. You're transitioning. Like, This is who you are. What do you mean you're just leaving everything?'"" McCall noted.
""When I started losing the friends and some family members, my relationship with the Lord just kept blossoming. The day that I made the Facebook live video, that was the day I was filled with the Holy Spirit. The Bible became completely alive to me,"" he recalled.
""All of a sudden, I had a peace and joy I hadn't had since I was a little, little, little boy – that peace and joy of like everything was lifted. And then the Lord started speaking to me and said, 'Go out and share.' My whole life's purpose now is to continue to share Christ's love,"" he said.
""Not just speaking of it, but acting it out, showing it to the people that He loves them, that He wants them. This is so real it's like having the best thing you could get in the world and you want everyone to have it,"" McCall continued.

NYT: Trump Working to Designate Muslim Brotherhood a Terror Organization,www1.cbn.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/nyt-trump-working-to-designate-muslim-brotherhood-a-terror-organization,"NYT: Trump Working to Designate Muslim Brotherhood a Terror Organization 04-30-2019 Emily Jones
President Donald Trump plans to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terror organization, The New York Times reports.
Such a designation would make the Muslim Brotherhood and its partners vulnerable to harsh economic and travel sanctions imposed by the US.
The Times reports that national security and diplomatic officials began discussing the move after Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi held a private meeting with Trump at the White House on April 9th.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed that the Trump administration is pushing for the designation in a statement to the Times .
""The president has consulted with his national security team and leaders in the region who share his concern, and this designation is working its way through the internal process,"" Sanders said.
Trump told CBN News during an interview in 2017 that he was holding meetings about the Muslim Brotherhood’s terror status.
Senior officials are reportedly divided over the decision.
National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo support the decision, while others argue that the Muslim Brotherhood is more of a loosely organized movement than a unified group and therefore does not fit the criteria for designating it a terror organization.
Another concern is the impact such a designation would have on the rest of the Middle East. The move would increase US tensions with Turkey, whose president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a vocal supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Others believe the measure would allow el-Sisi to crack down on his Muslim Brotherhood opponents in Egypt. El-Sisi led a coup in 2013 that challenged and removed former president Mohamed Morsi from power. Morsi was a former leader in the Muslim Brotherhood.
Some advisors suggest designating another group linked to the Muslim Brotherhood as a terror organization, which will ultimately make the Muslim Brotherhood subject to harsh sanctions.
The consideration comes weeks after the Trump administration designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terrorist organization.
It was the first time the US has labeled another country's military a terror organization."

The family of the young boy who was thrown from the third fall of the Mall of America balcony is praising God after news that their son's condition has improved.
On April 12, Landen Hoffman was thrown 40 feet off a railing by 24-year-old Emmanuel Aranda, who is now being charged with attempted murder.
Five-year-old Landen was in critical condition following the incident as he suffered from broken arms and legs, and doctors believed he had sustained severe head trauma. However, a recent MRI revealed he had no brain damage .
Now, Landen has improved from critical condition to alert and conscious, R. Stephen Tillitt, a family attorney said on Friday.
""All praise, glory, and honor to Jesus! He saved our son's life and is healing him in the most miraculous ways. We are so elated to let you know that our son is now alert and conscious and is no longer in critical condition!"" the family said in a statement read by Tillitt.
The family said they are now turning their focus on rehabilitation and they are believing for Landen to be released from the hospital in June.
""The road to recovery remains long, but with God and you, we are assured to make it through,"" the family said.
Meanwhile, they are thanking the community for their prayers and support.
""We want to personally thank each and every one of you for your love, prayers, and support,"" they said. ""We are astounded and so blessed by the over 28,000 individuals and families, from literally around the world, that have donated to our GoFundMe page. Your love and generosity overwhelms and means so much to us! We have no idea where we would be without you - God and your prayers have sustained us.""
The fundraising campaign was set up for Landen's family to help cover the cost of medical treatments and rehabilitative programs. So far, it has raised over $1 million.

The United States is joining Jews in Israel and around the world in honoring the victims of the Holocaust this week.
President Donald Trump declared that April 28 to May 5 is Holocaust Remembrance Week.
""On Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day, and during this week of solemn remembrance, we honor the six million Jewish men, women, and children who were brutally murdered by the Nazi regime,"" Trump said in a statement. ""We also remember the Roma and Sinti, persons with disabilities, Poles and Slavic ethnic groups, Soviet prisoners of war, Jehovah's Witnesses, and persons who were targeted based on their sexual orientation, all of whom were targeted and killed by the Nazis and their collaborators.""
The Jewish people will commemorate the Holocaust from Wednesday evening to Thursday evening.
In Israel, all business will stop and Israelis will observe a nationwide moment of silence at 10:00 AM, lasting for two minutes. A state ceremony is usually held in Warsaw Ghetto Square at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. During the ceremony, Holocaust survivors will light six torches symbolizing the six million Jews who were slaughtered.
The United States Holocaust Memorial Ceremony also held its annual remembrance ceremony Monday.
The ceremony featured the stories of Holocaust survivors and their families. Allan M.

Study Suggests Rise in Suicide Among Kids and Teens After Netflix Drama '13 Reasons Why',www1.cbn.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/study-suggests-rise-in-suicide-among-kids-and-teens-after-netflix-drama-13-reasons-why,"Study Suggests Rise in Suicide Among Kids and Teens After Netflix Drama '13 Reasons Why' 04-30-2019 Christian Ellis Netflix (Photo: Netflix Website)
Suicide is at a 19-year-high among kids ages 10 to 17, and some are suggesting it's tied to the release of the Netflix drama ""13 Reasons Why"" which showed a girl ending her life.
Researchers admit they cannot prove the connection, but they do say there were 195 more youth suicides than would have been expected in the nine months after the show came out in March 2017.
The lead author of the findings, Jeff Bridge at Nationwide Children's Hospital, says the creators of the series intentionally portrayed the suicide of the main character with a very graphic depiction of her death. He says seeing that alone can trigger suicidal behavior.
The researchers utilized the data from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on deaths in Americans aged 10 to 64 from January 2013 through December 2017. While adolescent suicide rates were higher, the Associated Press reports researchers found no change in suicide rates for those 18 and older after the show was released.
Sociologist Anna Mueller of the University of Chicago stated the results add to evidence that descriptive media depictions of suicide can negatively influence young people.
Lisa Horowitz, a co-author and researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health, noted that suicide is the second leading cause of death for US teens and called it ""a major public health crisis."" She went on to state the new results highlight the necessity of parents and other adults connecting to young people.
""Start a conversation, ask how are they coping with the ups and downs of life, and don't be afraid to ask about suicide,"" she said. It's a myth that just asking might be a trigger, Horowitz said.
The first season of the Netflix show included warning messages with some of the episodes and offered a website with crisis hotlines. In the second season, the show's actors gave advice on where to seek help about suicide. The series' third season is expected later this year.
A Netflix spokesman stated the new study conflicts with University of Pennsylvania research that finds fewer suicidal thoughts among young adults who watched the entire second season than among non-viewers.
""We've just seen the study and are looking into the research,"" he said. ""This is a critically important topic and we have worked hard to ensure that we handle this sensitive issue responsibly.""
Bridge acknowledged the study does not include whether a person who died watched the show and researchers could not account for other influencing factors."
New US Terror Attack Thwarted in Wake of Anti-Semitic Synagogue Shooting,www1.cbn.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/national-security/2019/april/new-us-terror-attack-thwarted-in-wake-of-anti-semitic-synagogue-shooting,"Authorities have arrested a 26-year-old US Army veteran who's accused of planning terror attacks in California. Investigators believe he plotted to detonate a bomb at a Long Beach rally over the weekend.
Investigators arrested Mark Steven Domingo, a military veteran who served in Afghanistan. They say he converted to Islam and wanted revenge for the New Zealand mosque attacks, and discussed his deadly plans with undercover agents he met online.""
US Attorney Nick Hanna said, ""The terror plot culminated with plans to bomb innocent people causing dozens of deaths and serious injuries.""
Domingo lives in Reseda, California. Federal authorities took him into custody a short time after he received what he believed where explosives from the undercover agents.
""He allegedly purchased several hundred three-inch-long nails to be used in IEDs as shrapnel, specifically because the nails were long enough to penetrate the human body and puncture internal organs,"" Hanna said.
The FBI says Domingo talked about targeting Jews, churches and police officers, and in addition to a Long Beach rally of white supremacists, he even talked about detonating a bomb at the Santa Monica Pier.
Domingo's family released a statement, saying they're surprised by his arrest. They also requested privacy.
This all comes as southern California continues to deal with the deadly shooting at a synagogue in Poway over the weekend.
Residents on Monday mourned the loss of 60-year-old Lori Gilbert Kaye. Friends say she stepped in front of the rabbi to stop the accused gunman, 19-year-old John Earnest.
Sam Hoffman, president of Chabad of Poway synagogue, said, ""We stand tall against a darkness of evil and anti-Semitism in the world.""
Authorities say Earnest opened fire, taking the life of Kaye, and injuring three others. Earnest was a stand-out scholar, athlete and nationally recognized pianist. The Associated Press reports his adherence to white supremacy and anti-Semitism shocked the people closest to him.
His parents released a statement, saying, ""How our son was attracted to such darkness is a terrifying mystery to us.""
The FBI says it did receive a tip about a threatening social media post about five minutes before the synagogue attack, but it did not say who was the author of the post or the location of the threat.
Investigators say they tried to identify the writer immediately, but the shooting took place before the suspect could be fully identified.

Four VA School Systems Claim 'Thousands' of Transgender Students in Landmark Case,www1.cbn.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/four-va-school-systems-claim-thousands-of-transgender-students-in-landmark-case,"Four VA School Systems Claim 'Thousands' of Transgender Students in Landmark Case 04-30-2019 Emily Jones
Four schools in northern Virginia claim there are ""thousands of students in Virginia public schools who...identify as transgender"" and should be allowed to use whatever bathroom they choose.
The Washington Post reports that the Alexandria, Arlington, Falls Church, and Fairfax County school boards filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Gavin Grimm, a biological girl who sued her school board in Gloucester County, Virginia in 2015 after being denied access to the boys' restroom.
Grimm claimed that Gloucester County violated Title IX and the equal protection clause of the Constitution. The Obama administration declared that Title IX, which in 1972 prohibited discrimination in schools ""on the basis"" of sex, also included gender identity.
Grimm's case made it to the Supreme Court but was returned to a lower court after the Trump administration abandoned the Obama-era rule on transgender students.
Now, Grimm's case is scheduled for trial in July at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
The four school boards who came to Grimm's defense shot down fears that allowing students to use whatever bathroom they choose would violate other students' privacy and make them vulnerable to sexual misconduct.
""Male students, teachers, and parents have not used the policy as a ruse to improperly access female restrooms. Sex offenders have not exploited the policy to prey on children,"" the school boards said.
Instead, they argued, it is the transgender students who have suffered ""stigma and trauma.""
However, the policy has come under fire from critics ranging from conservative Christians to radical feminists.
Kara Dansky from the Women's Liberation Front told Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2017 that women are made vulnerable by these kinds of bathroom policies.

German Christians to Bring Life-Sized Temple Menorah to Jerusalem As Peace Offering to Jewish People,www1.cbn.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/german-christians-to-bring-life-sized-temple-menorah-to-jerusalem-as-peace-offering-to-jewish-people,"German Christians to Bring Life-Sized Temple Menorah to Jerusalem As Peace Offering to Jewish People 04-30-2019 Emily Jones Courtesy: The Menorah Project
JERUSALEM, Israel – A group of German Christians who call themselves "" The Menorah Project "" are on their way to Jerusalem with a life-size replica of the seven-branched menorah that once stood in the second Temple before it was destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
The 5-foot, 265-pound gold-coated menorah is a peace offering and plea for reconciliation to the Jewish people.
This group of 11 Christians are bringing the menorah to Jerusalem, where it was once stolen by the Romans, to seek forgiveness for the Church's long history of anti-Semitism and violent persecution of Jews.
The group views the Romans' robbery of the Menorah as the beginning of the early church's severance from it's Jewish roots. This, they believe, ultimately led to the development of Replacement Theology, the belief that God has rejected the Jewish people and replaced Israel with the Church. This theology is credited with being one of the root causes of anti-Semitism in Christianity and even the Holocaust.
""The church never returned the holy instruments back to the Jewish people,"" the group says in a German to English translation on their website. ""Instead, the church saw itself as the new spiritual Israel….We want to set a statement. We want to accept our failures as a church as set a sign of return.""
The menorah is traveling from Germany by boat through Rome to Israel's port in Haifa. It is expected to arrive in Israel on May 5 and will be presented to Israeli citizens on May 9 at a ceremony in Jerusalem.
The menorah will arrive at a time when Israel stops to remember the horrors of the Holocaust and the rebirth of their nation.
""As a group of young Christians, we accompany the Menorah on (its) way from Rome to God's eternal city of Jerusalem to deliver (it) to the Jewish people in the context of the Jewish State Day of Mourning Yom HaShoah and Israeli Independence Day Yom HaAtzmaut,"" they say.
""With the return of the (Menorah) our thanks and our love for the Jewish people, together with the request for forgiveness, should be expressed. A sign that perhaps speaks louder and means more than many words,"" they continue.
They see the return of the menorah as a symbol of God restoring Israel.
""The Menorah is a symbol of hope that the Jewish people will be given back, what has been stolen from them all these years, and that God is putting together the pieces we are bringing back."""

WASHINGTON – Religious persecution plagues countries around the world and the problem is only getting worse. Now, an annual report by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom ( USCIRF ) gives us a clear picture of the world's top offenders.
Burma, Central African Republic, China, Eritrea, Iran, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Vietnam are where people of faith face the most aggressive and violent forms of persecution.
Gary Bauer, one of the nine commissioners on USCIRF, is particularly concerned about China's inclusion on the list because of the influence it wields.
""So here's a rising power. It's economy is growing bigger and bigger each year, its military is expanding. It's got worldwide ambitions and every place it reaches it's bringing these values of persecution along with them,"" he tells CBN News.
So called ""tier two"" countries of concern include Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Cuba, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Laos, Malaysia, and America's NATO ally Turkey.
Turkey, of course, made international headlines for holding American Pastor Andrew Brunson hostage for nearly two years before releasing him last fall.
""One of the things the commission is really focused on is not only when there are governments perpetrating violence but when governments are tolerating the perpetration of violence,"" USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava told CBN News after release of the report.
This report is unique in that the nine commissioners on USCIRF aren't burdened by diplomacy. Unlike many State Department accounts, these observers are free to tell it like they see it.
""We believe as a commission that no person of whatever faith they are should have to fear within their house of worship,"" says Commissioner Tony Perkins.
For the world's Christians, the situation is especially dire.
""Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world and it's accelerating,"" says Bauer.
In its report, the commission calls on President Trump to appoint a special adviser on international religious freedom, target top offenders with sanctions, and put money toward the State Department's effort to help houses of worship protect themselves. ""Churches, which are soft targets, have become targets for terrorists and so we believe this would be a very effective role for our government to come alongside these governments to provide the training that would be a combination of police officers, the law enforcement agencies, the domestic security, along with the houses of worship to provide the security,"" says Perkins, who has also served on the security team at his own church.
For so many people around the world, finding religious tolerance is increasingly a matter of life and death. "

NYT: Trump Working to Designate Muslim Brotherhood a Terror Organization,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/nyt-trump-working-to-designate-muslim-brotherhood-a-terror-organization,"President Donald Trump plans to designate the Muslim Brotherhood as a foreign terror organization, The New York Times reports.
Such a designation would make the Muslim Brotherhood and its partners vulnerable to harsh economic and travel sanctions imposed by the US.
The Times reports that national security and diplomatic officials began discussing the move after Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi held a private meeting with Trump at the White House on April 9th.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed that the Trump administration is pushing for the designation in a statement to the Times .
""The president has consulted with his national security team and leaders in the region who share his concern, and this designation is working its way through the internal process,"" Sanders said.
Trump told CBN News during an interview in 2017 that he was holding meetings about the Muslim Brotherhood’s terror status.
Senior officials are reportedly divided over the decision.
National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo support the decision, while others argue that the Muslim Brotherhood is more of a loosely organized movement than a unified group and therefore does not fit the criteria for designating it a terror organization.
Another concern is the impact such a designation would have on the rest of the Middle East. The move would increase US tensions with Turkey, whose president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a vocal supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Others believe the measure would allow el-Sisi to crack down on his Muslim Brotherhood opponents in Egypt. El-Sisi led a coup in 2013 that challenged and removed former president Mohamed Morsi from power. Morsi was a former leader in the Muslim Brotherhood.
Some advisors suggest designating another group linked to the Muslim Brotherhood as a terror organization, which will ultimately make the Muslim Brotherhood subject to harsh sanctions.
The consideration comes weeks after the Trump administration designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terrorist organization.
It was the first time the US has labeled another country's military a terror organization."
Study Suggests Rise in Suicide Among Kids and Teens After Netflix Drama '13 Reasons Why',www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/study-suggests-rise-in-suicide-among-kids-and-teens-after-netflix-drama-13-reasons-why,"Suicide is at a 19-year-high among kids ages 10 to 17, and some are suggesting it's tied to the release of the Netflix drama ""13 Reasons Why"" which showed a girl ending her life.
Researchers admit they cannot prove the connection, but they do say there were 195 more youth suicides than would have been expected in the nine months after the show came out in March 2017.
The lead author of the findings, Jeff Bridge at Nationwide Children's Hospital, says the creators of the series intentionally portrayed the suicide of the main character with a very graphic depiction of her death. He says seeing that alone can trigger suicidal behavior.
The researchers utilized the data from the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on deaths in Americans aged 10 to 64 from January 2013 through December 2017. While adolescent suicide rates were higher, the Associated Press reports researchers found no change in suicide rates for those 18 and older after the show was released.
Sociologist Anna Mueller of the University of Chicago stated the results add to evidence that descriptive media depictions of suicide can negatively influence young people.
Lisa Horowitz, a co-author and researcher at the National Institute of Mental Health, noted that suicide is the second leading cause of death for US teens and called it ""a major public health crisis."" She went on to state the new results highlight the necessity of parents and other adults connecting to young people.
""Start a conversation, ask how are they coping with the ups and downs of life, and don't be afraid to ask about suicide,"" she said. It's a myth that just asking might be a trigger, Horowitz said.
The first season of the Netflix show included warning messages with some of the episodes and offered a website with crisis hotlines. In the second season, the show's actors gave advice on where to seek help about suicide. The series' third season is expected later this year.
A Netflix spokesman stated the new study conflicts with University of Pennsylvania research that finds fewer suicidal thoughts among young adults who watched the entire second season than among non-viewers.
""We've just seen the study and are looking into the research,"" he said. ""This is a critically important topic and we have worked hard to ensure that we handle this sensitive issue responsibly.""
Bridge acknowledged the study does not include whether a person who died watched the show and researchers could not account for other influencing factors."

Years later, he says he's heard from God and has started a journey to literally carry the cross all the way to the Grand Canyon.
""The moment that I gave my life to God, my life was radically changed, and that's what makes this walk kind of easy -- is Jesus,"" Burleson shared in a recent video on Facebook. ""Jesus is amazing.""
The 34-year-old has left his home in Andrews, South Carolina, and since March 11th he's been traveling from town to town on back roads carrying a wooden cross he built.
""Anything to help get God's word out,"" Burleson said, waving at drivers.
""When I got saved, God called me out to be a walking memorial for him,"" he said. ""I've never done a long distance like this before. Most of the time it was just town to town. This is the big one. I'm going all out.""
Since the start of his journey, he has been sharing the gospel of Christ along the way, telling people to ""pray and be ready for the coming of Christ.""
Burleson predicts it will take three months to get to the Grand Canyon. He carries a small tent with him, but he's met so many generous people and churches along the way that he hasn't had to use it.
He has multiple stories of miracles so far, including a woman being saved from suicide.
""There was a woman driving and she was just looking at me, so I waved like 'Hello' and kept walking. She then cut me off and is just falling out of her window weeping and crying,"" Burleson told the Carolina News and Reporter.
""Just like that, crying, and I was like, 'Oh my gosh what's wrong? What happened? Are you alright?' and she said, 'I was one block away from killing myself and you stopped me',"" he continued.
He's glad he obeyed God because he almost didn't carry his cross that day. But thanks to his wife and kids supporting him, he decided to walk, and that's when he encountered the woman.
""I wasn't going to walk that day,"" he said. ""I didn't feel like it, and my wife encouraged me to get up and go.""
Burleson says others have stopped and prayed with him alongside the road too.
""One guy turned his car around and immediately started trembling and tearing up when he approached me,"" Burleson said. ""God knew he needed that that day."""
Four VA School Systems Claim 'Thousands' of Transgender Students in Landmark Case,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/four-va-school-systems-claim-thousands-of-transgender-students-in-landmark-case,"Four schools in northern Virginia claim there are ""thousands of students in Virginia public schools who...identify as transgender"" and should be allowed to use whatever bathroom they choose.
The Washington Post reports that the Alexandria, Arlington, Falls Church, and Fairfax County school boards filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Gavin Grimm, a biological girl who sued her school board in Gloucester County, Virginia in 2015 after being denied access to the boys' restroom.
Grimm claimed that Gloucester County violated Title IX and the equal protection clause of the Constitution. The Obama administration declared that Title IX, which in 1972 prohibited discrimination in schools ""on the basis"" of sex, also included gender identity.
Grimm's case made it to the Supreme Court but was returned to a lower court after the Trump administration abandoned the Obama-era rule on transgender students.
Now, Grimm's case is scheduled for trial in July at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
The four school boards who came to Grimm's defense shot down fears that allowing students to use whatever bathroom they choose would violate other students' privacy and make them vulnerable to sexual misconduct.
""Male students, teachers, and parents have not used the policy as a ruse to improperly access female restrooms. Sex offenders have not exploited the policy to prey on children,"" the school boards said.
Instead, they argued, it is the transgender students who have suffered ""stigma and trauma.""
However, the policy has come under fire from critics ranging from conservative Christians to radical feminists.
Kara Dansky from the Women's Liberation Front told Fox News host Tucker Carlson in 2017 that women are made vulnerable by these kinds of bathroom policies.
""We think that 'women and girls' are a meaningful category worthy of civil rights protection,"" she said. ""If we define sex, under Title IX, to mean gender identity, what we're essentially saying is that 'women and girl' can mean anyone who self-identifies as 'women and girl,' which makes the category 'women and girls' meaningless as a category.""
The Women's Liberation Front teamed up with the conservative Family Policy Alliance to challenge the Obama-era bathroom policy before Trump overturned it."
Uprising?

""I want to tell the Venezuelan people: This is the moment to take to the streets and accompany these patriotic soldiers,"" said Lopez in his first public appearance since being detained in 2014 for leading anti-government protests. ""Everyone should come to the streets, in peace.""
Lopez said he has been freed by members of the military responding to an order by Guaidó, whom the U.S. and dozens of other governments recognize as Venezuela's rightful leader.
As Lopez spoke, there were sporadic efforts with tear gas to break up the protesters who gathered on a highway overpass in wealthier eastern Caracas. It appeared to have been fired from inside the Carlota air base. But more people gathered as they sensed what could be their strongest opportunity yet to overthrow the government.
""It's now or never,"" said one of the young soldiers, his face covered in the blue bandanna preferred by the few dozen soldiers who stood alongside Guaidó and Lopez.
Socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello downplayed the significance of the rebellion, saying most of Caracas was in complete calm. He called on government supporters to amass at the presidential palace to defend Maduro from what he said was a U.S.-backed coup attempt.
The tumultuous events started when Guaidó appeared in an early morning video shot next to the air base. He was surrounded by the heavily armed soldiers backed by a few armored vehicles
Guaido said soldiers who had taken to the streets were protecting Venezuela's constitution.
Venezuelan Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said on Twitter that Maduro's government is confronting a small ""coup attempt"" led by military ""traitors"" backed by right-wing opponents.

NASA Chief Warns of Potential 'Major Asteroid Strike on Earth in Our Lifetime',www1.cbn.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/nasa-chief-warns-of-potential-major-asteroid-strike-on-earth-in-our-lifetime,"NASA Chief Warns of Potential 'Major Asteroid Strike on Earth in Our Lifetime' 04-30-2019 Steve Warren
NASA and various scientific experts are participating in their latest drill this week, examining what federal agencies would do in case an asteroid struck our planet.
If you think this sounds like the good premise for a science fiction movie, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine would probably agree with you. However, Bridenstine thinks Earth could face the real possibility of such a catastrophic event within our lifetime.
The Daily Mail reports the NASA chief presented his argument why the US should be readying its defenses against objects from outer space Monday at the 2019 Planetary Defense Conference held in Washington, DC.
NASA, FEMA, and other agencies will conduct a defense drill at the conference, showing what would happen if an asteroid was on a collision course with the Earth. The plans are scheduled to be released for social media. Drills like this one are conducted every two years.
""We have to make sure that people understand that this is not about Hollywood, it's not about the movies,"" Bridenstine said. ""This is about ultimately protecting the only planet we know, right now, to host life and that is the planet Earth.""
Bridenstine used the recent Chelyabinsk Event in Russia to illustrate the potential for such an event to occur. The meteor, which struck the Ural Mountain range six years ago, was the largest ever recorded meteor strike in more than a century after the Tunguska event of 1908 , according to The Daily Mail .
Almost 2,000 people were injured by the shock wave from the resulting explosion, which was estimated to be 20 times as strong as the nuclear weapon that leveled the Japanese city of Hiroshima during World War II.
Even though Near Earth Object strikes are estimated by scientists to happen every 60 years, Bridenstine explained they've happened three times over the last century.
Planetary defense is just as critical as landing men on the moon, the NASA chief told the audience at the conference.
That's why the space agency is working to identify and track 90 percent of all asteroids approximately 500 feet or larger, which have the potential of damaging our planet upon impact.
Among its other projects, NASA is currently developing the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission scheduled to launch in June 2021. The mission will be the first attempt to change an asteroid's trajectory by crashing an object into it.
The target for the DART will be the near-Earth asteroid Didymos, which measures 2,600 feet in diameter."

The Houston, Texas group known as the Houston MassResistance activists have exposed a second ""drag queen"" as a convicted child sex offender, who was involved in reading stories to children at a local library.
LifeSite News reports the man was convicted of multiple sexual assaults against four children (four young children (ages 4, 5, 6, and 8) in 2004. He was incarcerated and is listed as a ""high-risk sex offender.""
The man was part of a local drag queen group called the ""Space City Sisters"" who were invited by the Houston Public Library to read stories to little children during an event promoted as ""Drag Queen Story Hour."" The convicted sex offender served as a greeter for the event, according to LifeSite News . The activists also uncovered that the man had worked as a transgender prostitute and a porn actor.
According to their website, the Space City Sisters are a local chapter of a national organization of cross-dressing homosexual men. The men dress as parodies of Catholic nuns in order to mock Catholicism. The organization is active in gay pride parades and LGTBQ events across the country.
In March, the MassResistance activists also found another drag queen reading to children during a story time hour was also a sex offender.
Library officials later apologized for failing to conduct a background check on men who read to children at an event hosted by drag queens, according to MSN ."
Beto O'Rourke Looks to Regain Steam with Climate Change Proposal,www1.cbn.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/beto-orourke-looks-to-regain-steam-with-climate-change-proposal,"Beto O'Rourke announces he's running for president (Photo: screen capture) 6031636856001 Beto O'Rourke Looks to Regain Steam with Climate Change Proposal
Democratic presidential candidates are trying to break out from the two-dozen opponents by going specific with their agendas.
After an initial hot start, Beto O'Rouke has been steadily losing steam in the polls. Now the one-time top contender is out front with the first comprehensive proposal.
""Muy Buenos Dias ( A very good morning) from Yosemite Valley here in California where we are announcing the most ambitious climate plan in the history of the United States,"" O'Rouke said Monday.
The former Texas congressman is trying to reignite his once bright but fading star as the first candidate to lay out a major policy plan. And his focus is on climate change.
""I want you to be part of this effort,"" he told supporters.
The 10-year, $5 trillion plan, he says, would require the participation of all Americans and touch every sector from housing to health care, transportation, and pensions.
The four-part proposal would start on day one of an O'Rourke presidency by recommitting to the Paris Climate Accord and undoing the Trump administration's environmental agenda.
It would also raise taxes on businesses and the wealthy to fund the sweeping plan, which aims to cut carbon emissions to ""net zero"" by 2050 and get halfway there by 2030.
""It's hard to argue there's anything more important facing this country - this generation today,"" O'Rourke said.
He named climate change the ""greatest threat"" America faces.
The plan gives O'Rourke the chance to potentially avoid recent characterizations as a political lightweight."

CBN News Contributing Reporter Chuch Holton appeared on CBN's Newswatch program Tuesday to talk about the situation in Venezuela and what his sources in the Venezuelan military were telling him about the uprising.
Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido took to the streets with a top activist and some heavily armed soldiers Tuesday, calling for the military to rise up and overthrow socialist leader Nicolás Maduro.
Violent street battles erupted during the early morning hours in parts of Caracas in what was the most serious challenge yet to Maduro’s rule.
Despite media reports that the rebellion seems to have limited military support, CBN News Contributing Reporter Chuck Holton says this move has been planned by members of the military for some time.
""I've been meeting with members of the Venezuelan military who defected back on Jan. 23rd when the aid got burned there,"" Holton told CBN 's Newswatch program Tuesday. ""What they were telling me is that this has been planned for some time. Now they believe it may have gone off a little half-cocked, but they told me the military of Venezuela has been behind Guaido in large parts, a vast majority of them, but they have been waiting for the right moment to strike.""
""These troops have families,"" Holton noted. ""And if they stand up to Maduro, the troops and their families are in great peril. This is a widespread movement not just in Caracas.""
Guaido started the day's events when he appeared in an early morning video that showed him surrounded by heavily-armed soldiers outside a Caracas air base. He said the soldiers were joining him to protect the country's constitution. En el marco de nuestra constitución. Y por el cese definitivo de la usurpación. https://t.co/3RD2bnQhxt

Guiado then took to the streets with activist Leopoldo Lopez who said he'd just been set free by members of the military in response to an order from Guaido.
Lopez said, ""I want to tell the Venezuelan people: this is the moment to take to the streets and accompany these patriotic soldiers.""
One of the soldiers said ""it's now or never."" Report says even more military units are joining effort of Interim President @jguaido in #Caracas #Venezuela https://t.co/jxJpffKY8v

Guiado is the head of the Venezuelan National Assembly and is recognized by dozens of countries — including the US — as Venezuela's president.
Maduro's government said it's putting down what it callse a small coup attempt by military traitors working with right-wing opponents.
The country's Supreme Court issued arrest warrants for Guaido, Lopez, and other opposition leaders.
President Donald Trump tweeted his support for the protestors saying: ""I am monitoring the situation in Venezuela very closely. The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom! "" I am monitoring the situation in Venezuela very closely.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded to the uprising in Venezuela tweeting this morning: ""Today interim President Juan Guaido announced the start of Operacion Libertad. The U.S. government fully supports the Venezuelan people in their quest for freedom and democracy. Democracy cannot be defeated.""

New Account Credit Card Fraud Up 24% In 2018: The Top Frauds of 2018,www1.cbn.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/april/new-account-credit-card-fraud-up-24-in-2018-the-top-frauds-of-2018,"New Account Credit Card Fraud Up 24% In 2018: The Top Frauds of 2018 ©iStockphoto.com/Rocky89
Welcome to the 2018 Consumer Fraud Awards Show! We have a great show for you, with criminal activity galore. Tonight's winners are chosen based on information from the Consumer Sentinel Network 2018 Data Book and brought to you by the Consumer Information Group at your Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Okay, there really isn't a consumer fraud awards show – but it has been a banner year for fraud and identity theft reports. After a three-year decline from a peak of 1.526 million fraud reports in 2014 to 1.29 million in 2017, 2018 fraud reports shot up to 1.427 million.
Similarly, identity theft reports peaked in 2015 at just over 490,000, sank for two consecutive years, and rose to over 444,000 in 2018. The number of combined annual fraud and identity theft reports is at a record high. One–quarter of those reporting fraud lost money in the process, resulting in a median loss of $375 and $1.48 billion in total losses.
The three top consumer reports of 2019 were imposter scams (18% of all reports), debt collection issues (16%), and identity theft (15%). There's little challenge to the top three, as no other category reached 6% of total reports.
Imposter scams involve someone pretending to be a trusted person to get you to send money or give out your personal information. These situations include romance scams and fraudsters claiming to be relatives in distress, technical support experts, government representatives, or well-known businesspeople in order to get your money.
Debt collection issues refer to creditors or third-party debt collectors who call repeatedly or continuously, use profanity, fail to send written notices of the debt, falsely represent the status or amount of the debt, falsely threaten legal action, or otherwise violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.
The databook defines identity theft as someone appropriating your personal identification information, such as your Social Security Number or credit card account number, to commit theft or fraud. The most common types of identity theft reported include credit card fraud, bank fraud, phone or utility fraud, employment or tax-related fraud, loan or lease fraud, and government documents or benefits fraud.
While debt collection reports fell by 24% to move to second place, both imposter scams and identity theft are still going strong. Almost 20% of people lost money in imposter scams, with a median loss of $500 and $488 million in total losses. Identity theft losses are shifting in focus, with tax fraud losses dropping by 38% while fraudulent new credit card accounts increased by 24%. Let MoneyTips protect your credit and your identity with a free trial .
FTC data revealed an interesting relationship between fraud reporting and age. Younger people report losing money more often to fraudulent schemes compared to older people. Approximately 43% of Americans 20-29 years old reported fraud losses, compared to only 15% of Americans 70-79 years old.
However, when they did lose money to fraud, older Americans lost more on average. The 20-29 age group reported a median of $400 in losses, while the 70-79 age group reported a median loss of $751 – and those aged eighty and above had a whopping $1,700 median loss to fraud.
Older Americans may have seen scams before and be more skeptical than their younger counterparts – or it could be that older Americans are less likely to report the losses unless the losses are too large to ignore. They may be ashamed to admit they were victims of fraud, thinking that they should have known better.
If you're a victim of fraud and/or identity theft, be sure to report what happened to the FTC and local law enforcement. Don't be embarrassed. As the statistics show, you aren't alone – and your report may help catch fraudsters and prevent further damage.
Whether or not you've been a fraud victim in the past, avoid becoming one in 2019.
Take common-sense steps to protect your personal information, both in electronic and hard copy form. Learn to recognize common e-mail/telephone scams and be skeptical of any unsolicited requests for personal information.
Fight the increase in fraudulent credit card accounts by applying credit freezes to your accounts to keep identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name. Check your credit report regularly. Consider using a credit monitoring service if you're too busy to monitor all of your accounts. You can start monitoring your credit and see your credit report and score for
There probably won't be a 2019 Consumer Fraud Awards Show. If there is one, don't have a reason to take part in it. That's one red carpet you want to avoid.

40 Million Americans Will Miss At Least One Credit Card Payment In 2019,www1.cbn.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/april/40-million-americans-will-miss-at-least-one-credit-card-payment-in-2019,"40 Million Americans Will Miss At Least One Credit Card Payment In 2019 ©iStockphoto.com/sturti
It's another lean financial month. You'll be lucky just to make the minimum payment on your credit card bill. Should you wait until you can pay a larger portion of your bill, or pay what you can on time?
In a recent WalletHub survey, almost 16% of respondents said they expected to miss at least one credit card payment in 2019, equating to over forty million people nationwide. That's the wrong answer to the above question.
It's far better to make a partial credit card payment on time than it is to delay payment. Not only will you incur late fees (typically in the $20-$40 range) per missed payment, you'll also temporarily lose your grace period. Grace periods keep interest charges from the beginning until the end of the monthly payment cycle. Without a grace period, interest accrues from the time of purchase.
You may also incur a penalty annual percentage rate (APR) that's higher than your usual card APR (typically near 30%).
If your payment is more than thirty days late , then the late payment will be reported to the credit reporting agencies. The late payment will drop your credit score and cause lenders to re-assess your risk. You may have trouble qualifying for credit/loans or pay more for the privilege in the future. You can check your credit score and read your credit report for
Convinced? Good. Now how do you avoid late credit card payments? Survey results suggest that you set a reminder.
The top reason by far to miss a credit card payment is the old classic – ""I forgot."" Approximately 46% of respondents gave this reason for missing a payment.
Does that excuse work anywhere else in life? It won't work with credit card companies, either – more than once. The survey found that 91% of people who asked to get a credit card late fee waived were successful (although it's unclear if a second request will be granted). Even if the fee is waived, you'll still lose the grace period and may see a penalty APR. With all the ways to set reminders, there's no reason to forget a payment. Set regular alerts on your phone or computer. See if your credit card issuer offers reminders. Use old-school handwritten notes. Tattoo your payment schedule on your forehead if you have to. Do whatever it takes.
If all reminder options fail – or you're too busy traveling, as 9% of respondents were – consider setting up an automatic payment through your bank account. Since high-income consumers were twice as likely as low-income consumers to miss credit card payments due to forgetfulness, automatic payment may be a viable option. Consumers should only use automatic payments if they monitor their bank balance and can keep enough money in the account to avoid overdrafts.
As for the 29% of respondents who don't have enough money, the question is why. Are you spending more than you can afford to pay? Review your budget and look for ways to save.
Meanwhile, divide the money you do have to ensure that at least the minimum payment is made on all bills. Credit card debt is probably the highest interest debt you have. It must be addressed immediately after any payments on secured assets (like a mortgage or car payment).
Ultimately, if you can't pay your credit card bill on time for financial reasons, you have to charge less or find a way to get more income. It's critical to make at least the minimum payment on time to avoid making a bad situation even worse.

‘Privacy-Focused’ Facebook Puts the Spotlight on Groups,www1.cbn.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/entertainment/2019/april/lsquo-privacy-focused-rsquo-facebook-puts-the-spotlight-on-groups,"‘Privacy-Focused’ Facebook Puts the Spotlight on Groups 04-30-2019 Associated Press Facebook, Photo, AP
SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Facebook is launching a major redesign of its app and website built around letting people connect with groups that share their interests — an attempt to shift its focus away from the untrammeled public sharing that has helped spread hate speech, extremism, misinformation and live-streamed video of massacres.
The new features, announced Tuesday at the company’s annual F8 developer conference, are part of CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s broader strategy for countering Facebook’s growing array of critics, emboldened regulators and competitors.
Zuckerberg, who at one point stood in front of a giant display reading “The future is private,” acknowledged widespread skepticism of his plan to turn Facebook into a “privacy-focused” social network.
“Look, I get that a lot of people aren’t sure that we are serious about this,” he said to laughter from the crowd. “We are committed to doing this well and to starting a new chapter for our products.”
The redesign isn’t without risks of its own. When Snapchat rolled out major changes in late 2017, people hated them so much the service lost 3 million users in a single quarter ; analysts think it still hasn’t recovered.
Zuckerberg and his chief lieutenant, Sheryl Sandberg, have apologized repeatedly over the past year for Facebook’s ever-expanding list of mishaps over privacy, data misuse, and security problems. Last week, the company said it is setting aside $3 billion to cover a possible fine from the Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations.
Amid all that, Zuckerberg is encouraging Facebook users to rely more on private messaging and “communities.” The redesign is structured to make it as easy to connect with groups as it is with individual friends, he said.
The groups cover a wide range of interests and topics — hiking, hair care, parenting, rare diseases. Recommended groups will appear on users’ homepages. (The redesign will also do away with Facebook’s signature blue banner.)
Groups have also caused controversy for the company, especially as communities pop up around extremist topics. Facebook is working to remove groups that have “harmful content,” Zuckerberg said, and to de-emphasize those that share misleading information.
The redesigned mobile app is live for U.S. users now, while the desktop version is coming later this year. This is Facebook’s fifth major mobile app redesign since it launched more than a decade ago.
A desktop app for Messenger is also coming later this year. And Messenger will eventually make end-to-end encryption the default setting for all messages, rather than an opt-in choice. End-to-end encryption protects messages as they travel between people, making it impossible to see them unless you are on the sending or receiving end.
Inside WhatsApp — by far Facebook’s most secure app — the company is making status updates more private. Only people in each other’s contact books will be able to see such updates.
The privacy changes extend to Instagram as well. Facebook executives say the company is starting to test new features that hide “likes” from photos. Users will still be able to see how many likes their photos get, but the number won’t appear at the bottom of each post.
Facebook’s dating service will come to U.S. users later this year. Facebook also announced a way to date friends — but only if each user separately adds the other to his or her own “secret crush” list.
Zuckerberg said last week that Facebook’s focus on private communications will be built out over the next five years or more.
A few years ago, the company probably would have rolled out these changes right away and dealt with problems as they came up, Zuckerberg said. But no longer. “We have to change a lot of the ways we run this company,” he said.
Last year’s F8 conference took place weeks after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a political data-mining firm accessed personal data on tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent.

"Shots Reported at University of North Carolina's Charlotte Campus: Two Dead, Four Injured",www1.cbn.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/shots-reported-at-university-of-north-carolinas-charlotte-campus-school-on-lockdown,"North Carolina Campus Shooting Leaves 2 Dead, 4 Injured 04-30-2019 Associated Press
CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — A shooting on a North Carolina university campus left two people dead and four wounded Tuesday, prompting a lockdown and chaotic scene in the state’s largest city.
UNC Charlotte issued a campus lockdown late Tuesday afternoon, saying shots had been fired. Later in the evening, the campus was declared secure after a suspect was taken into custody.
“Shots reported near kennedy. Run, Hide, Fight. Secure yourself immediately,” the university said in an alert, referring to the school’s Kennedy building on campus.
Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency said on Twitter that two people were killed, two others had life-threatening injuries and another two people were treated for less serious injuries. They said the numbers could change.
Aerial shots from local television news outlets showed police officers running toward a building, while another view showed students running on a campus sidewalk.
The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department later said that the campus had been secured and that officers were going through buildings to let people who had sheltered in place know that it was safe. Police said that one suspect was in custody, and it didn’t appear that others were involved.
It was not immediately clear whether the victims were students.
The university has more than 26,500 students and 3,000 faculty and staff. The campus is located northeast of the city center and is surrounded by residential areas.
Sam Rice, a senior on UNC Charlotte’s tennis team, told Spectrum News that he was in the library studying for a final exam when he heard people yelling “shooter, shooter.” He said he heard police yelling for people to stay down and stay on the floor.
He was “waiting for someone to tell us everything was going to be OK.”
When people were told to leave, he ran out in his socks, running over glass on the floor.
His reaction is “just shock,” he told the television station. “It doesn’t feel real.”
Susan Harden, a UNCC professor, and Mecklenburg County Commissioner was at home when she heard of the shooting. She went to a staging area, she said, to provide support.
Harden said she has taught inside the Kennedy building, where the shootings occurred.
“It breaks my heart. We’re torn up about what’s happened,” Harden said. “Students should be able to learn in peace and in safety and professors ought to be able to do their jobs in safety.”
