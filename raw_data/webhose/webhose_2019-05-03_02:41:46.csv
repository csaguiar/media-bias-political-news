My wife doesn't like Carlson's show mostly for that reason, and I'm sure others feel the same way. I respect Carlson's combativeness for standing up for what he believes but wish he was a bit smarter and less emotional about handling his leftist guests.
The bottom line, is if CNN can't beat Carlson, they're really bad. I've always said, Chicken Little also had great ratings in the beginning. Many CNN viewers just learned they've been listening to lying propagandists."

If enacted, there actually would be no reason to even conduct an general election at all. Electors would cast their votes dictated by the political bosses in control of that state. That's the actual gambit here. The Democrats are doing this to nullify and cancel opposition at all levels. Including and especially opposition that is expressed in elections through the ballot box. It will have the effect of assuring an alliance with a minority number of states that will control national action from that moment on!

Does anyone really think businesses wouldn't hire only women if they could cut down on labor costs?
It's been proven, time and time again, women don't want to work the same hours men do, or go into the same professions men do. No whining about it at a rally is going to change women into men.
I was amused recently when Google did a pay study on their employees, to try to adjust wages to be more fair between men and women, and ended up having to increase the pay of a lot more men than women.
When you account for the hours, the type of work, and levels of experience, men always put in more time in more valuable jobs for society. We don't need more baristas with gender studies degrees. We need more scientists, inventors, and engineers, and we need them to stick around in the workplace, for long careers. Most women only play at work. They go into a job for a few years, until they find a husband and quit, or quit when they get pregnant. A male employee is a much better investment, and while it's generally illegal to discriminate knowing full well a female employee is likely to be leaving the company in a few short years, it's absurd to compare the salaries of a woman who just started with a man who's been on a 30 year career track.
Seeing as how study after study has shown that women who work instead of having families are generally far less happy with their lives, and those women who do work tend not to work for very long, I think it's absolutely scandalous that women now account for most of the university degrees earned each year. We are frankly wasting resources on short-term employees. Dorm rooms are now filled with young women who will not get degrees that are very important to society, and will ultimately accumulate massive debts they'll never be able to pay off themselves. Men filling those dorm rooms are statistically far more likely to go into important jobs that benefit everyone, stay in those careers for decades, and ultimately contribute far far more to university endowments. This is certainly not politically correct to say, but I think at this point we should be very seriously questioning the wisdom of sending women to college at all, or having women in the workforce at all. Women would be happier not to bother, and men's salaries would likely increase without temporary competition from women. More men would be able to get degrees that add in a big way to the nation's economy, and universities would have more money from financial contributions of graduates, which they could reinvest in improving our educational institutions and doing more cutting-edge research."

Do these Democrats not foresee the voters in their states being extremely outraged if that happened? Do they not see that voters would rebel against a state government that negated their votes and made them meaningless?
Democrats tend not to have the critical thinking skills needed to predict how their lame ideas could backfire on them in a big way. They were warned when they pushed for Harry Reid's nuclear option so Obama could stack the Federal Circuit and Destrict Courts. It opened the door for McConnell to expand the nuclear option for ALL presidential appointees. Now the Democrats are saying they'll send a subpoena to AG Barr demanding that he commit a felony crime by demanding the release of the Mueller report unredacted.
The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is just another example of Democrats violating our laws... picking and choosing which laws they want enforced or not."
