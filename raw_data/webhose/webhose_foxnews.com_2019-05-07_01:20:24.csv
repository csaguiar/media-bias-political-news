Hospital staff errors with gowns and gloves spread antibiotic-resistant bacteria,www.foxnews.com,Reuters,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/hospital-staff-errors-with-gowns-and-gloves-spread-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria,"“No one is perfect and inadvertent health care worker contamination with multi-drug resistant organisms can occur and may be a key step in the spread of potential pathogens in health care settings,” said lead study author Dr. Koh Okamoto of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. “The more we understand how and why contamination happens, the better prepared we are to help health care workers avoid it,” he told Reuters Health by email.
Over a six-month period, Okamoto and colleagues observed 125 health care workers, including 83 nurses and 24 doctors, in four adult intensive care units at their hospital. Half of the doctors and nurses had received formal training in the use of personal protective equipment for the Ebola virus within the previous year, and 90 percent had received “donning and doffing” training within the previous five years.
During the study, the workers oversaw 95 patients with contact precautions for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, as well as vancomycin-resistant Enterococci and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli.
The research team collected 6,000 samples from 5,000 sites around the ICUs, including items that had touched the patient’s body and environmental surfaces such as blood pressure cuffs, call buttons and sinks. They also tested the health care workers’ hands, gloves and gowns before and after patient interactions. In addition, they watched the “doffing,” or removal process, and recorded errors based on Center of Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, which recommends removing gowns and gloves together.
According to a report published in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, they found that more than a third of the health care workers acquired a multidrug-resistant organism during a patient encounter. Notably, four health care workers had it on their hands, four had it on their clothes or jewelry, three had it on their stethoscope, and two had it on their in-hospital mobile phones. About 70 percent of environmental sites had organisms, especially items that were close to patients such as blood pressure cuffs, call buttons and bed rails.
Overall, 49 workers, or 39 percent, made multiple doffing errors and were more likely to have contaminated clothes after a patient interaction. For instance, all four health care workers with hand contamination made errors while removing their gowns and gloves. In particular, hand contamination was 10 times higher when gloves were removed before gowns.
“Our study occurred in a real-world busy ICU setting where the rush of crisis care makes simple slip-ups more likely,” Okamoto said. “This allowed us to better observe donning and doffing methods and potential errors of various healthcare workers.”
Simple interventions are needed that reinforce the preferred order of doffing, which could reduce contamination, he said. Removing gloves and gowns together as a unit, for instance, seemed most helpful in preventing self-contamination.
“While we need more research to better understand potential transmission risk, we can also focus on strategies to assist healthcare workers with properly removing gowns and gloves,” said Sarah Krein of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Krein, who wasn’t involved with this study, has researched infectious agent transmission precautions in hospitals.
For example, signs or cues inside patient rooms could remind healthcare workers of the proper procedures for removing gowns and gloves, she said. Some researchers are also working on a gown redesign that would use color coding to better identify the outside of the gown, so workers can more carefully remove it, roll it up and dispose it.
“Although a seemingly simple process, mistakes can occur during the removal of gowns and gloves,” Krein told Reuters Health by email. “While this doesn’t necessarily lead to an infection, it is important to find better ways to help health care workers with this process to ensure patient and healthcare worker safety.”

Baltimore City Council calls on embattled Mayor Catherine Pugh resign immediately,www.foxnews.com,Lucia Suarez Sang,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/baltimore-city-council-calls-on-embattled-mayor-catherine-pugh-resign-immediately,"The 14 members of the Baltimore City Council sent a two-sentence letter to Pugh on Monday urging her to resign, effective immediately. All members of the city council except acting mayor Bernard C. ""Jack"" Young signed the letter. “The entire membership of the Baltimore City Council believes that it is not in the best interest of the City of Baltimore for you to continue to serve as Mayor,” the council members wrote to Pugh. “We urge you to tender your resignation, effective immediately.”
Copies of the letter were also sent to City Solicitor Andre Davis, Pugh’s chief of staff Bruce Williams, the city’s senators and delegates in the Maryland General Assembly and Young.
Pugh is under fire after she reportedly received $500,000 from the University of Maryland Medical System for her self-authored “Healthy Holly,” a children’s book series.
The university paid Pugh for 100,000 copies of her books between 2011 and 2018 while she was on its board. The books were intended to go to schools and day care centers, however, some 50,000 copies remain unaccounted for and may never have been printed, the Baltimore Sun reported.
The state prosecutor opened an investigation earlier this month into the books’ sales, the Baltimore Sun reported.
Pugh announced last Monday she was taking an indefinite leave of absence to recover from a bout of pneumonia for which she was hospitalized for five days. Her spokesman told the Baltimore Sun on Saturday that Pugh intends to return to her post once her health has sufficiently improved.
This statement appeared to prompt the City Council to urge her to step down.
“Baltimore will continue to have a cloud over its head while the investigations into Mayor Pugh’s business dealings go on,” Councilman Brandon Scott said in a statement . “My colleagues and I understand the severity of the action we have taken, but know that it’s what’s the best for Baltimore.”
Councilman Zeke Cohen said while the move was “unprecedented,” it is the best course for Baltimore.
Pugh, at a news conference last week, described the book deal with the university-based health care system as a ""regrettable mistake,"" and apologized for ""any lack of confidence or disappointment"" citizens and colleagues may have felt.
Pugh has not commented on the city council’s letter.

Moore and Cain aren’t Good Republicans, and that’s why their credentials are called into question. Instead of spending the last two years going after Trump on policy and crafting an attractive agenda, liberals decided the president was a Russian spy. It makes sense they would extend the insanity to his nominees.
The Washington Post’s excitable faux-conservative blogger, Jennifer Rubin, called Cain and Moore “outrageously irresponsible picks.” Rubin goes after any Republican who dares line up with the president on anything -- even on positions Rubin herself once held.

Self-driving spacecraft may save Earth from doomsday,www.foxnews.com,Chris Ciaccia,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/science/self-driving-spacecraft-may-save-earth-from-doomsday,"Iron volcanoes may have erupted on metal asteroids
Judging by the valuations of companies such as Waymo, Lyft and Uber, humanity is placing a big bet on self-driving cars as the future of transportation. But the future of humanity itself may rest on the hopes of self-driving spacecraft.
The European Space Agency is currently developing a self-driving craft for its Hera planetary defense mission to the Didymos asteroid, which could happen as soon as 2023.
“If you think self-driving cars are the future on Earth, then Hera is the pioneer of autonomy in deep space,” Paolo Martino, lead systems engineer of ESA’s proposed Hera mission, said in a statement. “While the mission is designed to be fully operated manually from ground, the new technology will be tested once the core mission objectives are achieved and higher risks can be taken.”
By functioning autonomously, the Hera spacecraft could steer itself in real-time, cutting down precious minutes in space and navigate around potentially treacherous objects in space. Similar to a self-driving car that uses a variety of different sensors and cameras, the spacecraft will also an array of technologies, ESA Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) Engineer Jesus Gil Fernandez, said.
In addition, Hera’s onboard computer will have a dedicated image processing unit, akin to a graphics card in a PC.
“Hera’s most crucial data source will be its Asteroid Framing Camera, combined with inputs from a star-tracker, laser altimeter, thermal infrared camera plus inertial sensors including accelerometers,” Fernandez added in the statement.
By giving autonomy to Hera, it should let the spacecraft get as close as 200 meters (656 feet) from the surface of Didymoon, which would let it take observations as close as 2 centimeters per pixel.
“All other deep-space missions, by comparison, have had a definite driver back on Earth, with navigation commands planned at mission control in ESA’s European Space Operations Centre, before being uplinked to the spacecraft hours later,” GNC engineer Massimo Casasco added. “During Hera’s experimental phase, equivalent decisions will be performed aboard on an autonomous basis in real time.”
The Hera mission is scheduled for launch in October 2023 and would visit the 2,550-foot-wide Didymos asteroid, as well as its satellite, a smaller, but still potentially lethal object, known as Didymoon.
Hera, which will only start testing the autonomous system once all of the major objectives are complete, is just a small part of the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission, according to Space.com. Using its laser altimeter Hera scans Didymoon’s surface. ESA
The AIDA mission also includes a NASA spacecraft headed to the same asteroid system, where its Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is slated to crash into the surface of an asteroid and have two smaller cubesats examine the surface.
NASA has recently expanded its planetary defense protocols, including last year’s unveiling of a bold new plan to protect Earth.
Last June, NASA unveiled a 20-page plan that details steps the US should take to be better prepared for near-Earth objects (NEOs) such as asteroids and comets that come within 30 million miles of the planet.
Lindley Johnson, NASA’s planetary defense officer, said at the time that the country “already has significant scientific, technical and operational capabilities” to help with NEOs, but implementing the new plan would “greatly increase our nation’s readiness and work with international partners to effectively respond should a new potential asteroid impact be detected.”
In addition to enhancing NEO detection, tracking and characterizing capabilities and improving modeling prediction, the plan also aims to develop technologies for deflecting NEOs, increasing international cooperation and establishing new NEO impact emergency procedures and action protocols.

"American tourist, guide who were freed after kidnapping in Uganda pictured as Trump urges captors' capture",www.foxnews.com,Katherine Lam,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-tourist-guide-who-were-freed-after-kidnapping-in-uganda-pictured-as-trump-urges-captors-to-be-caught,"American tourist and her tour guide recently abducted in Uganda have been released American tourist Kimberly Sue Endecott has been released from her kidnapper’s custody in Uganda after a ransom was paid. American tourist Kimberly Sue Endicott and her safari guide were pictured for the first time since they were freed Sunday following five days in captivity at the hands of gunmen who ambushed them in Uganda’s Queen Elizabeth National Park . Endicott and her guide, Jean-Paul Mirenge Ramezo, were greeted by several people on Monday after they were found alive in Congo, where their kidnappers had taken them after abducting them last Tuesday, Ugandan authorities said. Endicott and Ramezo were found in “good health” and placed “in the safe hands of the joint security team” on Sunday.
AMERICAN TOURIST, DRIVER ABDUCTED IN UGANDA RELEASED BY CAPTORS, OFFICIALS SAY
U.S. military drones assisted Ugandan security forces in the recovery of Endicott and Ramezo, U.S. officials told Fox News
Endicott left the Ishasha Wilderness Camp in the national park on Monday for the capital city of Kampala, where she is expected to meet Deborah Ruth Malac, the U.S. Ambassador to Uganda.

President Trump on Monday urged Ugandan officials to work quickly in finding the armed kidnappers still at large.
“Uganda must find the kidnappers of the American Tourist and guide before people will feel safe in going there. Bring them to justice openly and quickly!” Trump tweeted.
Endicott — an aesthetician from Costa Mesa, Calif. — Remezo and two other tourists were in a car between 6 and 7 p.m. Tuesday when four men stopped them and held them at gunpoint. The men took Endicott and Remezo and left the two tourists, who then contacted the camp manager and were taken to safety, Uganda Police Force said.

The captors used Endicott’s phone to demand a $500,000 ransom for the pair's safe return. Ugandan police spokesman Fred Enanga said the armed kidnappers released Endicott and Ramezo because of the “implicit threat of the use of force,” disputing several reports that stated a ransom was paid for their release.
""I have indicated to you that we don't do ransom,"" he said Monday.

A Uganda-based tour official said, however, that a ransom was paid to secure Endicott's freedom. The official with Wild Frontiers Uganda Safaris, which organized the kidnapping victims' safari itinerary, said Monday that Endicott was released -- ""not rescued"" -- after money was paid.
""Otherwise, she wouldn't be back,"" he said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press.

Enanga said authorities were working to find the kidnappers but insisted citizens' and tourists’ safety is their main priority. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni also tweeted the country is safe for tourists, despite Endicott’s terrifying ordeal.
“We shall deal with these isolated pockets of criminals. However, I want to reassure the country and our tourists that Uganda is safe and we shall continue to improve the security in our parks. Come and enjoy the Pearl of Africa,” Museveni tweeted.

Endicott, who is in her 50s, booked the trip to Uganda because it was her dream to see gorillas on a safari in Africa, her friend Pam Lopez, told the Los Angeles Times.
“I know she was planning this trip for a while because it’s something that she’s always wanted to do,” Lopez said. “This was always a big trip she wanted to take.”
Queen Elizabeth National Park, which is located near the porous border with Congo, is Uganda's most popular safari destination. Its attractions also include groups of tree-climbing lions.

Former Romanian leader to face crimes against humanity trial,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/former-romanian-leader-to-face-crimes-against-humanity-trial,"Europe Published 1 hour ago Last Update 54 mins ago Former Romanian leader to face crimes against humanity trial Associated Press Facebook Twitter Flipboard Print Email BUCHAREST, Romania – Former Romanian President Ion Iliescu is to be tried for crimes against humanity for his role in the country&apos;s bloody 1989 anti-communist uprising.
Prosecutor General Augustin Lazar announced Monday that the investigations are complete and the files documenting the events of 30 years ago, commonly referred to as the Revolution File, will be submitted to a court of law. He called the completion of the process ""paying a debt of honor to history and our country.""
Iliescu is the most prominent figure to face trial, along with Gelu Voican-Voiculescu, a former vice premier, and former Air Force Chief Iosif Rus. They are all accused of crimes against humanity.
The charges refer to a five-day period when Iliescu seized power after former Communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu fled Bucharest on Dec. 22, 1989. Ceausescu and his wife were summarily tried and executed on Dec. 25. Some 1,100 people died during the revolt, the vast majority after Ceausescu&apos;s ouster.
Military investigators who reopened the file in 2016 said the new political and military leadership that took control was directly involved in spreading fake news via the state broadcaster in order to create a state of panic regarding a possible ""terrorist threat."" This also set the stage for a ""simulated trial"" that ended with the execution of the Ceausescus.
Romanian President Klaus Iohannis saluted the announcement in a statement, saying that ""finalizing the judicial investigation into the Revolution events, 30 years since Communism collapsed, is a necessary act and honors our heroes."" He concluded that ""the crimes of the Revolution cannot go unpunished."""

Seeing the commotion, Bathily shouted, “I’ll stop him, officers!” and kicked into gear, speeding ahead of the suspect and blocking his path with the bike, according to a Facebook post shared by the precinct. Bathily, originally from Mali in West Africa, told CBS New York he jumped off his bike and “sat on [the suspect] on the floor” until officers arrived, though the NYPD had not confirmed that claim on Facebook.
Police confirmed that Bathily’s actions delayed the suspect, identified as Lovell Ambrister, long enough for officers to apprehend him.
“Yeah, he&apos;s in jail now, and we&apos;re told the pizza guy still managed to honor the 30 minute delivery guarantee on the pie,” police wrote.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio also hailed Bathily as a “hero” and credited the delivery man with being the “only reason” New Yorkers should consider eating Domino’s pizza.
Domino&apos;s, too, has said it was proud to count Bathily as a member of its team.
""We are certainly very proud of this driver and his actions that made a difference in his local community,"" a spokesperson for the chain tells Fox News.
Ambrister is accused of stealing a woman’s Apple AirPods just an hour before he was apprehended, and after having harassed that woman with a group of other people. Police say that during the chase, he also began tossing “fake $50 bills out of his pockets,” as he was in the process of trying to exchange the counterfeit money for legal tender at nearby shops.
Ambrister was charged with robbery, forgery, petit larceny, and trademark counterfeiting, CBS New York confirmed.

"James Jay Carafano: If Trump critics think DHS resignation will change his mind on the border, think again",www.foxnews.com,James Jay Carafano,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/james-jay-carafano-if-trump-critics-think-dhs-resignation-will-change-his-mind-on-the-border-think-again,"So, it’s not surprising that the president decided to change leadership at the Department of Homeland Security. When Trump doesn’t get results, he shakes things up. That’s always been his way. Kirstjen Nielsen is a tough woman who took on a tough job. She faithfully served her president and the nation.
TEXAS GRAPPLING WITH RECORD NUMBER OF MIGRANTS CROSSING INTO US
I worked with Kirstjen for decades as part of the community of scholars and practitioners who advocated for effective homeland security policies. We served together on the presidential transition team. Kirstjen gave the administration two years of dedicated service, working in a variety of roles. Every day she put the nation and the mission first. The president could not have asked for a more loyal and dedicated supporter.
Her critics on the right and left are off base. Those who want to intimate that she was soft on the president’s “get tough” approach to border security and immigration enforcement are just wrong. On the other side, those who attack her being too tough are in denial about the problems her department must deal with.
What are some of those problems? For starters, there is a humanitarian crisis at the border. Every day, innocent children are placed at risk. Every day, families endure unspeakable hardships.
The hypocrisy is maddening. The crisis at the border could be quickly brought under control if Congress would take the necessary and common sense steps.
But don’t blame the secretary or the president. Blame activists who are organizing and encouraging caravans and bogus asylum-seekers to rush the border. Blame multi-billion-dollar criminal cartels that exploit human trafficking. Blame ineffective leaders in Congress who deny a crisis exists—even as illegal immigration soars and conditions deteriorate.
Some of Kirstjen’s critics are little more than enablers—perpetuating policies that have encouraged what amounts to a modern-day trail of tears—all because they see this human misery as a lever that can be used in their ongoing, partisan political battle with the president.
The hypocrisy is maddening. The crisis at the border could be quickly brought under control if Congress would take these necessary and common sense steps: fund the wall; provide adequate resources for detention; speed up asylum claims processing, and close the legal loopholes that allow activists and criminals to encourage flooding America with unprecedented numbers of illegal immigrants.
But Trump’s political opponents will have none of that. Instead, they call for amnesties and open borders, which will only open the floodgates wider.
The real loser here is not Kirstjen. She can be proud of her service to the American people and the president. It is not Trump, who will relentlessly pursue protecting the nation. Those who will lose the most are American citizens. They will have to bear the cost of providing social services to millions of illegal immigrants.
Absent congressional willingness to fix the immigration system, the president has few options other than to do whatever he can to secure the border. Trump is not one to stand by and not try every possible legal option to get the job done—and that includes shaking up the team. On Team Trump, no one is more important than the mission. The president rightfully thanked the secretary for her service. Now the challenge is to impress on new leaders the need to keep at it.
Perhaps the strongest message here is for the president’s detractors. If they think he will ever back off in pursuit of securing the border and fixing a broken immigration system they are wrong. His latest action is just another reminder of that.

“This designation is a direct response to an outlaw regime and should surprise no one,” he said. “The IRGC masquerades as a legitimate military organization, but none of us should be fooled.”
The designation imposes sanctions that include freezes on assets the IRGC may have in U.S. jurisdictions and a ban on Americans doing business with it. The move also allows the U.S. to deny entry to people found to have provided the Guard with material support or prosecute them for sanctions violations.
In a statement, Trump said the unprecedented move “underscores the fact that Iran’s actions are fundamentally different from those of other governments.”
Video He warned: “If you are doing business with the IRGC, you will be bankrolling terrorism. This action sends a clear message to Tehran that its support for terrorism has serious consequences.”
Administration officials have said the step will further isolate Iran and make clear that the U.S. won&apos;t tolerate Iran&apos;s continued support for rebel groups and others that destabilize the Middle East.
""The IRGC&apos;s active support for terrorism is unacceptable, and the Department of Justice continues to support the administration&apos;s efforts to hold the Iranian regime accountable for its actions,"" Attorney General William Barr said in a statement.
The designation, however, may also have widespread implications for American personnel and policy in the region and elsewhere as Iran has threatened to retaliate.
It will also complicate diplomacy. Without exclusions or waivers to the designation, U.S. troops and diplomats could be barred from contact with Iraqi or Lebanese authorities who interact with Guard officials or surrogates.
Video The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies have raised concerns about the impact of the designation if the move does not allow contact with foreign officials who may have met with or communicated with Guard personnel. Those concerns have in part dissuaded previous administrations from taking the step, which has been considered for more than a decade.
The move, as expected, also was panned by Iranian officials, who called it a gift to Israel.
""A(nother) misguided election-eve gift to Netanyahu,"" Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, tweeted on Monday. ""A(nother) dangerous U.S. misadventure in the region.""

Tourists could face the death penalty for taking photos on beach near airport,www.foxnews.com,Alexandra Deabler,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/tourists-could-face-the-death-penalty-for-taking-photos-on-beach-near-airport,"Roller coaster gets stuck, traps riders at UK theme park
Picture-obsessed tourists visiting Thailand’s Mai Khao beach might want to put their phones down — or they stand to face the death penalty.
Authorities are cracking down on visitors to the beach, which borders one of the country’s busiest airports, Phuket International Airport, after it has become popular with tourists looking to take snaps with low-flying planes.
The portion of the beach near the airport’s runway has become known as “Unseen Phuket,” and tourists flock to the section to pose with the landing planes.
According to the Bangkok Post , authorities have become more concerned as the beach has grown in popularity and is developing a new safety zone near the runway that will ban people from entering. Authorities fear the influx of people on the beach could pose as a distraction for pilots.
Airport chief Wichit Kaeothaithiam told the Bangkok Post that stricter regulations must be applied as required by the International Civil Aviation Organization and violators must be subject to punishments under the Air Navigation Act.
Violators allegedly will face harsh punishments, such as a fine of $1,253 or a jail sentence of up to 20 years, The Sun reported . Shutterstock
“The maximum penalty is the death sentence,” he shared with the Bangkok Post.
Tourists looking to snag selfies with low-flying aircraft have been a problem at another popular beach, as well.
Maho Beach on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has suffered deaths and criticisms over its tourists who want to get an up-close plane pic.
A 57-year-old woman vacationing in Saint Martin was killed after a blast from a nearby jet knocked her to the ground. Officials say the woman had been holding onto a fence that separates the beach from the airport when winds generated by the jet’s engines blasted her back.
More recently, an acrobatic couple was criticized for performing a one-handed headstand inches away from a cargo plane. Performers Oleg Kolisnichenko, 36, and Yuliia Nos, 25, appear to be just feet away from the aircraft in the daring snap.
“It didn’t touch my feet but I felt so much air from the plane and I lost my balance. It was so much fun and exciting but it was only after I realized how dangerous it was,” Nos said to SWNS. Share this:"
Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's 'Shazam!' spinoff 'Black Adam' to enter production next year,www.foxnews.com,Fox News,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/dwayne-johnsons-black-adam-set-to-enter-production-next-year,"One of Shazam’s biggest adversaries in the comic books is the enigmatic supervillain Black Adam. The villain, portrayed as a corrupt antihero in recent DC Comics, has been rumored to be getting his own film to coincide with “Shazam!” For the past few years, the “Black Adam” production has been rumored to star none other than Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson — and now, those rumors may finally be coming to life. In an Instagram video, The Rock revealed plans for the “Black Adam” film, which is set to begin production within the next year.
“Black Adam is an antihero, or villain, who I cannot wait to play. I’ve been developing this and it’s been with me in my DNA for over 10 years now. We should start shooting that in about a year. Very excited about it,” Johnson told his followers on IGTV.
Initially, the character was slated to appear in “Shazam!,” but was eventually passed on as, “The challenges and the struggle that we were having and that was gnawing at my gut is that we were trying to tell two origin stories in one script.”
Eventually, Black Adam was excluded from the production of “Shazam!”—allowing for Black Adam to be featured in his own standalone film.
While The Rock did not make any appearances in “Shazam!,” he was credited as an executive producer through his Seven Bucks Production studio—a startup Johnson co-founded with ex-wife Dany Garcia.

Trump choice at Homeland Security focuses on border,www.foxnews.com,COLLEEN LONG and ZEKE MILLER,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/nielsen-out-at-homeland-security-as-trump-focuses-on-border,"Nielsen out at Homeland Security as Trump focuses on border By COLLEEN LONG and ZEKE MILLER | Associated Press Email
FILE - In this Friday, Oct. 26, 2018, file photo, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, left, speaks with Border Patrol agents near a newly fortified border wall structure in Calexico, Calif. In a tweet on Sunday, April 7, 2019, President Donald Trump said he's accepted Nielsen's resignation. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) WASHINGTON – Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has resigned amid President Donald Trump's growing frustration and bitterness over the number of Central American families crossing the southern border. Trump announced on Sunday in a tweet that U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan would be taking over as acting head of the department. McAleenan is a longtime border official who is well respected by many members of Congress and within the administration. The decision to name a top immigration officer to the post reflects Trump's priority for the sprawling department founded to combat terrorism following the Sept. 11 attacks.
""I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside,"" Nielsen wrote in her resignation letter . ""I hope that the next secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America's borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation's discourse.""
Though Trump aides were eyeing a staff shake-up at the Department of Homeland Security and had already withdrawn the nomination for another key immigration post, the development Sunday was unexpected.
Still, it was unclear how McAleenan would immediately assume the role. The agency's undersecretary of management, Claire Grady, is technically next in line for the job.
Nielsen traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday with Trump to participate in a roundtable with border officers and local law enforcement. There she echoed Trump's comments on the situation at the border, though she ducked out of the room while Trump spoke. As they toured a section of newly rebuilt barriers, Nielsen was at Trump's side, introducing him to local officials. She returned to Washington afterward as Trump continued on a fundraising trip to California and Nevada.
Nielsen had grown increasingly frustrated by what she saw as a lack of support from other departments and increased meddling by Trump aides on difficult immigration issues, according to three people familiar with details of her resignation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.
She went into the White House on Sunday to meet with Trump not knowing whether she'd be fired or would resign. She ended up resigning, though she was not forced to do so, they said.
Nielsen, who says she's staying on until Wednesday, is the latest person felled in the Trump administration's unprecedented churn of top staff and Cabinet officials, brought about by the president's mercurial management style, insistence on blind loyalty and rash policy announcements.
Nielsen was also the highest profile female Cabinet member, and her exit leaves DHS along with the Pentagon and the White House staff itself without permanent heads. Patrick Shanahan has held the post of acting defense secretary since the former secretary, Jim Mattis, was pushed out in December over criticism of the president's Syria withdrawal plans. Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney has held his post since January, following John Kelly's resignation last year.
McAleenan has helped shape many of the administration's policies to date and is considered highly competent by congressional leaders, the White House and Homeland Security officials. But it's unclear if he can have much more of an effect on the issues at the border. The Trump administration has bumped up against legal restrictions and court rulings that have hamstrung many of its major efforts to remake border security.
Rep. Joaquin Castro, chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, was critical of Nielsen, saying she spent her tenure ""championing President Trump's cruel anti-immigrant agenda,"" and he called McAleenan's appointment ""deeply disturbing.""
""He cannot be trusted as Acting DHS Secretary based on his record of prioritizing Trump's harmful policies that undermine national security and the economy, and hurt vulnerable families and children at the border,"" Castro, a Texas Democrat, said in a statement.
Tensions between the White House and Nielsen have persisted almost from the moment she became secretary, after her predecessor, Kelly, became the White House chief of staff in 2017. Nielsen was viewed as resistant to some of the harshest immigration measures supported by the president and his aides, particularly senior adviser Stephen Miller, both on matters around the border and others like protected status for some refugees.
Once Kelly left the White House, Nielsen's days appeared to be numbered, and she had expected to be pushed out last November.
During the government shutdown over Trump's insistence for funding for a border wall, Nielsen's standing inside the White House appeared to rise. But in recent weeks, as a new wave of migration has taxed resources along the border and as Trump sought to regain control of the issue for his 2020 re-election campaign, tensions flared anew.
The final straw came when Trump gave Nielsen no heads-up or opportunity to discuss his decision to pull the nomination of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Ron Vitiello — a move seen as part of a larger effort by Miller, an immigration hardliner, and his allies at the White House to clean house at the department and bring in more people who share their views, the people said.
Nielsen had wanted to discuss the move with Trump during their visit to the border Friday, but when there was no time, she asked for the meeting Sunday. She walked into it prepared to resign, depending on what she heard. The people described mounting frustrations on both sides, with Trump exasperated at the situation at the border and Nielsen frustrated by White House actions she felt were counterproductive.
Arrests along the southern border have skyrocketed recently. Border agents are on track to make 100,000 arrests and denials of entry at the southern border in March, more than half of which are families with children. A press conference to announce the most recent border numbers — scheduled to be held by McAleenan on Monday — was postponed.
Nielsen dutifully pushed Trump's immigration policies, including funding for his border wall, and defended the administration's practice of separating children from parents. She told a Senate committee that removing children from parents facing criminal charges happens ""in the United States every day."" But she was also instrumental in ending the policy.
Under Nielsen, migrants seeking asylum are waiting in Mexico as their cases progress. She also moved to abandon longstanding regulations that dictate how long children are allowed to be held in immigration detention and requested bed space from the U.S. military for 12,000 people in an effort to detain all families who cross the border. Right now there is space for about 3,000 families, and facilities are at capacity.
Nielsen also advocated for strong cybersecurity defense and often said she believed the next major terror attack would occur online — not by planes or bombs. She was tasked with helping states secure elections following Russian interference during the 2018 election.
She led the federal agency since December 2017 and was this administration's third Homeland Security secretary. A protege of Kelly's, he brought her to the White House after Trump named him chief of staff.
Nielsen, 45, previously served as a special assistant to President George W. Bush and worked for the Transportation Security Administration.
She rose through the Trump ranks quickly — joining the transition team after the election to help guide Kelly through the confirmation process. She quickly became a trusted aide to Kelly, and the two worked together to impose order on a dysfunctional White House that lacked clear lines of command.
House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said her tenure was ""a disaster from the start."" The policies she helped create ""have been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border.""
His Senate counterpart, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said the government needed ""steady, informed and effective leadership in the administration and in Congress to have any hope of fixing our out-of-control border security and immigration problems.""

AMC'S 'THE WALKING DEAD' KILLS OFF 10 CHARACTERS IN ONE EPISODE
“Showing audiences an unseen pocket of ‘The Walking Dead’ Universe steeped in a new mythology is a very cool way to celebrate a ‘Decade of the Dead’ on TV and over fifteen years of Robert Kirkman’s brilliant comic,” Gimple added. “Matt Negrete is one of the best writer-producers in ‘TWD’s’ long history — I'm thrilled to be working beside him to tell stories unlike we’ve seen before, taking our first step into an even larger world.”

Dr. Carlos Tunnerman, a member of the opposition Civic Alliance, waves from the backseat of car after taking part in a day of negotiations in Managua, Nicaragua, Thursday, Feb. 28, 2019. Nicaraguan government and opposition representatives began a second day of negotiations Thursday on resolving the country's political standoff, amid an atmosphere of rumor, secrecy and an early lack of consensus on key points. (AP Photo/Alfredo Zuniga) MANAGUA, Nicaragua – A representative of President Daniel Ortega said the government is working in good faith to find common ground with the opposition as talks on defusing Nicaragua's political standoff finished a third day Friday without deals on key sticking points. The first public comment from Ortega's camp since the negotiations began Wednesday came as a small group of university students held an anti-Ortega demonstration, defying a de facto ban on opposition protests since September after hundreds died in unrest last year.
Sandinista Front lawmaker Wilfredo Navarro, a member of Ortega's delegation, told journalists before discussions began for the day that the talks are advancing and ""there is a common will to work and achieve results.""
""The government is making every effort. ... We are sitting down with all the will in the world to achieve agreements,"" Navarro said.
However, asked about opposition demands for the presence of international ""guarantors"" at the talks, he rejected the idea at least for the near term.
""There cannot be guarantors right now,"" Navarro said. ""If we have still not reached agreements, what is there to guarantee?""
The opposition group Civic Alliance said it hoped to win approval of a so-called roadmap, with the goal of negotiating with ""clear rules of the game.""
The dialogue at a business institute south of the capital, Managua, is a kind of restart to previous talks that broke down last summer seeking to find a way to put an end to the crisis.
Talks concluded for the day Friday with negotiators still working to establish the rules for the negotiations. They agreed to continue meeting Monday through Friday next week.
At least 325 people were killed last year, according to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, as protests beginning in April were met by a deadly crackdown by security forces and armed, pro-government civilian groups.
Ortega opponents accused him of increasingly authoritarian rule and demanded he leave office and allow early elections; government officials alleged that protesters were effectively attempting a coup d'etat.
Large and widespread demonstrations all but vanished following the crackdown, but political tensions remain high with hundreds of people behind bars and thousands more in hiding or exile.
At the Central American University's campus in Managua on Friday, perhaps a few dozen students, some with their faces masked by bandannas, rallied and shouted slogans such as ""Long live a free Nicaragua!"" and ""Democracy yes, dictatorship no!""
""They were students, not criminals,"" they cried, in allusion to young people killed in 2018 when police broke up demonstrations including with live rounds.
Police were deployed to the campus, and a journalist was struck by a rubber bullet but not seriously hurt. There were no other reports of any injuries.
Unlike last year's talks, which were broadcast live, this week's dialogue has been held behind closed doors, leading to speculation and rumor in the absence of much concrete information about their content.
Navarro acknowledged that the discussions have been ""difficult"" but denied there had been any setback or breakdown.
""What is said outside is nothing more than a sideshow to make the negotiation tense,"" he said. ""This dialogue has many enemies.""
Mario Arana, a businessman and one of the Civic Alliance negotiators, said they are trying to narrow the gap on the 12-point ""roadmap,"" of which nine points have already been agreed.
Both sides have agreed not to release details prematurely, he added, and ""we are probably heading toward greater secrecy.""
Besides the presence of international guarantors from an institution such as the Organization of American States, the United Nations or the European Union, the opposition's demands include election reform; the release of hundreds of people it considers political prisoners; a restoration of freedom of expression rights after an effective ban on opposition protests and the shutdown of some independent media outlets; and justice for victims of the crackdown and their families.
Azahalea Solis, a lawyer and alternate negotiator for the opposition, said it is ""unacceptable"" for police to detain civilians and boost patrols in Managua even as the talks are going on.
""It is fundamental for there to be an atmosphere of peace in the country,"" Solis said. ""All of Nicaragua is being held hostage and persecuted."" Trending in World"

Aguerri contends the government’s new plan to cut pension payments and raise payroll taxes will cause more joblessness and capital flight, run businesses into bankruptcy and inflate the cost of basic goods. (AP Photo/Alfredo Zuniga) MANAGUA, Nicaragua – Nicaraguans revolted last April when the government announced it was raising payroll taxes and cutting retirement benefits to bolster a social security program hemorrhaging money. The unrest led authorities to quickly withdraw the measure, but as the protests boiled for months and broadened into demands that President Daniel Ortega leave office, security forces responded with a harsh crackdown that killed over 300 people. Hundreds more were arrested and an estimated 50,000 fled into exile.
Now, with the dissident movement cowed, a new plan to cut pension payments by 30 to 40 percent and raise payroll taxes is taking effect. And economists and businesspeople are warning that it threatens to have even more severe effects for Nicaraguans and could plunge the country into deeper recession and unemployment.
""This measure is absolutely much more drastic since it's not gradual but instead immediate, and it will affect the nearly 800,000 insured in the country,"" said Mario Arana, who was minister for development, head of the Treasury and president of Nicaragua's Central Bank during the 2001-2006 administration of Ortega's predecessor.
""All sectors of the economy will be damaged,"" Arana said.
The social security package was approved in January by a legislature dominated by Ortega's allies and took effect Feb. 1.
Businesses with over 50 employees will see their social security tax payments rise from 19 percent to 22.5 percent of pay while the tax on a worker's wages will go from 6.25 percent to 7 percent. The tax on independent workers increases from 18.25 percent to 22.25 percent of income.
At the same time, the tax that funds disability, age and death insurance programs is rising from 10 percent to 14 percent.
That has people like Mercedez Ramirez, who owns a beauty salon in the capital of Managua, worried. Over the last decade, she has already seen her clientele plummet and had to lay off two of her four stylists. Now she doesn't know if she can afford the social security taxes for the two who remain.
""This situation can't go on,"" Ramirez said.""If I let my employees go I'll have to close my business and then ... what will we live on? My children are out of work.""
Gustavo Porras, an Ortega ally who heads congress, which begins a new session Tuesday, said the change aims to ""guarantee payment of all pensions and the rights of workers that were won under this government.""
Yet authorities have not detailed how reforms will affect the finances of the Social Security Institute. Nor have they said whether they will address administrative costs at the agency, whose budget as of November was running at a record deficit of $86 million, up 57 percent from a year earlier.
Enrique Saenz, an economist and former lawmaker who left Nicaragua months ago due to his opposition to Ortega, characterizes the crisis at the institute as a problem of Ortega's own creation, blaming ""fiscal mismanagement, professional incompetence and irresponsible populism.""
Saenz said the institute was operating with a $60 million surplus when Ortega returned to power in 2007. But over the last 12 years its administrative costs more than doubled and its payroll more than tripled to over 4,000 workers, while executive positions rose from 10 to 136, he said.
The International Monetary Fund has been warning since 2017 that the agency's troubled finances threatened what had been relative stability in Nicaragua before the political crisis. The economy had been averaging annual GDP growth of about 4.5 percent since 2014.
Despite the new tax increases, Nicaragua has not seen a repeat of last year's mass protests. And it seems unlikely to, since Ortega, a 73-year-old ex-guerrilla who was first president from 1985 to 1990, forcefully quashed the challenge to his power, including effectively outlawing opposition demonstrations since September.
The Associated Press and rights groups have documented physical abuse and torture of some people taken into custody. Many others lost jobs, were expelled from universities, or suffered other reprisals for taking part in protests.
""We are not in the streets because there is a state of terror in Nicaragua, because there are police and shock troops that arrest you and beat you,"" said Ana Margarita Vijil, leader of the dissident Sandinista Renewal Movement, which the government accuses of promoting a ""terrorist coup.""
Still, Vijil insists there will be protests because ""this type of reforms ... only aggravate the crisis.""
The 2018 political crisis pummeled the Central American nation's economy, particularly tourism, commerce, infrastructure and investment. About 350,000 jobs were lost, including 160,000 that paid into the social security system, and the economy contracted 4 percent, according to World Bank figures.
Jose Adan Aguerri, president of the High Council of Private Enterprise, contends the new overhaul will cause more joblessness and capital flight, run businesses into bankruptcy and inflate the cost of basic goods. The council is preparing to mount a legal challenge.
""Let us remember that the political cost of applying these reforms and provoking more unemployment will be on the hands of the government,"" Aguerri said Friday at a news conference.
According to the Central Bank, about 58 percent of the workers who receive social security payments get less than $307 a month. The cost of the basic monthly food basket stood at $415 as of December.
Also worried are some 82,000 Nicaraguans who are over 55 years old and about to retire, and whose pensions stand to fall by 30 percent to 40 percent.
""I turn 60 this year and plan to retire in October, but under this law I will no longer get $400 in a monthly pension but just $280,"" said a private accountant who insisted on speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals. Trending in World"

NY county considers next steps after judge rules against emergency order amid measles outbreak,www.foxnews.com,Todd Piro,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/ny-county-considers-next-steps-amid-measles-outbreak,"Rockland County enacted the emergency order last month to fight the measles outbreak that, as of Friday, has infected 167 people since October, according to the County’s health department. The 30-day declaration barred unvaccinated children from schools, houses of worship and other public areas and the ban included children with a religious exception. In ruling against the declaration, acting Supreme Court Justice Rolf Thorsen decided in favor of several dozen parents challenging Rockland County Executive Ed Day’s order, according to the New York Post . The parents challenging the emergency order said it violated their First Amendment right to exercise their freedom of religion. Thorsen said the county’s measles outbreak didn’t rise to the level of an “epidemic” meriting an emergency declaration.
Rockland County officials disagree with Thorsen&apos;s ruling and are meeting with legal and health professionals Monday to “identify potential new strategies” to address the outbreak.
In a statement sent to Fox News, Day said, “My Administration refuses to sit idly by while those in Rockland are put at risk.”
He added, “It is unacceptable to the health of all in our County and we will do everything in our power to ensure the public health of Rockland is strong and vital.”
According to health officials, the number of U.S. measles cases through the first three months of this year have surpassed the count for all of 2018. There have been 387 cases of measles through March of 2019 compared to 372 cases reported for all of last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
This year&apos;s numbers have been driven by outbreaks in several states, including New York, California, Texas, Illinois and Washington.
Measles is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it is extremely contagious. Health officials said most people who contract measles have not been vaccinated. The measles vaccine is 97% effective, according to the CDC.
The most common symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough, and a rash all over the body. However, a very small fraction of people can suffer complications like pneumonia and swelling of the brain.

Cena made his way to the ring while a flustered Elias clamored for attention to be returned to his musical performance.
Hopping on the mic, Cena delivered some blistering insults to the “The Drifter.”
“Silence your cell phone, hold your applause, shut your mouth and no string plucks. Feels like I’m watching one of my movies ‘cause this whole damn thing sucks,” said Cena to a huge crowd reaction.
“I’m a bad man, my style like a pitbull bit you. And you ain’t even half a dog, you just a little piece of Shih Tzu,” Cena continued.
In an interview with WWE.com, Cena stated on his return, ""I wasn&apos;t supposed to be here and I wanted to do something that would be a nice surprise and a bit of entertainment in a show that is filled with the culmination of a lot of stories. The idea came up and I immediately said yes.""

British woman faces jail time in Dubai for ‘insulting’ post about ex-husband’s new wife,www.foxnews.com,Lucia Suarez Sang,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/british-woman-faces-jail-time-in-dubai-for-insulting-post-about-ex-husbands-new-wife,"Laleh Shahravesh, 55, of London was arrested along with her teenage daughter at the airport in Dubai last month after visiting the United Arab Emirates for her ex-husband’s funeral. According to Detained in Dubai , she was taken into custody for two Facebook posts made while living in the United Kingdom in 2016 that discussed her husband&apos;s remarriage. Her daughter, 14, was eventually allowed to leave and is staying with relatives in London.
Shahravesh, however, faces up to two years in prison or a $652,000 fine.
The United Arab Emirates' cybercrime laws say that a person can be jailed or fined for making defamatory statements on social media. (istock)
The group said Shahravesh and her ex-husband were married for 18 years and lived in Dubai for an eight-month period while he worked for HSBC there.
At some point, she returned to London with their daughter, 14, allegedly with the understanding that he would join them at a later date, after his work commitments ended.
Months later, however, the couple divorced. Shahravesh apparently discovered her ex-husband was remarrying when she saw posts of the new couple on Facebook.
She posted two comments in Farsi, including one that said: “I hope you go under the ground you idiot. Damn you. You left me for this horse.”
The second comment said: “You married a horse you idiot.”
Now, the 55-year-old has been accused of breaking the UAE’s cybercrime laws, which states a person can be jailed or fined for making defamatory statements on social media.
Detained in Dubai says Shahravesh’s ex-husband’s widow, who is Tunisian and lives in Dubai, reported the comments to authorities.
Radha Stirling, the chief executive of Detained in Dubai, which is helping Shahravesh, said her client has been bailed out of jail, but authorities have confiscated her passport.

She said Shahravesh is “absolutely distraught” about the entire ordeal and has checked into a hotel in Dubai to await trial.
In comments released by the campaign group, Shahravesh acknowledged she “reacted badly” when she lashed out on Facebook.
“I know I shouldn&apos;t have. I should have behaved better, but I felt angry, betrayed and hurt,” Shahravesh told the group. ""After 18 years of marriage, such a small amount of time apart, he was getting married so quickly. He didn&apos;t even have enough respect for me to tell me in advance.""
Shahravesh, who was born in Iran but moved to the U.K. as a child and holds a British passport, said she traveled to Dubai because her daughter wanted to say goodbye to her father, who died March 3.
A Foreign Office spokesman told reporters its staff is supporting a British woman and her family following her detention in the United Arab Emirates, but the woman was not identified.
“We are in contact with the UAE authorities regarding her case,” the spokesman said.

President Trump on Monday signed legislation authorizing the honorary promotion of former Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., from captain to colonel in the U.S. Army in recognition of his service in World War II .
The legislation, which was passed unanimously last month by the House of Representatives after going through the Senate, recognizes Dole's time spent in the armed forces during World War II, where he earned two Purple Hearts and was twice awarded the Bronze Star Medal with Valor.
""I was proud to wear our nation's uniform 77 years ago when I enlisted, and my pride in America's brave servicemen and women continues today,"" Dole said in a statement in March, when Congress passed the legislation authorizing his promotion.
The 95-year-old Dole, who ran for president in 1996, was last seen publicly in December when he rose from a wheelchair to salute the coffin of former President George H.W. Bush in the Capitol rotunda.
Dole, who represented Kansas in the U.S. House and Senate for a total of 35 years, was injured by German machine gun fire while serving as an infantry lieutenant in 1945 in the European theater. The injury left him with limited use of his right arm.
Trump last year praised Dole as a “great American” during a presentation awarding the former lawmaker the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor bestowed by Congress."
Jeep's two-door pickups are ready to rock...crawl,www.foxnews.com,Gary Gastelu,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/jeeps-two-door-pickups-are-ready-to-rock-crawl,"Jeep Published 6 days ago Jeep's 2-door pickups are ready to rock...crawl By Gary Gastelu | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email close Video Secrets of Jeep design Mark Allen, Head of Jeep Design, talks to Fox News Autos about what goes into styling the popular SUVs and what to expect from the new ones on the way.
The new 4-door Jeep Gladiator pickup is off to a strong start after the automaker received 4,190 orders on the day it opened the books for a special Launch Edition, but it’s already teasing the idea of a 2-door.
(Jeep)
Jeep always brings a batch of custom trucks to the annual Moab Easter Jeep Safari off-roading event in Utah and this year’s includes a concept called the J6 that’s a Gladiator modified with a single cab and a 6-foot bed.
(Jeep)
The Gladiator Rubicon-based truck was created to show off some of the accessories Jeep’s working on for it, and includes several prototype pieces like a light bar, in-bed spare tire rack and deep-dish 5-spoke beadlock wheels. The blue pickup also features a body-color spray-in bedliner, which would be a factory first if it makes it into production.
(Jeep)
Jeep used to sell a conversion kit that turned a 4-door Jeep Wrangler Unlimited into a 2-door pickup similar to the J6, but hasn’t offered a production truck like it since the 1980&apos;s Scrambler.
(Jeep)
Speaking of which, Jeep has also outfitted a 4-door Gladiator with a classic Scrambler graphics package for the event that&apos;s loaded with accessories and rides on 37-inch tires, but the retro look is what it’s all about.
(Jeep)
It can’t compete with the Jeep M-715 Five-Quarter for classic styling, though. The resto-modded 1968 Kaiser Jeep M-715 military truck has been updated with rear coil springs, Rubicon bumpers, modern Dynatrac axles a chopped convertible top and a perforated tailgate and bedsides. It’s also equipped with a 707 hp 6.2-liter supercharged “Hellcrate” V8 that’s slightly more powerful than the 132.5 hp Tornado straight-six the truck was originally powered by.

Ashley Wright told Good Morning America that she is frustrated by the lack of answers after her 10-year-old daughter Raniya died in the hospital two days after the March 25 fight at Forest Hills Elementary School in Walterboro.
""I want to know everything,"" Wright said ""And they didn&apos;t have no answers for me at all.""
The Colleton County School District released a statement last week saying they understand everyone is looking for answers, but it is critical to let the criminal investigation into the fight and the girl&apos;s death to finish before more information is released.
Prosecutor Duffie Stone said on March 29, the day of the girl&apos;s autopsy, that investigators need to test tissue and other samples taken from her which will take weeks, and charges may not be filed.
Other students in Raniya&apos;s class told her family that the other fifth grader involved in the fight had been bothering Raniya all day before coming up behind her and hitting or pushing her, Ashley Wright said.
""She pushed her or rammed her head or something into a bookshelf,"" Ashley Wright said.
The other fifth grader has been suspended. Her name and age have not been released.
State Sen. Margie Bright Matthews, who represents the area around the school, said she has talked to law enforcement, school officials, the substitute teacher in the class that day, and family members of both students.
Bright Matthews praised law enforcement, saying they separated the students in the classroom and questioned them all two separate times before they went home following the fight.
The Democratic senator said she was told the fight appeared to be just a small scuffle that was broken up, there were not repeated blows to anyone&apos;s head, and Raniya appeared OK after the altercation.
Raniya began complaining of a headache later in the principal&apos;s office, threw up and then lost consciousness, Bright Matthews said.
Ashley Wright said she got a call from the school nurse who said her daughter was complaining of dizziness and a headache. She said Raniya didn&apos;t have any serious medical conditions before the fight, but by the time she made it to the school, things had gotten much worse.
""No one called me back,"" Ashley Wright said. ""All I saw was my daughter hooked to all these machines and cords."""

Global warming is shrinking glaciers faster than we thought,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/science/global-warming-is-shrinking-glaciers-faster-than-we-thought,"Email

Scientists say it is one of the fastest melting glaciers in the world due to climate change and its relative proximity to the Equator. It has lost 60 percent of its mass and shrunk 250 meters since 1982. (AP Photo/Sam McNeil) WASHINGTON (AP) — Earth's glaciers are melting much faster than scientists thought. A new study shows they are losing 369 billion tons of snow and ice each year, more than half of that in North America. The most comprehensive measurement of glaciers worldwide found that thousands of inland masses of snow compressed into ice are shrinking 18 percent faster than an international panel of scientists calculated in 2013.
The world's glaciers are shrinking five times faster now than they were in the 1960s. Their melt is accelerating due to global warming, and adding more water to already rising seas, the study found.
""Over 30 years suddenly almost all regions started losing mass at the same time,"" said lead author Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service at the University of Zurich. ""That's clearly climate change if you look at the global picture.""
THIS FUTURISTIC, FLOATING CITY CAN WITHSTAND CATEGORY 5 HURRICANES
The glaciers shrinking fastest are in central Europe, the Caucasus region, western Canada, the U.S. Lower 48 states, New Zealand and near the tropics. Glaciers in these places on average are losing more than 1 percent of their mass each year, according to a study in Monday's journal Nature .
""In these regions, at the current glacier loss rate, the glaciers will not survive the century,"" Zemp said.
Zemp's team used ground and satellite measurements to look at 19,000 glaciers, far more than previous studies. They determined that southwestern Asia is the only region of 19 where glaciers are not shrinking, which Zemp said is due to local climate conditions.
Since 1961, the world has lost 10.6 trillion tons of ice and snow (9.6 trillion metric tons), the study found. Melted, that's enough to cover the lower 48 U.S. states in about 4 feet of water.
Scientists have known for a long time that global warming caused by human activities like burning coal, gasoline and diesel for electricity and transportation is making Earth lose its ice. They have been especially concerned with the large ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica.
This study, ""is telling us there's much more to the story,"" said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado, who wasn't part of the study. ""The influence of glaciers on sea level is bigger than we thought.""
AMAZING MUMMY DISCOVERY: HIGH PRIEST'S 2,500-YEAR-OLD REMAINS UNCOVERED
A number of factors are making sea levels rise. The biggest cause is that oceans are getting warmer, which makes water expand. The new figures show glacier melt is a bigger contributor than thought, responsible for about 25% to 30% of the yearly rise in oceans, Zemp said.
Rising seas threaten coastal cities around the world and put more people at risk of flooding during storms.
Glaciers grow in winter and shrink in summer, but as the Earth has warmed, they are growing less and shrinking more. Zemp said warmer summer temperatures are the main reason glaciers are shrinking faster.
While people think of glaciers as polar issues, shrinking mountain glaciers closer to the equator can cause serious problems for people who depend on them, said Twila Moon, a snow and ice data center scientist who also wasn't part of the study. She said people in the Andes, for example, rely on the glaciers for drinking and irrigation water each summer.
A separate study Monday in Environmental Research Letters confirmed faster melting and other changes in the Arctic. It found that in winter, the Arctic is warming 2.8 times faster than the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. Overall, the region is getting more humid, cloudier and wetter.

Attorneys spent last week paring a pool of 75. If they settle Monday on a panel of 12 jurors and four alternates, opening statements and testimony would follow.
The judge is considering a media request to allow access to graphic evidence shown to the jury. Noor has joined the challenge to evidence restrictions. Trending in US"
Mother of child who drowned in Detroit basement gets jail,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/mother-of-child-who-drowned-in-detroit-basement-gets-jail,"CRIME Published 2 hours ago Mother of child who drowned in Detroit basement gets jail DETROIT – The mother of an 11-month-old girl who drowned in standing water and sewage after falling through a hole in an upstairs floor and into a basement of their Detroit home has been sentenced to a year in jail.

Ca&apos;Mya Davis was unattended July 6 when she fell through the hole in her home&apos;s bedroom floor. Her death was ruled accidental.

Kim Kardashian on Kanye West after ‘Saturday Night Live’ pro-Trump rant: ‘I’m not trying to change who he is’,www.foxnews.com,Katherine Lam,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/kim-kardashian-on-kanye-west-after-saturday-night-live-pro-trump-rant-im-not-trying-to-change-who-he-is,"Kim Kardashian will always stand by husband Kanye West’s side. During Sunday night’s episode of “Keeping up with the Kardashians,” the reality star addressed West’s spontaneous rant on “Saturday Night Live” when he appeared as the musical guest last September. Kardashian admitted she was “freaking out” about West’s performance because it was live television, People magazine reported.
“I have to be honest — inside I’m kind of freaking out a little bit because live TV, you never know what could happen,” Kardashian said about West’s appearance.
West ended the show in September with a performance of “Ghost Town,” but instead of just thanking the audience and walking off the stage after the song ended, the rapper went on a political rant while the credits were rolling. Clips posted by audience members, including comedian Chris Rock, captured the speech.
“There’s so many times I talk to a white person and [they] say, ‘How could you like Trump, he’s racist?’ Well, if I was concerned about racism I would’ve moved out of America a long time ago,” a clip showed West saying.

Kardashian said on Sunday night’s episode that she would support her husband through thick and thin.
“I know that Kanye is always going to be Kanye and I’m never trying to change that,” Kardashian said. “I mean, that’s who I fell in love with and I’m not trying to change who is.”
Kardashian, however, wasn’t on board with uprooting the couple and their three children’s lives to move to Chicago. The rapper announced he, Kardashian and their children would be moving to Chicago — a move the reality star said she found out on social media.

The 38-year-old said the potential move would most likely be her “breaking point,” especially since the couple would be welcoming their fourth child via surrogate in the next few months.
“I just think that it would be amazing to have a second place in Chicago and if you need to spend more time out there that’s totally fine, but I think it would be really hard just to take the kids and leave and permanently move to Chicago,” she explained to West.

The rapper said he missed his hometown, where he says he feels “connected” and “inspired.” The couple ultimately agreed they would not be moving to Chicago.
""We’re not going to move full-time,"" West said. “But we will spend time [there], because that’s my home, too.” Katherine Lam is a breaking and trending news digital producer for Fox News. Follow her on Twitter at @bykatherinelam On Our Radar"

She was released from federal custody on $5 million dollars bail. Former ""Smallville"" actress Allison Mack pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn court to involvement in the cult-like group NXIVM on charges of racketeering. Mack entered her plea to racketeering charges on Monday, shortly before federal jury selection was scheduled to start in Brooklyn federal court.
The trial is expected to detail sensational allegations that the group recruited sex slaves for its spiritual leader, Keith Raniere.
Prosecutors accused Mack of helping Raniere recruit women to a secret sub-society within the group.
Authorities say the women were branded by a surgical tool with a symbol that resembled Raniere's initials. Mack has said in an interview that the group emphasized self-discipline and self-empowerment and she likened the branding to getting a tattoo, but cooler.
The defense says the women were never abused.

Judge eases curfew for Georgia officer charged in shooting,www.foxnews.com,RUSS BYNUM,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/judge-eases-curfew-for-georgia-officer-charged-in-shooting,"CRIME Published 1 hour ago Last Update 59 mins ago Judge eases curfew for Georgia officer charged in shooting By RUSS BYNUM | WOODBINE, Ga. – A judge agreed Monday to ease the curfew imposed on a former Georgia police officer awaiting trial on manslaughter charges in the fatal shooting of a fleeing suspect.
Zechariah Presley was on-duty as a Kingsland police officer June 20 when 33-year-old Tony Green was shot in coastal Camden County. Presley was fired and arrested after the Georgia Bureau of Investigation determined Green was fleeing when the officer shot him multiple times.
Presley was released from jail on a $100,000 bond in July. His attorney, Adrienne Browning, told the judge at a pretrial hearing Monday that the 12-hour daily curfew imposed on Presley as a condition of his bond was making it difficult for him at his new job driving a delivery truck in nearby Jacksonville, Florida.
""The 7-to-7 curfew really restricts the hours he&apos;s able to work,"" Browning told the judge. She said some evenings Presley has had to check into a hotel to avoid curfew violations because ""at 7 p.m. he&apos;s got to be inside and he can&apos;t make the trip home.""
Superior Court Judge Stephen Scarlett shorted Presley&apos;s curfew to seven hours during weekdays after prosecutors said they have no reports of Presley violating any terms of his bond, which also prohibits him from working in law enforcement or security and from having firearms. He&apos;s also required to stay away from Green&apos;s family.
Prosecutor Robert German told the judge that Green&apos;s family opposed any change to Presley&apos;s curfew. The family had previously sought unsuccessfully to keep Presley jailed until his trial.
Attorneys on both sides asked the judge Monday to consider scheduling Sept. 30 for Presley&apos;s trial to begin. Scarlett didn&apos;t immediately set a trial date, saying he needed to check his calendar first.
Investigators have released few details about the shooting. The GBI has said Presley was following a vehicle Green was driving when Green got out and began to run. The two men got into a brief altercation, the bureau said, before Green began to flee again and Presley fired multiple gunshots, killing him.
The case was presented in November to a grand jury, which declined to charge Presley with murder. Instead he was indicted on charges of voluntary manslaughter and violating his oath as a police officer. In Georgia, voluntary manslaughter is punishable by one to 20 years in prison."
"Gary Sinise, KJ Apa will star in faith-based film 'I Still Believe' about singer Jeremy Camp",www.foxnews.com,Caleb Parke,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gary-sinise-kj-apa-to-role-in-faith-based-film-i-still-believe-about-singer-jeremy-camp,"Camp has an impressive career as a Christian contemporary singer with four RIAA-certified Gold albums, more than 4.5 million albums sold and 41 radio No. 1’s, including ""There Will Be a Day."" ""I Still Believe"" is based on the 2013 book of the same name and will focus on Camp&apos;s true-life spiritual ""journey of love and loss.""
""Through tragedy has come healing and restoration,"" Camp told Fox News.
In October of 2000, Camp married Melissa Lynn Henning, a recovering ovarian cancer patient who had unwavering faith and loved worship. After their honeymoon, doctors informed the newlyweds that her cancer had spread. She died four and a half months later, in February 2001.
In the wake of her passing, Camp wrote the song, ""I Still Believe,"" the song the film is based on.
The story is expected to follow Camp&apos;s rebellious teen years growing up in Indiana, the tragic loss of his first wife and his rise in the Christian music industry. It also delves into how he re-found hope and love after meeting his wife, Adrienne, with whom he has three children.
The movie follows the success of Erwin Brothers Entertainment&apos;s ""I Can Only Imagine,"" based on the life of MercyMe lead singer Bart Millard.
The role makes sense for Apa, an actor and aspiring musician, who acted with the late Luke Perry as his son on ""Riverdale."" He last appeared in FOX&apos;s ""The Hate U Give."" Sinise, who was recently recognized for his life-long support for veterans, was most recently in ""Criminal Minds"" and ""CSI: NY.""
Shooting for the new faith-based movie is set for this spring with a planned release date of March 20, 2020.

On the roster: Dems need an answer on the border - Beto calls Bibi a racist - Buttigieg shares the struggle behind his coming out - Mulvaney: Voters will ‘never’ see Trump’s taxes - ‘That&apos;s frickin’ sweet’
DEMS NEED AN ANSWER ON THE BORDER
There are a lot of reasons that President Trump probably wanted to ditch Kirstjen Nielsen as Homeland Security secretary. She’s a by-the-numbers holdover from former Chief of Staff John Kelly , and not a good fit for a corner-cutting showman of a president.
But the biggest reason is the most obvious: Trump has yet to deliver on his most important campaign promise of securing the southern border.
Trump’s political exposure on the subject is certainly mitigated by the fact that his supporters blame Democrats primarily for the worsening situation along our border with Mexico. In their minds, the fact that Democrats were willing to keep the government shut down for 35 days rather than give Trump a few billion dollars more for some wall/fence/steel slats is proof enough for Team MAGA.
But as it is with many things, Trump’s main advantage on this subject is that Democrats can’t seem to address it in a sensible way.
As the consensus grows that the surge of refugees at the southern border constitutes a crisis, Democrats generally remain flat footed on the subject. It was fine to denounce Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the mistreatment of children and families and probably even politically useful to mock Trump’s fixation on a “big, beautiful wall,” but that’s not going to be enough.
We don’t know what direction Trump will take now that Nielsen is out of the way, but it seems like a sure bet that he will not be vulnerable to accusations of minimizing the threat.
Democrats have succumbed to the temptation that believing since Trump is intemperate and xenophobic sounding in his remarks on immigration it is enough for them to simply denounce his bluster and condemn his policies as cruelty.
There is no sign of things getting any better at the border any time soon. Voters care deeply about the issue. That means that as Democrats are wrestling their way through their primaries, voters will be confronting more bad news and more alarming images from the border. Candidates will need to have an answer.
THE RULEBOOK: WHEN WILL WE LEARN?
“All violent policy, as it is contrary to the natural and experienced course of human affairs, defeats itself.” – Alexander Hamilton , Federalist No. 25
TIME OUT: SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES
Garden & Gun: “ Sam Edwards III will be the first to admit it—the past three years have been hard. On January 19, 2016, his family’s decades-old Edwards Virginia Smokehouse went up in flames, leaving the facility destroyed. ‘In my lifetime, I’d never heard of it happening—a fire wiping out an entire ham house,’ says Edwards, the third-generation cure master to run the business his grandfather founded in 1926. In the immediate aftermath, Harper’s Country Hams of Clinton, Kentucky, was one of the first to step in, offering to take over Edwards’ production until the company got back on its feet in their Surry, Virginia, home base. Almost exactly a year later, the unthinkable happened again: Harper’s plant caught fire, too, and both families’ inventories were lost. Even in the face of that kind of devastation, Edwards hasn’t wavered in his determination to restore his historic operation to its former glory.”

BETO CALLS BIBI A RACIST
WaPo: “Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke on Sunday described Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a ‘racist’ whose outreach to far-right interests as he seeks to hang onto political power has seriously damaged the chances of peace in the Middle East. Speaking at a town hall here at the University of Iowa, the former Texas congressman denounced Netanyahu’s pledge Saturday that he would annex Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank if he wins another term in Tuesday’s Israeli general election. Netanyahu’s proposed annexation, O’Rourke said, ‘will make peace in the long term impossible.’ In response to a voter’s question about his policy toward Israel and Palestinian rights, O’Rourke reiterated his support for a two-state solution and accused Netanyahu of having ‘joined forces with far-right parties who are inherently racist in their speech and the way that they want to treat their fellow human beings in that part of the world.’”
Betomania subsides - Politico: “Yet by the time he left the state on Sunday, it was also clear that the euphoria that greeted [Beto] Rourke’s entry into the race three weeks earlier has started to subside. The inevitable slog of competing in a packed Democratic primary is underway, and O’Rourke has not yet drawn the wave of national adulation from the left that his Senate run against Ted Cruz last year received. ‘He’s going to have to do the work,’ said Scott Brennan , an Iowa Democratic National Committee member and a former state party chairman. ‘And it isn’t all breathless, 300-person crowds.’ … O’Rourke has seen little movement in polls since he announced. … And while O’Rourke sprinted from college campuses and coffee shops to house parties across Iowa, a more established contender, Bernie Sanders, was drawing even larger audiences here.
BUTTIGIEG SHARES THE STRUGGLE BEHIND HIS COMING OUT
NBC News: “ Pete Buttigieg may not become president or win the Democratic primary, but he&apos;s already broken a barrier by delving publicly and intimately into his struggle with his own sexuality in a way no other serious presidential candidate has. In a speech before an audience of LGBT rights supporters on Sunday, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, did not describe being gay as something he always believed was acceptable. Nor did he dismiss lingering questions about his viability as a presidential candidate in a country in which three in 10 adults still say they have some reservations or would be very uncomfortable with a gay candidate, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in February. Instead, he described wrestling with his sexual orientation as ‘a kind of war’ — one he said he was only able to win when he came home from serving in Afghanistan.”
BERNIE WARMS TO THE FRONTRUNNER ROLE
AP: “Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is quieting critics who questioned whether he could recapture the energy of his upstart 2016 campaign, surpassing his rivals in early fundraising and establishing himself as an indisputable front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. Less than two months into his second White House bid, no other declared candidate in the crowded Democratic field currently has amassed so many advantages: a $28 million war chest, a loyal and enthusiastic voter base and a set of clearly defined policy objectives. That puts Sanders on markedly different footing than during his first White House run, creating new challenges for a candidate whose supporters relish his role as an underdog and an outsider. He now carries the weight of high expectations and will face heightened scrutiny over everything from the cost and feasibility of his government-funded policy proposals to his tax returns, which he has not yet released.”
Bernie wants felons to vote while still in prison - Fox News: “Sen. Bernie Sanders has long fought to restore voting rights for felons who’ve completed their prison sentences. Now the presidential candidate wants to go a big step further – arguing that those currently behind bars should be able to vote too. Asked on the campaign trail in Muscatine, Iowa on Saturday if those imprisoned should have the right to vote, the independent senator from Vermont who’s making his second straight bid for the Democratic nomination answered: ‘I think that is absolutely the direction we should go.’ ‘In my state, what we do is separate. You’re paying a price, you committed a crime, you’re in jail. That&apos;s bad,’ Sanders explained. ‘But you’re still living in American society and you have a right to vote. I believe in that, yes, I do.’”
BOOKER FUNDRAISING LAGS FRONTRUNNERS
WaPo: “Sen. Cory Booker has raised more than $5 million in the two months since he announced his 2020 plans, the presidential candidate’s campaign said Sunday. Booker’s haul, while competitive, puts him behind other Democratic White House aspirants, including former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Booker’s campaign said 82 percent of the donors gave to the senator for the first time and the average online contribution was $34. The New Jersey Democrat, who was first elected to the Senate in a 2013 special election, raised $17.7 million to win a full term one year later.”
Bennet says nothing funny about Biden touchy contretemps - Politico: “Likely Democratic presidential contender Michael Bennet on Sunday criticized former Vice President Joe Biden for joking about the controversy swirling around his touchy, avuncular style that some women say made them uncomfortable. ‘I don&apos;t think anyone should make jokes about it,’ the Colorado senator told CNN&apos;s Jake Tapper on ‘State of the Union.’ ‘This is an important time in our country&apos;s history when women are coming forward and able to say when they&apos;ve been made to feel uncomfortable, whether in a sexual way or a nonsexual way. People&apos;s voices should be heard on that.’ … On whether the controversy should disqualify Biden from another presidential bid, Bennet said that would be up to voters to decide.”
Elizabeth Weil: ‘Kamala Harris takes her shot’ - Atlantic: “She delivers her talking points while dressed, as she always is, in her uniform of dark suit, pearls, black heels. I know—you think I shouldn’t be writing about her clothes. But the clothes themselves are a smart, cautious play, one that Hillary Clinton , frankly, could have benefited from. If you wear the same outfit every single day, pretty soon the haters will run out of snarky things to say about your appearance and move on.”
MULVANEY: VOTERS WILL ‘NEVER’ SEE TRUMP’S TAXES
Fox News: “Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told ‘Fox News Sunday’ in an exclusive interview that Democrats will ‘never’ see President Trump &apos;s tax returns, days after a House Democrat committee chairman made the unprecedented demand that the IRS provide the documents. Mulvaney&apos;s comments marked an apparent escalation in the White House&apos;s rhetoric on the issue. On Wednesday, Trump responded with a dismissive taunt to Democrats&apos; renewed push for his tax information, but suggested he might be willing to provide the information pending the conclusion of an audit. ‘Oh no, never -- nor should they,’ Mulvaney told Bill Hemmer , who is filling in for host Chris Wallace , when asked if Democrats will ever see the president&apos;s tax returns. ‘That’s an issue that was already litigated during the election. Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns. They knew that he didn’t and they elected him anyway.’”
Republicans ready to spend big on Jewish voters - Politico: “Republicans are planning a multimillion-dollar offensive aimed at fracturing the Democratic Party’s decades long stranglehold on the Jewish vote. Spearheading the push is the Republican Jewish Coalition, which receives substantial funding from casino mogul and GOP mega donor Sheldon Adelson . … The investment, people familiar with the early discussions said, will far surpass what the group spent in past presidential elections. With Democrats embroiled in a wrenching internal debate over anti-Semitism and support for Israel, Republicans are moving to capitalize with an aggressive campaign painting Trump — who has himself faced accusations of stoking anti-Semitism — as a fierce and unapologetic defender of the Jewish state.”

FROM THE BLEACHERS
“This is a suggestion for more research and commentary by Fox News. Running for President as an independent candidate without an existing formal structure and legal status of a political party is very difficult as best. Mass media exposure is one thing. However, every state has its own particular laws, regulations or requirements in order to obtain one&apos;s name on the ballot. Normally, political parties provide this service and coordinate with the state Secretary of State or other appropriate bureaucrat. Independents start from the beginning during the already very busy political campaign season. I had a friend who worked full time on Ross Perot&apos;s staff. He spent an enormous amount of time, energy, and money moving all over the country. He organized supporters, circulated petitions, and worked with the electoral officials. My friend was a hard working, able, experienced person. He was retired career military officer among other things. Put simply, it is my neutral, non-partisan opinion that Mr. Perot had a nearly impossible task. And, Mr. Schultz will do no better.” – Terry Simmons , Reno, Nev.
[ Ed. note: On Feb. 20, 1992 during an appearance on Larry King ’s television show – where else? – Perot issued a challenge to his supporters: If they could get his name on the ballot in all 50 states, he would run for president. This was also a challenge to the people working for him at his United We Stand group, which I assume includes your friend. They completed their work seven months later, a pretty impressive clip, especially at a time where ballot access was more restrictive and without the technology to organize that we have today. Unfortunately for them, Perot had already spectacularly, bizarrely dropped out of the race that summer before ever officially entering it. But when supporters delivered on the 50-state promise, Perot belatedly jumped in and still ended up with nearly 20 percent of the vote. I think that if Schultz were to put in the hundreds of millions of dollars he has discussed and make a decision on his current timetable of sometime this summer I would think he would have ample time to make the ballot in all 50 states. Whether there would be enough people who cared about that in order to make it consequential is another matter… ]
“Chris, When pollsters ask questions about income tax policy shouldn’t they restrict the questions to people who are actually paying taxes? It doesn’t make sense to ask someone who isn’t paying income taxes if the rich should pay more. Seems obvious how the majority of those people who don’t have skin in the game would respond to the question.” – Bob Steinen , Abingdon, Md .
[ Ed. note: But they do vote, Mr. Steinen. That would be like asking only military members what they think of foreign policy or only women what the laws on abortion should be. And as Republicans deride an appetite for socialism and high taxation among Democratic candidates, conservatives would do well to remember that such things as those are actually quite popular, and not just among the nearly half of adults who don’t pay federal income taxes. It’s not enough to scoff .]

‘THAT&apos;S FRICKIN’ SWEET’
KRIV: “A Visalia man has gotten pretty used to getting weird looks on the streets, as he drives around a jet ski on dry land. Nick Stemple says he put a jet ski&apos;s body right onto a scooter. He calls it ‘Scootski.’ ‘[My friend] built his, and I was just like, ‘That&apos;s frickin sweet&apos; and I had to have one,’’ said Stemple. And now that Stemple has his own Scootski, he&apos;s never going back. ‘I love this thing! I&apos;ve gotten rid of my other motorcycles. I ride this every single day,’ said Stemple. Stemple says he got a Honda Elite off Craig&apos;s List. His friend had the jet ski. And after about two months of work, he had Scootski. ‘The first question I always get it ‘Does that thing float on water?’ And I always say, ‘No, there&apos;s a huge hole at the bottom of it,’’ said Stemple. Scootski goes up to about 70 miles an hour, and get around 30 or 40 miles to the gallon. Stemple rides the thing anywhere and everywhere - even the highway.”

Woman who died at 99 unknowingly lived with organs in wrong places,www.foxnews.com,Alexandria Hein,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/woman-who-died-at-99-unknowingly-lived-with-organs-in-wrong-places,"It wasn’t until spring of 2018, when students at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) began examining the cadaver, that they reported Rose Marie Bentley’s previously undetected, potentially life-threatening anatomy. HAS 5 GOLF BALLS REMOVED FROM STOMACH AFTER SWALLOWING THEM ON WALKS In fact, when Bentley, who died in Oct. 2017, had her appendix removed years prior, her family said the doctor noted finding it in a strange location, but there was never any follow-up on her other organs.
This medical illustration shows how Bentley’s abdominal organs were a mirror image of typical human anatomy, meaning they were transposed right to left. She also had an abnormality called a hiatal hernia, which is when a portion of the stomach protrudes through the diaphragm, a thin muscle that separates the abdomen from the chest. (Lynn Kitagawa for OHSU)
“I knew something was up, but it took us a while to figure out how she was put together,” Cam Walker, Ph.D., an assistant professor of anatomy at OHSU Anatomical Service Center, said in a press release posted by EurekAlert!
Eventually, the class diagnosed Bentley with situs inversus with levocardia, a condition which causes the heart and abdominal organs to be either reversed or mirrored from normal positions in the body. According to the press release, it is diagnosed in about one in every 22,000 births, and is typically associated with life-threatening ailments concerning the heart or other abnormalities. The OHSU team believes Bentley is the oldest-known patient with the condition.
“It was quite amazing,” Warren Nielsen, one of the OHSU students who worked with Bentley’s body, said in the press release. “We were able to not only learn normal anatomy, but also the anatomic variation that can occur.”
Bentley’s five children told the team that she lived an active, healthy life, and that she would think “this was so cool.”

EasyJet flight honks horn at slow-walking flamingo holding up plane,www.foxnews.com,Alexandra Deabler,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/easyjet-flight-honks-horn-at-slow-walking-flamingo-holding-up-plane,"Man caught transporting invasive stingrays at airport
A flamingo was spotted strutting its stuff down the airport runway — much to the frustration of the EasyJet plane behind it.
An EasyJet flight landed at Palma Airport in the Spanish island of Mallorca on Sunday, but was briefly held up while taxiing to the gate because of a slow-walking flamingo.
An airport crew member said in a video of the incident that the EasyJet plane had to break because of the bird, the Daily Mail reported.
In the recording, the honking of a horn could be heard, though the noise does not seem to faze the bird as it continues slowly walk in the middle of the runway. Un flamenco recibía esta mañana a los pasajeros que llegaban al aeropuerto de Palma. Muy elegante, paseando por la plataforma…. pic.twitter.com/xmNBui2WtI

At one point, the airport crew member said the bird was leaving, but after flying a few feet, the flamingo landed once again in the middle of the runway, blocking plane traffic, Daily Mail reported.
Though potentially dangerous, the crew member who shared the video of the bird described the scene as “elegant” in a translation.
“A pink flamingo this morning welcomed in the passengers arriving at Palma Airport. Very elegant.”
However, the bird’s attempt to seemingly block the EasyJet plane from making it to the gate did not work out: A spokesperson for the airline told Fox News the plane did not experience any delays and passengers remained safe during the entire incident.
The wildlife control department was reportedly contacted to remove the bird, but the flamingo flew away before the team arrived. Share this:"

During the plea allocution, Sayoc admitted the devices he sent were capable of exploding and causing injury. His sentencing is in September and he faces up to life in prison. But in a letter dated March 23 -- the day after the plea hearing -- Sayoc told Manhattan Federal Court Judge Jed Rakoff that “under no circumstances my intent was to harm or hurt anyone.”
He added: “The intention was only to intimidate and scare,” he added. ""I Quote: under sound circumstance and in my own words, ‘Know what started out as a hoax, decoys, devices were not ever meant to work or could have worked, hurt or harm anyone. I am forever sincerely in remorse and sorry with all my heart.’”
Rakoff made the letter public Tuesday.
In another letter dated April 1, Sayoc told the judge he was “freaked out overwhelmed nervious (sic) with anxiety” when he pleaded guilty.
“I was not aware of risk,” he said, referring to the devices. “The fireworks was a sparkler and not capable of exploding. I am not a chemist or scientist.”
The second letter was made public Friday.
Sayoc pleaded guilty to sending 16 rudimentary bombs -- none of which detonated -- to targets including Hillary Clinton, former Vice President Joe Biden, several Democratic members of Congress, former President Barack Obama, actor Robert De Niro and billionaire George Soros. Devices were also mailed to CNN offices in New York and Atlanta with former Obama administration intelligence bosses as the intended recipients.
At the time of his arrest, Sayoc had been living in a van plastered with stickers of President Trump and images of Trump opponents with crosshairs over their faces.
Prosecutors and defense lawyers have not commented, the Associated Press reported.
Rakoff has told both sides he wants to discuss the matter with them at an April 15 hearing.

American tourists disappear after leaving hotel en route to airport in the Dominican Republic: report,www.foxnews.com,Lucia Suarez Sang,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-tourists-disappear-after-leaving-hotel-en-route-to-airport-in-the-dominican-republic-report,"Orlando Moore, 43, and Portia Ravenelle, 32, were set to return to their Mount Vernon, N.Y., home on March 27 after a four-day getaway to the northern beach area of Samana. However, the couple never made it to the airport after checking out of their hotel.
Their families have not heard from them in more than 13 days. Their phones are off and their car is still parked at Newark International Airport. Authorities said there is no record of them entering the U.S.
Moore’s sister, Lashay Turner, told NBC 4 New York her brother and Ravenelle had a rental car during their time in the Dominican Republic, but there is no sign of the vehicle.
She told the news station the couple&apos;s families have been in contact with U.S. authorities in the Dominican Republic and have filed a police report.
“We’ve been calling DR and they said they didn’t make their flight,” Turner said. “We also spoke to someone in U.S. Customs and they said my brother did not make his flight back here.”
A picture believed to be the latest of the couple posted to social media shows them riding horses together.
“I’m scared. I don’t know what’s going on,” Turner said. “I’m saddened, my family is saddened by this and we just want my brother to return safe and alive.”
A spokesman for the State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for comment early Monday afternoon.
It is unclear which airport they were due to fly home from and how far it was from their hotel. There is an airport in Samana that offers mostly seasonal flights to the island, mainly from Europe. The next closest airport in the area is the Cibao International Airport in Santiago, which offers daily flights to and from the U.S.
The State Department’s travel advisory for the Dominican Republic – issued on Feb. 12, 2019 – said tourists should exercise increased caution due to crime.

Alles was told that he should be prepared to leave his post as head of the Secret Service as part of that transition. “United States Secret Service director Randolph &apos;Tex&apos; Alles has done a great job at the agency over the last two years, and the President is thankful for his over 40 years of service to the country,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a brief statement Monday.
 NIELSEN MAKES FIRST PUBLIC COMMENTS AFTER RESIGNATION AS DHS BOSS She said that Trump has picked career Secret Service member James M. Murray to take over the agency in May. Alles will remain in his role until then.
A law enforcement official told Fox News that, inside the agency, the news of Alles&apos; departure came as a surprise.
Alles’ departure comes on the heels of Nielsen’s resignation and, according to a source, has nothing to do with the recent Mar-a-Lago incident, in which a woman was arrested at the president’s Florida property after allegedly carrying two Chinese passports and malware.
Nielsen and President Trump met at the White House on Sunday -- after which the president announced that Nielsen would leave her post as head of DHS. Trump also announced that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan would be appointed as acting DHS secretary.
Later, Nielsen tweeted that she had submitted her resignation.
“Its[sic] been an honor of a lifetime to serve with the brave men and women of @DHSgov. I could not be prouder of and more humbled by their service, dedication, and commitment to keep our country safe from all threats and hazards,” she tweeted with an image of the resignation letter.
The letter, addressed to the president, said: “Despite our progress in reforming homeland security for a new age, I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside.”
Nielsen’s resignation came amid an influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. The Associated Press reported that Nielsen had been frustrated with the difficulty of getting other departments to help to deal with the growing number of families crossing the border.
But administration officials told Fox News on Sunday that Nielsen’s background in cybersecurity made her a poor fit to handle border issues, while McAleenan best fits Trump’s requirement of being the “toughest cop” on the frontier. Sources told Fox News that Nielsen had been viewed as resistant to some of the immigration measures pushed by the president and his aides, specifically related to protected status for some refugees and policies at the border.
A senior administration official told Fox News that National Security Adviser John Bolton long felt that Nielsen was not the right person for the job
Nielsen served as the head of DHS for 16 months, following the appointment of former DHS Secretary John Kelly to be White House chief of staff. Kelly has since resigned from the administration.
Nielsen&apos;s departure is the latest staffing shakeup in the department, which was founded to combat terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.
On Friday, Trump confirmed he had withdrawn the nomination of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Ron Vitiello to become the permanent head of the agency, telling reporters that ""Ron’s a good man, but we’re going in a tougher direction, we want to go in a tougher direction."" Administration sources tell Fox News that the withdrawal of Vitiello&apos;s nomination was the first step in Trump&apos;s plan to control the border crisis.
The second step was asking for Nielsen&apos;s resignation.

Cory Booker introduces Senate bill on slavery reparations,www.foxnews.com,Paul Steinhauser,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/booker-introduces-senate-bill-for-slavery-reparations,"The senator from New Jersey said Monday that “this bill is a way of addressing head-on the persistence of racism, white supremacy, and implicit racial bias in our country. It will bring together the best minds to study the issue and propose solutions that will finally begin to right the economic scales of past harms and make sure we are a country where all dignity and humanity is affirmed.” The measure is a Senate companion to a bill introduced in the House of Representatives in January by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, which if passed into law would set up a commission to study the impact of slavery and continued discrimination against black Americans and make recommendations on reparation proposals for the descendants of slaves. The legislation was first introduced 30 years ago by then-Rep. John Conyers of Michigan.
“Since slavery in this country, we have had overt policies fueled by white supremacy and racism that have oppressed African-Americans economically for generations,” Booker added. “Many of our bedrock domestic policies that have ushered millions of Americans into the middle class have systematically excluded blacks through practices like GI Bill discrimination and redlining.”
Besides Booker, the idea of slavery reparations for black Americans is at least partially backed by at least eight other Democratic presidential contenders. They are Sen. Kamala Harris of California; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont; former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, who served as housing secretary under President Barack Obama; South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg; former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas; Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; and businessman and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
Several of them were asked specifically about Jackson Lee&apos;s reparations bill during a conference last week of Al Sharpton&apos;s National Action Network.
The push by the Democratic White House hopefuls points to the further importance of race and identity issues within the party. Yet while supporters say reparations are needed to address slavery and racist aspects of American history, critics claim such a move could cost several trillion dollars without solving the issue of racism.

Thirty-three-year-old Noor goes on trial Monday in the July 2017 death of Ruszcyzyk Damond. Judge Kathryn Quaintance ruled Friday, March 29, 2019, that potentially graphic evidence would be seen only by the jury, not the public or media. One media attorney says her ruling could be unconstitutional. (AP Photo/Amy Forliti, File) MINNEAPOLIS – A jury of 12 men and four women was seated Monday to hear the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer who fatally shot an unarmed woman who called 911 to report a possible rape near her home. Mohamed Noor, 33, is charged with murder and manslaughter in the 2017 death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a dual citizen of Australia and the U.S. who was shot when she approached his squad car.
After a week of questioning and paring down an original pool of 75 people, the jury finalized Monday includes a firefighter and paramedic, an ob-gyn, a civil engineer, a grocery store manager, a restaurant host, a carpenter and a Homeland Security immigration officer. The jurors' names were not revealed in court.
Six of the jurors are people of color, including two Filipino men, an Ethiopian man and a Pakistani woman. Noor is Somali American; Damond was white.
Twelve of those selected will end up deciding the case while four will be alternates. The 12 jurors who will deliberate will be picked at the trial's conclusion.
One woman who was picked as a juror had an emotional reaction to the case last week and was asked to think over the weekend about whether she could serve on the jury. She said Monday she had some anxiety about the responsibility.
""There's a huge life-altering decision that everyone's confronted with and that's overwhelming a little bit,"" she said. Still, she said she could put her emotions aside and serve.
Opening statements are scheduled for Tuesday.
The shooting of Damond, who was dressed in her pajamas, drew international attention. Prosecutors say there is no evidence Noor faced a threat that justified deadly force, while Noor's attorneys plan to argue that he acted in self-defense.
Damond, a 40-year-old life coach who was set to be married the month after her death, called 911 twice before Noor and his partner that night, Officer Matthew Harrity, arrived.
Harrity told investigators he was driving a police SUV when he heard a voice and a thump and caught a glimpse of someone outside his window. Harrity said he was startled and thought his life was in danger. He said he then heard a noise and turned to see that Noor, in the passenger seat, had fired his gun past Harrity and hit Damond through the driver's side window.
The officers did not turn on their body cameras until after the shooting, and there was no squad car video.
Noor has refused to talk to investigators and his attorneys haven't said whether he will testify.

Florida man goes on trial for murder of wife 26 years ago,www.foxnews.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/florida-man-goes-on-trial-for-murder-of-wife-26-years-ago,"Last Update 5 hours ago Florida man goes on trial for murder of wife 26 years ago Email JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – Jury selection began Monday for the trial of a Florida man who prosecutors say killed his wife in 1993 because she had plans to leave him with their son. Michael Haim's trial in Jacksonville was starting this week more than a quarter century after his wife, Bonnie, disappeared from their home. Haim has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder.
A key witness will be Haim's biological son, Aaron Fraser.
As a 3-year-old boy at the time of his mother's disappearance, Fraser told a child welfare worker, ""Daddy hurt mommy,"" or something similar, according to detectives.
""Aaron also stated that 'Daddy shot Mommy,''Daddy placed Mommy in timeout,' and 'My daddy could not wake her up,'"" a 2015 arrest affidavit said.
While Haim remained a suspect, detectives had trouble building a case without a body.
In 2014, having won his childhood home as part of a wrongful death lawsuit against his father, Fraser discovered his mother's skeletal remains while making repairs to the property, according to detectives with the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.
A water leak required Fraser to remove a concrete slab underneath which he found the badly composed remains. DNA tests confirmed the remains were those of Bonnie Haim and a medical examiner concluded she died from a homicide ""by unspecified means,"" according to the affidavit.
A spent shell casing found where Bonnie Haim was buried was the same type of caliber as a rifle that Haim owned, the affidavit said.
According to the affidavit, Haim was abusive to his wife and she had made plans to move into an apartment with their son while he was away on a trip. She had secretly opened a bank account and when Haim found out about it and made her close it, she started giving money to a trusted friend to hold for her.
Haim, 52, who had moved to North Carolina by the time of his arrest in 2015, claimed his wife left their home without their son late one night in January 1993 after they had an argument about their marital problems. Haim also said he went searching for his wife, although he didn't notify law enforcement about her disappearance. Law enforcement wasn't told about the disappearance until a maintenance worker found her purse in a hotel dumpster and called police.
""Michael Haim was the last known individual to have contact with victim,"" the arrest affidavit said. ""The suspect admits that he and the victim were fighting over marital issues and that she was planning to leave and take their child."" Trending in US"

Archipelagos Institute of Marine Conservation members carry a dead dolphin at a beach on Greece's Samos island in February. (AP/Archipelagos Institute of Marine Conservation) The Aegean Sea has seen a ""very unusual"" spike in dolphin deaths over the past few weeks, a Greek marine conservation group said Monday, adding that the rise could be linked to massive Turkish naval exercises in the area. Fifteen dead dolphins have washed up on the eastern island of Samos and other parts of Greece's Aegean coastline since late February, according to the Archipelagos Institute.
Its head of research, Anastassia Miliou, told The Associated Press that 15 is a worryingly high number compared to ""one or two"" in the same period last year.
The group said while it's still unclear what caused the deaths, the spike follows the Feb. 27-March 8 Turkish ""Blue Homeland"" exercises — the country's largest ever — that made constant use of sonar and practiced with live ammunition.
Archipelagos Institute of Marine Conservation members inspect a dead dolphin at a beach on Samos island in March. (AP/Archipelagos Institute of Marine Conservation)
The deafening noise of sonar, used by warships to detect enemy submarines, can injure dolphins and whales, driving them to surface too fast or beach themselves — with sometimes fatal consequences — to escape the din.
""We can't say that the Turkish exercises killed the dolphins, but the fact that we had such an unusual increase in the number washed up dead — and what we have seen must be a small percentage of the total because the Aegean has a long coastline — coincided with exercises that used more than 100 ships,"" Miliou said. ""(The deaths) are very worrying and we can't say that the two events are unrelated.""
After several mass beachings of whales, NATO, to which both Turkey and Greece belong, has adopted a code of conduct for using sonar that is designed to better protect marine mammals.
Miliou said the alliance's rules are respected by the U.S. Navy, which has a strong Mediterranean presence, and the Greek navy.
""There's a new (military) generation in place that doesn't want to harm the environment in the name of national sovereignty,"" she said.
But Miliou said it was unclear whether Turkey has implemented the guidelines. She said the Greek government in Athens should raise the issue in talks with Ankara, particularly ahead of new Turkish naval exercises in the Aegean.

""With these giant exercises... strain is placed on the entire marine ecosystem, including fish and plankton, because (they) cause intense noise pollution from which marine life can't escape,"" she said.
Miliou added that the Aegean Sea ""can barely handle the strain we are already subjecting it to,"" such as pollution, overfishing and heavy marine traffic. Trending in World"

Michael Cammarata, far right, and his girlfriend Ayisha Egea, center, were charged with second-degree murder, concealment of a human corpse and tampering with physical evidence according to police. (AP)
About two years before her death, Jeanine Cammarata introduced her husband to Egea, a mother of one of her students, in hopes of removing herself from her abusive marriage, the teacher’s longtime friend Jessica Pobega told the New York Daily News.
“Jeanine actually set up Mike and Ayisha because she wanted Mike to be occupied and leave her alone,” Pobega told the newspaper. “She [Jeanine Cammarata] actually introduced them in the hopes that Mike would stop stalking her.”
Michael Cammarata and Egea hit it off and, eventually, the new girlfriend moved into the couple’s home, Pobega said. Jose Perez, Jeanine Cammarata’s landlord, said he offered the mother of three a vacant apartment in his Staten Island building to help her out of the situation.
“She told me that Ayisha was babysitting their kids and then she found out that they were having a relationship,"" Perez told the New York Daily News . “She was trying to get rid of Mike. She thought if he kept busy with her [Egea], he wouldn’t be stalking her. But he continued stalking her.”
Michael Cammarata, far right, and his girlfriend Ayisha Egea, center, were arraigned together in Staten Island Criminal Court in St. George on Friday. (AP)
Perez said Cammarata suspected “something was up” about a week before her death, prompting her to update her will so her three children would be safe.
“She wanted her sister to keep the kids and she wanted to make sure her kids got everything,” Perez said. “...[Michael Cammarata] took her life, he took those kids’ mother away. [The children] deserve everything.”
Family and friends became worried about Cammarata after she failed to show up to work on Tuesday at Public School 29 and at her second job at a Dollar Store, police said. Cammarata was last seen at work on Friday and was scheduled to be off Monday for a custody hearing in court with her estranged husband.
Cammarata’s current boyfriend eventually reported her missing after failing to hear from her for a few days.

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis) KIGALI, Rwanda – Rwanda's President Paul Kagame said Monday that the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide feel repentant for killing some 800,000 people and that is helping the country to find reconciliation. Rwanda has begun commemorating the genocide which began 25 years ago and in which Hutu extremists slaughtered Tutsis and Hutus who tried to protect them during a 100-day period.
Kagame said Rwanda is rebuilding as a new nation of hope.
""Reconciliation is also one choice that has taken root,"" said Kagame in a press conference in the capital, Kigali. ""It has happened because even perpetrators have come out to say 'We are sorry.'
""They (the genocide's perpetrators) have come out to show remorse,"" he said. ""Survivors have also made a choice to forgive which completes a circle of reconciliation.""
The mass killing of Rwanda's Tutsi minority was ignited on April 6, 1994, when a plane carrying President Juvénal Habyarimana was shot down and crashed in Kigali, killing the leader who, like the majority of Rwandans, was an ethnic Hutu.
The Tutsi minority was blamed for downing the plane and the bands of Hutu militants began slaughtering the Tutsi, with support from the army, police, and militias.
Kagame said Rwandans will never turn against each other again.
He said Rwandans coming together over problems ""we have had to address is key. It is one of the choices that have enabled us to make this progress.""
Kagame said Rwanda is building a new relationship with France, which previously his government has accused of having had a role in the genocide.
""There's a conversation going on how to improve the relationship with Rwanda,"" said Kagame. ""France is also making good steps on matters on Africa generally.""
On Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron ordered a French commission of researchers and historians to investigate the ""role and involvement of France"" in Rwanda from 1990-1994. It is to make conclusions within two years.
Kagame has won praise for ending that violence and making advances in economic development and health care. Ethnic reconciliation is a cornerstone of the rule of Kagame, Rwanda's de facto leader since the genocide ended in 1994 and the country's president since 2000. He is credited with bringing Rwanda stability, economic growth, and improved health and education.
However, Kagame's critics charge that he is intolerant of criticism and his government is repressive, jailing opposition leaders.
On Sunday, to mark the start of the genocide, Kagame and several world leaders gathered with some 30,000 people at the National Stadium in the capital for a candlelight ceremony.
""We Rwandans have granted ourselves a new beginning. We exist in a state of permanent commemoration, every day, in all that we do,"" said Kagame on Sunday. ""Today, light radiates from this place.""

Delta tops latest 'Airline Quality Rating' report; Spirit Airlines no longer in last place,www.foxnews.com,Michael Bartiromo,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/delta-tops-latest-airline-quality-rating-report-spirit-airlines-no-longer-in-last-place,"The rankings, determined by researchers at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and Wichita State University, which make up the AQR itself, are released as part of a yearly report on the nation’s largest carriers. The report focuses primarily on on-time performance, baggage mishaps, the number of passengers involuntarily denied boarding and consumer satisfaction.
This year, the AQR awarded the top spot to Delta Air Lines, citing a slight increase in on-time percentages and a decrease in denied boarding numbers and passenger complaints throughout 2018.
AQR noted that six of the nine airlines studied had improved their scores (Delta, Hawaiian, JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit and United, specifically) compared with 2017, while three (Alaska, American and Frontier) had the “largest decline” in their scores, with Frontier’s scores dropping the most. Frontier also found itself in last place, a spot previously held by Spirit Airlines in the last report.
The report notes that Frontier’s scores in three of the four areas studied worsened since 2017, aside from only its rate of mishandled baggage, which improved.
And, as noted by USA Today , Alaska Airlines’ ranking likely dropped due to a merger with Virgin America in April 2018. (Virgin America was not included in this year’s AQR, though the report says Virgin’s scores previous to April 2018 were combined with Alaska’s to determine Alaska’s overall rating for 2018.)
Video Industrywide, the AQR notes that the overall 2018 scores are the best seen in the history of the rankings, as less baggage was mishandled in 2018 (2.43 bags per 10,000 passengers as compared to 2.46 in 2017) and denied boardings fell (from 0.341 passengers for every 10,000 to just 0.14). Complaints also dropped from 1.35 per 100,0000 passengers to just 1.04.
The AQR’s latest rankings are below. The full report can be found at Embry-Riddle’s official site.

Couple that sought peace and simplicity on farm met with violent death,www.foxnews.com,Elizabeth Llorente,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/couple-that-sought-peace-and-simplicity-on-farm-met-with-violent-death,"Email
Lizette and James Eckert (GoFundMe) Friends and clients of a couple that fled a high-pressure lifestyle for a more simple one on a farm several years ago now wonder what signs they may have overlooked that might explain the violent way James and Lizette Eckert died last month. The couple had three children – a biological daughter, 15, and two sons, ages 11 and 13, they adopted from Russia when the boys, who are brothers, were just 2 and 4.
James and Lizette Eckert were found by police in the New Hampshire farmhouse they lived in since moving from Maine in 2012, on the floor, bleeding. Lizette was dead, James was taking his last breaths. Both had been shot once in the head.
Police announced the arrest of an 11-year-old about two hours later, and have charged him with two counts of second-degree murder, according to a press release by state and local police. The release said the boy’s identity and other information are being withheld because he is a minor.
The Boston Globe , in an extensive story on the parents, said that two people who are knowledgeable about the investigation say the alleged killer is the Eckerts’ youngest son.
FLORIDA MAN GOES ON TRIAL FOR MURDER OF WIFE 26 YEARS AGO
Few details were offered about the youngest son, other than the observation by those who had been around the Eckerts that he was quiet and that, back in Maine, he cried a lot, according to the Globe.
The Eckerts ran their own chiropractic business in New Hampshire, drawing a broad base of devoted clients who described them as miracle workers and lived expensively. They seemed always to be renovating their large home, they had a Mercedes camper, a boat and timeshares, the Boston Globe reported.
They also went full-throttle into their business, dedicated to giving their patients relief from pain and taking a comprehensive approach to their health.
James Eckert, who was 48 when he died (Lizette was 50), wrote in a local newspaper several years ago: ""I desire to help the newborn, the aged, and those without hope…I choose to care for the patient with the disease, not the disease…I wish to assist rather than intrude, to free rather than control.”
Their lavish lifestyle, the Globe reported, caught up with the Eckerts, who started missing mortgage payments on their Maine property and were hounded by bill collectors. They ran into trouble with the Internal Revenue Service, which assessed the couple more than $100,000.
Neighbors saw a change in the family as their financial downward spiral continued.
James stopped working, they had stopped maintaining their property, and the children seemed unsupervised.
Then one day, abruptly, they left Maine for the farmhouse in New Hampshire that Lizette’s father was said to have bought for the couple, the Globe reported.
The Eckerts voiced disgust with the court system and the government in general.
They homeschooled their children.
While some Maine neighbors said they had been standoffish, their New Hampshire ones said they were very engaged at church and in the community. They resumed chiropractic care and again built a following of satisfied patients.
One of them, Virginia Adams, wrote on the couple’s obituary page : “I would see Dr. Jim twice a week and was always greeted with a cheerful, ‘How's your day?’ His office was a social gathering, a place to see friends, get advice and share a story. I feel so sad. I can't imagine what the family is going through. Hopefully, their faith will bring some comfort.”
Those who interacted with them said they never betrayed any concern about any of their children.
Gertrude Hammond, director of religious education and youth ministry at St. Katharine Drexel Parish in Alton, told the Union Leader newspaper shortly after the murders: “They were here last weekend for our annual parish bingo. They were here for Mass. They were here for youth night. The boys are altar servers. They’re just an integral part of the parish.""
The Globe noted that on her Facebook page, Lizette’s “likes” suggested an interest in the topic of kids who are traumatized.
She “liked” the television show ""Disconnected Kids, Reconnected Families"" and a page for parents of children who have experienced trauma and have problems connecting with others.

Police have not disclosed how the 11-year-old suspect got his hands on a gun or what may have compelled him to murder the Eckerts.
Meanwhile, Lizette’s mother, Diane Kennedy, has established a GoFundMe page to raise money for the Eckert children.
“The terrible impact of losing Lizette and Jim will be felt by their children for many years to come,” she wrote. “Because the story has been in the news, we are doing all we can to protect the children from excess attention, while still allowing the community that loves them so much and so well to help them in ways that will make a lasting impact.” Elizabeth Llorente is Senior Reporter for FoxNews.com, and can be reached at Elizabeth.Llorente@Foxnews.com.

"Iron volcanoes may have erupted on metal asteroids, study says",www.foxnews.com,Chris Ciaccia,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/science/iron-volcanoes-may-have-erupted-on-metal-asteroids-study-says,"The research, published in the scientific journal Geophysical Research Letters , comes ahead of NASA&apos;s planned look at Pysche , the largest metallic asteroid in the solar system. UC Santa Cruz professor Francis Nimmo said he was interested in the composition of metallic asteroids and asked a team to look into how they cooled and solidified. ""One day [graduate student Jacob Abrahams] turned to me and said, &apos;I think these things are going to erupt,&apos;"" Nimmo said in a statement. ""I&apos;d never thought about it before, but it makes sense because you have a buoyant liquid beneath a dense crust, so the liquid wants to come up to the top.""
Researchers have long believed that metallic asteroids initially started their lives as molten iron floating in space, at a time when the planets were just beginning to form. From there, they would ultimately cool, thanks to the incredibly cold temperatures of space, and solidify into the asteroid.
""In some cases, [the iron] would crystallize from the center out and wouldn&apos;t have volcanism, but some would crystallize from the top down, so you&apos;d get a solid sheet of metal on the surface with liquid metal underneath,"" Nimmo added.
It&apos;s unclear what the volcanoes would look, but Abrahams said it depends on the composition of the melt.
""If it&apos;s mostly pure iron, then you would have eruptions of low-viscosity surface flows spreading out in thin sheets, so nothing like the thick, viscous lava flows you see on Hawaii,"" he said in the statement. ""At the other extreme, if there are light elements mixed in and gases that expand rapidly, you could have explosive volcanism that might leave pits in the surface.""
NASA&apos;s Psyche mission is slated for a 2022 launch date, ultimately reaching the space rock four years later.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu escorted by bodyguards walks during a visit to the market on the eve of Israel's general elections in Jerusalem, Monday, April 8, 2019. (AP Photo/Sebastian Scheiner) JERUSALEM – It's a crowded field in Israel's elections as over 40 parties are slugging it out on Tuesday for seats in the country's parliament. There is the right-wing flagship, centrist newcomers, ultra-Orthodox parties, Arab parties and fringe movements. But only a handful will win the necessary 3.25 percent of total votes cast to cross the electoral threshold needed to enter the Knesset.
Israeli democracy operates on a parliamentary system of proportional-representation in which the government needs a majority to rule. Since no party has ever earned more than 61 of the 120 seats in the Knesset, a coalition is required.
Polls show Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rightist Likud in fierce competition with the centrist Blue and White party. Both camps are trying to rile up their bases to become the largest party in parliament while also convincing the smaller parties to join them in a coalition after the results become known.
Here's a look at the major players:
LONG-RULING LIKUD
Israel's conservative Likud party has dominated the political stage since 1977 with only a few exceptions, and it has controlled government for the past decade in large part thanks to Netanyahu's personality cult and strong base.
Netanyahu has brazenly allied himself with Israeli settlers and courted nationalist and ultra-Orthodox parties for his current coalition.
In past elections, Likud has depended on a groundswell of populist support from Mizrahi, or Middle Eastern, Jews who harbor deep-seated resentment toward Israel's European-descended founding elite and their social democratic brand of politics.
This constituency appears poised to support Netanyahu again, despite the attorney general's intention to indict him on three serious corruption charges.
If Netanyahu wins another term, he will be on track to become the longest serving leader in Israeli history. He'll also have to simultaneously lead the state while fighting criminal charges against him.
___
THE CENTRIST VANGUARD
Ex-army chief Benny Gantz shook up the scene when he announced the formation of a new party earlier this year, and several weeks later, when he formed a partnership with centrist politician and former television host Yair Lapid, head of the centrist Yesh Atid. Their joint Blue and White list presents the first viable challenge to Netanyahu's long rule.
If elected, Gantz would lead the government for the first two and a half years with Lapid taking over for the rest of the term.
The new coalition of centrists and former military officers has sought to mobilize a united front to oust the scandal-plagued Netanyahu, carrying the mantle of clean government, economic reform and respect for Israel's state institutions.
Gantz and his slate talk tough about standing up to Iran and striking Palestinian militants to appeal to hard-liners but have also hinted they won't foreclose future peace negotiations.
Although Blue and White has inched ahead of Likud in some polls, the party may find it more difficult to recruit suitable coalition partners.
___
THE NEW RIGHT
A pair of nationalist ministers, Naftali Bennett and Ayelet Shaked, ditched their religious Jewish Home party and formed the ""New Right"" to attract a broader range of secular but still staunchly pro-settler voters.
They've promised to join Likud's coalition, along with a handful of other right-wing and religious parties, but their sudden maneuver hints that their political aspirations may extend beyond Netanyahu's corruption-stained rule.
Bennett, often the first to slam Netanyahu for his failure to deter Gaza rockets, is jostling for the position of defense minister.
As justice minister, Shaked has clashed with the Supreme Court, which she views as a bastion of the Israeli left that unfairly curtails her party's nationalistic agenda.
Their sardonic campaign ads have stirred online debate, including one that features Shaked spritzing herself with a faux perfume called ""Fascism.""
___
THE OLD LEFT
The venerable Labor party, once Israel's largest faction that founded the state and promoted a statehood deal with the Palestinians, has languished under decades of Likud rule and an impasse in the peace process. It now appears overtaken by Blue and White and can only hope to join a coalition led by the new front-runner of the center-left bloc.
The liberal Zionist Union party dramatically split early this year after Labor leader Avi Gabbay announced the end of his party's union with former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, embarrassing her on live television. Livni subsequently bowed out of politics, ending her storied 20-year career.
___
THE CONTROVERSIAL ALLIANCE
The religious Zionist party Bennett once headed, Jewish Home, has joined forces with Jewish Power, a far-right faction inspired by the banned Kahanist movement, branded a terrorist organization by the U.S. for an extremist agenda that includes forced expulsion of Palestinians.
Netanyahu helped cut the deal in order to give the parties a better shot at passing the parliamentary threshold and serving as a potential coalition partner.
Both at home and abroad, Netanyahu's overture to Jewish Power drew sharp condemnation.
___
THE ARAB VOTE
Arab parties, which represent over 20 percent of Israel's citizens, could help sway the vote — if their constituents vote.
In the last election cycle, four Arab factions joined forces into a single list, energizing voters and winning a record number seats in the Knesset — 13. But this year, political infighting split the slate, which looks likely to cut away at their overall numbers.
Low turnout could also be an issue. Netanyahu's campaign against Arab politicians, seen as incitement in the Arab sector, together with the new alliance with anti-Arab extremists and the passage of last year's contentious nation-state law, which enshrined Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people alone, have deepened calls for a ballot boycott in Arab communities.
But some hope these blows will have the opposite effect, fueling enough frustration to drive up the Arab participation rate. That could complicate Netanyahu's attempts to form a coalition as he fights for a fourth consecutive term. Trending in World"

That same month, show creator Robert King said they were considering bringing Margulies back for a three-episode arc.
“We thought maybe about making a big episode where she would be at the resistance, Diane (Christine Baranski) and her face each other, but that would be the end of the story. It felt like an asterisk.”
Though Margulies reportedly praised the storytelling and her onetime castmates of the show, she&apos;s now unequivocally ruled out ever returning to the character.
“To be perfectly honest, I was shocked. I was more surprised than hurt,"" she said. ""I thought, what are you worth? If you are worthless, if you are not valued for your work, than what’s the point?”
