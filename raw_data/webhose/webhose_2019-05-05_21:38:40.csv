The state of Oklahoma has reached a settlement with drugmaker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family , for US$270 million to fund opioid addiction treatment.
This first of what could become a string of settlements will surely strengthen the resolve of activists urging the arts world, universities and other charities to distance themselves from the Sacklers – who amassed a fortune after founding Purdue Pharma . In protests that double as performance art, these activists have been hurling pill bottles, shouting slogans and waving banners demanding that these institutions scrub the Sackler name from their walls. They vow to keep the pressure up until the Sacklers and their company pay for the cost of fighting opioid addiction everywhere. Advertisement:
The Oklahoma settlement followed announcements by two of the Sacklers’ British charitable organizations that they had frozen their grantmaking in response to the refusal of U.K. and U.S. museums, art galleries and universities to accept new money from the Sacklers.
Does this mean that the family’s name will soon vanish from museums and university buildings? Probably not. As a nonprofit law scholar , I have seen that it’s much harder to sever prior arrangements with donors embroiled in scandals than it is to stop taking money from donors who are the object of public outrage.
A dilemma for charities Charities can have the most trouble distancing themselves from tainted donors when they grant a major giver naming rights : that is, name programs or buildings after them .
That is a serious obstacle in this instance, given how the Sacklers have left their mark through donations reflected in the U.S. and Europe, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Sackler Wing and the Guggenheim’s Sackler Center for Arts Education in New York City, the Serpentine Sackler Gallery in London and the Louvre’s Sackler Wing of Oriental Antiquities in Paris.
When these scandals strike, charities face a dilemma – keep the money given by the now-tarnished donor or return the tainted funds. But returning the funds may be easier said than done.
Once the money is given away, it’s committed to charitable use . Returning that money just because the donor’s reputation is now sullied may get the charity in trouble with state regulators . Advertisement:
But if the gift isn’t final, that is not an obstacle.
For example, before allegations regarding sexual abuse – and even rape – by Harvey Weinstein were first reported, the disgraced former Hollywood mogul had a history of supporting feminist causes. Apparently seeking to salvage what remained of his reputation, he sped up his plans to make a $5 million donation to fund scholarships for aspiring female directors studying at the University of Southern California.
But as several bombshell exposés and lawsuits were on the verge of ending his career , a student started an online petition and called on the university to refuse Weinstein’s “ blood money .” The school soon rejected the gift, thwarting Weinstein’s effort to cleanse his name through giving.
Morals provisions The complications that can arise from tainted donors is an incentive for charities to require “ morals provisions ” in naming rights agreements. These provisions let charities remove donors’ names from buildings, endowed fellowships or scholarships or return donated funds following allegations of or convictions for immoral or illegal behavior. Advertisement:
Otherwise, nonprofits must choose among a few bad options. They can give the money back, perhaps with interest. They can suspend programs or professorships named after the donors whose names have become an embarrassing burden, perhaps with threat of litigation from the donor for not fulfilling the charity’s end of the bargain. Or, they can continue to maintain the donor’s name and face public outrage.
In 1988 Bill and Camille Cosby made a $20 million gift to Spelman College, at the time the largest individual donation ever to a historically black college. A portion of the gift was used to endow a professorship at the women’s college bearing the performer’s name.
After allegations of Bill Cosby’s sexual assaults surfaced, Spelman sought to dissociate from its long-standing relationship with the performer. Without a morals provision in place, Spelman initially had to temporarily suspend the professorship. Advertisement:
Eventually, Spelman worked out a permanent solution to terminate the endowed professorship and distribute the related funds to a foundation established by his wife, Camille Cosby.
It will take more than that to scrub the Cosby name from the school altogether.
What Vanderbilt did Doing what’s morally right sometimes requires taking tough steps in terms of legal ramifications and expenses. But charities caught in this dilemma also face a cost for playing it safe by doing nothing. If prospective students or visitors stay away and other donors decide they’re better off not supporting this particular cause because of its association with a patron seen as toxic, it will be expensive no matter what they do. Advertisement:
Consider what happened at Vanderbilt University when it attempted in 2002 to rename “Confederate Memorial Hall,” a building which it had acquired following a merger with George Peabody College for Teachers in 1979.
Peabody had received a donation of $50,000 from the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1933 to fund the building’s construction, with the condition that the building carry the moniker in perpetuity. After Vanderbilt publicly announced that it would remove that tribute to the Confederacy from the building’s name and walls, the organization sued to enforce the terms of its gift agreement.
In 2005, the court ordered the university to reimburse the United Daughters of the Confederacy the value of its original donation, adjusted for inflation, in exchange for the right to rebrand the building.
A decade later, anonymous donors gave Vanderbilt the $1.2 million it took to get rid of what Chancellor Nicholas S. Zeppos called “a symbol of exclusion, and a divisive contradiction of our hopes and dreams of being a truly great and inclusive university.” Advertisement:
Once the cost of doing nothing gets too high in the long run, charities may implement costly options to terminate the association.
That is why in my view, museums and other recipients of the drug-making family’s philanthropy could eventually redirect their donations. But that won’t happen until what they lose by honoring Sackler gift agreements becomes more exorbitant than satisfying all of the anti-Sackler movement’s demands.
Editor’s note: The widow and children of Arthur Sackler assert that they have not financially benefited from OxyContin sales and that he was not culpable for the opioid crisis.

Congress' new Mueller fight: Do Dems need to begin impeachment to see secret files? - POLITICO,www.politico.com,KYLE CHENEY,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/06/mueller-impeachment-democrats-1259917,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Do Democrats have to begin the process of impeaching President Donald Trump in order to access special counsel Robert Mueller’s secrets?
That legal debate began raging inside the House Judiciary Committee on Friday after a new federal court ruling suggested that Congress’ access to some confidential evidence — like the kind obtained by Mueller — hinges on lawmakers launching a “judicial proceeding.” Story Continued Below
Republicans on the committee say the only “judicial proceeding” Congress can lead is an impeachment inquiry -- a claim they say is backed up by legal precedent and history. Democrats would have to launch one against Trump if they want Mueller’s grand jury evidence, Republicans say.
That interpretation would be problematic for Democratic leaders in Congress, who have little interest in launching a politically explosive impeachment process at the moment. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has said it’s not worth the House’s time and other top Democrats have said it’s premature while they conduct their own investigations and await the details of Mueller’s findings.
But it’s a fight that could animate the next few weeks and months as Democrats attempt to pry loose as much information from Mueller’s probe as they can. They’re still awaiting access to a redacted version of Mueller’s 400-page report, which Attorney General William Barr has indicated he’ll deliver by mid-April. But Democrats say Congress must see an unredacted version of the report and Mueller’s underlying evidence -- even if Barr has to get a judge to unseal the grand jury material it contains.

You can unsubscribe at any time.
That effort was complicated Friday by a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that said judges are not permitted to unseal grand jury information at their own discretion but rather must follow existing court guidelines that limit the disclosure of such material. Those guidelines have been used to share grand jury material with Congress “preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.”
The meaning of that phrase is likely to become a flashpoint in Congress’ battle over the Mueller report. Complicating the matter further, the 2-1 court decision may not be the final word legally on the issue if the full D.C. Appeals Court or the Supreme Court takes it up. But in the meantime, the Justice Department is hailing the ruling as a legal victory, a potential indication that it intends to hew closely to the traditional secrecy of grand jury matters.
“We are pleased that the court re-affirmed the Department of Justice’s long-standing position and Supreme Court precedent that the proper functioning of the grand jury depends on the confidentiality of proceedings,"" said Justice Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco. ""The Department of Justice will continue to defend the long established tradition of protecting grand jury information.”
Democrats have been demanding access to Mueller’s grand jury evidence for weeks, arguing it’s essential for them to review potentially damning information about Trump and his campaign’s contacts with Russians during the 2016 campaign, as well as evidence that Trump may have worked to obstruct the investigation. They note that Republicans joined them earlier this month in a 420-0 House vote to call for making Mueller’s “full report” available to Congress
Barr is also expected to redact other categories of evidence from Mueller's report, including classified material, material related to ongoing investigations and other details he deems damaging to ""peripheral third parties"" who aren't charged with any crimes. Democrats say they should get to see all of the information in those categories as well even if the broader public doesn't. Republicans, they note, received access to voluminous information in each category when they opened inquiries into how the FBI handled the Russia probe and the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server. But grand jury information is the only category Barr is filtering out of the report that Democrats say would require judicial permission to reveal to Congress."

bush1 was also an evil groper and the whole bush family were swamp rodents and the were for abortion no matter what they claimed (shockingly enough they were liars), but bush 1 never got called out for his groping and the family got a free pass on their cronyism (to the point I am not even sure how they did theirs exactly other than you could see plenty of graft went on while they were in office so you know they were in on it).

The Speaker said that changing the voting age to 16 would help drive a higher level of voter awareness and turnout.""I myself have always been for lowering the voting age to 16,"" Pelosi said. ""I think it's really important to capture kids when they're in high school, when they're interested in all of this, when they're learning about government, to be able to vote.""

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
It's time for sports.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
SIMON: The Final Four - finally here. The women's tourney began last night, men's tonight. Right here, right now, Howard Bryant of ESPN. Thanks very much for being with us, Howard.
HOWARD BRYANT, BYLINE: Hey, Scott. Good morning.
SIMON: Good morning. So last night, Notre Dame knocked off UConn once again, 81 - they're making a habit of this - 81-76. Brianna Turner had a great game.
BRYANT: She had a great game. And remember when we were talking not just a year, year and a half ago that - and, in fact, it was last year when we were talking about how women's basketball was just so boring. And college basketball belonged to UConn, and nobody could beat them and - yeah, look. Notre Dame, Scott...
SIMON: You said that.
BRYANT: I actually did not say that.
SIMON: I don't recall I ever felt that way.
BRYANT: (Laughter) I did not say that. I said, you got to play these games. And it seems to me that in a transition that college - women's college basketball is in, as the game becomes more and more and more competitive, you're going to have better teams. And Notre Dame is doing exactly - they're the defending champions, and they had a great, great tournament. They came in last night. They were trailing by eight in the fourth quarter. And it was just an amazing, you know, battle at the end. And, of course, you know, Arike Ogunbowale is just the - she's a star. She hit the winning shot last year in overtime against UConn, and she drops 13 in a 10-minute quarter last night. And so it's - this is a championship team playing like champions, and now they're playing for another, you know, back-to-back final.
SIMON: Baylor beat Oregon, also by five points.
BRYANT: And Baylor - once again, these - this is the great thing about this tournament. On the one hand, you have - I think there's so much more uncertainty in the men's game right now because the women - you know, the best teams showed up here. And if you look at what Baylor - they've been a great team all season long. They're a one seed as well. And so - and Lauren Cox, Kalani Brown - I mean, they're - this is going to be a great tournament. And it's going to be a really great final because I don't know who's going to win, and I don't think that there's a - you know, a real prohibitive favorite. I'm going to go with the defending champs and stick with Muffet McGraw and Notre Dame.
SIMON: And Muffet McGraw won a lot of admiration for her outspokenness at a press conference this week about the lack of women in leadership positions in sports.
BRYANT: Yeah, and she did. And she came out, and she said, look; I'm not going to hire any more - no more men. I'm not hiring any men. And she got all kinds - she got flak for that, and it became a national story. And she got all kinds of admiration for it, as well, for coming out and saying it. I thought what was very interesting about it is that if you look at the statistics that she was presenting from Title IX - that you had 90 percent of women's basketball coaches were women 40 years ago, and now it's down to 50 percent. And she's like, listen; we need more representation, and this is - I'm going to advocate for this.
And what's funny about it is that you have - in the real world, this is happening all the time, just that men aren't advertising it. So I didn't see what the big deal was. And not only that, it's not as if she said that no men should be hired. She said that's not what she's going to do for her program because she feels like there's more representation that is needed, and she's going to do her part. I didn't think it was that big a deal. I was happy that she said it, though.
SIMON: Hours from now, Auburn faces off against Virginia.
BRYANT: We've got the clear underdogs and the clear favorites in this, but I don't see that. I think any of these four teams can win. I think Texas Tech can beat Michigan State. And I think Virginia, you know, is, you know, the - Virginia is the team that was a great team all season, No. 1 at one point as well. But I was just thinking college basketball - I think all four teams can win. And I just don't see anybody with that much of an advantage. I'm going to go with Michigan State simply because I do like Tom Izzo. But I - once again, it wouldn't surprise me if any of the four teams won the championship.
SIMON: Yeah. Well, Tom Izzo doesn't get to dribble.
(LAUGHTER)
SIMON: Howard Bryant of espn.com and ESPN The Magazine. Thanks so much.
BRYANT: Oh, my pleasure, Scott. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
Perhaps you've seen her pinging around the Internet, a six-month-old baby in a purple jumpsuit in midair. She's being heaved across a yawning gap between two giant boulders by her precariously perched mother towards the waiting arms of her father. Actually, maybe, you shouldn't look. It's heart-stopping.
JORDAN LEADS: My name is Jordan Leads, and I am 27 years old.
SIMON: Jordan Leads is the airborne baby all grown up. She landed safely in the arms of her father that day, and the moment was photographed by Greg Epperson at Joshua Tree National Park back in 1991. It first appeared publicly four years later in a Patagonia catalog. And now it's been given a new life in the current catalogue, along with an update about Jordan.
LEADS: I am currently going to school to be a court reporter. I live in Las Vegas, Nev.
SIMON: She says the photo of her flying over a gap in the boulders was just one of many outdoorsy shots that hung on the walls of her parents' house. She enjoys seeing Photoshopped versions these days, like her infant self leaping with a pod of dolphins, being hurled out of a cannon or punted by a kicker on a football field.
LEADS: Another one - there's a guy that's juggling chainsaws, and I'm also being juggled. And then - oh, OK, also the dinosaur where my parents are feeding me to a ""Jurassic Park"" dinosaur, I think that's the best (laughter).
SIMON: Perhaps surprisingly in this era of Internet trolls, Jordan Leads says her parents didn't get a lot of public scolding for playing catch with their daughter at high altitudes. She says she knows of no calls to child protective services. And that early moment of flight among the boulders might have instilled some joy. Jordan Leads has become a rock climber and still occasionally climbs with her father. And she hopes to continue the tradition.
LEADS: I can't wait to show it to my kids one day and to show them how I was growing up, how my parents raised me and to really just bring that whole family value of going outside back to them. And I think it's so important to get outside. And these days, everyone is so lost in their own world. And I really think that they just need to get outside with their family and that that's what creates memories.
SIMON: Some day, she says, she may even try to re-enact the photo.
LEADS: I would put mine up on the wall, and then I could put my child's right next to it in our hallway. And, yeah, I would love to do that. I think that would be really cool.

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
""Fosse/Verdon"" premieres next week on FX, a miniseries based on what is all at once an enduring love, a toxic relationship and a persisting partnership in work, love and life between Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FOSSE/VERDON"")
MICHELLE WILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) You know, I didn't realize that you'd started as a dancer.
SAM ROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) Sure, sure.
WILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) That must have been difficult.
ROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) What's that?
WILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) Giving up dancing.
ROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) I still dance a little, you know?
WILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) Well, you're not going to cast yourself in this show, are you?
ROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) If they'd let me, I'd play your part.
SIMON: Sam Rockwell is Bob Fosse, the genius director and choreographer. Michelle Williams is Gwen Verdon, the legendary dancer and actor who gave life to works that include ""Damn Yankees,"" ""Sweet Charity"" and ""Chicago.""
Thomas Kail is one of the executive producers and one of the directors of ""Fosse/Verdon."" He's also directed many Broadway productions, including ""In The Heights,"" ""Lombardi"" and a little show called ""Hamilton"" with Lin-Manuel Miranda, who also is a co-producer of ""Fosse/Verdon."" Thomas Kail joins us from New York. Thanks so much for being with us.
THOMAS KAIL: I'm delighted to be here.
SIMON: Taken from Sam Wasson's biography ""Fosse,"" but why is this miniseries pointedly ""Fosse/Verdon""?
KAIL: Because this felt like an opportunity to have a conversation about how things are actually made. And this was a partnership, and Gwen's contribution has been overlooked. And when we started talking about this 2 1/2 years ago, one of the questions we kept on asking was, why do we know his name but we don't know hers? And we wanted to explore and examine the relationship and ask that question.
SIMON: It opens with the story of ""Cabaret,"" the film that made so much of the Bob Fosse legend and was that rare thing in the business, a risk in all ways - a musical set inside the rise of Nazism and an unfulfilled love story. And there were doubts about him as a director. How did all of the elements combine, and the two of them, to make this a success?
KAIL: Well, ""Cabaret"" was, you know, a relatively groundbreaking show, to say the least, in 1967 when Harold Prince directed it.
And around that time, Bob, who had already established himself as a very in-demand choreographer, decided that he wanted to go out West and make a movie. So he made a movie of ""Sweet Charity."" But he didn't cast the woman who originated the role of ""Sweet Charity,"" his wife Gwen Verdon. It was Shirley MacLaine who actually could get the movie made, so Gwen taught Shirley the part. They went out, and they made this thing together. And the movie, which many people were incredibly excited about, was a total bomb. And it was a disaster. So Bob was back to zero.
And this ""Cabaret"" movie was one that felt like it would allow him to access some of the parts of himself that were not accessed in ""Sweet Charity."" He got in there. He started making this movie, and he realized that he needed his, you know, his partner. And so Gwen came over and spent a lot of time on set with him, as well as in the edit room.
SIMON: And she's not even in the credits, is she?
KAIL: No, she's not.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""FOSSE/VERDON"")
ROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) It'd be great to get you here for a few days, maybe get your eyes on some of the numbers.
WILLIAMS: (As Gwen Verdon) Am I going to be unhappy when I get there?
ROCKWELL: (As Bob Fosse) No, of course not. Why would you be unhappy? I need you.
SIMON: You know, Bob Fosse was one of my artistic heroes until I saw this miniseries (laughter).
KAIL: You're welcome.
SIMON: But I think it's important to understand not just how much Gwen Verdon was a part of his success and what is still hailed as his genius, but - forgive me - what an utter ass he was.
KAIL: Well, you know, this kind of behavior that was accepted and has now been brought to light over these last few years felt like a conversation we wanted to be a part of, and this felt like an opportunity to take this kind of behavior out of the darkness and keep it in the light.
And having Nicole Fosse, the one child of Bob and Gwen, was an enormous resource and asset. She's a producer on the show. She was involved in the smallest things and the largest things, from what somebody might be wearing to how we were going to reconstruct these dances with real specificity and authenticity. And it felt like she was providing us so much insight into Gwen's life. And I think it gave us a lot of confidence to examine the darkest places because she felt it was necessary and essential, just like we did.
SIMON: Did Gwen Verdon just tolerate too much from Bob Fosse?
KAIL: What I know is the two of them found something in each other they couldn't find anywhere else. You know, Gwen was someone who is a survivor, and she was a fighter, and she was just as ambitious and as profoundly talented as Bob was.
This was someone - when she did a show called ""New Girl In Town"" in the late '50s, she took to bed one time - this is in the Wasson book - because Bob was being mistreated. And so she, in protest, stepped out of the show. And they had to bring in four people to play her part - four people - two people to dance it, one to act it and one to sing it.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ON THE FARM"")
GWEN VERDON: (Singing) You put me on the farm far away from harm. All kids need to grow up nice as milk.
SIMON: I mean, look; I love every minute of it, but you take us through breakdowns, heartbreak, deceptions, drunkenness, pill-gobbling. I thought at one point, wait; show business is supposed to be fun (laughter).
KAIL: I don't know who told you that. As we say, it ain't called show fun.
But, you know, show business both elevated and got Bob Fosse and Gwen Verdon out of their respective childhoods and took them to places they probably couldn't have dreamed of. But it also is an addiction. And you can become addicted to the applause. You can become addicted to that feeling of the great unknown of the audience. And the question is, what do you do when that goes away?
One of the other questions we thought about a lot was, what does the dancer do when the dancer stops dancing? The dancer dies twice. The dancer dies when they stop dancing, and then they die when it's all over. And Bob was someone who wanted desperately to be Fred Astaire. But at age 25, with his hair balding and his shoulders slouched and his look not what the studio wanted, he was fired. So to have the thing that you want to do taken away from you, how do you reconcile that?
SIMON: Generation from now, will how the talents who got there and what they went through and made other people go through count as much as the work of art?
KAIL: What I know is great work does not justify foul behavior. And there's a way that people that make things must be viewed when we have a greater context for how they made them or for what they did. But I feel like that's an incredibly subjective thing. And I just know that the who matters more than the what. And that's something that I learned years ago and I keep very present when I'm trying to make something. What we did is important. How we did it and who I did it with matters the most.
SIMON: Thomas Kail - he's one of the executive producers of ""Fosse/Verdon,"" set to premiere on FX. Thanks so much for being with us.
KAIL: It's my pleasure. Thank you for having me.
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""IF MY FRIENDS COULD SEE ME NOW"")
VERDON: (Singing) If they could see me now, that little gang of mine. I'm eating fancy chow and drinking fancy wine. I'd like those stumble bums to see for a fact the kind of top-drawer, first-rate chums I attract. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
What's in the Mueller report? When will we all know? It's just been over two weeks since the special counsel submitted his findings in interference in the 2016 election to Attorney General Barr, who delivered a relatively short summary of what he found to be in the findings. But this week, there were reports members of the Mueller team are not pleased with the way Attorney General Barr characterized their report.
Many Democrats have said they just don't trust the Barr summary. Mr. Barr's views on executive power during his confirmation hearings displeased many Democrats. Just three Democrats voted to confirm him; one of them - Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, who joins us now. Senator, thanks so much for being with us.
DOUG JONES: Hey, thank you, Scott, for having me.
SIMON: How's your vote looking now?
JONES: Well, I think it still looks fine. I mean, you know, I voted for Bill Barr for any number of reasons, not just on the Mueller report but also because he is - you know, he's an institutionalist as far as the Department of Justice goes. He has a lot of respect for that department, as do I. I'm a former member of that department as a U.S. attorney. I felt like the department needed a lot of stability. He gave me assurances regarding two things - first, you know, that he would not interfere with the special counsel. That's obviously come to pass. And the second thing is that he would provide as much transparency as possible. So I think that we're OK right now. We'll look and see once the report gets out. And I understand all of, you know, the naysayers right now about that the report itself. But let's just see what the report says before we jump to too many conclusions.
SIMON: Reports this week also say members of the Mueller team informed associates they had prepared summaries that were meant to be shared with the public and that didn't happen. Does that give you any pause?
JONES: Well, you know, those summaries were prepared all along, and apparently, you know, the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, who many people, you know, we're trying to protect, did not share those as they were going. I don't know what those reports say. I want to see the full report. I think that's the main thing. Let's just try to see the full report. We'll see what happens then. I think you won't see everything. I think there will be some redactions. Remember; we've got two indictments dealing with Russian interference with the election. That's the one thing we know that's going to be in the report is a detailed information about Russian interference. Let's just see how this goes before we jump to too many conclusions, and then we'll go from there. The main thing is we do need to see the report.
SIMON: When you say we need to see the report, does that include us? Does that include your constituents?
JONES: Well, I would like as many people as possible to see that report. I mean, I really would like to see the whole thing made public. You know, I recognize there's got to be - I say got to be. There may have to be some national security redactions. We get a lot of briefings in a classified setting about what's going on with Russian interference in the elections. I get that. But I would like to see the public, the media, everyone made aware of everything that could possibly be in that report - just like the House of Representatives voted unanimously. That's what we've been saying all along. Let's get it out there, and let's just see and let the chips fall where they're going to fall.
SIMON: As you noted, you're a former federal prosecutor. Would - has the way Attorney General Barr handled this matter be just about the way you think you might have?
JONES: Absolutely. I just - I think he's played it straight by the book. I think people are overreacting a little bit about the reports coming out from the Mueller report - I mean, Mueller team. You got to remember, you know, he's going to do this in his eyes and what he believes and what he thinks. I think he's done exactly what he said he would do. That four-page summary came out very quickly. People may have different views about that, but it came out quickly with the top lines. And it takes a little bit when you're looking at a national security review, a Rule 6(e) grand jury review. It takes a little bit of time to go through a 400-page report. I think he's doing it timely, just like Bob Mueller did. I'm fine with the way it is now. We'll see what happens when it comes out. You can call me back then, and I'll give you another opinion.
SIMON: Well, that'll be after the Auburn game. Alabama Senator Doug Jones, thanks so much.
JONES: (Laughter) Thanks a lot, Scott. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
This week, Representative Richard Neal, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, officially requested six years of Donald Trump's tax returns. The request was months in the making. Speaker Nancy Pelosi made clear - as she banged the podium at a press conference this week - Democrats do not intend to back down.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
NANCY PELOSI: Let's rise to a level of presidential in all of this. Show us the Mueller report. Show us the tax returns. And we're not walking away just because you say no the first time around.
SIMON: NPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell joins us in our studios. Thanks so much for being with us.
KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Thanks for having me.
SIMON: Tax returns are typically private - right? - confidential between a filer and the IRS. Let's also note President Trump is one of the few candidates for president in recent years who hasn't voluntarily released his returns. How are Democrats making this request?
SNELL: Well, first, we should say that the IRS automatically audits the tax returns of any president. But this is a request going back to 2013. Democrats want to see what his tax returns look like before he was president. Now, they're using a special authority that tax-writing committees have. It's called Section 6103. Now, that's the very technical way of saying that they are demanding the president's tax returns. They are not requesting them. And typically, the committee keeps the returns private. But, actually, there's new research out from the big research arm of Congress, the Congressional Research Service, that says they don't have to keep it confidential. They can release the information to all of Congress. And then from there, we would expect many, many members - many Democrats - would want to make that public.
SIMON: Any reason to believe the president's going to comply now?
SNELL: No, not at all. He says he can't release his taxes because he's being audited. That's what he said during the campaign as well. And he was asked about this at the White House twice this week. First, he said he wasn't inclined to comply, and then he was even more clear on Friday when he was walking into Marine One to leave for a tour of the border.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm under audit, but that's up to whoever it is. From what I understand, the law is 100 percent on my side.
SNELL: One hundred percent on his side - that doesn't necessarily seem to be true. Witnesses testified earlier this year that there's not a lot of wiggle room when the committee uses this authority to make a request. And on Friday, President Trump's personal lawyer said that this request flouts constitutional constraints. So they're basically arguing that Congress doesn't have the right to even be asking.
SIMON: And the reaction from Republicans in Congress.
SNELL: Well, they are so far siding with the president. They're calling it a massive overreach. Now, the Republicans in the House and the Senate agree on this point. And Senator Chuck Grassley, who oversees taxes over in the Senate as the Senate Finance Committee chairman, railed against Democrats on the Senate floor and called it a political attack.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CHUCK GRASSLEY: It's motivated by their desire to use all of the resources at their disposal to find something, anything, to bring this president down.
SNELL: But so far, it doesn't seem like there's a lot Republicans can do to stop it. This is very likely to become a legal fight. We expect to have the president's lawyers involved. We hear that they want to continue to fight this. And they'll have to find a way to argue that there is no legislative reason to be asking for the president's tax returns. So that's probably the first front in what could be a very, very, very long fight over whether or not the returns become public at all.
SIMON: One of the reasons candidates for president got into the habit of releasing their tax returns is it was felt the American people had a right to know if the policies they espoused had any relation to personal financial gain. There are a lot of questions about that in this administration, aren't there?
SNELL: Yeah. And that's part of what Democrats are arguing here is that they not only have legislative reasons wanting to understand how they can legislate to ensure that people are protected in the country, but they also have an oversight responsibility. And they say that knowing how the president may be profiting from his businesses or other interactions from his presidency - that's something that they say is really important to disclose, something that they can't look at without his tax returns.
SIMON: NPR's Kelsey Snell, thanks so much for being with us.

Biden Comments And Jokes On Inappropriate Touching Allegations,www.gpb.org,Don Gonyea,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/biden-comments-and-jokes-inappropriate-touching-allegations,"Originally published on April 6, 2019 2:09 pm Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:
And it has been a week of controversy for the still unofficial presidential campaign of Joe Biden. Several women have come forward with stories of moments, they say, in which Mr. Biden made them feel extremely uncomfortable by hugging them or getting too close. Yesterday, the former vice president made his first public appearance since those allegations and commented on the matter. NPR's Don Gonyea says it began a bit awkwardly.
DON GONYEA, BYLINE: The setting was a morning speech by Joe Biden to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. He was introduced by the union's president, Lonnie Stephenson. As Biden took the stage, the two men shared a friendly embrace, prompting this...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOE BIDEN: And I just want you to know I had permission to hug Lonnie.
(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)
GONYEA: Biden then went into what seemed a standard stump speech. But about 10 minutes later, he invited some kids in the audience up on stage. He shook their hands and gave one of the boys a quick hug and then this...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BIDEN: By the way, he gave me permission to touch him.
(LAUGHTER)
GONYEA: But that was it for that topic. The speech continued, including this attack on President Trump...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BIDEN: Well, this president wages war on Twitter and insults his opponents, attacks our most important institutions - the courts, the press, the Congress - inflames our nation's oldest wounds of racism and hate.
GONYEA: Biden was warmly received inside the ballroom. Afterward, he approached a scrum of reporters clustered on the sidewalk outside. Biden seemed to want to set the record straight about something he said - the lines about getting permission for those onstage hugs. His first words - that his intent was not to make light of anyone's discomfort.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BIDEN: I realize my responsibility is to not invade the space of anyone who is uncomfortable in that regard. And I hope it wasn't taken that way.
GONYEA: When asked if he'll offer a direct apology to the women who have come forward, Biden said he's sorry he didn't understand he'd made them uncomfortable.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BIDEN: I'm sorry I didn't understand. I'm not sorry for any of my intentions. I'm not sorry for anything that I have ever done. I've never been disrespectful intentionally, to a man or a woman.
GONYEA: The questioning turned to when Biden would officially join the Democratic presidential contest. He promised an announcement very soon. Asked if the events of the past week would change the way he campaigns, the politician, who has always prided himself in authenticity, in his ability to be himself, acknowledged, yes, it would.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BIDEN: And it's not a bad thing. It's a new thing, it's important and I'm sure it's going to take a while for it to settle out. But it's settled out for me (laughter).

"Novel Material: Ann Beattie, Voice Of The Boomers, Turns Her Focus To Millennials",www.gpb.org,Lynn Neary,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/novel-material-ann-beattie-voice-boomers-turns-her-focus-millennials,"By Lynn Neary • 32 minutes ago Originally published on April 6, 2019 8:33 am
Ann Beattie has been hailed as the voice of her generation, but she's never taken that distinction too seriously. Beattie's short stories began appearing in The New Yorker in the 1970s . In her latest book, A Wonderful Stroke of Luck, the voice of the boomer generation focuses on a new generation — the Millennials.
Beattie has published more than 20 books over the course of her career, both novels and short story collections. She says short stories come more easily to her. Novels, she admits, are ""endlessly fascinating,"" but more of a struggle.
""You just can't imagine how much I go wrong in a novel versus how much I go wrong in drafts of a short story,"" she laughs. ""It's really astonishing, I'll never get it down.""
Beattie says getting started is always hard, so she tries to jump off from an image. The image that inspired A Wonderful Stroke of Luck was a boarding school.
It's completely fictional — ""I went to public high school in Washington, D.C., what do I know?"" says Beattie — but she does readings at boarding schools, and has found them ""extremely beautiful"" but ""incredibly mysterious.""
Beattie's Bailey Academy caters to smart, rich kids with troubled backgrounds. One group within the school, the honor society, falls under the spell of a charismatic and elusive young teacher, Pierre LaVerdere.
Eventually we learn that LaVerdere insinuated himself into his students' lives in some damaging ways. This is revealed as Beattie follows Ben, one of those students, into young adulthood. Ben meanders aimlessly through life, working at jobs he doesn't care about, falling into relationships that are going nowhere. He leaves New York City and moves upstate to the Hudson Valley. It's the kind of place, Beattie writes, that Millennials flocked to in the decades after the Sept. 11 attacks.
""Once you know something of that magnitude, you can never not know it,"" Beattie says. ""I think it's always there as a kind of refrain, or as a kind of conscious or subconscious awareness.""
But just as she rejected the idea that she was ever the voice of her own generation, Beattie insists that she did not set out to make sweeping observations about Millennials. ""I never really think that I'm defining a generation,"" she says. ""I at least want to think that what I am doing is talking about individual psychology.""
Beattie leaves a lot unsaid in her novel. She believes dialogue can be misleading and unrealistic. Her favorite punctuation mark, especially when writing short stories, is the asterisk. It allows her to leap forward without filling in too many details. It's better if the reader fills in the blanks, she says.
""There's what's there and then ... what's not there. ..."" she explains. ""You want to give a cue to the reader that there's a lot not here.""
Beattie says she doesn't necessarily know at the outset whether she's writing a short story or a novel. She doesn't have an outline, and she never knows how it will end.
At the moment, she is working on something that might be a short novel ... but she's not sure yet. All she can say for certain is: She has written up to the point where there's an asterisk. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

Here's What To Know About Israel's Upcoming Elections,www.gpb.org,Larry Kaplow,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/heres-what-know-about-israels-upcoming-elections,"By Larry Kaplow • 47 minutes ago Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, is escorted by security guards during a visit to the Hatikva market in Tel Aviv on Tuesday. Oded Balilty / AP
Israel will hold parliamentary elections Tuesday that are largely a referendum on the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The country has seen a decade under Netanyahu. It's been a time of dramatic economic growth, sporadic conflict with neighbors and the formation of what is probably the most solidly right-wing coalition in Israel's history.
Netanyahu, who has an edge in most polls, has allied closely with President Trump and attracted increased criticism from left-wing Americans and even pro-Israel organizations.
His government has passed laws banning entry to foreigners who support boycott s and targeting activist groups — largely those supporting Palestinians — that receive international funding .
He was prime minister for three years in the 1990s, was elected again in 2009 and won re-election twice. With another victory now, he could — this summer — pass David Ben-Gurion as the longest-serving Israeli premier.
Netanyahu's main challenger is retired Gen. Benny Gantz. New to politics, he has positioned himself as a centrist alternative to Netanyahu. He heads a new party cobbled together with former senior officers ranging from the center to the right. If he wins enough seats to form a government, it's conceivable that he could form a ruling coalition with the center-left Labor Party as well as with right-wing parties.
How it works
The country's 6.3 million registered voters are choosing the 120 lawmakers in the parliament, or Knesset. There are about a dozen main candidate lists to choose from, made of single parties or groups of parties. There are some 30 other lists, too. So the new government will be chosen as parties form coalitions and make deals with each other. Former Israeli army chief of staff Benny Gantz dances with ultra-Orthodox Jewish men at the Western Wall, in Jerusalem's Old City, on March 28. Gantz is running in opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sebastian Scheiner / AP
Israel's president sets that process in motion by choosing a candidate with the best chance of gathering the 61 seats for a majority — generally the leader from the party with the most votes.
A wide array of parties
Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party currently holds the biggest bloc in parliament, with 30 seats . Second is the center-left Labor Party — now in the opposition — with 18. That leaves a lot of other seats held by smaller parties.
Netanyahu's main challenger, Gantz, leads the Blue and White alliance, including a collection of military figures and an existing centrist party that now has 11 seats in the parliament.
Netanyahu's current coalition comprises his Likud and mostly Jewish religious parties that take a hard line on relations with the Palestinians.
One party making an unexpected splash with young voters is called Zehut (Identity), whose leader favors legalizing marijuana and — in what would be an extreme-right position — annexation of the occupied West Bank, land populated mostly by Palestinians that Israel captured in 1967.
There's one main left-wing party, Meretz (Vigor), which has lost ground over the years and now holds five seats in the parliament.
There are two lists from Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel, which hold 13 parliamentary seats. They seek to provide representation for their 20 percent of the country's population but rarely join any government coalition — meaning they don't usually factor in deciding who becomes prime minister.
Focus on Netanyahu
Israeli politics traditionally revolves around security, economics and the role of religion in government. But this campaign has hinged largely on Netanyahu himself.
There's some Netanyahu fatigue after 10 years of his combative style and an accumulation of scandals around him. In February, the country's attorney general said he was preparing indictments against Netanyahu over cases concerning gifts he's accepted and favors he's allegedly done for media moguls to win positive coverage.
Netanyahu's pitch in the campaign is that Israel has never been in better shape. ""We have brought an unprecedented diplomatic flowering,"" a Likud party ad states.
The economy has grown steeply over the last decade, with unemployment down and incomes way up. The government has increased trade around the region and the world. And though there has been conflict with neighbors — a 2014 war with Hamas in Gaza that the United Nations said left more than 2,100 Palestinians dead , rocket attacks from Gaza and Lebanon — the toll for Israelis has been relatively low and the impact on daily life has been minimal.
But Netanyahu's critics worry about the health of the country's democracy. They note passage of a law declaring Israel as the ""nation state of the Jewish people,"" which could undermine the standing of the country's 1.6 million Palestinian Arab citizens. Netanyahu says everyone has equal rights but recently also said, ""Israel is the nation state not of all of its citizens, but only of the Jewish people.""
He has highlighted his close relationship with Trump, which has led to Washington backing Israeli claims to sovereignty in the Golan Heights and Jerusalem (where the U.S. opened its embassy last year). He has also met with other nationalist leaders in the run-up to the vote, from Brazil's Jair Bolsanaro to Russia's Vladimir Putin.
The alternative
Benny Gantz served as chief of staff of the Israeli military — the country's highest-ranking officer — and retired in 2015. He has little political record but has cast himself as the clean alternative to Netanyahu's embattled administration. ""There's no more left and right. Israel before all,"" says his campaign.
His campaign promises new laws barring people who have been convicted of crimes from holding office and he favors term limits for prime ministers. Gantz's critics have accused him of using his connections to get government contracts for a private company he headed after leaving the military. Netanyahu's campaign questions his mental fitness .
Meanwhile, Gantz casts himself as someone ready to use overwhelming force against Israel's enemies. An early campaign ad touted his leadership of Israel's war against Hamas in 2014 and showed video of airstrikes.
Gantz has also promised to make peace but speaks without much specificity about a ""separation"" from the Palestinians. He says he'll also reduce religious influence over Israeli law. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"

"As 2020 Candidates Pitch Scrapping The Electoral College, Voters Are Intrigued",www.gpb.org,Britta Greene,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/2020-candidates-pitch-scrapping-electoral-college-voters-are-intrigued,"By Britta Greene • 1 hour ago Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., left, speaks at a campaign house party, last month in Salem, NH. Warren has proposed abolishing the Electoral College. Elise Amendola / AP
At a time of deep disenchantment with the political system, dramatic proposals to upend how politics are conducted are starting to resonate with voters.
So far, Democrats running for president have endorsed proposals to abolish the Electoral College , expand the number of Supreme Court justices along with overhauling the role of money in politics. Some voters want them to go even further.
At a recent event at a high school in Littleton, New Hampshire with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., one attendee praised Warren for backing proposals to scrap the Electoral College in favor of a popular vote — then asked if she would support passing laws based on citizen petitions and national referendums.
Warren laughed. ""You come to New Hampshire and you hear about democracy,"" she said. ""I love this.""
While the idea of a national system for citizen petitions isn't mainstream, Democratic voters aren't rejecting ideas that would have been unthinkable a decade or two ago.
That shift in sentiment comes at a time when just a third of Americans think the country is headed in the right direction, according to a recent Gallup poll .
But even as the Democratic presidential candidates keep throwing out different ideas — term limits for Supreme Court justices, restrictions on redistricting to prevent gerrymandering — voters are trying digest the proposals.
Two attendees in the crowd for Warren's event, Jimmy Darden and Brian Romeo, were conflicted about abolishing the Electoral College. Both live just over the state line in neighboring Vermont.
Surveys suggest Democratic voters strongly support a national popular vote but Darden worried it would penalize voters in states with small populations like Vermont and New Hampshire.
""I think, even still, that just shows that everyone's vote is not equal,"" Romeo argued. ""I feel like it should be, regardless of where you live.""
For those voters concerned about making big changes to the political order, South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who recently argued that additional justices should be added to the Supreme Court, argues experimentation can be healthy.
""In a country that changed its Constitution so you couldn't drink, and then realized that that was a bad idea and changed it back, we have the mechanisms to do this responsibly but boldly,"" Buttigieg told New Hampshire voters.
One open question is whether this talk of overhauling the political system will draw voters to a candidate in both the primary and general elections?
""I think these ideas are further down the list than what seems to me to be more important issues,"" argued Maynard Goldman of Grantham, NH. ""You know, jobs and the economy, immigration.""
His neighbor Dave Wood agreed, but said political gridlock had prevented recent Congresses and presidents from addressing those issues.
""If we can't deal with healthcare and climate change and the big issues because we're so partisan,"" he said, ""then fixing the partisan divide is the primary objective so that we can deal with the things that really matter.""

Dangerous Art: A Stark But Inspiring New Exhibit,www.gpb.org,Diane Cole,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/dangerous-art-stark-inspiring-new-exhibit,"Dangerous Art: A Stark But Inspiring New Exhibit By Diane Cole • 1 hour ago Those aren't birds — they're mini-missiles made of foam, from ""Hellfire II,"" a piece by Pakistani-American artist Mahwish Chishty. It's part of the ""Perilous Bodies"" exhibit at the Ford Foundation Gallery in Manhattan. Yana Paskova for NPR
A rickety-looking wooden boat is piled high with overstuffed bags covered in colorfully patterned African fabrics. Hanging overboard: a collection of toy plastic teapots and gasoline cans. Instead of floating on water, this ark is adrift on an ocean of green glass bottles.
The boat is actually a piece of art called ""Road to Exile,"" by the Cameroonian artist Barthélémy Toguo, part of a series of works examining migration and colonialism. Poised at the entrance to ""Perilous Bodies,"" the initial exhibit at the Ford Foundation Gallery in Manhattan, it is the first stop on a journey through the perils of living in the 21st century. The boat is a piece of art called ""Road to Exile"" and was created by Cameroonian artist Barthélémy Toguo. It sits on a sea of green glass bottles. Yana Paskova for NPR
Go through the gallery doors, and swarming overhead is what at first appears to be a flock of blackbirds. Look again: These are miniature foam, laser-cut replicas of air-to-surface Hellfire missiles. Pakistani-American artist Mahwish Chishty conceived the piece, ""Hellfire II,"" as the trajectory of a drone strike, she says.
These are but two of the 19 artists whose paintings, photographs, videos and mixed-media installations fill the gallery's two rooms. Their works, from small to large-scale, all illustrate the perils of living in a world of inequality, conflict and injustice. The curators are Jaishri Abichandani and Natasha Becker.
""The works here are visceral,"" says Abichandani. ""You don't necessarily have to read the labels.""
But you do have to take a closer look to fully comprehend the artist's intention. An oversized tapestry at first glance resembles a planet-filled space-blue backdrop for a planetarium show. But what ""The Weight of Scars"" by the Nigerian-Belgian artist Otobong Nkanga actually maps is a Namibian landscape marred by the mining of minerals. Artist Tiffany Chung constructed 31 wooden lightboxes displaying ""found images"" of war-torn homes in Syria — a work she titles ""finding one's shadow in ruins and rubble."" Yana Paskova for NPR
Bold white rope-like lines connect black-and-white photographic discs depicting images of abandoned mine shafts and cracked, fragmented land. Holding up the ropes on either side are mechanical, headless human figures.
""This is a reference to the physical bodies involved in the extraction of minerals,"" says Becker. The tapestry as a whole, she says, evokes the scars left on the human body, the land and the abandoned communities.
A separate work nearby consists of three larger copper plates, in each of which a photo of an anonymous Dalit woman from 19th-century India is superimposed against a backdrop of legal texts from the era. The purpose of the juxtaposition is to show the women's double exclusion from the legal system as both women and as members of society's lowest caste, the so-called untouchables. A piece showing portraits of three unnamed Dalit women is called ""We are still here."" Their images are juxtaposed against legal texts from the 19th century governing their lives as women and as the lowest caste in Indian society. Yana Paskova for NPR
The series is called ""We are still here,"" explains artist Thenmozhi Soundararajan. ""I did these as a testament to the courage of Dalit women, to return their dignity and put these women into an ancestral place of honor.""
Some of the art reflects ongoing protests against injustices. A photograph of a woman sleeping in a public park is part of ""Meet to Sleep/I Never Ask for It"" an ongoing safety campaign started by Jasmeen Patheja, a human rights activist and artist from India. Women volunteer to sleep outside, at different times of day and night, usually in groups, then log the time and place to emphasize their right to be safe in open spaces.
A potted ""cactus,"" sculpted out of border patrol uniform fabric, is embroidered with figures and landscapes that tell the stories of immigrants crossing the border from Central America and Mexico to the United States. It is one of many such cactus sculptures created by ""Space in Between,"" workshops across the country organized by Mexican artist Margarita Cabrera. She began the project in Houston nine years ago and now has about 700 collaborators, who participate in workshops in which they embroider scenes from their personal stories of crossing the border onto the fabric leaves. The fabric cactus is one of many created by artist Margarita Cabrera, who collaborates with women to embroider their immigration stories on the leaves. Yana Paskova for NPR
The idea is to use traditional Mexican embroidery crafts to allow people to tell their stories. Thus, on one cactus leaf here you see the embroidered outlines of mountains, sun, and clouds — and a trailer-truck filled with people. Another leaf unfolds to reveal a brightly colored human hand, symbolizing the hold of family. A detail from artist Mohamad Hafez's ""Damascene Athan Series 2017"" showing bombed-out Syrian cities. Yana Paskova for NPR
The need to connect to one's past is also present in the work of Syrian-born architect Mohammed Hafez. In ""Damascene Athan Series 2017"" he creates miniature streetscapes and interiors of bombed-out cities. ""These works reflect my nostalgia for Syria but these scenes can apply to many cities in the Middle East, inn Europe and in North Africa,"" he says. Adding another layer of meaning, each work is backed by an elaborate mirror frame. ""The concept is that instead of seeing our reflections in the mirror, we are seeing our emotional baggage. We cannot escape our past,"" or history, he says. ""It pops out at us every single day when we look at our own mirrors."" The artist known as Dread Scott is called ""The Blue Wall of Violence. He shows six shooting targets showing what six unarmed black men were holding when shot by the police: keys, a squeegee, a candy bar, a toy gun, a wallet and nothing. Yana Paskova for NPR
Artists should ""document their societies,"" he says. ""They are ringers of bells of danger and warning"" — a vision brought to life in ""Perilous Bodies.""

Court Life Is Murder In 'The Poison Bed',www.gpb.org,Bethanne Patrick,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/court-life-murder-poison-bed,"By Bethanne Patrick • 1 hour ago
When the press release for The Poison Bed by Elizabeth Fremantle called it "" Gone Girl meets The Miniaturist ,"" I took notice — because while I enjoyed Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl , I flat-out loved Jessie Burton's 2014 debut The Miniaturist , which brought readers to a 16th-century Amsterdam as sugar-trade boomtown, a place few of us had ever considered.
You'll immediately get the Burton connection with Fremantle's fifth book, which is based on a 16th-century true crime, the case of Frances and Robert Carr. The Carrs were convicted in 1616 of murdering Sir Thomas Overbury, one of the many courtiers surrounding King James I. Period detail abounds, from the bling-y golden ruffs that Frances's creepy cohort Anne Turner dyes with saffron, to the time it takes to bake a meat pie (""a good hour""), to the high value of an intact hymen amongst the upper classes.
There's also plenty of intrigue and sexy sex, with the intriguing difference that the sexiest sex is between men. When they called Robert Carr ""the King's Favourite,"" they weren't talking about his amazing intellect. The much-older king paws constantly at his boy toy, who lets us know he's only ever felt lust for men before he sets eyes on the slender Frances, who could be a boy were it not for her Rapunzel-like hair. While he dreams of Frances, only Frances, King James is wetly kissing him and maneuvering him into yet another round of ""the acts we performed ... certainly they contravened the law, but human desire can take many forms ..."" There's a lot of musk released, many musky garments, tons of male pheromones flying fast and furious around the royal personage. (All that musk is eminently human. Still, I wondered more than once if Fremantle really wanted to write erotica.)
However, the author allows her initially farcical version of Jacobean London to ease up as she speeds up the flip-flopping perspectives of Frances and Robert, signaled merely at each chapter's start by the words ""Her"" and ""Him."" Despite the speed of their alternating perspectives, the two tell their stories slowly, using their present circumstances and past peccadilloes to heighten the tension about whodunit.
Which is where, of course, the Flynn comparisons come from: Frances is a member of the powerful, ruthless Howard clan, people who will stop at nothing when it comes to gaining royal favor. The special pawn of her nasty Uncle Henry (""she's more than a daughter to me,"" he tells Carr), Frances has more political knowledge beneath her ruff than most of her male contemporaries will ever learn. She may be, as a female, a pawn in some games, but she hopes at some point to gain her freedom by playing along skillfully. What she wants, she tells us, is to be married in full, to have her own home, to be happy with Robert Carr, to be healed of the brokenness she feels, which she has told him about in sad detail.
Perhaps we shouldn't take her words at face value, what with the Gone Girl comparison and all. Or should we? On your way to finding out, maybe you'll be most affected, as I was, by scenes between Frances and a young woman named Nelly. In those sections we learn a great deal about the severely restricted choices for women in early-modern England — and how those restricted choices also restricted their communication. Like all the best writers of historical thrillers, Elizabeth Fremantle weaves together documented fact with sensitively imagined fiction to create a novel that helps us understand a time and place better. -
But back to Frances Howard Carr and her story, because the second half of the book tells us much more about a different version than the one we've already learned. What could be more tense than being the King's Favourite? Remaining the King's Favourite, that's what. Once married, Frances and Robert have to work harder than a CEO trying to close a billion-dollar deal to maintain their positions. (Perhaps court nobles of various times and places were the CEOs of their day? Discuss.) While Fremantle doesn't live up to Flynn's sly, artful deceit in plotting — who could? — she makes up for it in the slow trail of clues left showing us what really happened at King James' court.
Except, of course, she doesn't. No one will ever know the full truth behind the Carr case. (Don't look on Wikipedia if you don't want your reading of The Poison Bed prematurely spoiled!) Like all the best writers of historical thrillers, Elizabeth Fremantle weaves together documented fact with sensitively imagined fiction to create a novel that helps us understand a time and place better. It doesn't matter if you guess whodunit, early or late. The tale is in the telling, and so is the readerly enjoyment. If your idea of a great summer read is closer to The Miniaturist than Gone Girl , I highly recommend The Poison Bed . And maybe you'll want to keep track of what your spouse buys at the drugstore, too.

Boeing To Slow Production Of 737 Max Jets As It Works On Flight Control Software Fix,www.gpb.org,Daniella Cheslow,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.gpb.org/post/boeing-slow-production-737-max-jets-it-works-flight-control-software-fix,"Boeing To Slow Production Of 737 Max Jets As It Works On Flight Control Software Fix By Daniella Cheslow • 12 hours ago A Boeing 737 MAX 8 airplane sits on the assembly line on March 27, in Renton, Wash.

Boeing says it is reducing production of its 737 Max planes, and the temporary slowdown will begin in mid-April.
CEO Dennis Muilenburg says the company will build 42 of the planes per month, down from the current 52, while keeping the same number of workers. Boeing still has an enormous backlog of orders — about 4,600 — for the Max planes. That will take years to fill.
Muilenburg says he now knows that two deadly crashes within five months of each other, involving Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines, had a common link of a malfunctioning flight-control software called MCAS.
He says he has asked Boeing's board of directors to create a committee to review company policies for airplane development and recommend improvements.
Ethiopian Airlines released a preliminary report Thursday on the crash of its plane on March 10. Investigators say the pilots used procedures provided by Boeing but couldn't stop the plane's repeated nose dives. All 157 people on board died in the crash just after takeoff from Addis Ababa.
A Lion Air 737 Max jet crashed in a similar way on Oct. 9, with pilots frantically trying to stop the nose from dropping. The plane went down off the coast of Java, killing 189 people.
The 737 Max planes have been grounded worldwide for nearly a month as Boeing works on a software fix. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 Georgia Public Broadcasting"
The children of Ontario schools have little or no clue how they are being abused and used,defendingthetruth.com,David Jeffrey Spetch (invalid@example.com),04-05-2019,2019,4,https://defendingthetruth.com/threads/the-children-of-ontario-schools-have-little-or-no-clue-how-they-are-being-abused-and-used.110780/,"#1 The children of Ontario schools have little or no clue how they are being abused and used I urge that the education system finally share the facts on foundations of primary issues I have addressed with the officials of Canada for years with these children so they can see through the lies forced upon them by liberals for years and then they can do some critical thinking since their education was replaced years ago by the liberals primarily with an insanity manifestation of leftist / globalist lies and deceptions. Liberals obviously couldn't care what Ontarian citizens majority wants because it was more important to them to turn backs on citizens, turn backs on democracy while instead forcing the dictatorship of lobbyist / globalist crime organization for decades. This is what sabotages democracy and leads to even innocent little children as pawns to divide society with lies. Don't these kids understand that cuts need to be made because of liberal thieves robbing our economies with their sick and filthy mental redundancies in an ever accumulating debt we shouldn't even have. Oh I bet children love to pass without doing any effort over McGuinty / Wynne boasting that was an education or promoted success of anything other than replacing the curriculum with a sick joke and filling children's heads with leftists trying to hide the genuine definitions of words such as gender and attempting to replace definitions of words with leftist lies while forcing factually proven foundations of leftist lies through legislation (Ontario bill 89 for example). What the majority wants is what democracy is, instead we get tyranny and treason on all 3 levels of government. Instead of including a story about Ontario students walking out of school today, (BTW I suspect my google news feed is deliberately being tampered with because I saw two stories yesterday stating the walk out was on the 5th of April 2019 in my google news feed yet today it s announced that it happened today on the 4th ~ sabotage) I will instead share a story called ""Failure is not an option"" from the Star. A quote from that story ""Whatever happened to being allowed to fail?"" asks Durham Region music teacher Jeff Pighin, who says he is one of a vanishing breed of teachers who fails several students each year in his Grade 9 music course and hands out exactly the marks he believes students deserve."" So basically children can graduate high school with a grade 2 equivalent education and a free pass not to fail pretty much no matter what ...and liberals call such a success based upon so called graduation rates... Basically if a potato had arms and legs it could graduate high school. An insult to our children's education system and I can see how kids could also be fooled into thinking that a free pass is preferred to an actual education. Because primarily leftists and globalists are not able to contest with even so much as a shred of validity what the facts I share prove on the foundations of primary issues I address which reveal lies and deceptions being forced on the public for years now, they resort to tampering with my feeds on stories many are aware will attract my interest to try and claim I share false information (when look who went as far out of their way to cast falsified information I researched and found) because they are that mentally redundant sick and pathetic but mostly to try and hide that they have not even so much as a shred of validity when it comes to the foundations of many primary issues I address. A couple of weeks ago I found some information on google search. I copied two paragraphs, completely removed one paragraph because it was irrelevant (I initially copied the wrong one and still can't figure out how that happened), but replaced with the one I intended to copy), cut out the explanatory bs in between (It had descriptive I didn't need) and shared it within my response and floored who I was responding too with it. I came back to find that person lying claiming I just reworded the first paragraph I did include but removed because it was irrelevant, and when I went to go and find what I copied and pasted it was removed from google search just like that. I blew them away with my response in lieu of such with the greatest of ease anyway. This is what they are pulling to try and drag me down to their sick and pathetic level with their sick and pathetic lies and deceptions. I started to notice information begin to be removed around 2012 and alerted the officials of Canada right away. All these years later, this is how intellectual cowards who have no validity roll.

House sues to stop border wall,americaswatchtower.com,Steve Dennis,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://americaswatchtower.com/2019/04/06/house-sues-to-stop-border-wall/,"House sues to stop border wall April 6, 2019 Once the Congress failed to stop Donald Trump’s emergency declaration we knew it was only a matter of time before they took the President to court and on Thursday they voted to do just that. Here is more: Top Democrats voted to authorize a lawsuit against President Trump emergency declaration on Thursday. Pelosi announced that the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group, which is comprised of five people, voted 3-2 (on party lines) to authorize a lawsuit challenging the President’s decision to transfer funds from appropriated accounts for his border wall. “The President’s sham emergency declaration and unlawful transfers of funds have undermined our democracy, contravening the vote of the bipartisan Congress, the will of the American people and the letter of the Constitution,” Pelosi said in a statement Thursday. “The House will once again defend our Democracy and our Constitution, this time in the courts,” Pelosi added. “The President’s action clearly violates the Appropriations Clause by stealing from appropriated funds, an action that was not authorized by constitutional or statutory authority.” I still get a kick out of it when I hear Democrats who suddenly claim to care about the Constitution, what they care about is simply making sure they do not lose a grip on pushing their agenda through and Donald Trump is a clear and present danger to that agenda. We know how this is going to end, the Democrats will shop this lawsuit around until they find a sympathetic judge who will rule this national emergency declaration is unconstitutional and order a stay while the lawsuit makes it through the court system. It will eventually make it to the Supreme Court, but the game plan here is not to let it get that far. The Democrats are hoping to stall the wall until Donald Trump is out of office and then it will not matter how the Supreme Court would rule because the construction would be stopped.

After Parkland, Dick’s continued its mini-war with the Second Amendment, refusing to sell long guns to anyone under the age of 21. It’s already law that you need to be 21 to purchase a handgun, but rifles and shotguns are available to purchase for those 18 years of age or older. Some states, like Florida and Vermont, have passed unconstitutional laws increasing the age for all firearms purchases. All this does is deny law-abiding Americans their right to exercise their right to bear arms. What else is new?
Via NPR :
Almost nine months after the Parkland shooting, Ed Stack — the CEO of Dick's Sporting Goods — stood up in the audience of a New York Times conference. He got up to talk about restricting gun sales at his stores. He had done it many times before, but this time, he got personal.
""I'm not embarrassed to say I'm viewed as a relatively tough guy,"" Stack said. ""I wouldn't characterize myself as a crier. And that weekend, I watched those kids, and I watched those parents, and I hadn't cried as much since my mother passed away.""
His highly publicized tougher stance on gun sales and outspoken push for reform turned the now-64-year-old into an unlikely corporate face of gun control. To Wall Street, the company's new gun policy wasn't out of line with its business interests. But to most Americans, this was a staid, dependable athletics store suddenly plunging into activism.
One year after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, Stack's early lobbying efforts have proved difficult. But on a corporate level, the company remains steadfast in its new gun sales policy. Dick's no longer sells the type of semiautomatic rifle used in the shooting, which is sometimes called assault-style or military-style. Dick's also no longer sells any firearms to people under 21.
Springfield ended its business partnership with Dick’s and for good reason: by 2018, the chain was now a full-blown advocate for gun control . Well, here’s the butcher’s bill for all of that (via Bloomberg ):
Last February, when Dick’s Sporting Goods boss Ed Stack announced he was restricting gun sales at the country’s largest sports retailer, he knew it’d be costly.
At the time, Dick’s was a major seller of firearms. Guns also drove the sale of soft goods—boots, hats, jackets. What’s more, Stack, the retailer's chief executive officer, suspected the position could drive off some of his customers on political principle.
He was right. Dick’s estimates the policy change cost the company about $150 million in lost sales, an amount equivalent to 1.7 percent of annual revenue. Stack says it was worth it.
“The system does not work,” Stack said. “It’s important that when you know there’s something that’s not working, and it’s to the detriment of the public, you have to stand up.”
[…]
The 64-year-old Stack is an unlikely champion of gun reform. Earlier this decade, he helped Dick’s double-down on its outdoor roots, buying licensing rights to “Field & Stream” and launching both a private brand and a new series of stores dedicated partially to hunting. He’s a gun owner himself and insists he’s not anti-firearm, just in favor of what he likes to call “common-sense gun reform.”
No longer a go-to store for many gun-owners and hunters, Dick’s is now navigating its new reality. In August, the company announced it would remove hunting supplies and equipment entirely from 10 stores and use the space for team sports like baseball. Sales jumped in the test stores, and the company will implement the change in 125 additional stores, about 17 percent of the total fleet. After a dip in the last 12 months, the company expects same-store sales to be flat or rise a little.
Dick’s Sporting Goods stock position hasn’t changed. The company will continue, even thrive as it transitions away from firearm sales. Boycotts are unproductive. Yes, they trashed a consumer base they have catered to for years, but you can buy similar products Dick’s sells elsewhere. Dick’s Sporting Goods’ decision is part of the war against gun rights in America, but the chain is a third-tier opponent. The Democratic Party and their allies in the media remain the Second Amendment’s biggest public enemies."

What Is Behind the Opposition to Peace with Israel?,www.gatestoneinstitute.org,Bassam Tawil,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/14020/opposition-peace-israel,"https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/14020/opposition-peace-israel
The anti-Israel campaign in the Arab and Islamic world sees peace with Israel -- and not failed leadership, bad economic policies and corruption -- as the biggest threat to Arabs and Muslims. Recognizing Israel's right to exist is also seen by many Arabs and Muslims as a humiliation to their values, their culture, their political power and their economic traditions. They seem concerned that Arabs and Muslims might wake up one morning and start demanding freedom of expression and free and democratic elections like the ones held every few years in Israel.
The anti-peace camp seems to want its people to continue living in misery and under dictatorships, so that it is easier to recruit people to jihad against Israel and the West. Also, if people are lifted from poverty and misery and begin to enjoy the fruits of modern civilization, there is a chance that Arabs and Muslims will move away from Islam and even start endorsing the inadmissible values of the West.
The Trump administration will soon discover what every child in the Arab and Islamic world already knows: that the Israeli-Arab conflict is not about a settlement or a checkpoint or a security fence, but about Israel's very right to exist in the Middle East. The Trump administration will also learn that peace with Israel is seen by many Arabs and Muslims as nothing but an unacceptable threat that must at all costs be stopped.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who is often described by Western media and officials as ""moderate"" and ""pragmatic,"" last year quoted Egyptian intellectual Abdel-Wahab El-Messiri, saying Israel ""constitutes a colonialist enterprise that has nothing to do with Judaism,"" and adding that Europeans wanted ""to transfer the Jews"" to the Middle East because ""they wanted this region to become an advanced post to protect the interests and the convoys coming from Europe to the East."" (Image source: MEMRI video screenshot)
Peace with Israel is purportedly a form of surrender and submission that will harm the dignity of Arabs and Muslims.
This is the theme of a massive campaign being waged by Palestinians and other Arabs in preparation for the announcement of the US administration's plan for peace in the Middle East, also known as the ""deal of the century."" The plan, according to US officials, is expected to be announced sometime after the general elections in Israel, slated for April 9.
The latest campaign is designed to thwart the ""deal of the century"" and terrorize Arabs and Muslims who may wish to accept the US administration's peace plan.
As part of an effort to raise awareness to the dangers of the ""deal of the century,"" an increasing number of Palestinians and Arabs are now trying to explain to their people why peace and normalization of ties with Israel is totally unacceptable.
The latest effort came in the form of an online campaign called ""The International Anti-Normalization Campaign.""
The organizers of the campaign say they are worried that some Arab states and leaders may cooperate with the ""deal of the century."" They are concerned because they see that some Arab states and leaders are already engaged in various forms of normalization with Israel.
The campaign clearly aims to send a warning not only to ordinary Arabs and Muslims, but also to their leaders, about the ""dangerous repercussions"" of making peace with Israel.
According to the organizers of the anti-peace campaign, ""normalization [with Israel] is the miserable outcome of a culture of surrender and submission"" -- and concessions and peace are only shameful and degrading.
For them, the words peace and compromise (with Israel) seem associated with extremely negative connotations such as retreat, defeat and surrender.
Recognizing Israel's right to exist is also seen by many Arabs and Muslims as a humiliation to their values, their culture, their political power and their economic traditions. They have been educated to see Israel as an alien body and a ""colonial project"" planted in the Middle East by Western powers. They therefore cannot accept the presence of Jews -- in what they regard as their own sovereign state -- on lands they believe belong solely to Muslims .
Even Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who is often described by Western media outlets and officials as a ""moderate"" and ""pragmatic"" Arab leader, shares the view that Israel is nothing but a ""colonial project."" In a speech before PLO delegates in Ramallah last year, Abbas quoted Egyptian intellectual Abdel-Wahab El-Messiri, saying:
""The functional nature of Israel means that it was evoked by colonialism in order to fulfill a specific function, and thus it constitutes a colonialist enterprise that has nothing to do with Judaism.""
Abbas added :
""[Oliver Cromwell] came up with the idea of transferring the Jews from Europe to the Middle East... because they wanted this region to become an advanced post to protect the interests and the convoys coming from Europe to the East... He asked Holland, which owned the largest fleet in the world, to transfer the Jews, but the project was unsuccessful. This was in 1653.""
In the past year, Abbas has also repeatedly announced his rejection of the unseen ""deal of the century."" He has referred to the plan as a ""conspiracy"" and the ""slap of the century."" How then can he turn to his people and suddenly accept it -- or any deal that might recognize Israel's right to exist?
""Normalization [with Israel] is tantamount to defeat,"" explained Mohammed al-Adloni, secretary-general of an anti-Israel group, ""The International Coalition for Supporting Jerusalem and Palestine.""
He went on to warn that making peace or normalizing ties with Israel would constitute a threat to the ""consciousness"" of Arabs and Muslims. Making peace with Israel, al-Adloni said , would be like ""a complete occupation of the consciousness [of Arabs and Muslims].""
Al-Adloni and other anti-Israel activists in the Arab and Islamic countries appear worried that, should they make peace with the ""Zionist entity,"" their people might be exposed to democratic values and freedom of expression. They seem concerned that Arabs and Muslims wake up one morning and start demanding free and democratic elections like the ones held every few years in Israel.
The anti-peace camp in the Arab and Islamic world appears not to want its people exposed to advanced Israeli technology, including medical care. This camp seems to want its people to continue living in misery and under dictatorships, so that it is easier to recruit people to jihad against Israel and the West. Also, if people are lifted from poverty and misery, and their living conditions are improved so they begin to enjoy the fruits of modern civilization, there is a chance that Arabs and Muslims will move away from Islam and even start endorsing the inadmissible values of the West.
This camp, extremists, seem not to care about lowering the high rate of unemployment among Arabs and Muslims, improving the living conditions of its people or offering young Arabs and Muslims hope for a better future. They seem instead to want their people to continue living in misery so that their anger, again, can be directed more easily towards Israel and the West.
The anti-Israel campaign in the Arab and Islamic world sees peace with Israel -- and not failed leadership, bad economic policies and corruption -- as the biggest threat to Arabs and Muslims. The message that the anti-peace activists are sending to their people says: ""Peace with Israel is the worst thing that could happen to us Arabs and Muslims because these Jews will invade our minds and our culture.""
Yasser Qadoura, who represents a Lebanon-based group called ""The Popular Committee for Palestinians in the Diaspora,"" says that his organization is now making a big effort to educate Arabs and Muslims about the ""dangers"" of peace and normalization with Israel. He said that his followers and he are planning to publish a ""list of shame"" containing the names of Arabs and Muslims who are caught promoting peace and normalization or trying to make peace with Israel.
Anyone whose name appears on the list will immediately be denounced by Arabs and Muslims as a ""traitor."" Treason, in many of the Arab and Islamic countries, is a charge punishable by death. The ""list of shame"" would therefore be seen by Arabs and Muslims as a license to kill anyone who dared even to talk about peace with Israel.
Last month, a large group of Arab and Islamic activists who met in the Lebanese capital of Beirut ruled that ""all forms of normalization with the Zionist entity are an act of treachery."" According to the group, an Arab or Muslim who even engages in sports, cultural and artistic activities with the ""Zionist entity"" would be considered a ""traitor."" In the eyes of the Arab and Islamic activists, including Islamic religious leaders, anyone who plays soccer or attends a cultural event with a Jew would be condemned as a ""traitor.""
If and when US President Donald J. Trump's administration finally publishes its plan, it will discover that many Arabs and Muslims have already launched a campaign of intimidation to stop their leaders from making peace with Israel. If an Arab or Muslim child is prohibited from playing soccer with a Jew, how can the Trump administration expect the Arabs and Muslims to recognize Israel's right to exist?
The Trump administration will soon discover what every child in the Arab and Islamic world already knows: that the Israeli-Arab conflict is not about a settlement or a checkpoint or a security fence, but about Israel's very right to exist in the Middle East. The Trump administration will also learn that peace with Israel is seen by many Arabs and Muslims as nothing but an unacceptable threat that must at all costs be stopped.

Judge Orders Elon Musk Into A Room While Regulators Berate Him About His Tweets,thelibertarianrepublic.com,Guest Post,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/judge-orders-elon-musk-into-a-room-while-regulators-berate-him-about-his-tweets/,"0 comments

A federal judged decided Friday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk must meet with federal regulators for about an hour so they can resolve their problems, chief among them the mercurial billionaire’s twitter behavior.
Judge Alison Nathan’s decision comes after a hearing Thursday when Musk’s lawyers and SEC prosecutors got into verbal spats over what constitutes a material disclosure on Twitter. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked a judge in February to hold Musk in contempt for violating the terms of an agreement requiring Tesla to pre-approve his tweets.
Musk agreed to resolve an SEC probe in October 2018 without admitting or denying wrongdoing. The plan called for their combined $40 million in penalties to be distributed to affected shareholders. He told his Twitter followers in August of that year he secured “funding” to take the company private at $420 per share, far more than the company was worth at the time of the tweet.
SEC regulators said he violated the agreement when he tweeted that Tesla would make around 500,000 cars in 2019. Musk later corrected the tweet, saying he “meant to say” weekly production would be equal to half-a-million cars.
“For the reasons stated on the record at oral argument yesterday, the parties are required to meet and confer for at least one hour in an effort to resolve the pending motion to hold Mr. Musk in contempt,” her order noted. Musk, who owns more than 20 percent of the company, reacted favorably to the judge’s decision.
“I have great respect for Judge Nathan, and I’m pleased with her decision today,” he said in a statement distributed by Tesla. “The tweet in question was true, immaterial to shareholders, and in no way a violation of my agreement with the SEC. We have always felt that we should be able to work through any disagreements directly with the SEC, rather than prematurely rushing to court.”
Musk and the SEC have had an acrimonious relationship. “Just want to [sic] that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!” Musk wrote in a tweet in 2018 less than a week after agreeing to pay a fine connected to a tweet he wrote in August.
The Tesla CEO was referring to his long-time battle against so-called short-sellers who make bets that a stock will plummet in the future."

Romney Says Trump’s Fed Pick Of Herman Cain Is Too Partisan,thelibertarianrepublic.com,Guest Post,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/romney-says-trumps-fed-pick-of-herman-cain-is-too-partisan/,"0 comments
Whitney Tipton
Sen. Mitt Romney voiced his concerns after President Donald Trump announced plans Thursday to recommend Herman Cain for a vacancy on the Federal Reserve Board.
Romney dismissed, in an interview with Politico, the possibility that Trump will actually nominate Cain , a former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza for 10 years who also previously served as chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City from 1995-1996. Cain ran for the Republican nomination in the 2012 presidential elections.
“I doubt that will be a nomination. But if it were a nomination, you can bet [what] the interest rates he would be pushing for,” Romney said Thursday.
Mocking Cain’s 2012 presidential platform position on tax rates, the Utah Republican continued: “If Herman Cain were on the Fed, you’d know the interest rate would soon be 9-9-9.”
“9-9-9” is in reference to Cain’s proposal to erase all existing taxes and implement a 9 percent personal income tax, a 9 percent federal sales tax and a 9 percent corporate tax.
“I would like to see nominees that are economists first and not partisans. I think it’s important that the Fed be a nonpartisan entity,” Romney continued in his interview with Politico. “The key is that someone is outside of the political world and is an economic leader not a partisan leader.”
Trump has also nominated Stephen Moore for the other open seat on the Federal Reserve Board. Romney told Politico he was still considering Moore’s likely nomination. Trump has previously attacked Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for raising interest rates, threatening to fire him.
“I find Herman to be an outstanding person, a truly outstanding individual,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office. “I would think he would do very well there.”
Any nominations for the Fed must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate."

4 Basic Principles of Libertarians,thelibertarianrepublic.com,Maggie Novak,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thelibertarianrepublic.com/4-basic-principles-of-libertarians/,"0 comments
Libertarianism is not just a political theory, but it is also a philosophy for understanding certain aspects of human relationship, judging and explaining the path of human evolution and an attitude towards life. Many people claim to know nothing about libertarianism, but when they were told about it, they realised they were always been a libertarian. For those who are still confused about what they know has really something to do with libertarianism, then here are a few basic libertarian principles that will help you recognise who you are.
#1 Stand by their words and actions
Libertarians firmly believe that the individuals are the only responsible for the situation they find themselves in and the choices they make. Good or bad, they must face the consequences and avoid putting the blame on others if they don’t get the desired outcome of their actions. However, whether they succeed or not in their endeavours, their efforts, planning and foresight are the first thing that defines the result. They shouldn’t be afraid of the shame that their actions would bring, and courageously face even the worst of situations.
#2 Understand and support other’s beliefs
As libertarian’s basic fundamental value is maximum freedom, they also teach and promote other moral and religious principles despite their own religious beliefs. They believe that there should be complete acceptance of the beliefs and opinions of other individuals, rather than imposing their own theories on others. Every individual’s behaviour or belief is permitted as long as it doesn’t conflict with others’ freedom and life. An individual is allowed to live his life the way he wants if he doesn’t harm any other individual, even though the majority of the population disapproves his acts.
#3 Focus to improve rather than achieving perfection
Libertarian believes that life is a constantly changing process that would persistently bring new adaptation and challenges. According to them, it is impossible to achieve that perfect life or to create a perfect world where everybody is equal and all of our needs and wishes are fulfilled without a struggle. Libertarians are generally described as pragmatic and realistic in their beliefs and life’s challenges, and although they are settled with the world as it is, they wish to see the world change for the better. They believe only the individual’s efforts, knowledge and contentment will enable them to live a peaceful life.
#4 Encourage free market system
Libertarians believe in the free market system, which means there should be unrestricted competition between businesses with no or little control of the government. They believe that there should be elimination of income taxes, social security and internal revenue service, so that the businesses and individuals can donate to help people who are less fortunate. Even Bydiscountcodes.co.uk can help you save tons of money and donate to charity. The concept of free market allows companies and individuals live without the help of government.
Thus, these are just a few things that could help determine libertarianism for individuals who wish to live on this ideology. Though, there are certain complex political and economic arguments, but they will barely have such impact on people who are not bothered about these debates and follow libertarian principles. 2"

Rachel Dolezal) avoids jail time Jazz Shaw Posted at 10:01 am on April 6, 2019 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Nkechi Diallo, who until a couple of years ago was known as the “transracial” NAACP executive Rachel Dolezal, is back in the news. And once again, it’s not for anything good. Diallo got herself into a spot of trouble with the law when she failed to disclose income from her book, In Full Color while collecting public food and child care assistance. This type of welfare fraud can result in time behind bars, but Diallo and her attorneys apparently struck a deal that will keep her out of the crowbar hotel. (KATU News)
A former NAACP leader in Washington state who was exposed in 2015 as a white woman pretending to be black has reached an agreement to avoid trial on charges of welfare fraud.
Rachel Dolezal, who changed her name to Nkechi Diallo two years ago, was charged with two felonies last May.
Investigators alleged she failed to report tens of thousands of dollars in income from her memoir, “In Full Color: Finding My Place in a Black and White World,” and other sources, so she could collect $8,847 in food and child care assistance from the state.
I’m assuming that the “tens of thousands” of dollars Diallo received for the book represented her advance from the publisher since I never heard anything about the book hitting the best sellers lists. After that, her opportunities for income were extremely limited, at least according to her. She claims to have landed a few jobs under her new name, but employers kept figuring out who she actually was and terminating her employment.
There was a time when I thought that the entire Dolezal debacle might have served some larger public purpose. After all, if people who are born with all the obvious, normal biological markers of males or females can claim that they are the opposite gender just because they feel that way , why couldn’t they say the same thing about race? But if Diallo, whose childhood pictures show her as coming from one of the whitest, most Scandinavian looking families imaginable, can’t be accepted as a member of the black community, why are exceptions being made for transgender individuals?
I never heard or read a suitable answer to that question, but the matter seems to have been largely dropped in social media debates. And left in the wreckage of that fight we have Ms. Diallo, who once had a promising career in community organizer circles, but is now struggling to keep a roof over her head and stay out of jail. It’s really kind of a sad story when you stop to think about it. "

A- A A+
Moldova’s President Igor Dodon has pointed to the importance of strategic partnership with Russia in the country’s foreign policy.
""Today, Moldova seeks to restore strategic partnership with the Russian Federation. I am certain that our bilateral relations have good prospects for expanding and deepening,"" the president wrote on Facebook on Saturday on the occasion of the 27th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Moldova and Russia.
""Moldova is determined to pursue a balanced foreign policy based on national interests. However, strategic partnership with Russia will always be a particularly important part of our country’s foreign policy concept. Our fraternal peoples have gone through a lot: there was our common history, common problems and common victories too,"" Dodon added. He noted that next year Moldova, Russia and other former Soviet republics would jointly celebrate the 75th anniversary ""of our common Victory in the Great Patriotic War."" The country is also going to celebrate the anniversary of the republic’s liberation this coming August.
Relations between Chisinau and Moscow deteriorated after the coalition of pro-European parties came to power in Moldova in 2009. In 2016, former leader of Moldova’s Party of Socialists Igor Dodon won the presidential election in the country. His main slogans were strengthening nationhood, observing neutrality and restoring strategic partnership with Russia.

Former South Carolina Sen. Ernest F. “Fritz” Hollings, who is credited with leading the state through desegregation as governor, died early Saturday morning at 97 years old, the Associated Press reports. A family spokesman confirmed Hollings death. A stalwart among southern Democrats, Hollings went on serve six terms in the senate before retiring in 2005, and remains one of the longest serving senators in U.S. history. He briefly made a run for Democratic nomination for president in 1984. Hollings originally campaigned against desegregation in his first bid for governor in 1958, but would later ask the state legislature to embrace integrating public schools and admitting the first black student to Clemson University.

In the wake of criticism over the U.S. Department of Education’s (DOE) proposed funding cuts to the Special Olympics, OpenTheBooks.com published a report of all the ways it says the agency is wasting taxpayer money, including the DOE overpaying $11 billion in Pell grants and student loans over the past two fiscal years alone.
OpenTheBooks.com ’s new oversight report “reveals outdated policies, misaligned priorities, and weak accounting controls at the department. Resources are being squandered,” the organization’s CEO and founder, Adam Andrzejewski, says.
“Federal funding is being poured into the nation's richest colleges, the worst performing junior colleges, nontraditional colleges you didn't know existed, for-profit schools, and more,” he adds.
The 50 lowest performing junior and community colleges in the nation received $923.5 million in DOE student loans and grants, the report found. Of them, the 10 that received the most federal funding had a 12 percent graduation rate, on average.
The report highlights how federal money was spent on “higher education” programs, including $51.4 million of taxpayer money for a video game college at DigiPen Institute of Technology and $9.5 million to the Crescent City School of Gaming and Bartending.
The Professional Golfers Career College received $4.5 million in federal funds, and Northwest School of Wooden Boat Building received $781,330.
The agency also spent billions of dollars on staffing. It spent $1.6 billion to hire companies to collect and disperse federal student loans, according to the audit.
In fiscal year 2017, the DOE employed 3,818 staffers; 2,600 earned more than $100,000. On average, including benefits, each employee costs taxpayers $143,992, the report states.
The agency’s employees spent 6,522 working hours in Fiscal Year 2016 on union activities instead of on their department jobs despite being paid by taxpayers, the report notes. In March 2018, the DOE eliminated this policy, called “official time,” saving taxpayers about $500,000 annually.
“Employee unions are private organizations, not public entities,” OpenTheBooks.com notes.
The top five states who receive the most federal money – 36 percent of all DOE funding – are California ($18.6 billion), Texas ($12.6 billion), New York ($11.9 billion), Florida ($9.5 billion), and Illinois ($7.2 billion). Federal funding included grants, contracts, direct payments and student loans.
High tuition costs could easily be dropped in light of the federal funding pouring into higher education institutions, Stephen Moore, an economic consultant with FreedomWorks, says.
The DOE gave $6.9 billion to 25 colleges and universities that have the largest endowments in the country. Collectively, they hold one quarter-trillion dollars in existing assets. They received federal money in the form of grants, contracts, and direct payments, and student loans.
“If universities are going to rely on taxpayers to subsidize their exorbitant costs, it makes sense for the public to hold these schools to the high standards they say they hold their students to,” Moore argues. “Notre Dame, Princeton, Yale, Harvard and other elite schools like Duke and USC can’t make a plausible case for the need for billions of dollars annually in federal subsidies when these schools’ bank accounts hold hundreds of millions and in many cases billions of dollars of funds.”
Moore points out that even without any new gifts, “most if not all Ivy League endowment could fund full-ride scholarships for all financially needy undergraduate students for the next half-century. With continued gifts to universities, tuition could practically be free to students forever without the endowments running dry.”
The most expensive colleges should be required to lower their tuitions costs every year by 5 to 10 percent, Moore said. The institutions can cut costs or use their endowments to subsidize the out-of-pocket costs paid by students and/or taxpayers. This article originally ran on watchdog.org ."

Will Too Many Candidates Spoil the Democrats’ Chances in 2020?,www.politicususa.com,Leo Vidal,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/06/will-too-many-candidates-spoil-the-democrats-chances-in-2020.html,"Will Too Many Candidates Spoil the Democrats’ Chances in 2020? 491 Subscribe Print Flipboard
It seems like every Democrat in the country is running for president in 2020. There could be as many as 20 candidates who lose the nomination next year. But who will win?
With so many candidates running, how worried should Democrats be about a fiasco like a deadlocked nomination battle leading to a loss in November?
Nate Silver argues that a very large candidate field is dangerous for the party.
He wrote:
“ The crowded field developing for 2020 doesn’t necessarily imply that an anti-establishment candidate will prevail. Even when party elites don’t get their first choice, they usually get someone they can live with. But the high number of candidates does imply a higher-than-usual risk of chaos.”
But Democrats may not need to worry, according to Elaine Kamarck from the Brookings Institute:
“The complex rules for awarding delegates to presidential candidates have not changed in many years and will remain the same in 2020. First, there is a threshold of 15 percent of the primary vote for winning a delegate. In a twenty-person field, many candidates won’t win a single delegate. Second, while delegates are awarded proportionally … By the time Super Tuesday is over, candidates without delegates are likely to be walking ghosts.”
Still, Democrats are on pace to have the largest presidential primary field in campaign history and its growth shows no sign of slowing.
As of Friday, there are at least 14 major candidates in the race and another half dozen who are expected to announce soon.
This means that the 2020 crowd is likely to become the biggest presidential field of all time , including the 2016 Republicans, which had at least 17 candidates, and the 1976 Democratic field, which had 16.
So what are Democrats to do with so many choices?
Grant Woodard, a Des Moines, Iowa, trial lawyer and former Democratic operative is not impressed with what he’s seen, saying:
“This reminds me of the menu at a Cheesecake Factory: utterly overwhelming and nothing particularly stands out.”
At the very least it shows that there is confidence in the party that a Democrat will win in 2020 . It also shows that there is a “ deep bench ” of younger, not well known candidates who are anxious to create a national profile.
Recently the Democratic National Committee expanded its first debate to make it over two nights to accommodate up to 20 candidates (10 each night). It also has a contingency plan in place should there be more than 20 bona fide candidates and it needs to winnow that field to keep the debate number at 20.
The first debate is set for June 26-27, 2020 in Miami, Florida.
Some Democrats are worried that so many choices will cause “overload” among primary voters, leading to “decision fatigue” and ‘anticipated regret.” (This is like having buyers’ remorse before you even buy something, because you worry you’ll make the wrong decision.)
“We all want candidates to choose from, but we don’t want to work that hard on it, particularly for people like me who are not political experts,” said Lilly Kofler, the U.S. director of behavioral Science at Hill+Knowlton Strategies. “It’s the paradox of choice.”
Kofler, who recently wrote an essay for Politico magazine titled, “Too Many Democrats Are Running in 2020, According to Science,” said that when people are overwhelmed by choices, they default to what she calls “a known option.”
The problem with the “known option” is that it’s not necessarily the favorite option. Kofler has maintained that Donald Trump benefited from this effect in the crowded 2016 GOP field, since he was more famous than any of his competitors.
Overconfident Republicans are rubbing their hands with glee, thinking they can pit Democratic candidates against each other and help create party disunity.
“It gives us the opportunity to create chaos every single day,” said Sarah Dolan, the executive director of the GOP research group America Rising. “They’re making our jobs easy.”
But Charlie Cook, a longtime political analyst and founder of the Cook Report, doubts that a long, crowded primary season necessarily spells trouble for the Democrats, noting Trump won in 2016 and so did Barack Obama in 2008.
What Dolan’s analysis doesn’t take into account is that not only is Donald Trump historically unpopular, but he has also unified Democrats. It is almost certain that the various factions within the Democratic Party will unite for the common purpose of defeating Donald Trump in 2020."
