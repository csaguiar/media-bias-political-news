"Iran media: Police helicopter crashes near border, killing 1",www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iran-media-police-helicopter-crashes-near-border-killing-1,"Email TEHRAN, Iran – Iran's semi-official ISNA news agency says a police helicopter carrying border guards to their post in the country's northwest has crashed, killing one. The report says the crash took place around noon on Wednesday in West Azerbaijan province, in the mountainous area of Dalamper, near the city of Urmia which is close to the border with Turkey.
It quotes the province's deputy governor, Ali Mostafavi, as saying that along with one killed, eight people were injured in the crash.
The chief of the Iranian police helicopter division, Gen. Hesseinali Mostajeran, said the crash was due to a technical glitch.
Aircraft crashes are frequently blamed on Iran's aging fleet that was long under international sanctions over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Trending in World"
Biker beats 'The Wire' star Idris Elba's 'flying mile' speed record with 182.4 mph run,www.foxnews.com,Tom Bevan,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/auto/biker-idris-elba-motorcycle-land-speed-record,"Speed racer Zef Eisenberg maintained an average speed of 182.4 mph to set a new benchmark for the &apos;flying mile&apos; record . A flying mile takes the average speed over two mile-long runs, with a mile build up.
The record was first set on Pendine Sands in 1927 when Sir Malcolm Campbell reached 174.8mph in his iconic Blue Bird - a marker that stood for nearly 90 years.
Eisenberg set the British Flying Mile record for wheel-driven vehicles at Pendine Sands.
But Zef has now taken the record from the Luther star who achieved 180.361 mph in a 650 hp Bentley Continental Super Sport twin-turbo W12 - also on Pendine Sands - in 2015.
Zef used the same stretch of beach in Wales on board his specially-made 400 hp supercharged Suzuki Hayabusa, built by the Madmax Race Team, and needed only a single run in both directions.
(SWNS)
This was despite a rear tire that was found to be falling apart after the first run and he even survived a scare at 195 mph when his helmet was sprayed with black engine oil.
He said: ""The bike had been spinning the rear wheel for two miles at 240 mph.
""We were using a GP racing tire, too – the best you can get, but I assume it’s not used to that much power or wheel spin.
(SWNS)
""That’s why these records are so hard to achieve. You’re pushing human and engineering boundaries.""
The MADMAX team fitted a new tire during the permitted one-hour turn-around time, enabling Eisenberg to complete his return run and establish the new record.
For the third run, a harder compound of tire was used, but the extreme demands of running at maximum rpm for nearly three miles – and constant wheelspin at such high revs – took its toll on the motorcycle’s highly stressed engine.
Zef, a businessman based in Jersey, added: ""I was doing 195 mph approaching the end of the mile and my helmet visor and leathers were sprayed with black engine oil, obscuring my vision.
""I lost sight of the finish flags, but I couldn’t just slam on the brakes due to the sand. Fortunately, I managed to keep it straight and bring it to a stop.
“Then I noticed engine oil spraying onto the hot exhaust, but unless I jumped off and dropped the bike, I couldn’t get off because I couldn’t put the kick-stand down on the sand. Luckily, the oil never caught fire on the hot exhaust, as the bike would have burst into flames.”
With critical engine damage, he was not able to continue racing and attempt to increase his speeds as he had been hoping to reach a speed of 200 mph over the weekend.
Mr. Eisenberg still holds the fastest wheel-powered vehicle (bike or car) at Pendine, at 201.5 mph, which is also the fastest motorbike on sand world record.
Speaking ahead of the attempt he said he was inspired by someone asking what was next after his successful motorbike attempt last year.
He added: ""That&apos;s not good to say to someone like me and I thought let&apos;s get the outright sand record for a car and a bike.
""When you try something that no-one has done before, there is some trepidation and fear.
""The car has a roll cage and I wear all the protection you can buy, but if the wheel sticks in the sand and the car flips 360 degrees, it could be game over.""
As time ran out on Saturday, The Madmax 1200 hp Porsche Sand Racer will come back to Pendine on Speed Week 18 and 19 May for an attempt on the all-out flying mile record and speed.

Laura Ingraham: Voters must choose between Trump's mindful persistence and Dems' mindless resistance,www.foxnews.com,Laura Ingraham,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/laura-ingraham-voters-must-choose-between-trumps-mindful-persistence-and-dems-mindless-resistance,"Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey of New York badgered Barr on his synopsis on the Mueller report. She said the following: ""Your conclusion is something we&apos;ve seen before. In June 2018, you wrote a memo as a private citizen and a former attorney general to the Department of Justice, laying out the president&apos;s case against obstruction of justice. Your audition clearly went well."" ""Your audition clearly went well."" Wouldn&apos;t you just love to read Barr&apos;s subliminal thoughts about this entire charade scrolling at the bottom of the screen? I&apos;d pay big money for that.
. The attorney general didn&apos;t need this. He already was attorney general almost 30 years ago when he was a lot younger and probably had a lot more patience.
But, like so many others in this administration -- I&apos;m thinking Bob Lighthizer at USTR, Wilbur Ross at Commerce, Alex Azar at HHS, Steve Mnuchin at Treasury, Betsy DeVos at Education -- they all left their very comfortable lives and moved to Washington to help solve problems and make a difference That&apos;s what civil service is supposed to be all about, isn&apos;t it?
But, instead they deal with nasty exchanges with lawmakers who have the power to fix things, like the immigration system - and yet they fail to do so.
Congress has the power to fix the immigration laws, don&apos;t they? And if child detention or separations are so offensive, hey, why don&apos;t you change the laws? Better yet, seal up the border and the endless travesty altogether.
Now, of course, Congress does have legitimate important constitutional obligations to do proper oversight of the executive branch. I&apos;m all for it. But, what the Democrats have been doing since Trump took the oath of office isn&apos;t oversight. It&apos;s character assassination, either of the president himself -- that he was secretly working with the Russians -- or of anyone who works for him.
The truth is Nancy Pelosi wants to throw sand in Trump's gears every chance she gets. If Obama had negotiated the same [NAFTA] deal, she'd have been all for it. But she'd rather deny Trump a victory than do the right thing by the American people.
Look at what the jackals did at Secretary Mnuchin&apos;s hearing on Tuesday . We have a crisis on our southern border and all ""Impeach 45"" Mad Maxine Waters cares about is Trump&apos;s old tax returns -- and of course, Russia and whether Trump or anyone associated with his campaign met with Russian oligarchs.
Maxine Waters is just a complete and utter embarrassment, along with Pelosi, the co-ruling queen of the Resistance. How is any of this helping their constituents? The answer is, it&apos;s not.
Now, the Republicans, remember they&apos;re also called the GOP, as in the Grand Old Party. I&apos;m thinking Democrats should be called just ""UP,"" as in the Unserious Party. Why Because for more than a year, the Trump team undertook the painstaking process of doing things like renegotiating NAFTA, the trade deal that had given an unfair advantage to companies that move their plants to Mexico.
Canada and Mexico both signed off on it. So, why has Nancy Pelosi called it up for a vote? Because she&apos;s unserious. She&apos;s parroting bogus concerns of her buddies over there at the AFL-CIO about labor laws in Mexico.
Video I haven&apos;t heard Nancy demand the same from China lately, have you? They don&apos;t do anything with labor law problems. The truth is Pelosi wants to throw sand in Trump&apos;s gears every chance she gets. If Obama had negotiated the same deal, she&apos;d have been all for it. But she&apos;d rather deny Trump a victory than do the right thing by the American people.
Same scenario, by the way. is at play with the ongoing invasion across our southern border . Congress could fix this in a weekend. Now, estimates are that this month alone, we could see 150,000 migrants overwhelming our border and our Border Patrol. So instead of closing loopholes, ending this crisis, Democrats just use every opportunity to grandstand for the cameras.
We all should be thanking Bill Barr and the entire Trump team. Now, despite a constant stream of defamatory attacks and scurrilous charges from the Democrats, the Trump administration has still managed to accomplish an enormous amount for our country, with the economy, the courts, on trade, et cetera. Mindful persistence versus mindless resistance -- Americans will have a clear choice in 2020.

Janice Dean: Kids with cancer are real-life superheroes,www.foxnews.com,Janice Dean,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/janice-dean-kids-with-cancer-are-real-life-superheroes,"I was a bit surprised about the head shaving, but not about him wanting to help others. I realize I’m biased, but my son Matthew is one of the kindest, most considerate human beings I know. He and his brother have something I believe you can’t learn. They have the gift of empathy. When we watch movies or read books whose main character struggles with something that makes them different from the rest, I can tell Matthew and Theodore take these particular stories to heart. They will ask questions about why people are sometimes treated differently because of the way they look. I tell them you never know what someone might be going through, so it’s just good to be kind to everyone. Sometimes there are kids in real life who have big challenges, and they’re the bravest people you’ll ever meet.
So when I asked Matthew why he wanted to take part in the event, he said it was because he felt so bad for the kids who lost their hair because of the medicine they had to take. It wasn’t their fault they looked different. He told me he learned about the St. Baldrick&apos;s Foundation in class, the group that promotes the event, and he raised his hand right away to take part.
We started reading up on the charity and found out this year marks St. Baldrick’s 20th anniversary. What started out as a challenge between successful businessmen who wanted to give back in 1999 turned into an incredible fundraiser with events all over the world.
Firefighters, police officers and military troops have been a big part of St. Baldrick’s from the very beginning. Thousands have added head-shaving to their public service, with events in police and fire stations across the U.S., and even military bases in Iraq and Germany.
And because of the research supported by St. Baldrick’s, the FDA has approved a new drug that drastically increases the cure rate for high-risk neuroblastoma patients. It’s only the third drug approved in 20 years made specifically for kids with cancer.
These kids are real life superheroes. They deserve prayers, love and our help to find a cure as soon as possible.
Even though there have been big strides and millions of dollars raised, the statistics are still heartbreaking. More children are lost to cancer in the U.S. than any other disease — more than many other childhood diseases combined.
Worldwide, a child is diagnosed with cancer every two minutes. That’s about the time it takes to shave a head, so my boy Matthew will be honoring those who have lost their hair by losing his too, for the team he named ""MattsMajors.""
On Saturday there will be a big parade and celebration before the razors begin buzzing. My younger son Theodore said he wouldn’t do it this time (he’s a little afraid of the electric razors), but if it went OK for Matthew this year, he would join him next year.
If you’d like to learn more about St. Baldrick&apos;s and the amazing work they do for childhood cancer, you can visit their website .
These kids are real-life superheroes. They deserve prayers, love and our help to find a cure as soon as possible.
Oh, and I’ll be the one cheering loudly in the crowd, smiling through the tears when I see my bald boy helping others. I&apos;m the proud mom of a son whose empathy for others makes the world a better place.

MSNBC’s Chris Matthews slams Trump for aiding Israeli PM Netanyahu’s reelection,www.foxnews.com,Fox News,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/msnbcs-chris-matthews-slams-trump-for-aiding-israeli-pm-netanyahus-reelection,"MSNBC host Chris Matthews blasted President Donald Trump for playing the “political sidekick” of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . In recent weeks, the Trump administration has recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights and declared Iran’s Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization . President Trump also welcomed Netanyahu to the White House in late March.
Matthews accused the president of breaking tradition with his predecessors by staying out of Israeli politics, but as Newsbusters pointed out, he overlooked the Obama State Department ’s financial contribution of taxpayer money to OneVoice, an Israeli political group and opponent of Netanyahu.
MSNBC'S CHRIS MATTHEWS LIVID OVER MUELLER REPORT
In this Monday, March 25, 2019 file photo, President Donald Trump welcomes visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House in Washington. In a tight race for re-election, Israel’s prime minister has gotten a welcome lift from his friend in the White House. In the run-up to the April 9 vote, Netanyahu has hosted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, visited Trump in the White House and received American recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war. (AP)
“American presidents from both of our parties have abstained from getting involved in Israeli politics, opting instead of playing two roles; friend of Israel but also a regional honest broker. But not this time,” Matthews told his audience. “President Trump broke with his predecessors, taking a number of steps to help insure that his friend Bibi Netanyahu was victorious today.”

The “Hardball” host continued, ”Always, our president from Eisenhower — from all the way up to W, although some lean towards Israel, some leaned against them a little bit... they’ve always played this other role as honest broker in the region so they can bring peace and play a bigger global role than just being buddies with Israel. This President has ignored his global role, ignored the role — forfeited that of peacemaker or honest broker and just played political sidekick of Bibi.”
Local Israeli reports have suggested that after a very tight race, Netanyahu will hold onto his office and form a fifth government. On Our Radar"

The cause and extent of Wednesday&apos;s fire at Bangkok&apos;s Central World complex, which includes a hotel and an office tower, was not immediately known.
The report of casualties came from the city&apos;s Erawan Emergency Radio network.
Images posted by social media users showed thick black smoke pouring from the complex, with hundreds of evacuated shoppers filling a large open square next to the mall.
The fire broke out during the congested city&apos;s evening rush hour. Sirens from emergency vehicles wailed as they tried to make their way through gridlocked traffic.
Central World sits at a major intersection surrounded by shopping complexes, shrines and high-rise hotels popular with foreign tourists. It is near the main junction for Bangkok&apos;s elevated train lines, as well as the Erawan Shrine, which was the site of a deadly bombing in 2015.
The mall typically would have been busy with shoppers as well as diners headed to the many restaurants inside.
The Central World complex was among several Bangkok buildings set on fire by arsonists during mass anti-government protests in 2010."

The state’s Cobb County Tax Commissioner’s Office, which refrained from issuing a decision during the election due to appeals, confirmed last month that McBath didn’t meet the requirements to call her Cobb County home her primary residence for the three tax years leading up to the election, meaning she was a Tennessee resident when she was elected to Congress.

The congresswoman disputed previous reports that she’s not a resident of Georgia, insisting that she only “briefly” lived in Tennessee or that she “recently” moved to Georgia.
Cobb County permits some residents to decrease their property tax liability through a homestead exemption to residents, an exemption McBath’s husband used since 2000.
Yet according to documents reviewed by AllOnGeorgia.com , her husband has been ordered to pay back taxes for the last three years as the exemption was revoked for having vehicle registrations, voter registrations and driver&apos;s license applications in other states.

Even after Princess Diana’s tragic death, the laws were never changed to protect targets from the lawless paparazzi,” Johansson wrote in a statement to Entertainment Tonight. “Many paparazzi have criminal pasts and will perform criminal acts to get their shot.”
The 34-year-old actress said men in five cars with blacked out windows chased her after she left the “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” studio on Hollywood Boulevard on Monday night. She was at the show promoting her upcoming film, “Avengers: Endgame,” with co-stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Paul Rudd.
""After leaving the ‘Jimmy Kimmel’ Show, I was followed by 5 cars full of men with blacked out windows who were running red lights and putting other drivers and pedestrians at risk so they could follow me to find out where I was staying and subsequently stalk me and my young daughter for the duration of my stay,"" the actress said, referring to her 5-year-old daughter, Rose Dorothy Dauriac.
""The paparazzi put people&apos;s [lives] at risk, so they can wait for days in quiet neighborhoods in blacked out cars, and try to follow me to the playground and photograph my child and other people’s children in a safe place that should be off limits, but isn’t,"" Johansson added. ""All of this is perfectly legal.”
Johansson was taken to the Los Angeles Police Department’s Hollywood station for security reasons Monday night. Police said the actress was “a little spooked” by the incident, but was eventually able to leave the station. No police report was filed, Entertainment Tonight reported.
Johansson said Tuesday that she felt it was her “duty as a concerned citizen” who was being stalked to seek help from local police and urged others who are being “pursued dangerously” to do the same.
""Women across the US are stalked, harassed and frightened and a universal law to address stalking must be at the forefront of law enforcement conversations. Until paparazzi are considered by the law for the criminal stalkers they are, it’s just a waiting game before another person gets seriously injured or killed, like Princess Diana,"" she said.
Video The Princess of Wales, 36, died in August 1997 when the vehicle she was in crashed in a tunnel in Paris while they were being chased by the paparazzi. Diana’s boyfriend Dodi Fayed and their driver, Henri Paul, also died from their injuries.

Mummified mice and falcons on display at the newly discovered burial site, the Tomb of Tutu, at al-Dayabat, Sohag, Egypt April 5, 2019. REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany A recently unearthed tomb from Ancient Egypt contained several mummified animals, including birds, mice and dogs, researchers said. The tomb, built for a man known as Tutu and his wife, Ta-Shirit-Iziz, was recently excavated by archaeologists, according to a statement by the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities.
""The location of this tomb and its entrance was found [in October 2018] during the arrest of a gang while attempting to dig in the area outside the archaeological hill of the Aldi area,"" the ministry said according to a translated version of the post.
60 ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MUMMIES ENTOMBED TOGETHER DIED 'BLOODY, FEARSOME DEATHS'
""Immediately after the ... investigation, the ministry of Antiquities received the site and the archaeological and scientific excavations began through an Egyptian Archaeological Mission headed by Dr. Mostafa Minister of the Secretary-General of the high council of Antiquities. The works of the [group] have found ... human remains and a group of birds and animals.""
The ministry added that the tomb, which contains two rooms, is in ""good condition"" and contains a number of inscriptions and ""bright colors where photos on the side of its entrance are a scene of the god Anubis."" There are also pictures of the god Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife.
In total, there are approximately 50 mummified animals, Live Science reported .
The tomb itself is located near the Nile in Akhmim, Egypt, approximately 280 miles south of Cairo. It dates to the early Ptolemaic period, Reuters reported .
“It shows images of the owner of the burial room, Tutu, giving and receiving gifts before different gods and goddesses,"" Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, said in comments obtained by the news outlet.
In addition to the mummified animals, researchers found two clay jars that contained the remains of a woman between the age of 35 and 50 and a young boy, between the ages of 12 and 14, Reuters added.

Ancient Egypt continues to be a source of fascination for researchers, as more artifacts are uncovered. On Sunday, archaeologists uncovered the 2,500-year-old remains of a powerful ancient Egyptian high priest, broadcast live on the Discovery Channel.
Last month, experts announced the discovery of dozens of mummies in ancient desert burial chambers. Archaeologists also recently explained the strange brown spots on some of the paintings in King Tutankhamun’s tomb.

Salah Khashoggi described King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as ""guardians to all Saudis.""
""Acts of generosity and humanity come from the high moral grounds they possess, not admission of guilt or scandal,"" he said in a statement on Twitter on Wednesday.
On April 1, the Washington Post reported the writer's children were given ""blood money"" in the form of million-dollar homes and monthly payments after Khashoggi's killing by Saudi agents in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year.

Felicity Huffman offered prison advice from Abby Lee Miller amid college admissions scandal guilty plea,www.foxnews.com,Katherine Lam,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/felicity-huffman-prison-advice-abby-lee-miller,"Felicity Huffman pleads guilty in college admissions scam Actress agrees to plead guilty in nationwide college admissions cheating scandal. “Dance Moms” star Abby Lee Miller offered some advice to Felicity Huffman after the “Desperate Housewives” actress pleaded guilty to charges for her involvement in a nationwide college admissions scam . ""My advice would be, take a deep breath and if you need a consultant, I’m your girl,” Miller told “Inside Edition” on Tuesday.
Huffman announced Monday she was pleading guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud for her involvement in the bribery scheme. The actress said she accepts “full responsibility” for her actions.
Huffman now faces four to 10 months in prison, Us Weekly reported.

If she does end up serving prison time, Miller, who finished an eight-month stint in federal prison for bankruptcy fraud in March 2018, told “Inside Edition” that Huffman should “keep a low profile” and be kind to others.
“Be respectful of everyone, keep a low profile, be kind to people. Tell your story, but listen,” Miller advised.

The reality star said Huffman should be worried about how the prison guards may treat her because she is a “big star.”
“She's a big star and I think when she gets there, they're going to be out for her. And I don't necessarily mean the other inmates, I think they will welcome her with open arms,” Miller told ""Inside Edition."" “It was definitely the guards [who messed me up].”

The “Desperate Housewives” star paid $15,000 to have someone secretly alter her daughter’s answers on the SAT, officials said.
""My daughter knew absolutely nothing about my actions, and in my misguided and profoundly wrong way, I have betrayed her.

“I never felt her move during the pregnancy,” she told KSLA. “I never had cravings, I never had morning sickness. Looking back now I did put on a little bit of weight, but it wasn’t noticeable weight, so I didn’t ever think about it. I had my normal cycle some months were a little lighter, but I thought it was the pill that I was on so I never thought anything about it.”

DOJ watchdog reportedly scrutinizing role of FBI informant in Russia probe,www.foxnews.com,Brooke Singman,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-watchdog-fbi-informant-in-russia-probe,"Last Update 7 hours ago Barr testifies 'spying did occur' on Trump campaign, amid reported review of informant's role Attorney General Barr to review FBI conduct during Russia probe Reaction and analysis from 'The Russia Hoax' author Gregg Jarrett and Fox News contributor Sara Carter on 'Hannity.' Attorney General Bill Barr testified Wednesday that he believes ""spying did occur"" on the Trump campaign in 2016, as he vowed to review the conduct of the FBI's original Russia probe -- and the focus of a related internal review shifted to the role of a key FBI informant. ""I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated. … I think it’s my obligation. Congress is usually very concerned with intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies staying in their proper lane,"" he testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, while noting that ""spying on a political campaign is a big deal.""
BARR VOWS MUELLER REPORT RELEASE 'WITHIN A WEEK,' AS DEMS RIP 'UNACCEPTABLE' HANDLING AT HEATED HEARING
The comments follow a new report that the Justice Department’s internal watchdog also is scrutinizing the role of an FBI informant who contacted members of the Trump campaign during the 2016 election, as part of a broader review of the early stages of the Russia investigation. The New York Times reported that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is looking into informant Stefan Halper’s work during the Russia probe, as well as his work with the FBI prior to the start of that probe.
BARR REVEALS HE IS REVIEWING 'CONDUCT' OF FBI'S ORIGINAL RUSSIA PROBE
Halper, an American professor who reportedly is deeply connected with British and American intelligence agencies, has been widely reported as a confidential source for the FBI during the bureau’s original investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. That official counterintelligence operation was opened by then-senior agent Peter Strzok, who has since been fired from the bureau.
During the 2016 campaign, Halper contacted several members of the Trump campaign, including former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and former aide Carter Page. Page also was the subject of several Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants during the campaign -- which is an issue at the heart of the IG's investigation. Republicans, including President Trump, have alleged misconduct in the bureau and Justice Department’s handling of those FISA warrants.
""It was an illegal investigation. ... Everything about it was crooked,"" Trump told reporters on Wednesday, describing it as an attempted ""coup"" and reiterating his interest in digging into the probe's origins. ""There is a hunger for that to happen.""
Professor Stefan Halper (Voice of America, File)
The Times, in its report, noted that Halper also contacted former Trump campaign aide Sam Clovis. It is unclear whether Halper had the FBI’s permission to contact Clovis, according to the report.
Horowitz, more broadly, is probing alleged wrongdoing related to the issuance of FISA warrants to surveil Page during the election. During a prior hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Barr testified that Horowitz’s investigation is expected to be complete by May or June.
While vowing to release Special Counsel Robert Mueller's now-completed Russia report in a matter of days, Barr also announced Tuesday that he was reviewing the origins of the Russia investigation at the FBI and the Justice Department, amid mounting calls for scrutiny of the probe's beginnings from Trump and prominent congressional Republicans.
“More generally, I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all of the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted in the summer of 2016,” Barr told the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday.
BARR ASSEMBLES 'TEAM' TO LOOK INTO COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION ON TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN 2016, OFFICIAL SAYS
Also on Tuesday, Fox News reported that a source said Barr had assembled a “team” to investigate the origins of the bureau’s counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign.
On Wednesday, Barr testified that he hasn't technically ""set up a team"" but has colleagues helping him as he reviews the case.
""This is not launching an investigation of the FBI,"" he stressed. ""Frankly, to the extent there were issues at the FBI, I do not view it as a problem of the FBI. I think it was probably a failure of the group of leaders—the upper echelons of the FBI. I think the FBI is an outstanding organization and I am very pleased Director Chris Wray is there.""
He added, ""If it becomes necessary to look over former officials, I expect to rely on Chris and work with him. I have an obligation to make sure government power is not abused and I think that’s one of the principal roles of the attorney general.""
The FBI’s 2016 counterintelligence investigation, formally opened by Strzok, began with a “paucity” of evidence, according to former FBI counsel Lisa Page, with whom Strzok was romantically involved. During a closed-door congressional interview, Page admitted that the FBI “knew so little” about whether allegations against the Trump campaign were “true or not true” at the time they opened the probe, adding that they had just “a paucity of evidence because we [were] just starting down the path” of vetting allegations. Video
Page also said in her interview that it was “entirely common” that the FBI would begin an investigation with just a “small amount of evidence.”
Barr’s team will also review the FISA warrants issued against Carter Page. The issuance of the FISA warrants relied, in part, on the unverified anti-Trump dossier authored by ex-British Intelligence Agent Christopher Steele, who worked on behalf of Fusion GPS—a firm paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through law firm Perkins Coie to do opposition research against the Trump campaign. In the dossier, Steele accused Page of conspiring with Russians. Page was not charged with any wrongdoing in either the FBI’s Russia probe or Mueller’s.
Fox News exclusively obtained internal FBI text messages last month showing that just nine days before the FBI applied for the Page FISA warrant, bureau officials were battling with a senior Justice Department official who had ""continued concerns"" about the ""possible bias"" of a source pivotal to the application.
Barr’s review could also dovetail with the work U.S. Attorney John Huber has been doing. In 2017, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions appointed Huber to review not only alleged surveillance abuses by the Justice Department and the FBI but also the handling of the probe into the Clinton Foundation and other matters.
The day following Barr’s release of his summary of the Mueller report, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said his panel also would investigate alleged FISA abuses at the start of the Russia investigation and called on Barr to appoint a new special counsel to investigate “the other side of the story.” Graham has been calling for a second special counsel since 2017 to investigate “whether or not a counterintelligence investigation was opened as a back door to spy on the Trump campaign.”
Also, House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said over the weekend he was preparing to send eight criminal referrals to the Justice Department this week regarding alleged misconduct by DOJ and FBI officials during the Trump-Russia investigation. It is unclear whom Nunes will refer for investigation, and what the process at the Justice Department might be.
When asked Tuesday about Nunes’ referrals, Barr said he hasn’t seen them yet, but, “Obviously, if there is a predicate for investigation, it will be conducted.”

The Herald newspaper cites the secretary in the justice ministry as calling the reburials part of measures supported by President Emmerson Mnangagwa to bring closure to the killings between 1983 and 1987. She did not say when they will start.
Mnangagwa was state security minister at the time, publicly supporting the campaign. He has refused to apologize for his alleged role but recently said people should be free to talk about the killings.

Chelsea Handler blames 'white privilege' for acting like a 'spoiled brat' about Trump's election,www.foxnews.com,Tyler McCarthy,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/chelsea-handler-blames-white-privilege-for-acting-like-a-spoiled-brat-about-trumps-election,"Chelsea Handler says she has ‘feelings’ for Robert Mueller Comedian Chelsea Handler says she is ‘not embarrassed’ by her sexual attraction to Robert Mueller. Chelsea Handler explained that her ""white privilege"" is responsible for her acting like a ""spoiled brat"" following the election of Donald Trump as president. Since 2016, the 44-year-old comedian has spent much of her time in the spotlight lambasting Trump and his administration. She has previously noted that the election of President Trump prompted her to start seeing a therapist and got her hooked on marijuana. She has posted a flurry of politically charged tweets and even voiced a jocular attraction to Robert Mueller .
CHELSEA HANDLER 'NOT EMBARRASSED' BY SEXUAL ATTRACTION TO ROBERT MUELLER
On Tuesday’s episode of “ The View ,” Handler was asked about her latest politically inspired project, which is a documentary about white privilege on Netflix.
“White people certainly don’t want to talk about it,” she said of tackling race relations in the U.S. “So I figured, start with myself so, you know, I can hang myself out to dry at my own privilege, at my own reaction to the presidency. Like a spoiled brat, you know, the way so many people were crying and screaming. It was like, 'well, nothing in your life has ever gone that wrong before?' I really had to take a look and go, ‘no.’ Yes, my brother died, that was traumatic and awful. But I’ve never been hungry, I’ve never been starving, I’ve never been discriminated against that I knew about.”
Handler continued: “I think it’s important to have uncomfortable conversations about race because we have a big situation that’s happening. And I thought, like an idiot, Barack Obama being elected was the end of racial tension in this country, and that’s not the case.”
CHELSEA HANDLER'S MOST INFLAMMATORY TWEETS AND CONTROVERSIAL MOMENTS
In the interview, Handler noted that she came close to having a mental breakdown after Trump won the presidency in a tight race against Hillary Clinton . However, she said therapy helped her understand why Trump’s rise to power affected her so deeply and made her want to take action.
“I realized what he signified was actually what happened during my childhood when it became undone. When my whole world fell apart. I lost the two most important men in my life,” she said.
The star described finding out that her father had another child while engaged to her mother. She said that his secretive and morally ambiguous behavior reminds her a lot of the president.
“But he was a lot less powerful, thankfully,” she concluded. On Our Radar "

So, you know. I really don’t know yet. It’s easy, I’m not lying right now!” Some of that work involves Lopez, 49, going on tour. She revealed that her kids will be with her for the jaunt and that she and A-Rod are working hard to make their busy schedules match up while she&apos;s on the road and he&apos;s busy covering baseball season.
“The kids will probably be with me the whole time,” she said . “Alex has &apos; Sunday Night Baseball ,&apos; so he’ll be in and out. He told me, ‘I’m definitely at opening night, I’m definitely at closing night, in between we’ll figure it out.’”
Rodriguez popped the question to Lopez last month during a beach vacation after two years of dating, and Lopez previously admitted she was ""weary"" of potentially tying the knot for a fourth time. Still, A-Rod has been so supportive, she says, that it&apos;s almost a no-brainer.
The triple-threat has been filming ""Hustlers,"" in which she plays a stripper . She says the 43-year-old former New York Yankee is proud of her work on the film.
“He knows I’m a serious actor,” she said. “He sees the bravery in what I’m doing [for &apos;Hustlers&apos;].”

The fossilized remains of a 430 million-year-old sea creature that had tentacles longer than its body have been found in Herefordshire, Britain. Given the name Sollasina cthulhu , due to its resemblance to the fictional Cthulhu sea beast thought of by American author H.P. Lovecraft, the creature was significantly smaller than the fictional monster, but perhaps just as scary to other sea creatures alive at the time.
""Although the fossil is just 3 [centimers] wide, its many long tentacles would have made it appear quite monstrous to other small sea creatures alive at the time,"" a press release describing the find reads. ""It is thought that these tentacles, or 'tube feet', were used to capture food and crawl over the seafloor.""
FOUR-LEGGED WHALE THAT LIVED 40 MILLION YEARS AGO FOUND OFF COAST IN PERU
Sollasina cthulhu was a type of sea cucumber and its 45 tentacles likely helped it walk along the seafloor, researchers noted. They were also able to look at it in 3-D, which gave researchers a deeper look into the creature's soft tissue.
""Using physical–optical tomography and computer reconstruction, we visualize the internal anatomy of S. cthulhu in three dimensions, revealing inner soft tissues that we interpret as the ring canal, a key part of the water vascular system that was previously unknown in fossil echinozoans,"" researchers wrote in the study's abstract.
The study's co-author, Dr. Jeffrey Thompson, was surprised it was a sea cucumber, originally thinking it might be a closer relative to sea urchins.
""We carried out a number of analyses to work out whether Sollasina was more closely related to sea cucumbers or sea urchins,"" Dr. Thompson said in the release. ""To our surprise, the results suggest it was an ancient sea cucumber. This helps us understand the changes that occurred during the early evolution of the group, which ultimately gave rise to the slug-like forms we see today.""

We are facing a crisis that even Obama-era lackeys can recognize. Heck, even Bernie Sanders sees it:
“I’m afraid you may be getting your information wrong. That’s not my view, what we need is comprehensive immigration reform. If you open the borders, my God, there&apos;s a lot of poverty in this world, and you&apos;re going to have people from all over the world.

Four thousand apprehensions a DAY? One hundred thousand in a month? We already have 11-22 million illegals in this country.
How many more can we take?
Better question, why are we allowing LEGAL immigrants to be disrespected and cut in line like this? It&apos;s disgraceful.

Kirstjen did a pretty good job and dealt with a lot of crap. Like being forced out of a Mexican restaurant for doing her job and enforcing immigration law.
Now that she has resigned, look at what these rags are saying about her. So wrong. Maybe she couldn’t take it. Maybe she didn’t want to. Either way, let’s move on.
Now I really like the acting DHS Secretary U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan. I’ve met him and think he’s a fearless warrior for the cause. I also think CBP still needs his leadership.
So who do I want? Well, I think the PERFECT pick is former ICE Director and personal friend of mine, Tom Homan.
I sat down with Tom just a few months ago to talk about this illegal immigration crisis.
He knows political correctness is intellectual dishonesty and he is not afraid of the liberal media mob. Not even for a second.
He’s faced cartel, murderers, rapists and repeat felons. Think he’s scared of CNN or Washington Post? Think again.
We need a leader like Tom Homan who will do what is right, not what is popular.

Illegally downloaded 'Game of Thrones' episodes expose you to viruses that hijack your computer,www.foxnews.com,Harry Pettit,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/illegally-downloaded-game-of-thrones-episodes-expose-you-to-viruses-that-hijack-your-computer,"Hackers are disguising viruses as illegal downloads ahead of the show&apos;s hotly anticipated final season, which airs this week. Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to pirate the episodes so they don&apos;t have to shell out for pricey TV packages.
And it seems cybercriminals are jumping on the chance to scam viewers as they scour the web for downloads.
Security researchers from Kaspersky Lab say cybercriminals often use popular TV shows to spread viruses – and ""Game of Thrones"" is their weapon of choice.
A whopping 17% of all infected pirated content in 2018 was disguised as Game of Thrones downloads, with nearly 21,000 users attacked.
This number is especially impressive when you consider the show did not release any new episodes last year.
More than 126,000 users downloaded malware instead of TV shows in 2018, researchers found.
Victims could have their computer taken over by hackers, who may use this access to nick passwords and banking details.
""Game of Thrones&apos;"" first episode, Winter is Coming, is most widely used to trick people into downloading viruses or ""malware"" – software designed to damage or gain access to your computer.
Behind ""Game of Thrones,"" zombie drama ""The Walking Dead"" and superhero thriller ""Arrow"" are hugely popular shows for the spread of malware.
Users downloading these series made up 15 percent and 10 percent of all malware attacks disguised as TV shows in 2018.
While the figures are staggering, the number of users affected by fake downloads was down a third from 2017.
This may be because hackers are moving away from torrent and other download websites, experts said.
""As the world tightens up policies regarding pirated content and treats intellectual property more like physical property, malware distributors seem to be leaving file-hosting and torrent websites,” commented the report’s authors.
""But this might be due to increased popularity of streaming websites that do not require files to be downloaded, yet might be a source of different threats.""
Illegal downloads for TV shows have been posted online for decades.
The practice is against the law, and as such carries inherent risks – including malware attacks.
We&apos;d recommend you get hold of your shows legally to avoid attacks.
The latest series of ""Games of Thrones"" will be available on Sky Atlantic and NowTV.

Kentucky police fatally shoot man who wounded another man,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/kentucky-police-fatally-shoot-man-who-wounded-another-man,"Email LOUISVILLE, Ky. – Police in Kentucky say officers have fatally shot a man who wounded another man in the parking lot of a Louisville apartment complex.

Pediatricians urge recall of Fisher-Price 'Rock 'n Play' after infant deaths,www.foxnews.com,Alexandria Hein,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/pediatricians-urge-recall-of-fisher-price-rock-n-play-after-infant-deaths,"But the AAP said the warning, which also said 10 babies have died while using the product since 2015, is not enough and cited Consumer Reports’ analysis that recorded 32 infant deaths involving the product between 2011 and 2018. The AAP said Consumer Reports recorded deaths involving infants younger than three months, “which is alarming.”
“AAP urges parents to stop using the product immediately,” the group said in a statement posted to its website on Tuesday . “Stores should remove the Rock ‘N Play Sleeper from their shelves. A warning issued by the CPSC and Fisher-Price on April 5 did not go far enough to ensure safety and protect infants.”
The group’s president called the product “deadly.”
“When parents purchase a product for their baby or child, many assume that if it’s being sold in a store, it must be safe to use,” Kyle Yasuda, MD, FAAP, and AAP president, said in a statement. “Tragically, that is not the case. There is convincing evidence that the Rock ‘N Play inclined sleeper puts infants’ lives at risk, and CPSC must step up and take immediate action to remove it from stores and prevent further tragedies.”
The AAP does not recommend any sleeping products for infants or any products that require restraining a baby. It also advises against using car seats, strollers or other devices for sleeping due to risk of roll over leading to possible suffocation or strangulation.
In Fisher-Price’s warning last week, the company noted that the 10 deaths they cited in their statement involved children older than 3 months who were unrestrained in the product, and had managed to roll on their stomach or sides.
The product is advertised as a place for infants to nap or sleep, and includes a vibration setting for comfort. In its initial statement, Fisher-Price said the product “meets all applicable safety standards, including those of the international standards organization, known as ASTM International, and is certified by the Juvenile Products Manufacturing Association (JPMA).”
But AAP’s chair of the Task Force on SIDS said the product fails to meet the group’s recommendations for a “safe sleep environment.”
“Infants should always sleep on their back, on a separate, flat and firm sleep surface without any bumpers or bedding,” Rachel Moon, MD, FAAP, and chair of the AAP Task Force on SIDS, said in a statement.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Kirstjen Nielsen ‘oversaw one of the largest-scale human rights violations in history’,www.foxnews.com,Kathleen Joyce,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-kirstjen-nielsen-human-rights,"Ocasio-Cortez responded to a tweet regarding a New York Times’ op-ed titled “Cancel Kirstjen Nielsen.” The opinion piece addressed a report from the paper that said Nielsen stayed in her position because “she was aware how awful life would/will be for her on the outside given her role in defending Donald Trump’s policies.”
Video “Her role in terrorizing children should make her a permanent pariah,” the piece stated .
“In stealing 1000s of children, deporting their parents, & refusing to provide info for reunification, Sec. Nielsen oversaw one of the largest-scale human rights violations in recent history,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “Awarding her a lucrative deal or prestigious post is to legitimize+celebrate that abuse.”
The freshman congresswoman was addressing the Trump administration’s practice of separating migrant children from their families at the southern border which was carried out by Nielsen.
Last summer, the administration separated more than 2,500 children from their families before international outrage forced Trump to halt the practice and a judge ordered them reunited. The government recently said in court filings that it would take up to two years to reunify all the children already separated from their families.
On Sunday, President Trump announced that Nielsen “will be leaving her position” after 16 months on the job. He announced that U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan will replace Nielsen as acting secretary, tweeting: ""I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!""

Another Dem Capitol staffer implicated in Senate data theft 'doxxing' scheme,www.foxnews.com,Lukas Mikelionis,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrat-aide-maggie-hassan-jackson-cosko-doxxing,"Cosko, who formerly worked for Hassan before his firing, pleaded guilty on Friday to five federal offenses for “doxxing” personal information of five Republican senators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, during the hearings for then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. He also confessed to stealing gigabytes-worth of data, including dozens of user names and passwords, Social Security numbers, and credit card information belonging to Senate employees,
Prosecutors said Cosko concocted an “extraordinarily extensive data-theft scheme, copying entire network drives, sorting and organizing sensitive data, and exploring ways to use that data to his benefit.”
Video But prosecutors now say that a second aide to Hassan has been involved in the data-stealing scheme, alleging that she helped Cosko to conduct the operation.
Samantha G. DeForest-Davis, whose LinkedIn states she’s a staff assistant to the senator, though Senate records indicate that she’s no longer working there, is being implicated in the crime, with a case being opened that names her, according to the Daily Caller .
DeForest-Davis hasn’t yet been charged with anything, though she allegedly provided a key that Cosko used to enter the senate office at night in an effort to set up the scheme to steal the data. Prosecutors said in courts records that she was aware of Cosko’s intentions.
The now-former staffer also reportedly filed an affidavit that could be used to determine whether she’s eligible for a public defender, the outlet reported.
Cosko worked for Hassan as a computer systems administrator until May 2018 when he was fired for failing to follow office procedures. This prompted him to enter the office and steal the information.
He went on to become an intern for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas. He was fired again amid his arrest for doxxing GOP senators after getting angry about their support Kavanaugh in the midst of allegations of impropriety. He intended to intimidate the senators and their families, according to court records.

"Two thirds of ice in the Alps will melt by 2100 due to climate change, scientists warn",feeds.foxnews.com,Charlotte Edwards,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/www.thesun.co.uk/tech/8824461/climate-change-melting-glaciers-faster/,"Published 6 mins ago Two thirds of ice in the Alps will melt by 2100 due to climate change, scientists warn By Charlotte Edwards, Digital Technology and Science Reporter | The Sun Email
File photo: Water from the melting glacier runs down through a hole in the Aletsch Glacier on the Jungfraufirn Glacier, Switzerland, August 28, 2015. One of Europe's biggest glaciers, the Great Aletsch coils 23 km (14 miles) through the Swiss Alps - and yet this mighty river of ice could almost vanish in the lifetimes of people born today because of climate change. The glacier, 900 metres (2,950 feet) thick at one point, has retreated about 3 km (1.9 miles) since 1870 and that pace is quickening. (REUTERS/Denis Balibouse) Emissions rising at their current rates will result in almost all of the glaciers in the Alps melting by the end of the century. A recent study has found that half of the ice in the 4,000 Alpine mountain glaciers will have disappeared by 2050 due to a combination of rising temperatures and past pollution.
Even if carbon emissions dropped all the way to zero by 2050, researchers still think it would be too late to save the glaciers and estimate that two-thirds of the ice will still have melted by 2100.
Losing the glaciers would negatively impact nature, farming, hydroelectricity and tourism in the area.
Glaciologist Daniel Farinotti was part of the team who conducted the research.
He said: ""Glaciers in the European Alps and their recent evolution are some of the clearest indicators of the ongoing changes in climate.
ETH Zurich in Switzerland senior researcher Matthias Huss said: ""In the pessimistic case, the Alps will be mostly ice-free by 2100, with only isolated ice patches remaining at high elevation, representing 5% or less of the present-day ice volume.""
The glacier research was published in the journal The Cryospher and details how computer models were combined with real-world data to predict the fate of the glaciers.
Glaciers across the World are thought to be losing 369 billion tons of snow and ice each year.
All this melting ice is contributing to rising sea levels.
Cutting back on fossil-fuel burning, deforestation and other polluting activities could help to minimize the melting and its subsequent devastating impact.

Chick-fil-A met with opposition at San Jose airport,www.foxnews.com,Caleb Parke,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/chick-fil-a-opposition-san-jose-airport,"Activists protested the opening of the chain at the airport on Tuesday, even though it had been approved last year as part of a package deal with other vendors. The City Council blasted the company and ended up rejecting a contract extension with Chick-fil-A because of what they called an ""anti-LGBTQ stance."" They also voted to put LGBTQ flags around the store, making it the ""gayest Chick-fil-A in the country,"" according to one city councilmember. Chick-fil-A was recently banned from airports in San Antonio and Buffalo. The city of San Jose, where two Chick-fil-A&apos;s are already in operation just miles from the airport, criticized the Christian company but stopped short of removing it from the airport. The chain is expected to open at the San Jose airport next month.
“My heart just sank when I saw the construction wall (at the airport),” former County Supervisor and the first openly gay lawmaker in the county Ken Yeager, told the San Jose Spotlight . “I’ve been doing LGBTQ rights activities for 35 years. I remember when this city was not welcoming and we’ve come a long way. I feel like this is a throwback to those times.”
The chain has a six-year deal to operate at the airport. City council members rejected a contract extension on the grounds that Chick-fil-A doesn&apos;t open on Sundays, one of the airport&apos;s busiest travel days. By nixing the extension, the restaurant will only be allowed to operate through 2026. The Christian-owned fast food joint closes on Sundays to allow employees to spend the day resting and in worship.
Councilmember Raul Peralez said putting LGBTQ pride flags at the restaurant&apos;s San Jose airport location would make it the ""gayest Chick-fil-A in the country.""
Keisha Russell, associate counsel to First Liberty Institute, argued that the city council&apos;s attempt to ban Chick-fil-A is not only bigoted, it&apos;s illegal.
""The city council cannot operate in a way that brazenly violates the Constitution and federal law, but if it chooses to, then the federal government should pull its grant,"" Russel wrote in a Fox News op-ed .
To avoid the risk of violating the First Amendment, City Attorney Rick Doyle reportedly cautioned the council not to reject the contract extension on religious or political grounds.
Not everyone agreed though. Some argue customers, not the government, should decide.
“They do not discriminate against LGBTQ in serving their customers,” Shane Patrick Connolly, chief of staff for Councilmember Johnny Khamis, tweeted . “If we disapprove of owners’ views, we may vote with our dollars: eat elsewhere.”
San Jose councilmembers admitted they overlooked the issue when they approved the restaurant in March 2018.
“There are some people who are very political, there are people who have social, conscientious issues,” Joe Good from Oregon told FOX 2 . “I just like a good sandwich.”

Royal Caribbean 'temporarily' closes trampoline attraction at the center of $10 million injury lawsuit,www.foxnews.com,Janine Puhak,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/royal-caribbean-temporarily-closes-trampoline-attraction-at-center-of-10-million-injury-lawsuit,"Royal Caribbean officials are currently reviewing the feature following a $10 million injury lawsuit filed in March by a Mariner of the Seas passenger, who broke his pelvis in a 20-foot fall from the Sky Pad , reportedly suffering permanent injuries.
Holladay is said to have suffered ""a disability and permanent injuries"" as consequence of the event, as per reports. (Royal Caribbean)
In recent days, reps for the cruise line have responded to various inquiries from Twitter users and confirmed that the attraction, indeed, will be temporarily closed, the Miami Herald reported.
“We&apos;re currently conducting a review as the safety as part of our commitment to safety for all of our guests. I&apos;m very sorry for any disappointment this has caused,” one official wrote online.
It remains unclear at this time just how long the Sky Pad will be closed.
When contacted for comment, Owen Torres, Royal Caribbean International&apos;s corporate communications director, told Fox News that the Sky Pad has been taken out of service to “conduct further inspection” as a safety measure.
As noted by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel , there is also a Sky Pad trampoline on the Spectrum of the Seas ship, but Royal Caribbean has not yet addressed whether or not the attraction remains open on that vessel.
The 25-year-old man had looked forward the ""awesome experience"" of trying the Sky Pad attraction (pictured) during the cruise, which he took with his girlfriend, but never could have predicted that he would suffer such devastating injuries. (Royal Caribbean)
Brett Rivkind, Holladay’s attorney, confirmed to Fox News on April 10 that his client is suing the cruise line company for $10 million, and gave the following statement on the news of the Sky Pad’s provisional closure:
“It is obvious they have finally recognized the sky pad is unsafe and Royal Caribbean Cruise Line must do the proper safety analysis and risk assessment that should [have] been performed before launching this activity on their ships,” Rivkind said, via email. “Casey is angry and sad he had to be one of the motivating factors for this to happen.”
“It comes too late for him, but hopefully it will save others from serious injury and possibly even death.” the maritime lawyer continued. “I have said many times the cruise ship companies rush to put more and more shipboard activities on their ships that are dangerous and do so without the proper risk assessments and qualifications to assure they are safe for passengers.”
“No one is inspecting and certifying these attractions on cruise ships. This is a major safety concern,” Rivkind alleged.
On March 12, Holladay filed suit against the Miami-based Royal Caribbean for negligence in relation to the incident, which occurred during a cruise in early February. According to NBC 6, the 25-year-old Washington man had looked forward the ""awesome experience"" of trying the Sky Pad attraction during the tropical cruise, which he took with his girlfriend.
Billed as an ""out-of-this-world bungee trampoline experience,"" Sky Pad adventurers strap into a harness that features bungee cords on each side to jump and bounce, according to its official web page. Soon after Holladay strapped into the attraction and soared upwards, his harness unexpectedly “snapped 20 feet above the ground,” plummeting him to hit the hard surface of the ground next to the trampoline, Business Insider reported.
""I just felt the momentum release from my body that I wasn’t being held by anything anymore. When I hit all I really remember is the hit and the noise and the fear,” Holladay told NBC . ""It&apos;s kind of one of those cliché moments when your life changes in the blink of an eye.”
The cruise line shortened the trip to bring the man back to Miami, where he spent nine days in the hospital, undergoing multiple surgeries for his broken pelvis and receiving treatment for his dislocated shoulder.
Holladay is said to have suffered ""a disability and permanent injuries"" as a consequence of the event. He is now in physical therapy and seeing a psychologist for depression in relation to the accident, The Sun-Sentinel reports.

Lowcock also urged the council to press for sustained and regular access to people in need, and to fund the expansion of humanitarian programs.

The caption on the last post listed three dates and locations of where he will perform alongside fellow comedian John Mulaney for their comedy tour.
That said, the account doesn&apos;t appear to be run by Davidson himself. Rather, photographer and filmmaker Marcus Russell Price, who works with Davidson, per Us Weekly , is managing it.
Davidson’s return comes after he shared a dark message on Instagram in December.
“I really don’t want to be on this earth anymore,” he wrote in a now-deleted post . “I’m doing my best to stay here for you but I actually don’t know how much longer I can last. all I’ve ever tried to do was help people. just remember I told you so.”
Additionally, in a post shortly before, the 25-year-old also commended rapper Kanye West for his “bravery” for openly discussing mental health issues. The comment came after West and pop star Ariana Grande, whom Davidson was once briefly engaged to, feuded on Twitter.
Davidson, who is now dating actress Kate Beckinsale, 45, has been open about his own mental health struggles, too. The comedian suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), which he was diagnosed in 2017, according to TIME . Davidson, before deleting his Instagram, once shared a lengthy post addressing both his BPD and suicide.
""I’ve spoken about BPD and being suicidal publicly only in the hopes that it will help bring awareness and help kids like myself who don’t want to be on this earth. I just want you guys to know. No matter how hard the internet or anyone tries to make me kill myself. I won’t. I’m upset I even have to say this. To all those holding me down and seeing this for what it is – I see you and I love you,"" he wrote, in part, at the time, according to the magazine.
“This whole year has been an f---ing nightmare. This has been the worst year of my life, getting diagnosed with this and trying to figure out how to learn with this and live with this,” Davidson separately told Marc Maron on the WTF podcast in September 2017.

Baggage handler filmed doing push-ups inside EasyJet plane while waiting to load luggage,www.foxnews.com,Michael Bartiromo,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/baggage-handler-filmed-doing-push-ups-inside-easyjet-plane-while-waiting-to-load-luggage,"The fitness-forward employee was captured on camera by a passenger named Andy Lee, who filmed the action from inside Manchester Airport on April 9, The Independent reported. In the footage, the handler can be seen performing several quick push-ups as large pieces of luggage slowly make their way up the conveyor belt. Passengers can also be heard laughing from inside the departures area, prior to Lee’s flight to Alicante, Spain.
EasyJet, however, seems to think this is no laughing matter. In a statement obtained by Fox News, the airline said it was discussing the incident with its contracted ground-handling service, which employs the handler.
“We are aware of the video and have raised it to our ground handling services supplier at Manchester Airport.”
It is unclear if the handler was violating any rules with the fitness routine.
In the past, however, airport luggage handlers have been caught engaging in other controversial activities, such as tossing luggage , stealing guns from passengers’ bags, falling asleep among the luggage and getting trapped on a flight ,

Kellyanne Conway: Congress needs to 'stop denying' border crisis and act,www.foxnews.com,Chris Irvine,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kellyanne-conway-congress-border-crisis,"Citing figures released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection Tuesday , Conway said that migrants were facing a “perilous journey and a humanitarian crisis at the border.” “In the fiscal year so far, we’ve had 104 of these so-called caravans with at least 100 people,” she said. “Two years ago, fiscal year 2017, we had exactly 2. We’ve gone from 2 to 104. Stop denying what you see in front of you. We’ve got people still searching for the elusive collusion and will deny what’s right in front of them.
“There was over 100,000 migrants presented at the border just last month alone, that was a 35 percent jump from February from the month before… For years, a decade really, most of them were single men from Mexico and you can return them very easily to their home country. Now you have 8,000 or so unaccompanied minors last month, you have the family units from the northern triangle countries, it is a perilous journey and a humanitarian crisis at the border.
Video CPB said that more than 103,000 migrants were turned away from or apprehended at the border last month, an increase of nearly 106 percent over the same period last year.
In all, CBP said it apprehended 92,607 people, including 53,077 family units (a 45.3 percent increase over February) and 8,975 unaccompanied minors (a 31 percent increase over February). Another 10,885 migrants were deemed ""inadmissible"" by immigration authorities.
The total number of 103,492 apprehensions or rejections is the highest of any month over at least the past six years.
Conway continued: “Anybody who can look at me with a straight face and tell me that they know what happens to those young children once they’re released into the United States is lying. It’s wishful thinking that they’re ‘oh they’re reunited with family members and sponsors and they’re gainfully employed and life is wonderful, roses and lollipops after that.’
""You don’t know where they are. You don’t know who’s human-trafficked, who’s murdered, who’s with a gang. I’ve got girls 14, 11 and 9, all three of them within the range of the girls being pumped with birth control and pregnancy tests because we know this journey is perilous. Stop lying and start doing.”
When asked about potential solutions, Conway suggested fixing the TVPRA [Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000], calling it a “magnet for recycling children.”
She also called on a fix for the Flores Settlement, which limits the time immigration services detain unaccompanied minors to 20 days.
The CBP’s numbers were announced two days after the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in a shakeup orchestrated by President Trump, who has been frustrated by his administration&apos;s inability to stem the tide of migrants from Central America and other parts of the world.

"Robert Bianchi: Don't expect a ""Smollet"" resolution in the college cheating scandal",www.foxnews.com,Robert Bianchi,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-bianchi-dont-expect-a-smollet-resolution-in-the-college-cheating-scandal,"Lori Loughlin, husband hit with new charges in college admissions scandal The actress and her husband are among 16 parents hit with money laundering conspiracy charges. The college cheating scandal comes on the heels of the disgraceful dismissal of actor Jussie Smollett’s case. But with this case, don’t expect actresses Felicity Huffman or Lori Loughlin to be treated so “kindly” as Smollett . Of course, this is a tale of two entirely different cases, but it is also a tale of two different kinds of prosecutors and two different kinds of defendants.
The cheating scam illustrates the height of arrogance, privilege, and entitlement by the “haves” at the expense of the “have nots.” These actresses allegedly made illegal payoffs to cheat the college admission system so that their well-connected children could obtain even bigger head starts in life.
LORI LOUGHLIN INDICTED ON NEW MONEY LAUNDERING CHARGES IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL
Some people think, “Hold on. This is not a violent crime. What’s the big deal?” But what is missing from that perspective is that this is NOT a victimless crime. Think about the hard-working students and their parents who should have earned those spots -- the ones who played by the rules and didn’t bribe college officials for admission. Educational institutions and we as a society have been harmed by this scandal. The callous and insensitive actions of these parents are corrosive to our laws and societal values and have lessened our sense of fairness and respect for the college admissions process. When fairness is wrongly taken away from us, justice steps in -- at least most of the time, the Smollett-kind-of-cases notwithstanding.
Now, Smollett got the break of a lifetime and demonstrated that justice can be wrongly manipulated by those who administer it. He skates as unaccountable and arrogant, as he was when he scammed the world with his tale of being attacked.
But Huffman and Loughlin will not escape as Smollett did, and the U.S. attorney is clearly telegraphing that.
The fact is prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges have to make careful considerations about defendants every day.
Felicity Huffman has accepted responsibility by pleading guilty quickly. She has given a gut-wrenching statement of remorse to the court and the public, and she is willing to accept her punishment. This is what we in the law call atonement.
As a former prosecutor, this would have factored into how I decide to resolve her case. Yes, deterrence and punishment need to be considered. But her seemingly genuine remorse and willingness to plead guilty also achieve other important criminal justice goals, such as unburdening the court with otherwise lengthy legal proceedings and assisting prosecutors in building cases against other defendants. So it is fair for a lower sentence to be offered in exchange.
Huffman is now facing months in prison, not years, and it is possible that the lawyers may be able to convince a judge to give her no jail time at all. Either way, her “landing”, while not as cushy as Smollett’s, is still far better than the years in prison she faced had she toughed it out and later been convicted. By comparison, Loughlin is not getting the message. The U.S. attorney was seemingly unimpressed by her failure to plea and accept responsibility, and as a result, she secured a second, more draconian indictment that will likely add more jail time to her sentence. There will be no adoring fans seeing her as innocent Aunt Becky from Full House, and no handlers, agents or red carpets to placate her in that austere courtroom. In this case, the prosecutors have the great equalizer of wrongdoers who are powerful and famous: the grand jury.
My great grandfather once stated that “a small pebble can overturn a large carriage.” Metaphorically, I believe that Ms. Loughlin is about to run head-on into a prosecutorial boulder.
The physics of federal prosecution is that plea offers are escalating. This means they get harsher as the case goes on. Importantly, prosecutors are mandated under the attorney general guidelines to require defendants to plead guilty to the highest, most readily provable offense. So as charges are increased, more jail time is tacked on.

I am not saying that these parents should never see the light of day again, but typically when the reality hits defendants that they have harmed themselves further by having more serious charges filed against them, it is a decision often regretted -- from within a place where there is plenty of time to do little other than ponder their decisions.
Who knows … perhaps Ms. Loughlin has a valid defense to the charges. Or, perhaps she naively believes she will get a Smollett deal.
My feeling is that she is ensuring she will be going to federal prison at some juncture and that this moment of pride will be followed by her fall. Robert A.

Google’s Wing kicks off first drone delivery service in Australia,www.foxnews.com,Danielle Wallace,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/googles-wing-drone-delivery-service-australia,"Wing partnered with local businesses to deliver small household items via drone to eligible homes in Canberra, located southwest of Sydney. Products are lowered from the drone by a string to the front yard of paying customers who live in the capital’s northern suburbs of Crace, Palmerston and Franklin. “Our service allows customers to order a range of items such as fresh food, hot coffee or over-the-counter chemist items on our mobile app, and have them delivered directly to their homes by drone in minutes,” Wing Medium wrote in a press release Monday, announcing plans to expand the service to surrounding areas in the coming months.
The Australian aviation authority granted Wing permission to operate a commercial drone delivery service after evaluating the company’s safety record and operational plans, BBC News reported. Despite complaints from residents over noise from drone flights, the agency has allowed Wing to test the service since 2014, concluding that the drones pose no risk to residents or other aircraft.
Wing will host community information stalls and delivery demonstrations in areas where the service is offered to ensure residents adjust to the drone deliveries, according to the press release. The country’s aviation authority requires Wing drones to steer clear of main roads and people and only to conduct deliveries during daytime hours as part of a policy to protect locals from disturbances, Observer reported.
Over the past 18 months, Wing’s drones have flown products to the doors of residents in Fernleigh Park, Royalla and Bonython communities more than 3,000 times before the commercial service was launched. During the service’s trial period, residents outside Canberra launched the Bonython Against Drones campaign, complaining loud drones disrupted the peace in local neighborhoods, BBC News reported.
""When they do a delivery drop they hover over the site and it sounds like an extremely loud, squealing vacuum cleaner,"" the group said on its website. The Australian aviation authority ordered Wing to develop quieter drones for its deliveries. As part of the agency’s new policy, drone deliveries will only be conducted on weekdays between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m.
“The feedback we have received during the trials has been valuable, helping us to refine our operations to better meet the needs and expectations of the communities in which we operate,” the company stated.
The company has partnered with local businesses, including Kickstart Expresso, Capital Chemist, Pure Gelato, Jasper + Myrtle, Bakers Delight, Guzman Y Gomez, and Drummond Golf. Wing is looking to partner with more companies in the future who are looking to “reach more customers faster, safer and more sustainably.”
Wing estimated that its drone delivery service could add as much as $28.5 million to Australia’s annual revenue at its full capacity, The Guardian reported .

Hassan Nasrallah said Wednesday that the Trump administration&apos;s decision stems from the ""failure"" of its policies in the region.
The Guard is the main backer for Hezbollah, which plays an influential role in the Lebanese government and is already designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S.
Nasrallah said that although his group and Iran are sanctioned, that ""does not mean we have no power cards.""
Designating the Guard as a terrorist organization could also significantly complicate U.S. military and diplomatic work, notably in Iraq and Lebanon."

George magazine co-founder, Michael J. Berman, said he was shocked Kennedy suggested Madonna – who famously portrayed his late father’s reported mistress Marilyn Monroe in the 1985 music video “Material Girl” – to pose as the former first lady.
“There were always things that we’d think he was going to be weirded out about but he wasn’t,” explained Berman. “He wanted to do a cover about his mother. Something about telling the truth, it was his idea. He wanted somebody dressed like his mother sitting on a pile of every book that’s ever been written about her. And I was like, ‘It sounds great, but we don’t need the books.’”
“He called Madonna and asked her to do it,” continued Berman. “We were like, ‘Holy s---, you’re going to see Jackie Kennedy on the cover with the sunglasses and the hair and then you’re going to look again and it’s Madonna.”
Madonna, who allegedly had a fling with Kennedy in 1988, refused.

“He faxed Madonna a note,” said executive assistant Rosemarie Terenzio . “And she called, I remember she left a voicemail. ‘Hi, it’s Madonna calling for John. I don’t know if this is the right number, but this is the number that he gave me’ — clearly annoyed that she was in voicemail.”
“So he told her the idea, and she faxed a note back. It said, ‘Dear Johnny Boy’ – because she loved to f--- with him – ‘Thanks for asking me to be your mother, but I’m afraid I could never do her justice. My eyebrows aren’t thick enough, for one.&apos;”
According to Terenzio, Madonna suggested she might be a better fit to pose as Adolf Hitler’s wife.
“When you want me to portray Eva Braun , I might say yes,” Madonna quipped.
And the pop star wasn’t the only icon to turn down Kennedy. Terenzio revealed the former first son was also turned down by Princess Diana.

“We wanted to put Princess Diana on the cover,” she explained. “There were all these calls back-and-forth; she was in town and staying at the Carlyle [in New York City]. I can’t remember who hatched this scheme that he should go in disguise. We were laughing and carrying on, ‘Oh, go in as this’ or ‘go in as that.’ And finally, he was like, ‘I’m not going anywhere in disguise, that’s the stupidest thing ever.” It just wasn’t him.”
“He had tea with her,” Terenzio continued. “When he came out, I said, ‘Well, how was she?’ And he’s like, ‘She’s tall, taller than I thought. She’s very nice, shy, a little coy. But she’s not going to do it.’ At the end of the day, all he cared about was getting a yes to the cover of George. Everything else was kind of, whatever.”
Executive editor Elizabeth Mitchell added that Diana’s death in 1997 at age 36 greatly impacted Kennedy.
“When Diana died, I remember calling him at home and saying, ‘We’re going to have to do something.’ And he said, ‘Yeah, OK, we’ll talk about it.’ So I called a meeting to discuss it. He just didn’t come — he wasn’t showing up on time, which he normally would never do. We kept delaying, and finally, he came in and said, ‘I can’t do it right now, I need to clean my office.’

“It was obvious he was having an emotional response to the tragedy and finding it difficult. He kept saying, ‘I don’t see why this needs to be a story.’ In the end, we did this incredible photo essay of the mourning going on in London.”
This July will mark 20 years since Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette died in 1999 after the aircraft he was piloting crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. The trio was on their way to Rory Kennedy’s wedding. He was 38.

Back in 2017, Terenzio told Fox News Carolyn was stressed by her husband’s non-stop schedule with George, along with the growing attention from pestering paparazzi when she decided not to attend the family wedding. Instead, she was hoping to take a break. Terenzio said she convinced Carolyn to attend to avoid questions being raised on any reported marital woes the tabloids were clinging onto. Carolyn would go on that fatal flight, which haunted Terenzio for years.
“It was very difficult,” Terenzio admitted. “It took time for me to get back up and figure out what I wanted to do next… there was a lot of trial and error.”
Terenzio chronicled her memories with Kennedy in the 2012 memoir “Fairy Tale Interrupted,” which helped her cope. Today she is the founder of a publicity firm. And while Terenzio’s career continues to flourish, she still thinks of her friends and what could have been.
“I don’t think he felt any pressure or felt any burden [to pursue politics] because of his name,” she said at the time. “I think he saw it as a wealth of opportunity. And that he was very lucky. He thought about it. He certainly talked about running for office, but his priority was to make George a success.”

Mohammad al-Issa: My advice to Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar News,www.foxnews.com,Mohammad Al-Issa,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/mohammad-issa-tlaib-omar,"It is a challenging question. I may be the secretary-general of the Muslim World League, but it’s not my place to counsel lawmakers — Muslim or not — elected and entrusted to represent their communities. My refrain is often along the lines of: “They should faithfully advocate for their constituents, and faithfully serve as custodians of the Constitution.” It is perhaps an unexpected response. But it is one that reflects my view of inclusive national integration, and how best to promote tolerance toward people of all faiths and backgrounds.
As I tell my American friends in and out of government when they ask about the integration of Muslims, the majority in any country has vital obligations. For one, they must create a framework of identity independent of religious or ethnic affiliation. The binding element should be love of country. The universal ambition should be to enable meaningful contributions to society.
I have dwelled upon this matter deeply in the weeks since a crazed extremist gunned down 50 Muslims in their houses of worship and injured 50 others in New Zealand. This is not because the attack relates to the two congresswomen, but because the question goes to the heart of how we construe successful integration. My answer remains the same.
In fact, I believe the message is even more poignant today. To build tolerance and promote full national integration, majority and minority bear a responsibility that is, at its core, similar. It starts with embracing diversity and putting the interests of the entire nation first.
Respecting the law is a two-way street. When I sat down with French politician Marine Le Pen, people questioned what I was trying to do. I hope I showed them otherwise when we found some common ground, particularly concerning integration. We agreed that the nation must guarantee full rights and freedom to all people under her flag and that all citizens must respect the laws of their government.
We can teach our children religion without isolating them from their communities, or erecting psychological walls between them and the majority.
No nation, no community, and no majority or minority are immune to mistakes that hinder inclusive citizenship. We must all explore our own actions and prejudices to determine how well we are contributing to harmony, coexistence and national cooperation. We should examine our civil society institutions to see if they effectively advocate the interests of a national body representative of everyone.
My organization represents the interests of all of the world’s Muslims, but I see my mandate as broader. I am determined to combat intolerance and hatred toward anyone based on race, religion, ethnicity or personal beliefs. Bigotry and racism against one is a crime against all.
As a Muslim right now, it might seem appealing to play the victim card to gain political advantage. This trap benefits no country and no minority group, however great its grief. We as Muslims must confront the problem from within, and see how our attitudes or behavior contributes to misunderstanding. This is not to say Muslims are culpable, but that we share a responsibility to make things better.
I tell Muslims everywhere I travel to embrace the nations they live in and to positively integrate. The process must start early. It makes no sense to separate Muslim children and youth from the rest of society or to cloister them away in Islamic private schools. We can teach our children religion without isolating them from their communities or erecting psychological walls between them and the majority.
Dialogue is critical. Unless we talk to one another, even with those whose opinions we most virulently reject, how are we to define an inclusive national interest? If we differ on tactics and approaches, we can start by harmonizing our goals, which must include the advancement of the entire nation rather than any partisan bloc, religious community or ethnic subgroup. This maxim must hold true for both the majority and the minority.

Funeral services will be private.

""Just by being himself,"" Time wrote, ""he has enabled a giveaway show, the crassest of lowbrow entertainments, to whip up a doting mass audience for a new kind of TV idol — of all things, an egghead.""
Later, as the triumph unraveled into scandal, he initially denied he had been given advance answers, but he finally admitted that the show was rigged.
He retreated to his family&apos;s home in rural West Cornwall, Connecticut, after telling a congressional committee in 1959 that he was coached before each segment of the show.

After spending much of the 1960s and &apos;70s in Chicago, Van Doren and his wife, Geraldine, returned to Connecticut, residing for years in a small brown bungalow on the family compound. They did some teaching but largely lived in semi-seclusion, refusing to grant interviews and even leaving the country for several weeks when Robert Redford&apos;s film ""Quiz Show"" was released in the fall of 1994.
Van Doren refused to cooperate in the movie&apos;s making and declined to meet with actor Ralph Fiennes, who portrayed him in the film. Fiennes later told People magazine that after Van Doren brushed him off, he knocked on his door pretending to be lost so he could observe Van Doren&apos;s movements and speech patterns.
Van Doren broke his silence in 2008, writing an account of his downfall in The New Yorker and how he finally had publicly admitted a half-century earlier that he was ""foolish, naive, prideful and avaricious.""
""People who knew the entertainment business didn&apos;t have much doubt about what was going on, although they didn&apos;t speak out,"" he wrote.
In light of the large profits the rigged game shows were making, he added, ""why would they?""
He also disclosed that he eventually did watch ""Quiz Show"" and laughed at an insulting reference that a character made about him. He said he had been tempted to take a consulting fee from the producers, but his wife talked him out of it.

Van Doren&apos;s family had a proud literary standing at the time of the scandal. His father, Mark Van Doren, was a critic, biographer and poet who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1940. His uncle, Carl Van Doren, received a Pulitzer in 1939 for a biography of Benjamin Franklin.
Charles Van Doren was himself a rising young academic at Columbia when he became famous on the quiz show. He went on to win $129,000 on the show after defeating Herbert Stempel, a New Yorker portrayed by John Turturro in the movie.
Stempel later went public and said contestants were fed the answers to the questions prior to the show. He said he was told to lose because the show&apos;s producers thought Van Doren had star potential.
25TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH In 1962, Van Doren and nine other winners from three NBC shows — ""Twenty-One,"" &apos;&apos;Tic-Tac-Dough"" and ""Hi-Lo"" — pleaded guilty to lying to a grand jury that had investigated the scandal. They were spared jail terms by a judge who said the nation&apos;s scorn was punishment enough.
After the scandal broke, Van Doren lost the $50,000-a-year job NBC gave him when he defeated Stempel. He also was dropped from the faculty at Columbia, where his father had been a professor for decades.
Friends said Van Doren&apos;s family was shocked by his eventual revelation that he had been given the answers in advance.
Bucky Whitney, a longtime friend, recalled the family&apos;s shame.
""His father took it real hard. The old man was never the same after that,"" Whitney told a reporter who visited Cornwall when ""Quiz Show"" came out.
Van Doren later joined the Institute for Philosophical Research, a nonprofit Chicago think tank, and worked at Chicago-based Encyclopaedia Britannica for many years. Among his books were ""The Idea of Progress,"" a philosophical work, and ""A History of Knowledge; Past, Present, and Future.""
Van Doren and his wife had two children, Elizabeth and John.
""He was a loving husband and a terrific father, and he&apos;s going to be deeply missed,"" John Van Doren said.
In West Cornwall, neighbors were protective of ""Charley,"" as Van Doren was affectionately known.
Walter DeTheir, the proprietor of a store in Cornwall, said Van Doren was a quiet, shy man who came in regularly to pick up the Sunday New York Times.
""It&apos;s not that he isn&apos;t friendly, he just doesn&apos;t have much to say,"" DeTheir said.
In his New Yorker piece, Van Doren said he liked to avoid ""people who say, &apos;Aren&apos;t you Charles Van Doren?&apos; Well, that&apos;s my name, I say to myself, but I&apos;m not who you think I am — or, at least, I don&apos;t want to be.""

Defense Minister Olta Xhacka said Wednesday she has ordered military police and a special air forces battalion to install a security perimeter around Mother Teresa International Airport in Tirana.
The robbers took the cash as it was loaded onto an Austrian Airlines plane on Tuesday afternoon. One robber was shot dead in an exchange of fire with police, but the cash was not recovered.
Cash is regularly sent out of Albania by private banks because the country&apos;s central bank does not accept foreign currency.
Hong Kong-based China Everbright Ltd, which runs the airport, rejected as ""incorrect"" claims by the interior minister that security at the airport had failed."

Rep. Sean Duffy: Green New Deal supporters don’t care about the climate – they want control over your life,www.foxnews.com,Rep. Sean Duffy,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rep-sean-duffy-green-new-deal-supporters-dont-care-about-the-climate-they-want-control-over-your-life,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez speaks at the annual National Action Network convention Thanks to policies laid out by President Trump and Republicans in Congress , the American economy is booming. We reformed the tax code so that families can keep more of their own hard-earned money, and instituted smart regulations so that businesses have the right guardrails to grow and hire more workers.
As a result, wages are up, and unemployment is down. Right now, in fact, there are a million more job openings in the United States than there are unemployed Americans.
The American Dream is back within reach of millions of families. My wife, Rachel, and I have eight children, and we have never been so excited for their future.
But we’re not getting tired of all this winning. We’re just getting started.
Alarmingly, leftist ideologues in the Democratic Party want to stop America’s momentum in its tracks. For decades, socialists in America have rejected the notion that America is the land of freedom, opportunity, and upward mobility.
Instead, they view our way of life as the problem.
Take their support for the so-called “Green New Deal.” Supporters of the Green New Deal desire to rig the game in their favor by radically overhauling our economy, which would make it harder for families to save money and live the American Dream. They say this is all in the name of addressing climate change.
The plan’s “Frequently Asked Questions” document lays out their goals:
“Yes, we are calling for a full transition off fossil fuels and zero greenhouse gases. Anyone who has read the resolution sees that we spell this out through a plan that calls for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from every sector of the economy. Simply banning fossil fuels immediately won’t build the new economy to replace it – this is the plan to build that new economy and spells out how to do it technically.
We do this through a huge mobilization to create a renewable energy economy as fast as possible. We set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren’t sure that we’ll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.”
So, they want to ban fossil fuels, get rid of all cows in America, take away your freedom to travel by air, and require your home, church, place of work, children’s school – everywhere – to be “retro-fitted” to eliminate carbon emissions.
And what happens if we don’t? According to the Green New Deal’s author, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, “The world is going to end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change.”
Because she claims the world is going to end, she argues that her critics are wrong to ask, “how are we gonna pay for it?”
Well, Ocasio-Cortez, rich liberals in places like San Francisco or New York may be able to afford the massive new set of regulations that the Green New Deal requires, but hardworking families in northern Wisconsin – and in communities around America – will not be able to afford these radical ideas.
The American Action Forum, a non-partisan think tank, has calculated that the Green New Deal will cost up to $93 trillion in only the first 10 years.
Despite the Green New Deal’s claim that this plan will help the poor, it is the poorest Americans who will suffer the most from this plan.
Poor and working-class Americans would face higher energy costs, higher food costs, and higher housing costs.
On two occasions, I have raised awareness of the plan’s damaging consequences in legislative discussion in the House Financial Services Committee. By inserting language of the Green New Deal into housing legislation, I gave Democrats, including several of the Green New Deal’s original supporters, the opportunity to vote in support of their plan to overhaul our economy.
Any reasonable person would think they would vote for their own proposal, right?
If the world were truly going to end in 12 years, they would have a sense of urgency and immediately vote for it any chance they could. They would also change the way they live before asking Americans to change how they live. For instance, why does Sen. Bernie Sanders often take private jets? Why does Rep. Ocasio-Cortez not take the train to Washington from New York? Why didn’t she take the subway during her campaign, which was less than a football field away from her office?
Their actions and their votes show that this radical economic upheaval is not about saving the world’s climate.
Supporters of the Green New Deal in the House voted against their own proposal twice. Every single Democrat on the Committee voted against the plan. And the Green New Deal’s author, Ocasio-Cortez, skipped the vote entirely.
In the Senate, all six Senators vying for the Democrat nomination for president have signed their names to the plan. However, those same six Senators ducked a vote on the Green New Deal. That’s right, even avowed socialist Bernie Sanders did not vote in favor of it.

They have chosen to vote against or vote present for their own proposal they say we need so dearly because these socialists don’t want you to see their full hand too quickly. Ultimately, they want to control the way you live, control what you eat, where you live, and how you travel. They want to institute a socialist ideology that the far-left has been trying to force upon the American people for over a century.
We must stand against radical ideas like the Green New Deal, and continue to work to find commonsense solutions that expand freedom and opportunity for the American people. It is my hope that these far-left Democrats will join us in the effort to help make a more prosperous America for the next generation – and yes, one that will live and work in our nation more than 12 years from now.

Bill Bennett jokes maybe Sanders’ tax returns reveal 'he's got $32T in there' to cover the Medicare for All plan,www.foxnews.com,Talia Kaplan,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bill-bennett-bernie-sanders-tax-returns-medicare-for-all,"“As Ronald Reagan would say about Bernie Sanders view ‘there you go again,’ more movement to the left among the leaders of this Democrat party, runners for the presidential nomination,” said Bennett, a Fox News contributor, on “ America’s Newsroom ” Wednesday. “Look, it’s a $32 trillion dollar bill at least. I don’t know if you made the connection but Bernie Sanders has not released his tax returns, maybe he’s got $32 trillion in there that can cover this but I kind of doubt it,” joked Bennett.
Sen. Sanders, I-Vt., who is expected to release his tax returns on Monday, is one of the most outspoken lawmakers in support of the policy and used “Medicare for All” as part of his platform in his 2016 presidential campaign. He is expected to use the updated version of the proposal for his 2020 run, shaking up the election by reopening the debate over his call to eliminate private health insurance.
The plan’s astronomical price tag is under fire from President Donald Trump and Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell who slammed it as a far-left social experiment. On Tuesday McConnell, R-Ky., wrote on Twitter, “Democrats’ “Medicare for None” would slap a $32 trillion tab on Americans, and that’s just a rough estimate for the first decade. And competing private insurance policies -- like the ones that 180 million Americans currently use -- would be banned outright.”
Four of Sanders&apos; fellow senators and rivals for the Democratic nomination, including Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., are set to sign on to the updated single-payer health care proposal.
“They’ll all follow him. He’s the Pied Piper and they will follow him and many of them have endorsed this idea,” said Bennett.
Video Some candidates who back the plan tout it as one of several ways to achieve more affordable coverage and lower the number of uninsured.
“This idea has initial approval from the public, about 50% when they first hear about it. When they hear that they will lose their individual insurance plan it goes down in the 30s, when they hear what it will cost it goes down in the 20s,” said Bennett. “This is a nonstarter, this is something Donald Trump can use to great advantage in a campaign.”
Those candidates who don&apos;t support “Medicare for All” are instead focusing on safeguarding popular provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as the one that protects coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.

BERNIE INTRODUCES NEW ‘MEDICARE FOR ALL’ PLAN
AP: “Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont unveiled a new version of his ‘Medicare for All’ plan on Wednesday, shaking up the 2020 presidential race by reopening the debate over his call to eliminate private health insurance. ‘It is not a radical idea to say that in the United States, every American who goes to a doctor should be able to afford the prescription drug he or she needs,’ Sanders said. ‘Health care is a human right, not a privilege.’ Four of Sanders’ fellow senators and rivals for the Democratic nomination are set to sign onto the updated single-payer health care proposal. The bill’s reintroduction promises to shine a light on Democratic presidential candidates’ disparate visions for the long term future of American health care. Under fire from President Donald Trump and Republicans for the astronomical price tag of Medicare for All, some candidates who support the plan tout it as one of several ways to achieve more affordable coverage and lower the number of uninsured people.”
He’ll also release his tax returns by Monday - NYT: “Senator Bernie Sanders, whose $18 million fund-raising haul has solidified his status as a front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said Tuesday that he would release 10 years of tax returns by Tax Day on Monday and acknowledged that he has joined the ranks of the millionaires he has denounced for years. ‘April 15 is coming,’ Mr. Sanders, whose refusal to release his full past returns has become an issue in the campaign, said in an interview in his office. ‘We wanted to release 10 years of tax returns. April 15, 2019, will be the 10th year, so I think you will see them.’ Told that he was being compared to President Trump, who has refused to release his tax returns, Mr. Sanders got more specific: ‘On the day in the very immediate future, certainly before April 15, we release ours, I hope that Donald Trump will do exactly the same.’”

THE RULEBOOK: HOLD THE PURSE
“[The House of Representatives] in a word, hold the purse that powerful instrument by which we behold, in the history of the British Constitution, an infant and humble representation of the people gradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance, and finally reducing, as far as it seems to have wished, all the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government.” – James Madison , Federalist No. 58
TIME OUT: ‘HIS ACCIDENCY’
Vanity Fair: “In 1868, President Andrew Johnson found himself impeached and on trial before the U.S. Senate. Over the course of his term, he had essentially declared war on his own government, vetoing an outrageous 29 bills, firing officials without Senate permission, and pardoning old pals. Congress fought back: 15 vetoes were overridden, and after a nearly three-month trial Abe Lincoln ’s successor barely escaped conviction. ‘The question of whether a president could govern while being on trial was a hot topic,’ writes Jared Cohen in Accidental Presidents: Eight Men Who Changed America , out this month from Simon & Schuster. ‘Johnson clearly thought he could … The book is also a reminder that, when it came to succession, America’s founders basically winged it. ‘If you think about how much we leave to chance, the fact that only Andrew Johnson was a disaster is really quite the miracle,’ Cohen says.”

TEAM TRUMP CONSIDERS REVISING FAMILY SEPARATION PLAN
WaPo: “The Trump administration is considering a revised version of its family separation tactic to cope with an influx of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border that would force parents to choose whether to remain detained as a family or agree to a separation to keep their children out of custody, according to administration officials. The administration weighed the new policy as President Trump insisted that he has no plans to separate families, falsely claimed that President Barack Obama carried out the same plan and maintained that his decision to halt the practice last year was the reason so many Central Americans have been coming to the United States. ‘We’re not looking to do that now,’ the president told reporters in the Oval Office, when asked to respond to reports that the White House is planning to separate families again. ‘But it brings a lot more people to the border when you don’t do it.’”

The Army Corps of Engineers awarded a $789 million contract to the Galveston, Texas-based company, SLSCO Ltd., for ‘border replacement wall construction’ in Santa Teresa, N. M., near El Paso, Texas. Barnard Construction Co. Inc., of Bozeman, Mont., was awarded a contract worth $187 million for ‘design-bid-build construction project for primary pedestrian wall replacement’ in Yuma, Ariz. Both projects, announced on the Defense Department website, are slated for completion in fall 2020.”
Resignation of DHS acting deputy secretary continues shakeup - Fox News: “President Trump&apos;s high-level overhaul of the Department of Homeland Security continued on Tuesday, with the announcement that DHS&apos; acting deputy secretary is resigning amid a reported historic surge in illegal immigrants and asylum seekers at the border. Claire Grady was technically the next in line to replace Kirstjen Nielsen , who resigned Sunday. But Trump chose Kevin McAleenan , the head of Customs and Border Protection, as acting secretary. That meant Grady had to resign or be fired. Two officials with direct knowledge of the decision, speaking anonymously to The Associated Press, said Grady was pressed to quit. In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Nielsen said Grady had offered her resignation, writing that ‘her sound leadership and effective oversight have impacted every DHS office and employee and made us stronger as a Department.’”
MCCONNELL IS READY FOR NEW BUDGET PLAN
AP: “Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said Tuesday it’s time to kick off bipartisan talks on a new budget pact to fund federal agencies over the next two years. The Kentucky Republican told reporters that he spoke with President Donald Trump last week and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday morning, and that both support trying to reach an agreement on a new spending pact for both the Pentagon and domestic programs. ‘We’ve agreed to put together, at the staff level, a group to begin discussing the possibility of reaching a two-year (spending) caps deal so we can move ahead hopefully with some kind of regular appropriations process,’ McConnell told reporters. A new funding agreement is needed to prevent the return of spending cuts under the remnants of a failed 2011 budget and debt agreement. Trump has only reluctantly signed spending bills during his two years in office…”
GILLIBRAND SAYS SHE WAS WRONG ON IMMIGRATION
Politico: “Democratic presidential hopeful Kirsten Gillibrand on Tuesday confronted some of her previous stances on immigration, saying they ‘didn&apos;t care’ about the needs of diverse Americans. ‘When I was a member of Congress from upstate New York, I was really focused on the priorities of my district,’ the New York senator said during a CNN town hall. ‘When I became senator of the entire state, I recognized that some of my views really did need to change.’ Before becoming a senator in 2009, Gillibrand represented a largely Republican district in the House and expressed ideas on immigration — from blocking certain benefits for undocumented immigrants to establishing English as an official language — that have come back to haunt her as she seeks the Democratic nomination in 2020. Those old stances especially corrode her platform as the antithesis of President Donald Trump…”
She was also confronted about relationship with Hillary - Fox News: “New York senator and 2020 candidate Kirsten Gillibrand was awkwardly confronted Tuesday about her relationship with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after suggesting that her husband Bill Clinton should have resigned from office. Back in November 2017 during the early stages of the #MeToo movement, Gillibrand told The New York Times that it would have been an ‘appropriate response’ for former President Clinton to resign over his affair with Monica Lewinsky . ‘Things have changed today, and I think under those circumstances there should be a very different reaction,’ Gillibrand said at the time. … Gillibrand, who succeeded Clinton in the Senate and was a big supporter of her 2016 campaign, was confronted by CNN anchor Erin Burnett about their relationship during a televised town hall on Tuesday night.”

AS IN ‘HE’S AWARE THAT HE’S EATING GLUTEN’
The Takeout: “Gluten avoidance is one of those things that people sometimes poke fun at, even though for people with celiac disease, or those who are extremely allergic to gluten, it can be deadly serious. But many people also try to avoid gluten for more minor health reasons. Vancouver-based Earls restaurant, a chain with 20 restaurants in the U.S., was apparently just trying to address those differences on its menu, noting that its tacos were available with ‘gluten aware tortillas.’ Conservative pundit Matt Walsh then asked on Twitter, ‘What the hell is a ‘gluten aware tortilla’’? … ‘Gluten aware’ kind of rankles in an overly PC way. Maybe one of those ‘This gluten-free product is prepared in the same kitchen as gluten products’ disclaimers?’ Too long? Still, we suspect that people with celiac disease would likely be asking those important questions regardless.”

"Warren releases tax returns showing million-dollar income, moments after pitching wealth tax",www.foxnews.com,Paul Steinhauser,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/warren-releases-tax-returns,"The Democrat from Massachusetts used the release to once again highlight a bill she’s pushing that would mandate that the Internal Revenue Service publicly release the tax returns of the president, vice president, presidential candidates and federal officeholders. “I’ve put out eleven years of my tax returns because no one should ever have to guess who their elected officials are working for. Doing this should be law,” Warren said in a statement, in a likely jab at President Trump and possibly rival Bernie Sanders.
But the details of her high income also come as the candidate doubles down on calls to tax the rich. Warren’s campaign released the candidate’s returns minutes after the senator concluded a speech to a union crowd in the nation’s capital where she once again pushed for her proposal to tax ultra-wealthy Americans based on their assets.
“I’m in this fight for a wealth tax. A two percent tax on the 75 biggest fortunes in the country. Two percent. That’s all we’re asking,” the populist senator with a history of taking on Wall Street and big businesses highlighted as she addressed a gathering of the North America&apos;s Building Trades Unions.
“We could provide universal childcare for every working parent in America. Universal pre-K…. for every child and still have $2 trillion left over,” she explained.
The senator released her previous 10 years of tax returns last August.
Last month Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York became the first Democratic presidential contender to release tax returns.
Besides Sanders, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg are among those White House hopefuls who’ve yet to release their returns. But tax returns are not due to the IRS until next Monday, April 15.

FOX Sports South reporter Kelsey Wingert tweeted a video Wednesday showing several Braves players rejoicing next to firefighters who helped them get out of what appears to be a hotel elevator.
“In other news, half the team got stuck on an elevator after the game last night,” Wingert tweeted. “No Brave was hurt in the making of this video.”
It was unclear how many Braves players were exactly stuck in the elevator. Some social media users were quick to point out that the chamber looked more like a “clown car” than an elevator car, due to the numerous players who emerged from it.
Atlanta won the road game, 7-1, over Colorado.

"Texas Senate votes to raise smoking age to 21, exempting active military members",www.foxnews.com,Danielle Wallace,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-senate-raises-smoking-age-21-exempts-military-members,"The bill’s sponsor Sen. Joan Huffman (R-Houston) amended her own legislation to exempt active military members after receiving pushback from some Republicans who argued the law denied young adults who enlist in the military the freedom to choose to use tobacco products, The Dallas Morning News reported. Active U.S. military or state military force members between the ages of 18 and 20 will be permitted to purchase tobacco products if they present valid military identification, according to the revised bill.
The amendment allowed Huffman to secure more than the 19 votes required in the 31-member body to approve the proposed legislation. The revised version of Bill 21 passed the state Senate 20-11 without debate and will be sent to the House for approval.
""I want to thank Sen. Huffman for passing this important legislation for the children of Texas. Senate Bill 21 will save lives and is an investment in Texas&apos; future,” Texas’ Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a statement. ""Increasing the age to purchase tobacco products in Texas to 21 will not only improve public health and save countless lives, it will save Texans billions of dollars in health care costs.""
Texas 21, a coalition of groups that supports raising the legal age for tobacco products to 21, opposed the military service member amendment to Bill 21.
“Texas 21 will be working with legislators to help them understand the importance of including the military in tobacco 21 legislation,” Claudia Rodas of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids told The Dallas Morning News. “Our goal is a tobacco 21 law that protects all young Texans, including those who are willing to die to protect our country.”
Huffman recognized the coalition’s concern but said the law would be impractical for military members who have to move across state lines. The state senator recognized the importance of the legislation to protect young Texans from developing deadly smoking habits.
""While I understand it&apos;s still an issue in the military, these individuals are often required to move across state lines,"" Huffman told WFAA , adding she wanted to avoid any confusion.
""Ninety-five percent, 95 percent of adult smokers, begin smoking before they turn 21,"" Huffman told WFAA. ""Even more astounding is that three-quarters of adult smokers tried their first cigarette before the age of 18.""

The judge overseeing the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor who fatally shot the unarmed Australian Ruszczyk Damond, is restricting media and public access. Thirty-three-year-old Noor goes on trial Monday in the July 2017 death of Ruszcyzyk Damond. Judge Kathryn Quaintance ruled Friday, March 29, 2019, that potentially graphic evidence would be seen only by the jury, not the public or media. One media attorney says her ruling could be unconstitutional. (AP Photo/Amy Forliti, File) MINNEAPOLIS – The Latest on the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman who had called 911 to report a possible crime (all times local): 11:35 a.m.
A defense attorney for a Minneapolis police officer who fatally shot an unarmed woman who had called 911 to report a possible crime near her home says the officer and his partner wouldn't have known they were responding to a report about a possible sexual assault.
Recordings of the two 911 calls Justine Ruszczyk Damond made to dispatchers shortly before she died in July 2017 were played Wednesday during Mohamed Noor's trial on murder and manslaughter charges. Damond's voice drew an emotional reaction from her family in court.
Defense attorney Tom Plunkett said the officers would not have heard the 911 calls before going to investigate. He said they were told by dispatch that there was a report of a woman screaming behind a building.
During the 911 calls, Damond said she could hear someone in the alley behind her home and thought it might be a sexual assault.

12:05 a.m.
Prosecutors may introduce body camera video as early as Wednesday in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed an unarmed woman.
Mohamed Noor faces murder and manslaughter charges in the July 2017 death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond. Noor shot her when she approached his squad car minutes after she called 911 to report a possible sexual assault in the alley behind her home.
The body camera footage doesn't capture the shooting because Noor and his partner hadn't activated their cameras. But it does capture the aftermath as officers tried to save Damond.
The judge in the case sought to keep the media and public from seeing the footage, but she reversed herself after media outlets filed a legal challenge. Trending in US"
Texas moves to become next state to protect free speech on college campuses,www.foxnews.com,Andrew O'Reilly,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-moves-to-become-next-state-to-protect-free-speech-on-college-campuses,"A day before President Trump signed his executive order last month that threatened colleges with the loss of federal research funding if they don’t protect students’ free speech rights, the Texas Senate passed a bill prohibiting public universities from rejecting appearances by controversial figures. The legislation, which passed unanimously in the state Senate, would require all Texas colleges and universities to come up with more uniform policies regarding free speech as well as dole out disciplinary measures for any student who interferes with free speech activities on campus and set up a system for addressing free speech infringement complaints.
""Colleges and universities should provide the opportunity for students to hear others&apos; points of view in a free and unrestrained manner,"" Texas state Sen. Joan Huffman R-Houston, said in a statement. ""Senate Bill 18 is a direct result of the Committee&apos;s process of hearings and research toward that goal. This bill was constructed in an objective, non-partisan manner and will be applied equally to all groups and points of view.""
The bill, which enjoys the support of Texas’ Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, has been referred to the Higher Education Committee in the Texas House, where it awaits a hearing.
Video The nationwide debate over the recent attacks on free speech on college campuses across the country has largely been driven by conservative activists and lawmakers, but both sides of the political divide have been affected by campus policies, or the lack thereof.
Three days after SB 18 passed through the state senate, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s presidential campaign was barred from handing out flyers on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin. This follows a 2017 incident where Texas A&M University was threatened with a lawsuit for cancelling a rally featuring white nationalist Richard Spencer and another one that year when Texas Southern University halted a speech by conservative state Rep. Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, after disruptions by protestors.
Across the country, colleges and universities have been grappling with how to handle free speech issues in an extremely polarizing political environment. The University of California, Berkeley – a traditional hotbed of campus activism – has been thrust into the center of the debate amid violent protests and disruptions during appearances by right-wing speakers.
In February 2017, 150 leftist black-clad protesters rampaged through Berkeley’s campus, where they caused $100,000 worth of damage, beat students and forced the University of California to cancel a planned speech by right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.
Video Later that year, a group of around 100 hooded members of Antifa stormed what had been a largely peaceful rally for free speech in the town of Berkeley and attacked at least five people, including the leader of a politically conservative group that had canceled an event a day earlier in San Francisco to avoid potential violence.
“I can see this popping up more and more,” Roy Gutterman, the director of Tully Center for Free Speech at Syracuse University, told Fox News . “It would be reasonable to see similar suits popping up with the events in Charlottesville.""
Gutterman was referring to the 2017 rally in opposition to the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee on the campus of the University of Virginia that turned violent as white supremacists and neo-Nazis clashed with counterprotestors. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed when James Alex Fields Jr. drove a 2010 Dodge Challenger into a crowd on a pedestrian mall.
Video So far, Kentucky, South Dakota, Tennessee, Colorado, Iowa, and Arkansas – all Republican-heavy states – have passed legislation similar to the one being discussed in Texas.
The unrest on college campuses has become a major concern for the current White House administration, with Trump frequently bringing it up in speeches.
Shortly before signing his executive order, the president brought Hayden Williams, a conservative activist who was attacked while working a recruitment table on campus in Berkeley, on stage during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February.
“He took a punch for all of us,” Trump said of Williams . “And we could never allow that to happen. And here is, in closing with Hayden, here’s the good news. He’s going to be a wealthy young man.”
“If they want our dollars, and we give it to them by the billions, they’ve got to allow people like Hayden and many other great young people and old people to speak,” Trump said. “Free speech. If they don’t, it will be costly.”

Fulham soccer fan sues California DMV over ‘Come on You Whites’ vanity plate,www.foxnews.com,Lucia Suarez Sang,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/fulham-soccer-fan-sues-california-dmv-over-come-on-you-whites-vanity-plate,"Jon Kotler, a lawyer and constitutional scholar at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalist, has been an avid fan of the London-based soccer club for years, diligently watching as they battled to re-enter the Premier League over the 2017-2018 season. Inspired by their triumph, Kotler applied for a vanity plate to proudly proclaim his loyalty to the club by using an acronym for the team’s slogan, “Come on You Whites,” or “COYW.”

The California DMV rejected the proposed plate, claiming that the abbreviation could have “racial overtones,” and carry “connotations offensive to good taste and decency.”
Kotler claims in a lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles that the department’s rejection of his personalized license plate violated his First Amendment rights – specifically his freedom of speech.

""You can&apos;t allow bureaucrats to make decisions that are fundamental to what it means to be an American, and our free speech is one of those things,"" Kotler said in a news release . ""As I tell my students, ours is the only constitution in the world that protects its citizens against their own government. When the government starts to infringe on our rights, that&apos;s when the individual citizen must speak up. If we don’t, we’ll get what we deserve and will have only ourselves to blame.""
The Department of Motor Vehicles said Tuesday that it does not comment on pending lawsuits.

(AP Photo/Richard Vogel)
In its rejection letter to Kotler, the Department of Motor Vehicles acknowledged the difficulties in balancing ""an individual&apos;s constitutional right to free speech and expression while protecting the sensibilities of all segments of our population.""
""I sent them tons of material,"" Kotler told the BBC . ""Press releases, stories from the British media, letters from the chairman who uses &apos;come on you whites&apos;.”
He added: “I pointed out that many clubs in Britain are known by their color - the blues, the clarets. Nobody thought the Liverpool reds were communists. Even when I did it, it was the furthest thing from my mind that anyone would object to it. I was shocked, absolutely.""
The 78-year-old, who was born in New Jersey and now lives in Calabasas, California, told the BBC that he has been a fan of Fulham FC for decades after watching a match “by happenstance” during a visit to London.
He said he travels to see the team play in Britain an average of around eight to 10 times a season – often taking the 11-hour flight on a Thursday and returning back to the U.S. by Tuesday for classes.
Kotler&apos;s suit asks the court to declare the Department of Motor Vehicles&apos; criteria for personalized license plates unconstitutional. He also wants the department to pay his court costs.
According to Los Angeles Magazine , the California DMV receives hundreds of thousands of vanity license plates applications – nearly 250,000 were fielded by the department in 2018.
The department employs four full-time workers to sort through the applications and eliminate any that may trigger the DMV’s standard of “good taste and decency.”
In a 1973 case, the California Court of Appeals upheld the Department of Motor Vehicles&apos; standard in rejecting a plaintiff&apos;s claim that his free speech was violated when the department rejected his requested license plate, ""EZ LAY.""
Constitutional scholar David L. Hudson said courts are often split in cases claiming censorship over personalized plates.
""It appears in this case that the government has engaged in regrettable censorship of Mr. Kotler&apos;s speech,"" said Hudson, who teaches at Tennessee&apos;s Belmont University and is a fellow at the Freedom Forum Institute. ""To me, courts should be very sensitive to viewpoint discrimination and should err on the side of protecting the individual&apos;s speech from government censorship.""
Kotler is being represented pro bono by the libertarian-leaning nonprofit Pacific Legal Foundation. The group criticized the Department of Motor Vehicles&apos; ""attempt to make itself the speech police"" in a statement announcing the lawsuit.
""You can call Jon a sports fan or a First Amendment expert, but the DMV&apos;s misguided efforts to regulate license plates have misbranded Jon as a racist,"" the foundation said.
