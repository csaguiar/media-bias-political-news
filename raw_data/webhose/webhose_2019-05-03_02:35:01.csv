Ichthys LNG Terminal is an LNG terminal in Western Australia, Australia. [1] Ichthys LNG is named after the Ichthys offshore gas and condensate field in western Australia.
Ichthys LNG is one of the most expensive liquefied natural gas projects in history. [2] Seventy per cent of the gas was slated to go to Japan. [3]
In 2008 Ichthys original budget was about $20 billion. [4] In May 2017 it was $37 billion and counting. [2]
Ichthys was approved in 2011. Construction on Ichthys began in 2012. It is slated to start-up in 2017. [5] The West Australian reported in September 2017 that 8,500 people are working just to complete the onshore facility at Darwin. [6]
Ichthys has a massive infrastructure. It has two Korean built floating offshore platforms. The gas fields off the Kimberly will feed the LNG. Broome's port and industrial one, 450 miles away, will provide significant support. [6]
In July 2017 CBS News reported that Ichthys LNG may possess a major crack in the floating production storage and offloading unit that could cost billions. [2]
Reuters reported in October 2017 that Wheatstone LNG Terminal in Western Australia is the sixth out of eight projects in a $200 billion Australian LNG construction boom with two more facilities to be launched. The two remaining are Shell’s Prelude Floating LNG Terminal and Ichthys LNG Terminal. [7]
As of 2017, Australia is the second largest LNG exporter after Qatar. The country exports almost 44 million tons a year. [8]
In 2017 it was discovered that the petroleum resource rent tax had failed to collect billions of dollars in revenue north-west Australia. According to research at Monash University, Wheatstone LNG Terminal , Pluto LNG Terminal , and Ichthys LNG Terminal are not subect to commonwealth royalities. [9]
The terminal began commercial operations in November 2018. [10] Environment
In 2015 The Guardian reported that Australia’s top 20 emitting facilities include the Wheatstone LNG Terminal , Gorgon LNG Terminal , Ichthys LNG Terminal, and Pluto LNG Terminal . [11]
ABC News reported in March 2016 that Ichthys had tried to renege on $30 million worth of its environmental offset programs designed to help mitigate the environmental damage of the LNG. [3]
Government approval was conditional on the company delivering $91 million of environmental offset projects over the projects 40-year estimated life. The company had hoped to dump some of its marine life and land commitments. Ichthys had originally agreed to a joint program with Aboriginal rangers to manage dugong, coastal dolphins and turtles program along the coast. [3]
The company claimed that new studies showed that the environmental effects were not as great as originally anticipated, therefore some offset programs could be dropped. [3] Articles and resources"

Note: mtpa = million tonnes per year; bcfd = billion cubic feet per day Background
Gorgon LNG Terminal is an LNG terminal in Western Australia, Australia. [1] The LNG terminal is a part of the Gorgon gas project, which includes the Greater Gorgon gas fields, subsea gas gathering infrastructure, and the Gorgon LNG Terminal. [2] A proposed Stage Two of the Gorgon gas project would upgrade existing subsea gas gathering to maintain supply to existing LNG Trains. In 2017, the proposed Stage Two was moved into the Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) stage. [3]
In December 2015 the company cut 1,200 jobs from the Gorgon LNG project. [4]
In 2017 a resource tax expert announced that the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) had failed to collect billions of dollars in revenue in northwest Australia. According to the research, the Turnbull government should reintroduce royalties for natural gas projects off northwest Australia, or the Gorgon plant may not pay taxes until 2030 despite being in operation for years. The Gorgon project would raise five billion in tax revenue by 2030 if royalties were reintroduced. [5]
Reuters reported in October 2017 that the LNG market will be sharply focused on how Wheatstone LNG Terminal progresses since going online in 2017 following the troubled beginnings at Chevron’s larger Gorgon LNG Terminal. Natural gas fields offshore of Western Australia feed both Gorgon and Wheatstone. [6]
As of 2017, Australia is the second largest LNG exporter after Qatar. The country exports almost 44 million tons a year. [7] Carbon Capture and Storage (CSS)
In 2015 The Guardian reported that Australia’s top 20 emitting facilities include the Wheatstone LNG Terminal , Gorgon LNG Terminal, Ichthys LNG Terminal , and Pluto LNG Terminal . [8]
This facility is estimated to generate 0.27 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) for every metric ton of LNG produced according to a 2013 report. [9]
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), or carbon sequestration, is a means of separating out carbon dioxide when burning fossil fuels, collecting it and subsequently “dumping” it underground or in the sea. CCS is an integrated concept consisting of three distinct components: CO 2 capture, transport and storage (including measurement, monitoring and verification). All three components are currently found in industrial operation today, although mostly not for the purpose of CO 2 storage.
A consultancy report for an Australian government agency highlighted that CCS would impose additional demands on finite water supplies. ""Issues related to water availability and carbon dioxide emissions present long term challenges for electricity generators. This is because water-cooled, low-emission, thermal power plants are likely to be significantly more water intensive than current coal-fired power plants. For example, coal-fired power plants incorporating carbon capture and storage (CCS) could be one-quarter to one-third more water intensive,"" the report states. [10]
As of 2011 Australia was to host to six large-scale integrated project (LSIP)s. [11]
Summer 2017, Gorgon LNG began its $2 billion carbon capture and storage (CSS) project. The C02 will be compressed at Barrow Island. The CO2 injection wells will also be located on the Island. It is expected to be operational by the end of 2017. [12] Articles and resources"

Note: mtpa = million tonnes per year; bcfd = billion cubic feet per day Background
Gladstone LNG Terminal is an LNG terminal on Curtis Island in Queensland, Australia on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef. [1] It converts coal-seam gas into LNG. [2] Curtis Island's three plants Australia Pacific LNG Terminal , Gladstone LNG Terminal, Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal are worth $70 billion. [3]
On October 22, 2010, the Australian federal government gave conditional approval to two major coal seam gas projects in central Queensland. Environment Minister Tony Burke announced that his department had given conditional environmental approvals for Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas (GLNG) - a $16 billion joint venture between Santos, Malaysia's Petronas, and France's Total - and BG Group's Queensland Curtis LNG. [4]
Industry-wide, LNG expansion hit some snags. In 2015 Australia’s geology research agency, Geoscience Australia, wrote in a report to the Council of Australian Governments Energy Council, that Australia's LNG reserves exceeded requirements. [2]
In 2016 Geoscience Australia claimed proven and estimated reserves held by Gladstone’s three LNG plants had decreased 5% in 2016 to 29.6 trillion cubic feet, largely caused by a drop at the Gladstone LNG plant. Consultant EnergyQuest reported in January 2017 that substantial coal-seam gas reserves to Gladstone LNG have yet to demonstrated commercial viability. [2]
In 2016 Santos announced a write-down of the value of Gladstone LNG by $1.5 billion. Previously Santos inflated the value of its assets. [5]
In June 2017, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) predicted liquefaction trains at Gladstone LNG would stop production in two years. [6]
Analysts from the Petroleum Economist predicted in July 2017 that two of the Curtis Island plants, Gladstone LNG Terminal and Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal , would likely operate below capacity until global demand exceeds supply. [7]
In 2017, the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull announced April that gas prices should halve as a result of new LNG export restrictions. Gas export restrictions are expected to have the biggest impact on Gladstone. [8]
As of 2017, Australia is the second largest LNG exporter after Qatar. The country exports almost 44 million tons a year. [9] Environmental Concerns
Dredging to widen and deepen the Port of Gladstone to allow for several LNG projects in the port caused some ocean turbidity and possible damage to wildlife and the fishing industry. [10]
In 2011 the Queensland Government announced it will close up to 311 square miles (500 square kilometers) of Queensland coast to fishing. At the same time, the government warned that seafood should not be handled or eaten. [10]
Divisions emerged over whether dredging caused these issues. [10] The release of acid sulphate from dredging may have damaged and killed turtles and fish. Fishermen had been warning about problems since October 2010. Thirty percent of the catch was infected for a month during August and September 2011. [10]
Bloomberg published an article in 2017 citing Curtis Island's three plants in Australia ( Australia Pacific LNG Terminal , Gladstone LNG Terminal, Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal ) as an example of having exorbitant infrastructure duplication that it could have saved $10 billion on the combined $70 billion LNG projects. The three LNGs built separate jetties that now crowd the coastal land. Shared facilities could have produced the same amount of fuel with less damage to the coast. [11]
This facility is estimated to generate 0.35 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) for every metric ton of LNG produced according to a 2013 report. [12] Coal Seam Environmental Concerns
In December 2014, Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal‎‎ became the world's first project to turn coal seam gas into LNG for export. Curtis Island's two other LNG plants, Australia Pacific LNG Terminal and Gladstone LNG Terminal also convert coal seam gas into LNG. [13]
Coal seam gas projects in Australia are not without controversy.
Coal seam gas (abbreviated ""CSG"") is formed by the geological process of heating and compressing plant matter to create coal. Over millions of years, methane forms within the coal. The methane is trapped by water in the gaps and cracks between the coal molecules. These gaps are known as cleats. Australia has been found to have many deposits, and is increasingly mining them through hydraulic fracturing , also known as fracking . [14]
CSG is a form of coalbed methane (CBM), or coalbed gas, and is a type of natural gas extracted from coal beds. In recent decades it has become an increasingly used source of energy in Australia, as well as the United States, Canada, and other countries. [14] Articles and resources"

Note: mtpa = million tonnes per year; bcfd = billion cubic feet per day Background
Fishermans Landing LNG Terminal was a proposed LNG terminal in Queensland, Australia. The project is proposed by Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd. (LNGL). [1]
LNGL secured a 24-hectare site on the mainland via a 20-year lease from Gladstone Ports Corp. Ltd. with two 5-year extension options. The site was directly opposite the three existing LNG plants on Curtis Island and the company planned an initial development based on two trains of 1.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) each. LNGL had hopes of eventually moving up to four trains for a total capacity of 7 mtpa. [2]
In May 2017, Perth-based Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd. (LNGL) announced plans to abandon the Fishermans Landing LNG project. After a number of years without any success in securing the long-term gas supplies needed to proceed with construction, LNGL has decided to no longer fund the costs associated with maintaining the site and close the project down.

The Darwin LNG Terminal is an onshore LNG terminal in Northern Territory, Australia. [1] It has one liquefaction and purification train, a 311 mile (500 kilometre) offshore facility, and a subsea pipeline from Bayu-Undan field in the East Timor Sea to Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory. [2]
Construction began in June 2003. The plant was officially commissioned in January 2006. According to the company website, since 2006, an average of one cargo per week has been shipped to its Tokyo Electric and Tokyo Gas customers. [3]
As of 2017, Australia is the second largest LNG exporter after Qatar. The country exports almost 44 million tons a year. [4] Expansion Plans
Darwin LNG is trying to find new sources of gas. Multiple options are being considered. [5]
According to the International Gas Union's 2017 report, because of declining natural gas feedstock, Darwin considered backfilling existing liquefaction and purification trains instead of building more expansion trains. [6] Darwin has not halted plans for train expansion. In April 2017, the company announced it would conduct a feasibility study to asses whether a second train should be added to the facility. The Northern Territory government will contribute 40% of the feasibility study cost. ConocoPhillips and upstream resource owners, Evans Shoal, Caldita-Barossa, Poseidon, Cash Maple and Bonaparte LNG Terminal 's offshore facility, will fund the remaining 60%. [7]
Woodside and ConocoPhillips, operators of Australia’s two oldest LNG plants, Darwin LNG Terminal and North West Shelf LNG Terminal are considering cheaper development options for their Browse and Barossa gas fields to compete against Qatar. Qatar added to the fears of Australia’s LNG owners in July 2017 when it announced a 23 million ton-a-year increase in gas exports. [8]
ConocoPhillips owns 37.5 percent of the Barossa gas field. The company prefers Barossa gas to feed the Darwin LNG Terminal. [8]
A floating facility approimately 186 miles north of Darwin would extract and send gas to the already built Bayu-Undan to Darwin pipeline through a 162 mile long pipeline.
In 2023 production of 3.7 million tons of LNG and 1.5 million barrels of condensate a year is expected to begin. This is enough gas to completely supply the Darwin LNG plant and last for 20 years.
Basic engineering is expected to begin in 2018.
In February 2018 it was reported that Santos was considering exporting Bonaparte Basin gas through the Darwin terminal.

AGL has proposed a US$250 million LNG import terminal in Australia, nominating Crib Point as its preferred location. The gas import jetty purports to increase gas supply for south-eastern Australia. It plans for construction in 2019 and operation by 2021. [1] This would involve the redevelopment of an existing jetty to import 100 petajoules a year of LNG, enough to supply all the residential demand for the state of Victoria. [2]
In October 2018 the government of Victoria asked AGL for a full environmental assessment of the project, delaying the projected completion date by at least a year. [3] Import/Export Controversy
As of 2017, Australia is the second largest LNG exporter after Qatar. The country exports almost 44 million tons a year. [4]
AGL is planning the import facility despite Australia being one of the world’s largest LNG exporters; the country exports so much gas that domestic supply has tightened. According to IEEFA, AGL’s investment in an import terminal is a bet by the company that Australian domestic gas prices will stay high enough in the future to cover the cost of liquefying foreign gas and shipping it to Australia. [1]
East Coast gas producers could be competing with imported gas if Crib Point is constructed. Santos and Cooper Energy are insistent that enough gas could supply Australia from Australian sources. [2]
Woodside CEO said in August 2017 it would not be financially prudent to ship LNG directly from either Western Australia or from Darwin to Crib Point in Victoria because tankers would need an all-Australian crews. This would cost more than bringing in gas from outside Australia. [2] Articles and resources References"

Browse LNG Terminal was a proposed LNG terminal in the Dampier Peninsula, in the Kimberley, Western Australia. [3]
The terminal was proposed for construction at James Price Point, 52 kilometres (32 mi) North of Broome on the Dampier Peninsula, Western Australia. [4] The onshore project was abandoned after Australia's rising gas costs made the project unviable. In 2013 the project was to be developed as a floating LNG facility with minimal construction work to be undertaken in Australia. [5]
The Browse FLNG partners put the $30 billion Browse floating LNG project on hold in 2016. [6]
Reuters reported in 2017 about the general trend for cheaper alternatives to FLNG. FLNG were popular in the early 2010s when gas demand and prices rose, and before the US shale boom pushed down gas prices. Approximately 8.6 billion cubic feet per day of U.S. gas is estimated to enter the market by 2020. FLNGs also face massive costs of building a tanker that is a fraction of the size of onshore facilities. [7]
The International Gas Union reports Browse FLNG partners are considering smaller-scale options. [6]
While FLNG remains an option, Woodside makes the case to that bringing gas from Browse gas field and the southeastern Scarborough field into existing onshore facilities. Then expanded those facilities. [7]
As of 2017, Australia is the second largest LNG exporter after Qatar. The country exports almost 44 million tons a year. [8] Opposition
Several Aboriginal groups claim ownership over the Dampier Peninsula including the Goolarabooloo, Jabirr Jabirr, Ngumbarl, Nimanbur, and Nyul Nyul. [9]

Bonaparte LNG Terminal is a proposed floating LNG terminal in Western Australia. [1] Plans for building Bonaparte LNG coincided with the development and production of Petrel, Tern and Frigate gas fields in the Bonaparte basin in the Timor Sea. The Bonaparte basin one of the main natural gas-producing regions in Australia.
In June 14, 2014 Bonaparte LNG announced it would likely drop plans for a floating facility that would ship gas back to land from the Bonaparte basin and instead opt for a more traditional pipeline from Bonaparte LNG approximately (155 miles (250 kilometers) inland to onshore on the town of Darwin. [2]
Reuters reported in 2017 about the general trend for cheaper alternatives to FLNG. FLNG were popular in the early 2010s when gas demand and prices rose, and before the US shale boom pushed down gas prices. Approximately 8.6 billion cubic feet per day of U.S. gas is estimated to enter the market by 2020. FLNGs also face massive costs of building a tanker that is a fraction of the size of onshore facilities. [3]
Santos Bonaparte LNG is one of several an upstream owners of Darwin LNG Terminal .
As of 2017, Australia is the second largest LNG exporter after Qatar. The country exports almost 44 million tons a year. [4]
In February 2018 it was reported that Santos was considering exporting Bonaparte Basin gas through the Darwin terminal. [5] With no progress since 2014, the Bonaparte LNG Terminal appears to be cancelled. Articles and resources"

Note: mtpa = million tonnes per year; bcfd = billion cubic feet per day Background
Australia Pacific LNG Terminal is an LNG terminal in Curtis Island in Queensland, Australia on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef. [1] Curtis Island's three plants (Australia Pacific LNG Terminal, Gladstone LNG Terminal , Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal ) are worth $70 billion. [2]
As of 2017, Australia is the second largest LNG exporter after Qatar. The country exports almost 44 million tons a year. [3] According to the company website, Australia Pacific LNG is the largest producer of natural gas sourced from coal seams in eastern Australia. [4]
The facility took five years to construct. In 2016, it began commercial operation and shipped its first cargo. [5] Environmental Concerns
Dredging to widen and deepen the Port of Gladstone to allow for several LNG projects in the port caused some ocean turbidity and possible damage to wildlife and the fishing industry. [6]
In 2011, the Queensland Government announced it would close up to 311 square miles (500 square kilometers) of Queensland coast to fishing. At the same time the government warned citizens that seafood should not be handled or eaten. [6]
Divisions emerged over whether dredging caused these issues. The release of acid sulphate from dredging may have damaged and killed turtles and fish. Fishermen had been warning about problems since October 2010. Thirty percent of the catch was infected for a month during August and September 2011. [6]
Bloomberg published an article in 2017 citing Curtis Island's three plants in Australia (Australia Pacific LNG Terminal, Gladstone LNG Terminal , Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal ) as an example of infrastructure duplication, and estimating that $10 billion of the combined $70 billion cost of the LNG projects could have been saved. The three LNGs built separate jetties that now crowd the coastal land. Shared facilities, pipelines, and roads could have produced the same amount of fuel with less damage to the coast. [7]
This facility is estimated to generate between 0.30 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) for every metric ton of LNG produced according to a 2013 report. [8] Coal Seam Environmental Concerns
In December 2014, Queensland Curtis LNG became the world's first project to turn coal seam gas into LNG for export. Curtis Island's two other LNG plants, Queensland Curtis LNG Terminal and Gladstone LNG Terminal also convert coal seam gas into LNG. [9]
Coal seam gas projects in Australia are not without controversy. Coal seam gas (abbreviated ""CSG"") is formed by the geological process of heating and compressing plant matter to create coal. Over millions of years, methane forms within the coal. The methane is trapped by water in the gaps and cracks between the coal molecules. These gaps are known as cleats. Australia has been found to have many deposits, and is increasingly mining them through hydraulic fracturing , also known as fracking . [10]
CSG is a form of coalbed methane (CBM), or coalbed gas, and is a type of natural gas extracted from coal beds. In recent decades it has become an increasingly used source of energy in Australia, as well as the United States, Canada, and other countries. [10]
Australian green groups and farmers have raised concerns about coal seam gas development. In May 2010 four toxic chemicals - benzene , toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) - were discovered in eight exploration wells owned by the Australia Pacific LNG Terminal in the Surat Basin. But the Queensland Government has ruled out a moratorium on the industry. [11] Articles and resources"

"Michael Cohen Sharing 'Additional Information' To Federal Investigators, Lawyer Lanny Davis Says | HillReporter.com",hillreporter.com,Chris Walker,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://hillreporter.com/michael-cohen-sharing-additional-information-to-federal-investigators-lawyer-lanny-davis-says-29611,"BY Chris Walker April 3, 2019
Michael Cohen, who once worked for President Donald Trump as his personal “fixer” lawyer, hasn’t been heard from publicly since special counsel Robert Mueller submitted his final report on the Russia investigation to Attorney General William Barr last month. Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images
Cohen’s own lawyer, Lanny Davis, recently revealed that his client, who agreed to a plea deal with Mueller on charges of lying to Congress last fall in exchange for becoming a cooperating witness in his investigation, had even more to say, and was presently cooperating with additional investigations beyond the office of the special counsel.
Davis, who was interviewed by MSNBC’s Ari Melber on Tuesday, explained that aspects of Mueller’s report, which were detailed in a letter from Barr to Congress, left him taken aback.
Davis was “a bit surprised that [Mueller] allowed Mr. Barr to misstate his report without his getting his own characterizations out first,” he said.
New: Michael Cohen advisor @LannyDavis responds to no chargeable collusion
""I believe Michael Cohen has a story to tell about what he told Mr. Mueller that leads to strong inferences of knowledge about the Trump Tower meeting, which was by definition collusion"" pic.twitter.com/5mJtv3n9lR
— TheBeat w/Ari Melber (@TheBeatWithAri) April 2, 2019
On the issue of Trump or members of his inner circle committing a crime of collusion with a foreign government, Davis said there’s still a lot we don’t understand without the full Mueller report being released.
“We don’t know what the level of proof [is] necessary to at least accuse a president of the United States of the crime of colluding with a foreign government. And that is a high standard,” Davis said.
He added that Cohen’s knowledge of Trump’s activities demonstrated that there were some questionable actions being carried out behind-the-scenes.
“I believe Michael Cohen has a story to tell, about what he told Mr. Mueller, that leads to strong inferences of knowledge about the Trump Tower meeting, which was by definition collusion,” Davis said, referring to a meeting that took place between the president’s son Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and campaign chairman Paul Manafort, along with a Russian lawyer who has deep ties to the Kremlin.
Davis also acknowledged that his client wasn’t done providing investigators in other jurisdictions beyond the special counsel’s office— namely, the Southern District of New York — with additional information he was able to retrieve since his recent statements to Congress .
“Mr. Cohen is fully cooperating with the Southern District of New York and is offering more information that he’s now discovered when he’s retrieved back his cell phones and other documents from the Southern District,” Davis said.
Melber asked if this included “evidence beyond what [Cohen] laid out in his Congressional testimony?”
“That is correct, and he also has additional information for the Southern District involving criminal behavior that needs to be looked into,” Davis confirmed. Follow Us On: Facebook and Twitter Previous Post "

Government backs developers with £300,000 funding
The government has unveiled two apps it claims will “revolutionise” the way students are given advice on careers and further education.
The apps, the development of each of was supported by £150,000 in funding from the Department for Education’s Open Data Competition, are available from this week. Both are now in open beta phase and can be downloaded from the developers’ websites.
The ThinkUni application, created by AccessEd , aims to help potential university applicants collate information on institutions, courses, and costs. Related content DfE seeks digital partner to help it ‘transform from a policy to a delivery department’
TheWayUp!, meanwhile, is published by The Profs . The app offers a “game for students to simulate different graduate career paths to help them make better choices about their future”. It will be particularly useful, the government said, in helping “students from disadvantaged backgrounds set aspirational educational and career goals”.
Universities minister Chris Skidmore said: “The importance of choosing where and what you study at university cannot be overstated – it will impact the rest of your professional and personal life. We have made more information available about institutions and outcomes than ever before, but sometimes the sheer amount of data can be daunting for students to navigate. We want to make it easier and fairer for them to access the information they need to make good higher education and career choices.
He added: “That’s why we’ve turned to the power of technology and funded two new apps, empowering students and ensuring they are well equipped to make these life-changing decisions which will help them succeed.”

Government implements open standards for cyberthreat intelligence,www.publictechnology.net,sam.trendall,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/government-implements-open-standards-cyberthreat-intelligence,"Government implements open standards for cyberthreat intelligence Written by Sam Trendall on 3
Users must adopt TAXII 2 and STIX 2 to analyse and share data on attacks
The government has revealed details of its new standards for departments to share data on cyberthreats.
The Open Standards Board – an independent advisory body for the Cabinet Office – has concluded a process for selecting standards to be applied to the use of “cyberthreat intelligence systems”.
The Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX 2) standard has been selected for the creation and analysis of cyberthreat intelligence information. The Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII 2) standard will cover the transfer of data between organisations.
According to newly published guidance, the two standards will help users convert cyberthreat intelligence information “to a machine-readable format”. Their implementation will also permit increased automation, the government believes.
“This increases the capability for machine-to-machine automated information exchange. This speeds up the threat response and also makes the intelligence more readable for users,” the guidance said. Related content NCSC picks IoT, cloud, and cryptojacking among UK plc’s biggest future threats
STIX 2 and TAXII 2 must now be adopted by any civil service users wishing “to analyse and share intelligence between government departments, industry and international partners”. Core users are likely to include security and cyber analysts, and security system administrators.
STIX 2 is a language and data format designed to “describe cyberthreat intelligence in a repeatable way” and thereby reduce the need for users to replicate documents in multiple formats.
To adhere to the standard, analysis information provided by users must cover at least of 12 specified “domain objects”: attack patterns; campaigns; course of action; identity; indicator; intrusion set; malware; observed data; report; threat actor; tool; and vulnerability. Detail must also be provided on either “relationship” or “sighting” of the cyberthreat in question.
TAXII 2, meanwhile, is a communications protocol that allows users to “share timely intelligence with relevant user groups in a standardised format”. Its adoption across government is intended to reduce the need for information to be sent via email.
Users can employ a restful API to adopt the standard. They can also create a TAXII Collection – which is “an interface to a logical collection of cyber threat intelligence” – or make use of a TAXII Channel, in which “a publish-subscribe model” allows users to exchange data, according to the guidance .
“Other governments already use STIX 2 and TAXII 2,” the document added. “Security technology suppliers are also starting to use these standards. Wider use of these standards makes it easier to share analysis of threat intelligence.
“These standards provide a way to link indicators of compromise – evidence of a cyberattack – to tactics, techniques and procedures… This will allow you to: identify the source of a cyberattack; increase the view of the threats your organisation faces; [and] link previously unassociated events.”
Chaired by Government Digital Service design chief John Strudwick, The Open Standards Board is comprised of 11 experts drawn from across government, industry, and academia. It was formed by the Public Expenditure Committee (Efficiency Reform), an entity which emerged from the 2014 closure of the joint Cabinet Office-Treasury Efficiency Reform Group. About the author

Department seeks leaders for mobility, networks, hosting, and service management
HM Revenue and Customs is offering an annual salary of £115,000 apiece for four new technology leaders.
The quartet are being recruited to support “bold plans to transform our IT and digital services”, the department said. They will join HMRC’s chief digital and information office, led by CDIO Jacky Wright.
The four roles on offer are: head of mobility and workplace; head of networks; head of service management and operations management; and head of Crown Hosting – enterprise cloud services.
A major part of the remit the new mobility chief will be to implement strategy and direct investment in support of the goal of moving the department to “an evergreen-based environment”.
The concept of evergreen IT first emerged about 10 years ago. The idea is to, effectively, permanently eliminate legacy technology through continuous incremental investments and iterative deployment of up-to-date programs. Shifting from manual to automated processes is another cornerstone of evergreen IT.
The head of networks will also support the move towards evergreen IT, as well as assuming overall responsibility “for the design, architecture and overall performance” of LAN and wireless network infrastructure. Related content HMRC digital tax platform ‘remains on track’ for April deadline
The Crown Hosting head will be expected to “lead the cultural change to introduce new ways of working”, as well as driving adoption of Crown Hosting services and expansion of existing deployments across HMRC.
Established in 2015 as a joint venture between the government and hosting firm Ark Data Centres, Crown Hosting offers public sector customers datacentre space on hosting contracts of up to seven years in length. Its aim is to help organisations move away from legacy systems and “pivot” towards a cloud environment.
The head of service management post comes with a responsibility to oversee the running of a round-the-clock operations centre “monitoring all CDIO services including services provided by third parties”.
The roles could be based at one or more of five HMRC locations around the UK: Newcastle upon Tyne; Telford; Edinburgh; Leeds and Liverpool. Applications for all of them are open until 21 April, with interviews due to take place during the week commencing 6 May. Each comes with an estimated salary of up to £115,000 per annum.
In an introduction to the candidate information packs, CDIO Wright said: “HMRC is becoming one of the most digital organisations in the UK and the plan is to be much bolder: by 2020 we will be one of the most digitally-advanced tax authorities in the world. We’re creating a dynamic, agile technology organisation that works on two levels: we want the most amazing experience for customers and citizens, both internal and external; and we are building careers that are rewarding and enjoyable for all of us. We will invest a lot of effort in your learning, development and career path.”
She added: “We have a massive challenge: we need to bring in more tax, reduce costs and improve the experience for customers. To do this, we’re using smart data analysis and innovative IT systems to ensure that customers get their tax affairs right from the outset - and we’re radically improving the technology we use to do our work.” About the author

An Economist Walks Into a Brothel: What Prostitutes and Big-Wave Surfers Can Teach Us About Risk,reason.com,Nick Gillespie,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/reasontv/2019/04/03/an-economist-walks-into-a-brotheland-lea,"If you think that all economists spend most of their time sitting at a desk plotting supply and demand curves, you haven't met Allison Schrager, author of the new book An Economist Walks Into a Brothel .
As her title promises, she visited the Moonlite Bunny Ranch in Nevada to learn how sex workers and their clients manage the risks that come even with legal prostitution. A Ph.D. economist who writes for Quartz , Schrager traveled the country to see how people in high-risk, high-reward fields such as horse breeding, candid celebrity photography, professional poker, and big-wave surfing assess and manage risk. The result is a compelling blend of first-person reporting and high-level economic analysis that gives individuals a new way not to avoid risk, but to make more-informed choices.
""People should feel more comfortable taking risks,"" Schrager tells Nick Gillespie. ""We don't really give people the tools to feel comfortable with risk taking, but you really do need to take risks to make your life move forward and any aspect of your life, [whether] it's a relationship or your job."" Their aren't any guarantees in life, she explains, but there are definitely smarter and dumber ways to take risks.

Who is Developer Les Otten?,indepthnh.org,Nancy West,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://indepthnh.org/2019/04/03/who-is-developer-les-otten/,"Who is Developer Les Otten? By PAULA TRACY, InDepthNH.org | Subscribe to Business & Economy The Balsams' website An artist's rendering of what the expanded ski area at The Balsams would look like in Dixville Notch with Dixville Peak the highest point. The plan includes a gondola going from the resort across Route 26 and up to a bowl area, with a lodge mid-mountain, accessing more than 1,200 acres of skiing. The resort would use water from the Androscoggin River for snowmaking and has already been permitted. At full build-out, the ski area would be the largest in the Northeast.
By PAULA TRACY, InDepthNH.org
DIXVILLE – Balsams developer Les Otten – who is looking forward to his 70 th birthday – has been known as a man with a vision since graduating from Ithaca College in 1971 with a degree in business administration.
Otten went to work in lift maintenance at Killington after college and at age 23, the Teaneck, N.J., native was sent by Killington’s owner, Preston Leete Smith, to work at his newest asset, Sunday River in Newry, Maine.
At the time, Sunday River had a string of surface lifts and was a small operation that drew 30,000 visitors a year.
In five years under Otten’s direction, the area blossomed to 300,000 skier visits a year. Inc. Magazine named Otten turnaround Entrepreneur of 1989. Balsams developer Les Otten. PAULA TRACY photo
Otten said his father (who was 65 when he was born) offered him $100,000 to “NOT” go into the ski business. After several years watching him turn his hand at it, steel magnate Albert Otten, (who fled the Nazis penniless and remade his steel fortune in America) relented, and gave him the money, Otten said.
He used that and $30,000 he had scratched together over his first years out of college to make his first ski area investment.
By 1997, Otten had nine major resorts in his collection, including Heavenly Valley in California, Steamboat Springs in Colorado, The Canyons of Utah, Sugarloaf in Maine and New Hampshire’s Waterville Valley, Attitash and Cranmore resorts.
Because the federal government believed he owned too many, he was forced to divest some of the assets. They included Waterville Valley, which went to Booth Creek in California and is now controlled by the family of Gov. Chris Sununu.
Otten focused on investing in marketing and developing the infrastructure at his remaining ski resorts. He was also a minority partner in the Boston Red Sox baseball team and was instrumental in the restoration of Fenway Park.
At one point, Otten’s ski firm, American Skiing Company, became overleveraged.
Oak Hill Capital Partners came in and bailed the company out, but sent him out as well. Otten was criticized for growing too fast, according to a 2016 book Ski Inc. by Chris Diamond.
Otten has since focused on rural economic development and renewable fuel development. In 2008, he created Maine Energy Systems in Bethel, Maine, which seeks to help state residents move to local pellet fuel and other renewables to help Maine workers and forests, according to its website.
An unsuccessful bid in 2010 to become the Republican governor of Maine ended in the primary, with Otten losing to former Gov. Paul LePage.
Otten is also involved in developing a 62-lot subdivision located off the Sunday River Road in Bethel, Maine and a Bethel-based business called Sports Vision Technologies. Promotional video from the Balsams’ website.
Otten has his supporters and detractors.
Rick Samson, who sits on the three-member Coos County Commission, said he may be “the lone wolf” opposing House Bill 540, regarding the redevelopment of the Balsams, “but I am just doing my job.”
The bill would create a financing tool that would help move the project forward, but not leave the county on the hook if it fails. It has passed the House and will be taken up by the Senate.
“I might not be too popular,” said Samson, “but I have concerns.”
“It’s partly Otten, but the way he’s gone about it and the way he went about it at Sunday River,” Samson said, referring to the Newry, Maine, ski area. Some have criticized Otten for over-leveraging the resort and others. Samson said Otten’s “salesmen” came before the commission in a non-public session to give an overview of the project several years ago, and it became obvious to him that fellow commissioners Tom Brady and Berlin Mayor Paul Grenier had already been briefed, when he had not.
Samson said the salesmen, whom he did not identify by name, told him “anyone who doesn’t support this will never get reelected.”
“I said, ‘I’m not worried about re-election and I need a lot more information before I support this,'” Samson said.
Tom Tillotson, whose late parents Neil and Louise Tillotson, owned the
Balsams for more than 50 years, wrote a response to a letter to the editor from Samson saying Otten’s current proposal to reopen the grand resort has “the elements to succeed.”
Both attended the hearing Jan. 29 on House Bill 540.
Their opinion pieces appeared in several North Country publications. A resident of Dixville and owner of land once held by his Abenaki great-great-grandmother, Mary Titus Hodge, Tillotson said he is pleased with the size and scope of the project that Otten envisions. He believes it is perhaps the last, best hope going forward to revitalize the historic landmark hotel.
The problem in past years, Tillotson said, was the ski area was too small to attract a solid winter tourism business.
Upon completion, the proposed ski area would include more than 20 new lifts and more than 1,200 skiable acres, larger than even Killington, Vt., now the largest ski resort in New England.
At a base elevation of 1,754 feet on the 45th parallel, it is among the snowiest places in the state and would be better able to withstand climate change than other areas of the state, Tillotson said."
"Turning Unnamed Deportees Into Faces, Names And Stories",wcqs.org,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/turning-unnamed-deportees-faces-names-and-stories,"By Dana Terry & Frank Stasio • 17 minutes ago Related Program: The State of Things | Blue Ridge Public Radio
In 1948, a plane deporting 28 migrant farmworkers crashed in Fresno County, California killing 32 people. In some of the press coverage, reporters omitted only the names of the migrants, while naming the flight crew and security.
The crew members’ bodies were returned home and allowed a proper burial, while the 28 farmworkers were buried in a large mass grave site in California. What happened next has become part of music history: folk singer Woody Guthrie was offended by the press’ decision to refer to the victims simply as deportees, so he wrote the protest song “Deportees (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)” in which he attempted to humanize the deceased farmworkers. This incident has since inspired author and scholar Tim Hernandez, who set out to name each victim, connect with their families and tell their stories. In his book “ All They Will Call You ,” he fuses fact, fiction and years of research. Hernandez will do a performance based on his book at the Connect Beyond Festival in Asheville at the Diana Wortham Theatre Saturday, April 6 at 2:30 p.m. Hernandez, a professor in the creative writing department at The University of Texas at El Paso, joins Frank Stasio to talk about his research, connecting with families of the victims, and finally marking the site where they were buried. He is joined by festival creator Jessica Tomasin who describes the event as a mini SXSW aimed to bring together authors, musicians and filmmakers.

"Art, Activism Entwined For DeWayne Barton In Mission To Uplift Asheville's Black Community",wcqs.org,Matt Peiken,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/art-activism-entwined-dewayne-barton-mission-uplift-ashevilles-black-community,"By Matt Peiken • 21 minutes ago Listen / 4:50 It’s a midweek morning at Asheville’s YMI Cultural Center . Upstairs, in a gallery featuring his wall-mounted sculptures, Dewayne Barton has just gotten off the phone, protesting his treatment earlier that morning at Buncombe County government office. “Being black here, being black anywhere, You have to have your own therapy to help you be able to move throughout the world,” Barton said. “The thing I just dealt with this morning is crap. ‘Oh, you need to take your bracelet off?’ I need to take your bracelet off to go through a metal detector? How many people do you tell to do that?” DeWayne Barton Credit courtesy of DeWayne Barton There are many in Western North Carolina on the front lines of racial equity and social justice. Barton lives and makes art from the front lines. He’s a poet and visual artist, creator of a peace and art garden on Asheville’s Burton Street and the founder of Hood Huggers , giving bus tours of Asheville’s historically troubled neighborhoods. “This is a tourist destination and there wasn’t anybody doing any tours that focused on African-American history and culture,” Barton said. “We’ve been working in these communities all these years, and I say ‘Wow, there’s a lot going on that a lot of people don’t know about, it seemed the city was leaving behind the African-American community, and we want to bring them up to center stage.” Barton is now focused on creating and publishing a workbook to guide people coming out of prison and, ideally, keep them from returning. Barton created a lobby installation on view now at the Magnetic Theatre in the River Arts District, and you can also hear him 7pm April 12 as part of a storytelling evening through Asheville Wordfest . Barton was born in Asheville but raised in Washington, D.C., where his stepfather was active in community organizing. His stepfather would often take a reluctant Barton along for the ride. “I think it was crucial. I don’t think I would be here without those experiences,” Barton said. “What I’m doing is continuing the experiences I had as a young person.” As a teenager, Barton felt the inertia of drug culture pulling in other young people from his neighborhood, so to escape, after high school, he joined the U.S. Navy. He went overseas in a non-combat role during the Gulf War, and that’s when he began expressing himself through by writing poetry and creating sculpture from driftwood and a range of discarded material. “I just did this out of therapy to keep my head right. It worked,” he said. “Making this made me feel better and is a way to educate other people about this issue that concerns me. I just did it and did it.” Barton’s sculptures are from found objects Barton has fused into social commentaries. One, about gentrification, features a funnel made of wood with a metal crank at the base and homes springing up from the top. The exhibition at the YMI was the first with pricetags next to his work. Until then, Barton never saw his work as presentable in galleries. “When I came here and walked around Asheville, I wondered would they put my stuff in there, and I could tell they wouldn’t,” he said. “I said why would I worry about put my stuff in their shop. Let me create my own space.” After returning to Asheville, in 2001, to be near his mother, Barton made it his early mission to engage young people through art. He spearheaded the Burton Street Community Peace Gardens, a patchwork of public art, traditional gardens and a meeting space in West Asheville. He also started Hoodhuggers, highlighting Asheville’s historically black arts, environments and businesses. Barton found it surprising his clientele was and remains largely white. “I just anticipated the African-American community have a stronger presence, and I was surprised all these other people want to be involved and learn,” he said. “I knew the platform we were creating was large enough for everyone to step on.” Burton later collaborated with Daniel Leroy to launch Green Opportunities , a job training program for people coming out of incarceration and rehabilitation programs, along with other people facing the greatest challenges finding stable work. Leroy and Barton stepped down as co-directors in 2014. “Dewayne has this authenticity as someone who understands the community on a deep level,” said Leroy, who in May becomes the executive director of the United Way of Asheville and Buncombe County. “He’s also brilliant,” Leroy said of Barton. “He has this artist mind, and he’s able to see things in a really different way.” Leroy said, though, some of Barton’s ideas met resistance from people who either didn’t understand them or weren’t ready to say yes. “Sometimes when you’re the kind of person that is in some ways way ahead of where other people are in their thinking, that it’s hard for other people even to understand enough of what you’re talking about to put it somewhere to make it work,” Leroy said. “But I think this community wouldn’t be what it is without Dewayne Barton in it.” Tags:"

Santiago Ramón y Cajal had dreams of becoming an artist, not a doctor. But he followed his father’s urging and went to medical school, later earning a Nobel prize for the way he furthered understanding of how messages are transmitted to, from and through the brain and nervous system. Cajal managed to merge science and art all along, however, through the meticulous and imaginative way he illustrated brain cells. His drawings remain foundational in the study of neuroscience. Now, they’re also being recognized for their aesthetic beauty. An exhibit at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s Ackland Art Museum presents 80 of his detailed works, contextualized by older attempts to capture the brain’s anatomy and contemporary images powered by today’s technology.

"'Native Son' Is Reborn, In 'Still Kind Of The Same America'",wcqs.org,Mandalit del Barco,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/native-son-reborn-still-kind-same-america,"/ Originally published on April 3, 2019 7:22 am
In the classic 1940 novel Native Son , 20-year-old Bigger Thomas dreams of a life beyond his impoverished Chicago neighborhood.
As in the book, the new Native Son movie begins with Bigger killing a huge rat in his house, where he lives with his siblings and their single mother. His troubles accelerate after he gets hired as a driver for the Daltons, a wealthy white family.
But this time, the story is set in contemporary times. The new retelling of Richard Wright 's novel debuts on HBO this Saturday, April 6. Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks wrote the screenplay. And the adaptation was directed by artist Rashid Johnson.
Ashton Sanders, who was in the Oscar-winning movie Moonlight , plays Bigger. In this version, he sports green hair and a graffiti-covered leather jacket. On set, Sanders explained Bigger is into both punk music and Beethoven.
""Along with the pressures of being a black man in this America, he's also dealing with the pressures of being this other other in America — being this Afro-punk and dealing with his circumstances and his environment,"" Sanders says.
Bigger is tasked with driving Mr. Dalton's wild-child daughter Mary (Margaret Qualley). Mary rebels against her privilege and impetuously tries to connect with Bigger. Mr. Dalton (Bill Camp) may fancy himself as a liberal, but Mary and her boyfriend Jan (Nick Robinson) fashion themselves as political radicals.
At the movie's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in January, writer Suzan-Lori Parks talked about how she updated their story.
""In the original novel, Jan was a member of the Communist Party,"" Parks says. ""So the Communist Party these days is not the same kind of party as it was back in the day. So immediately I said: Well we've got some parties that are also relevant, like Occupy or the anti-fascist movement, that a young person might want to join in that might cause some consternation in the hearts and minds of progressive wealthy parents.""
There are a few other changes. In Wright's bestselling novel, Bigger was a rapist and a murderer — portrayed as a victim or product of his environment.
That characterization has been controversial. Novelist James Baldwin once wrote a critique: In his 1955 book Notes of a Native Son , Baldwin blasted Bigger's portrayal as stereotypical and unsympathetic.
But Native Son remains popular. Over the years, it's been adapted for stage, and also made into a movie twice. Author Richard Wright himself played Bigger Thomas in the 1951 movie. ( Here he is doing his screen test .)
The character Bigger Thomas still resonates, says Ashton Sanders.
""It's always been rough for a black man living in America,"" Sanders says. ""You know, there's always pressures that are put on us. You know, I feel like the black man walks around with an anxiety because of the way that America views him, the world views him, you know? And so yeah, it's still very relevant, because this is still kind of the same America."" Rashid Johnson directs Ashton Sanders and Nick Robinson on set. Thomas Hank Willis / HBO
At his film's Sundance premiere, director Rashid Johnson explains why he thinks Wright's book is timely.
""His story Native Son — however divisive — is an incredibly complicated telling of how we're to examine some aspects of the black psyche,"" Johnson says.
Johnson also examines the black psyche in his artwork, which has been shown at major museums and galleries around the world. Just before he took off to direct Native Son , he had an art opening at the David Kordansky Gallery in Los Angeles.
It was a packed house and featured live music, poetry, paintings and sculpture. His work explores cultural identity and race. He mixes media: shea butter, potted plants, stacks of books, vinyl records.
Visitor Kidogo Kennedy pondered one of Johnson's recurring images , a square, black skull scribbled with big, swirly eyes.
""It reminds me: This is Bigger,"" she says. ""That's who I'm looking at when I look at these grimaces and eyes that are bulging. I think of him, I think of Native Son , I think of Bigger.""
A few weeks later, Johnson was on location in Cleveland, Ohio shooting Native Son . Before the cameras rolled on one scene, he spray-painted a similar skull image on a brick wall — one iteration of the characters he calls Anxious Men.
""I just kind of put it in the background,"" he says. ""I think this film has quite a bit of moments of anxiety, and alludes to the idea of anxiety and how it functions in our characters, as well as in society as a whole.""
On the wall of an alley for another scene, Johnson spray-painted the word ""Run"" — another theme he uses in his artwork.
""The idea of escape has been thematically a big part of my practice,"" he says. ""And so it also lives in this film, as far as how Bigger is negotiating with what he's done. And the idea of running and escape I think are also strong themes that live in this film and in my work simultaneously.""
That is, he put a little bit of himself into the film.
""I think it's hard not to,"" he says.
Johnson's 7-year-old son Julius makes a cameo in one scene. And gallery owner David Kordansky plays a record store owner in the film.
Johnson has made short films before, for commissions at the Guggenheim and the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow. But Native Son is his debut as a feature film director.
""This dialogue, this is not easy, this part,"" he says. He quotes one of Bigger's lines from the screenplay. ""Thank God I am not acting in this movie.""
Still, Rashid Johnson seems at ease directing the actors — quite the opposite of an anxious man.

"USDA Terminates Deadly Cat Experiments, Plans To Adopt Out Remaining Animals",wcqs.org,Vanessa Romo,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/usda-terminates-deadly-cat-experiments-plans-adopt-out-remaining-animals,"By Vanessa Romo • 45 minutes ago The United States Department of Agriculture announced on Tuesday it will discontinue a research program that involved killing thousands of cats. The agency has been under pressure to put an end to the program. USDA photo obtained through a FOIA request / White Coat Waste Project Originally published on April 3, 2019 12:05 pm
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Tuesday that it's putting an end to a controversial research program that led scientists to kill thousands of cats over decades.
Since 1982 the USDA's Agricultural Research Services division had been conducting experiments that involved infecting cats with toxoplasmosis — a disease usually caused by eating undercooked contaminated meat — in order to study the foodborne illness. Once the cats were infected and the parasite harvested, the felines were put down.
In a statement announcing the decision, the agency said ""toxoplasmosis research has been redirected and the use of cats as part of any research protocol in any ARS laboratory has been discontinued and will not be reinstated.""
Additionally, the USDA said it is in the process of putting the 14 remaining uninfected cats up for adoption by agency employees.
The experiments came under increasing scrutiny over the past year, and public outcry intensified over recent weeks in the wake of a report by the White Coat Waste Project that found the USDA's researchers also forced the lab cats to eat dog and cat meat obtained in overseas markets.
The aim of that seemingly gruesome practice — dubbed ""kitten cannibalism"" by critics — was to understand how widespread the parasitic disease is in animals around the world, Justin Goodman, vice president of the White Coat Waste Project, a group that works to end government animal testing, told NPR.
""We are elated that after a year of campaigning we have relegated the slaughter of kittens to the litter box of history,"" Goodman said.
He said the organization obtained details about the agency's active protocols through a Freedom of Information Act request ""that detailed how the USDA was breeding 100 kittens a year in a Maryland lab.""
""At eight weeks, [scientists] would feed them infected meat, harvest parasitic eggs from their feces to be used in other experiments, then kill them,"" Goodman said.
He estimates more than 3,000 cats have been killed since the founding of the research program at a cost of about $22 million to taxpayers.
""Kittens become immune after two weeks, and still the USDA was incinerating them,"" Goodman said.
Kim Kaplan, a USDA spokeswoman, told NPR 239 cats were euthanized between 2013 to 2018, adding that the lab discontinued infecting cats in September.
The nonprofit group's reporting brought widespread attention to the controversial program and resulted in bipartisan legislation to ban animal testing by the USDA. In May, Reps. Mike Bishop, R-Mich., and Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif., introduced a bill called the "" Kittens in Traumatic Testing Ends Now Act of 2018 ,"" also known as the KITTEN Act, to stop the USDA from using cats and kittens in experiments. That was followed in December by a Senate version of the bill , introduced by Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.
""The USDA made the right decision today, and I applaud them for their willingness to change course,"" Merkley said in a statement. ""It's a good day for our four-legged friends across America,"" he said, adding that it was past time the ""archaic practice and horrific treatment"" was stopped.
Panetta responded to the announcement by saying, ""I commend the USDA for their decision to end this type of testing on kittens. They listened to the people and responded appropriately to our concerns. This is how our institutions, our government, and our democracy should and must work.""
""With all the awful reports coming out, it was clear that Americans opposed USDA's cruel testing on kittens. This is a decisive victory against government animal abuse and wasteful spending,"" Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., another cosponsor of the House bill, said on Wednesday.
Mast also thanked Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue ""for his leadership in ensuring no more kittens are ever used in research and that the last cats remaining at USDA can be adopted.""
According to the USDA, its research has helped to cut the prevalence of the Toxoplasma gondii parasite by as much as 50 percent in the U.S. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates more than 40 million Americans may be infected with the parasite. While the vast majority of those infected have no symptoms, it can be deadly for people with weak immune systems, such as children and HIV patients.
The USDA said it is ""continually assessing our research and priorities and aligning our resources to the problems of highest national priority.""
""Over the course of this research, [the Agricultural Research Service] worked to minimize reliance on cats,"" the USDA said.
As recently as November, an independent panel advising the USDA ruled that the risk to human health was too great to allow infected cats to be placed for adoption.
It is the same panel that recommended that cats that were never infected should be made available for adoption. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"
House Judiciary Approves Subpoena For Full Mueller Report In Party-Line Vote,wcqs.org,Tim Mak,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/house-judiciary-approves-subpoena-full-mueller-report-party-line-vote,"By Tim Mak • 51 minutes ago House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., debated with ranking member Doug Collins, R-Ga., (right) about his move to subpoena the Justice Department to obtain an unredacted copy of the Mueller report at a committee markup Wednesday.

Updated at 11:3o a.m. ET
As the Justice Department prepares a redacted version of the Mueller report for release later this month, the House Judiciary Committee authorized subpoenas for the full report and its underlying investigative evidence.
The committee also authorized subpoenas for figures in the Trump orbit, including former White House counsel Don McGahn; McGahn's former chief of staff Ann Donaldson; former adviser Steve Bannon; former spokesperson Hope Hicks; and former chief of staff Reince Priebus.
""We are dealing now, not with the President's private affairs, but with a sustained attack on the integrity of the republic by the President and his closest advisors,"" said Democratic Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York. ""This Committee requires the full report and the underlying materials because it is our job, not the Attorney General's, to determine whether or not President Trump has abused his office.""
The panel split along partisan lines, resulting in a vote tally of 24-17 to back the subpoenas.
During the contentious session, Republicans objected even to small procedural measures such as proceeding without verbally reading out the subpoena resolution in its entirety.
""Why is the chairman doing this?"" asked the committee's top Republican, Doug Collins of Georgia. ""Because even full compliance from these individuals wouldn't satisfy him. ... He's picking the fight because fighting makes good headlines, and because his caucus is desperate for dirt on this president.""
Attorney General William Barr has promised to release a redacted version of the approximately 400 page Mueller report by ""mid-April, if not sooner.""
Barr said that the version he releases then will include redactions to grand jury information, intelligence information, information related to ongoing investigations and information that would ""unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.""
But congressional Democrats have demanded both a full accounting of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation and for it to be provided to Congress sooner.
A deadline set by six House Democratic committee chairs for these materials passed on Tuesday without action by the attorney general.
Following the committee vote, Nadler said that he would continue negotiations with the attorney general to obtain the full report, but if that failed he would move to issue a subpoena for those documents — which could set up a lengthy court battle.
""We're going to work with the attorney general for a short period of time in the hope that he will reveal to us the entire Mueller report, and the underlying materials, and will go to court to get permission to have the [grand jury] material,"" Nadler told reporters. ""But if that doesn't work out in a very short order, we will issue the subpoenas.""
The president weighed in Tuesday, before the committee's proceedings, arguing on Twitter that ""with the NO COLLUSION Mueller Report, which the Dems hate, he wants it all. NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY THEM!"" In 1998, Rep.Jerry Nadler strongly opposed the release of the Starr Report on Bill Clinton. No information whatsoever would or could be legally released. But with the NO COLLUSION Mueller Report, which the Dems hate, he wants it all. NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY THEM! @foxandfriends — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019

Malaysia's Former PM Najib Razak Begins Trial On 1MDB Slush-Fund Charges,wcqs.org,Bill Chappell,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/malaysias-former-pm-najib-razak-begins-trial-1mdb-slush-fund-charges,"Originally published on April 3, 2019 11:25 am
Updated at 10:33 a.m. ET
Malaysia's former Prime Minister Najib Razak is on trial in a wide-ranging corruption case, accused of siphoning millions of dollars from a state investment fund called 1MDB. Najib's trial began Wednesday, nearly a year after he was voted out of office.
Najib, 65, has insisted he is innocent, saying he didn't improperly enrich himself during the decade in which he jointly served as Malaysia's prime minister and finance minister. But prosecutors say those dual posts gave Najib nearly absolute authority — and that he criminally abused it.
""Today's trial involves the transfer of more than $10 million into Najib's personal account from an account linked to 1MDB,"" NPR's Michael Sullivan reports from Kuala Lumpur. ""Investigations by other countries allege that hundreds of millions found their way into Najib's accounts over the years.""
The former prime minister is facing a raft of charges that include criminal breach of trust and money laundering — and Wednesday's trial is the first of many cases brought against him in connection with the broader 1MBD scandal and the alleged misuse of billions of dollars.
While the government's allegations against Najib involve more than $680 million in state funds that wound up in his personal bank accounts, the 1MDB fund accumulated some $6.5 billion — money raised with the help of U.S. bank Goldman Sachs, which also faces charges related to 1MDB .
Founded in 2009, the alleged slush-fund snowballed from being a tool for exorbitant lifestyles to fueling massive pet projects.
The U.S. Justice Department said in 2017 that it believes Malaysian kleptocrats stole at least $4.5 billion from 1MDB accounts, and that some of that money was laundered through shell companies before being used to buy luxury items and make investments in the U.S.
As the DOJ described those purchases : ""These assets allegedly included high-end real estate and hotel properties in New York and Los Angeles, a $35 million jet aircraft, works of art by Vincent Van Gogh and Claude Monet, an interest in the music publishing rights of EMI Music and the production of the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street .""
Others who have been charged in the scandal include Malaysian financier Jho Low — believed to be the fraud's mastermind — along with two former Goldman Sachs bankers.
The alleged fraud was exposed by The Wall Street Journal in 2015. Speaking to NPR's Morning Edition, the Journal's Tom Wright, who helped break the story, called it ""probably the largest corruption scandal ever to have occurred.""
Wright says 1MDB ""wasn't a traditional sovereign wealth fund. This was a fund that went and raised money on global markets and it did so with the help of Goldman Sachs.""
He laid out how the 1MDB enterprise got its start:
""It started in 2009 when the Malaysian prime minister at the time, Najib Razak, wanted a political slush fund to stay in power. And he leaned on a 27-year-old Malaysian financier called Jho Low, who he allowed to run a sovereign wealth fund.
""Low helped him to funnel money around the world — and $1 billion into Najib's account, that Najib then used to pay off politicians in his home country. But unbeknownst to Najib, Jho Low then used billions more to fund a billionaire's lifestyle. He partied with Hollywood celebrities, he bought storied U.S. companies like EMI Music Publishing. He became a billionaire in his own right.""
Jho Low faces charges in both the U.S. and Malaysia. But he remains at large and is currently believed to be living in China.
Attorney General Tommy Thomas laid out the case against Najib in court Wednesday — highlighting a shopping trip in late 2014 in which Najib is said to have used his credit card to buy $130,625 worth of items at a Chanel store in Honolulu, Hawaii.
Thomas said Najib also used the money to pay for renovations at two properties that the former leader owns.
""A former prime minister is charged under due process in the ordinary court of the land, like any other accused,"" Thomas said, according to Malaysian newspaper The Star . ""The accused is not above the law and his prosecution and this trial should serve as precedents for all future holders of this august office.""
Malaysia is currently led by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the country's previous long-time leader who returned to the post last year , when Najib's political party lost power for the first time in more than 60 years.
Within days of Najib's election loss last May, police zeroed in on the ousted leader, raiding a residence at which they seized numerous luxury items, from Hermes crocodile skin bags to diamonds and jewelry. The goods, some of which were bought in Paris and Switzerland, included more than 560 handbags and 2,200 rings . Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"
"Judge Throws Out Panhandling Law, Says Physical Interaction Is Free Speech",wcqs.org,Matthew S. Schwartz,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/judge-throws-out-panhandling-law-says-physical-interaction-free-speech,"By Matthew S. Schwartz • 1 hour ago A man panhandles in the median strip on a street in Portland, Maine, in 2017. A federal judge in Arkansas ruled Tuesday that a law forbidding panhandlers to physically interact with people in cars is unconstitutional. Robert F. Bukaty / AP Originally published on April 2, 2019 11:14 pm
When a panhandler approaches a car in the intersection — his hand out, his eyes wide — that physical interaction is protected by the First Amendment, a federal district judge ruled Monday when he threw out an Arkansas city's panhandling ban.
It's the latest such ban to be found unconstitutional since a 2015 Supreme Court decision made it harder for the government to pass laws regarding the content of speech. That case, Reed v. Town of Gilbert, had to do with regulating church signs , but courts around the country have cited the case as they strike down panhandling laws.
To contend with an increase in panhandling at busy intersections, the city of Hot Springs in 2016 passed an ordinance imposing ""an absolute ban"" on solicitation on streets or in medians. After the American Civil Liberties Union sued, the city repealed the ordinance, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette .
In 2017, the city passed a new version of the ordinance. This one eliminated all references to panhandling, and instead made it illegal for pedestrians or the occupant of a motor vehicle to ""interact physically"" while the engine was running on a public roadway.
But that language was still constitutionally problematic, Judge Robert Dawson wrote , because physical interactions can convey love, disgust, sympathy, and myriad other emotions. ""All people everywhere routinely communicate non-verbal messages through physical interaction, often without even noticing it,"" he said. ""It is visceral and instinctive, and it is often the quickest way to communicate.""
So banning physical interaction between pedestrians and the occupants of a vehicle clearly has free speech implications, the judge wrote. ""The Court can think of no reason why a pedestrian would intentionally attempt physical interaction with a motor vehicle or its occupants other than to communicate a message.""
""Putting your hand out expresses you need money,"" attorney Bettina Brownstein, who handled the case for the ACLU, told NPR. ""Unless they're obstructing your traffic, your car, or assaulting you in some way,"" the speech is protected, she said.
People in their cars may be uncomfortable when panhandlers approach but aren't truly being threatened, said Brownstein. And the First Amendment ""takes precedence over everything"" – even the right of people to feel comfort in their cars, she said.
""We respect the Court's decision,"" Hot Springs attorney Brian Albright said via email. ""However, the safety of pedestrians and motorists are still a concern for the City."" Albright said it's too early to say whether the city will appeal the ruling.
The Reed case ""has placed literally every panhandling ordinance in the United States at least under risk,"" said First Amendment scholar Enrique Armijo, associate dean for academic affairs at Elon University School of Law.
Plenty of cities around the country have seen their panhandling laws struck down, Armijo said. Others have changed them to try to fit the new constitutional landscape. Hot Springs ""did a better job than most cities with respect to defining the banned activity in a way that refers more to the conduct than the speech,"" said Armijo, who thinks the judge's ruling could be overturned on appeal.
""It reads the First Amendment a little too broadly, given precedent,"" he said. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"
The Problem With Cherie Blair's Statement About Rape In Africa,wcqs.org,Joanne Lu,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/problem-cherie-blairs-statement-about-rape-africa,"The Problem With Cherie Blair's Statement About Rape In Africa By Joanne Lu • 2 hours ago Women's rights activist Cherie Blair speaks at an event in California in 2015. Last month she drew attention for her comment that ""most African ladies' first sexual experience is rape."" Rachel Murray/Getty Images Originally published on April 3, 2019 11:28 am
Women's rights activist Cherie Blair sparked outrage last week after The Guardian reported that she said ""most African ladies' first sexual experience is rape"" at a lecture on March 20.
Blair, who is the founder of a charity that supports female entrepreneurs in developing countries and who is married to former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, was giving a talk about women and leadership to a group of about 100 students and members of the community, held at a secondary school in London.
While some people say that Blair was highlighting a serious problem, many women called her out for perpetuating racist stereotypes: that African men are violent and African women are weak and unable to give consent. And some critics said it was not her place, as a powerful white woman, to talk about African issues.
When NPR asked for comment, Blair's office did not respond. But her foundation referred us to Blair's statement to The Guardian , in which she said her initial remark was in answer to a question about adolescent African girls missing out on education due to circumstances such as early pregnancy.
""In that context I said that for the vast majority of young girls — who are often 12-, 13-, 14-year-olds – their first experience of sex was rape,"" Blair said in her statement.
The statistic, she told The Guardian , comes from a World Health Organization report from 2002 , which said that ""A growing number of studies, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa, indicate that the first sexual experience of girls is often unwanted and forced.""
Other observers, such as Dr. Tlaleng Mofokeng , a medical doctor and longtime sexual and reproductive rights advocate in South Africa, say a forced first sexual experience is not unique to Africa.
UNICEF estimates that about 120 million girls under the age of 20 worldwide have experienced forced sexual intercourse or other forced sexual acts at some point in their lives. That's roughly 1 in 10 girls globally.
Mofokeng talked to NPR about the controversy and how she wishes Blair's conversation had gone. ""Dr. T,"" as Mofokeng calls herself, is an Aspen Institute New Voices fellow and the founder of Nalane for Reproductive Justice . Her answers have been edited for length and clarity.
What was your initial reaction when you heard what Blair said?
As a black woman who works in the sexual and reproductive rights space, I was just like, ""Oh, typical.""
A lot of black women feel that white women still look at them through a [white] savior gaze: ""Yes, we are all women and feminists, but we are still exceptional women by being white women; we possess better outcomes and know what's better for you.""That's the atmosphere in which she made her comment.
Based on your own work in sexual and reproductive health in South Africa, is there any factual basis for Blair's statement?
What I know for sure is that [when] a lot of young girls who do go through sexual experiences, contact, penetration often for the first time, even with their own peers, consent is not fully understood. So technically what [Blair is] saying is not completely flawed, but it is flawed in that there's no context to it.
What is the context?
Rape is not an African experience or a black woman experience. It's a human experience. By making it a ""black African woman"" thing, she's feeding a stereotype that we are so disempowered that no matter what we do, we don't have agency.
So by saying ""African,"" Blair implied race, not just geography?
People like to use this term ""African women"" to convey a narrative of a woman who doesn't care enough about herself. But they don't actually mean every woman in Africa. Blair's not talking about other white women who look like her, who happen to live in Africa or who grew up there. She's talking about black African girls.
So how would you have liked to hear Blair talk about the issue she was trying to shed light on?
If she had initially answered: ""In my experience, in the programs I've been in and in the conversations I've had with women, nonconsensual sex is a problem that keeps coming up. Even as someone who's not from Africa, I know it happens,"" this would have been a completely different positioning of the issue.
It affirms that yes, research shows this is a problem, but as an ally, you can't leave African women feeling shameful and more disempowered by your attitude.

Updated at 11:40 a.m. ET
Harsh criminal and anti-LGBT laws went into effect on Wednesday in Brunei amid outcry from human rights groups and celebrities.
Brunei's interpretation of Islamic law now imposes death by stoning as a punishment for sex between men and adultery, as well as amputation of limbs for theft. Lesbian sex can carry a penalty of up to 10 years in jail, the BBC reports .
Under the measures, the punishments can also be applied to children in some cases. The new laws stipulate the death penalty for offenses such as rape, adultery and the defamation of Prophet Mohammad, though the death penalty was already on the books in Brunei and the country has not carried out an execution since 1957, according to the United Nations .
""I urge Brunei to maintain its de facto moratorium on the use of capital punishment,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in a statement on Monday . The U.N., Human Rights Watch and other rights groups have called the punishments in the legislation ""cruel"" and ""barbaric.""
""Brunei's new penal code is barbaric to the core, imposing archaic punishments for acts that shouldn't even be crimes,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, in a statement .
The laws mostly apply to Muslims, the BBC reports, with some aspects still applicable to non-Muslims.
Fewer than 500,000 people live in the oil and gas-rich nation , and the majority are Muslim, though the country also has sizable Christian and Buddhist minorities.
Ellen DeGeneres, George Clooney and other high-profile celebrities have called for a boycott of Brunei-owned hotels in protest to these additions to the penal code. Brunei Investment Agency, a government-owned corporation founded by 72-year-old Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, owns luxury hotels across the U.S., U.K. and Europe, including both the Beverly Hills Hotel and Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles, The Dorchester in London and Hotel Principe di Savoia in Milan.
""In the onslaught of news where we see the world backsliding into authoritarianism this stands alone,"" Clooney wrote in a column for Deadline promoting the boycott.
The Dorchester Collection, the hotel operator owned by Brunei Investment Agency, responded in a statement that its code ""emphasizes equality, respect and integrity in all areas of our operation, and strongly values people and cultural diversity amongst our guests and employees. Inclusion and diversity remain core beliefs as we do not tolerate any form of discrimination,"" Quartz reports .
Brunei released a statement on Saturday defending the laws, saying the penal code criminalizes and deters acts against the teaching of Islam and ""aims to educate, respect and protect the legitimate rights of all individuals, society or nationality of any faiths and race.""
The newly enacted laws constitute the final parts of a penal code announced by the Sultan in 2013, the first phase of which was enacted in 2014. The legislation received widespread condemnation from human rights groups at the time and made Brunei the first Southeast Asian country to institute Sharia Law at a national level, as NPR reported .

May opens door to softer Brexit in an effort to resolve ongoing political impasse,www.neweurope.eu,Array,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.neweurope.eu/article/may-opens-door-to-softer-brexit-in-an-effort-to-resolve-ongoing-political-impasse/,"Published 14:40 14:40 April 3, 2019 May opens door to softer Brexit in an effort to resolve ongoing political impasse Share on LinkedIn +
British Prime Minister Theresa May was unable to broker a deal that brings together her party and the staunchly pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party from Northern Ireland which has forced her to reach out to the opposition Labour Party, with the distinct possibility of diluting her red lines and opting for a softer Brexit.
May is meeting with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn throughout Wednesday to seek support for the unamendable and thrice rejected 585-page Withdrawal Agreement. Failing to secure his backing, as it is likely, she will commit to a “run-off” vote in the House of Commons between the Withdrawal Agreement and other options.
She will, however, require the opposition to commit to accepting the result of the outcome, whichever that may be. This opens the door to a softer Brexit wide open, but the whole process must be complete before next Wednesday’s emergency meeting of EU heads of government.
The announcement enraged the Conservative Party who oppose any move that would see the government back a much softer Brexit that could lead to membership in the Customs Union, inclusion in the Single Market, or even a second Brexit referendum.
“This is a decisive moment in the story of these islands and it will require national unity to deliver the national interest,” said May.
Labour has consistently supported a Customs Union and deep alignment with the Single Market’s regulatory framework, which it claims would help resolve the deadlock over the question of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Supporting this position could see May facilitate a major rift in her own Conservative Party.
“It is very disappointing the cabinet has decided to entrust the final handling of Brexit to Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party,” said Boris Johnson , whose sentiments were further echoed by his fellow Conservative Party member Jacob Rees-Mogg, who added, “What was announced . . . was an attempt to overturn Brexit in an attempt to do a deal with socialists. It’s very serious .”
In a statement issued on 2 April, the Democratic Unionist party talked of a “lamentable, albeit, not surprising” handling of the Brexit negotiations by May.
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told the BBC that the “remorseless logic” in the House of Commons meant the UK was heading for an “undesirable” soft Brexit. Barclay admitted that 35 Conservative MPs were unwilling to support the Withdrawal Agreement, which has left May with few options but to reach out to the opposition as the situation has now come down to “soft Brexit or no Brexit at all”.

Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika resigned Tuesday after weeks of mass protests against his 20-year rule.
The move accelerated his promise earlier this week to resign before the end of his term on April 28. It followed a demand on Tuesday from the country's military chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Gaid Salah, that Bouteflika be declared unfit for office immediately.
""This decision is triggered by my eagerness to prevent that the verbal excesses that unintentionally mark the situation turn into potentially dangerous drifts, and for the protection of persons and property which is the main prerogatives of the State,"" he wrote in a letter released by state-owned Algeria Press Service.
Hundreds reportedly took to the streets of the capital Algiers in celebration, blaring car horns and waving flags.
Persistent protests began after the 82-year-old Bouteflika announced plans in February to seek a fifth term. He then reversed that decision but had delayed new elections.
Since suffering a stroke in 2013, Bouteflika has rarely been seen in public and has been represented by a portrait at public events.
Under the country's constitution, the speaker of the upper house of parliament, Abdelkader Bensalah, will run the country as interim leader for a maximum of 90 days until new elections are held, France 24 reports. The news site reports that Bensalah has been a Bouteflika loyalist and has taken Bouteflika's place at public events. Bensalah has been leader of the upper house since 2002.
Bouteflika had appointed a caretaker government on Sunday, consisting of 27 ministers and headed by Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui, another ally of Bouteflika.
But demonstrations are likely to continue as protesters reject any continuation of a government that bears the influence of Bouteflika and his allies.
""We will have a 100 percent democratic transition, this is very important,"" one man, Selmaoui Seddik, reportedly told Reuters . ""We need to remove the whole previous regime and that is the hardest thing.""
Protests have notably been peaceful in contrast to other demonstrations against longtime leaders of the Middle East and North Africa.
A group of political elites, business leaders and military officials known as le pouvior has effectively managed the country behind the scenes for years, according to analysts. Bouteflika's party, the National Liberation Front, has ruled the country since gaining independence from France in 1962. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"

Image: REUTERS/Yves Herman Sean Fleming Senior Writer, Formative Content Most Popular Explore the latest strategic trends, research and analysis
There are more bicycles than people in the Netherlands and they account for almost half of all journeys between home and work in the city of Amsterdam alone. It’s small wonder the country proudly calls itself the “unrivalled number one bicycling nation” in the world. The number one cycling nation Image: Government of the Netherlands
Being a relatively flat country no doubt helps encourage people to get on their bike. As does the expanse of cycle paths and lanes that keep bikes separate from other traffic. But there is a little-known additional incentive for Dutch people to get on their bike – tax credits.
Every kilometre cycled could earn you an extra $0.22 , tax-free, paid straight into your pay packet. This works in much the same way that someone driving their own car for business purposes is able to claim back a fixed sum related to the distance travelled. But the bottom line is that cyclists could be earning money simply by riding to and from work.
The Netherlands isn’t the only country offering financial incentives to get people out of their cars and using pedal power instead of fossil fuel.
In the UK, the Cycle to Work scheme operates a lease-to-own model allowing employees to get discounted bikes and equipment through their employer. The employer buys the bicycle and leases it to the employee over a set period – usually 12 months. The monthly payments are deducted from gross earnings, meaning an effective saving of 32% for basic-rate taxpayers. There is also a mileage allowance made available for British cyclists who use their bikes for business purposes, of around $0.26 per mile.
A similar tax-free bike-purchase scheme operates in the Netherlands as well as in Belgium, where a payment of $0.26 per kilometre is available to cyclists. Have you read?"

Former FBI Director James Comey conceded on Tuesday that Hillary Clinton might be president today if he had not interfered in the 2016 election.
Comey made the admission during an interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.
“Do you ever thing that you might be responsible for the election of President Trump?” Amanpour asked. “Does that keep you up at night?”
“Sure, and I hope some day somebody proves that what we did was irrelevant,” Comey replied.
Amanpour pointed out that Comey’s actions against Clinton “were kind of relevant” since she lost. Tags:"
'Someone To Speak For You': Low-Income Tenants Get Lawyers For Housing Court,wcqs.org,Jenifer McKim,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/someone-speak-you-low-income-tenants-get-lawyers-housing-court,"'Someone To Speak For You': Low-Income Tenants Get Lawyers For Housing Court By Jenifer McKim • 7 hours ago Tenant Jacqueline Davis held back rent when her landlord didn't fix damage from a burst pipe. Jenifer McKim / New England Center for Investigative Reporting Listen Listening... /
Jacqueline Davis walked into the Bronx's housing court hoping to stop her landlord from evicting her from the one-bedroom apartment she has lived in for nearly 30 years.
The 74-year-old retiree says her landlord moved to kick her out after she deducted part of her rent when a pipe burst and the ceiling collapsed, damaging her kitchen.
Worried about becoming homeless, Davis unexpectedly found some good news in the crowded hallways of New York City's busiest housing court, where more than 80,000 eviction proceedings were filed last fiscal year.
She's one of a growing number of residents in the city who qualify for a first-in-the-nation program to provide free legal services to low-income tenants facing eviction.
""I think it's great,"" Davis said. ""We had no legal representation before, and now you have someone to speak for you.""
The right to counsel program, signed into law in 2017, is meant to address the legal disparity in a city where historically only one in 10 tenants in housing court had a lawyer, while most landlords had legal representation. The program has become a model for other cities and states trying to limit displacement and homelessness amid rising rents and advancing gentrification.
San Francisco and Newark , N.J., have passed similar legislation over the past year. Now lawmakers in Massachusetts , Connecticut and Minnesota are considering statewide proposals to provide free attorneys to struggling renters.
A recent study by the Community Service Society of New York found that evictions declined more than five times faster in ZIP codes where the right to counsel law was in effect than in ZIP codes where the law was not. Loading...

The interest comes amid what some call an ""eviction epidemic"" — nearly 900,000 households across the U.S. were evicted in 2016, according to data provided by the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. Advocates argue that tenants facing eviction are ill-prepared to defend themselves in court, while the stakes are high — recovering from an eviction can be insurmountable.
""The right to counsel for tenants facing eviction is the biggest step forward in access to justice in a generation,"" said New York Law School professor Andrew Scherer. ""It's really the next frontier.""
Scherer said he grew convinced about the need while working as a young legal aid attorney in New York City in the late 1970s and witnessing how tenants who received legal help often were able to stay at home. He said the initiative advances legal rights given to defendants in criminal proceedings more than 50 years ago by the Supreme Court .
The New York City legislation was the result of a years-long push from tenant organizers and other community leaders that was launched by a Bronx-based advocacy group, Community Action for Safe Apartments. Randy Dillard, a 63-year-old retired brick mason, said he pushed for the campaign after fighting to save his own home a few years earlier. He has now been to court to make sure the program is working.
""The fantastic part is to see the expression on the tenant's face when they realize they are going to receive a lawyer,"" Dillard said.
The program is being phased in over five years. Steven Banks, commissioner of the New York City Department of Social Services, said 30 percent of tenants facing eviction now have lawyers and all eligible tenants should be receiving help by 2022.
By then the city will be paying $155 million a year to fund the program – a cost, Banks said, is worth it to reduce homelessness. Already, he said, the city has seen a drop in evictions — with 84 percent of households represented by lawyers in the last fiscal year able to stay in their homes.
""It's a dramatic expansion and a sea change in the way that the housing court has operated,"" Banks said. Thirty percent of New York City tenants facing eviction now have lawyers, and all eligible tenants should be receiving help by 2022, says Department of Social Services Commissioner Steven Banks. Jenifer McKim / New England Center for Investigative Reporting
Jean Schneider, supervising judge for the New York City Housing Court, supports the change. She said judges have long struggled to help tenants without attorneys defend themselves — with limited success. The influx of tenant lawyers has changed court culture, she said. ""I think all of us may respond differently by the fact that we have a level playing field with lawyers on both sides,"" she said.
Not everybody is convinced. Mitch Posilkin, counsel for the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents New York City landlords, said the benefits of the law are overblown. He attributes a multiyear drop in evictions to an influx of New York City funding to struggling tenants to cover housing arrears.
""Even with the best attorney, the housing court is going to be faced with the ultimate question of does the tenant have the money to pay the rent or not,"" he said.
Others argue that money is just one part of the equation. Davis said she deducted money from her rent only after her ceiling collapsed. A representative of the landlord could not be reached for comment.
The round-faced, soft-spoken senior said her landlord would not accept the partial rent and instead is pushing her to move out. After going to court, she was connected to attorney Sarah Joy Faliks of Bronx Legal Services.
Faliks said Davis' case is all too common: Tenants with homes in disrepair don't know their legal rights and are forced to pay money they don't owe or are forced out by landlords. Faliks plans to push the landlord to give Davis back money for damages and dismiss the eviction.
Davis is relieved to get the help. ""I hope they don't evict me"" she said. ""I want to live my last years in a nice, quiet apartment with heat and hot water.""

What Else Could Robert Mueller's Report Reveal About Trump And Russia?,wcqs.org,Philip Ewing,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://wcqs.org/post/what-else-could-robert-muellers-report-reveal-about-trump-and-russia,"By Philip Ewing • 7 hours ago President Trump arrives for a campaign rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., last week. Nicholas Kamm / AFP/Getty Images Originally published on April 3, 2019 8:35 am
The headline findings by special counsel Robert Mueller delivered a political shot in the arm for President Trump and Republicans, they say — how long it lasts may depend on the full document.
Attorney General William Barr told Congress that Mueller's office didn't establish a conspiracy between Trump's campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election , nor did it establish — per Barr — that Trump obstructed justice.
That's based on Barr's four-page letter about the report to Congress . The full document is nearly 400 pages, he wrote , and likely contains a great deal more detail about the findings and assessments made by Mueller and his office.
Barr's office is working now to redact grand jury testimony, foreign intelligence and other material from the full Mueller report before releasing it sometime this month.
Here are some of the big questions it may answer.
What did Trump know?
Trump's campaign and business had many contacts with Russians from 2015 through the 2016 election — these are not in dispute and they were among the reasons for the investigation in the first place.
Mueller, in fact — according to Barr — confirmed that ""Russian-affiliated individuals"" made ""multiple offers"" to ""assist the Trump campaign,"" which comports with the versions of events given in court documents and according to other official sources that already are public.
Did the substance of any of these offers ever reach Trump or other members of his brain trust? If so, what did they do?
Micromanagement
People who worked for Trump have said nothing happened in his business or campaign without his involvement. Donald Trump Jr. attends a fashion show during New York Fashion Week in February in New York City. Theo Wargo / Getty Images for NYFW: The Shows
That's why, for example, former Trump aides have said they thought it likely he was at least aware that Donald Trump Jr. convened a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016 at which a Russian delegation delivered a tip on Democrats.
Trump Jr. said it wasn't what he expected and he didn't pursue it any further, and authorities evidently did not conclude it broke the law.
No one faced criminal charges in connection with that meeting and the Justice Department says Mueller hasn't recommended any more indictments beyond the ones that already have been unsealed.
And Trump has denied he was aware in 2016 of the Russian interference in the election and of the Trump Tower meeting specifically. Democratic opponents said they thought phone records might undermine that denial, but they didn't .
If Mueller's full report further bolsters the Trumps' defenses, that will mean more good political news for the president and his family.
If Mueller's report established that Trump did know what was happening and, while he didn't conspire with Russia's efforts, he also didn't report them to authorities, that may take away some of the political momentum Trump and the GOP have built up so far from the Barr account of Mueller's findings.
What did the feds establish about the dossier?
The unverified Russia dossier was not the origin of the Russia investigation, but it may be the most infamous piece of information about it. NPR has not detailed its claims because they are unverified.
The degree to which Mueller's full report specifically addresses the material in the dossier could be one of its most important developments for the politics of the post-Mueller era.
If the full report torpedoes the dossier altogether, that will strengthen efforts like those by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who wants an investigation into how the FBI and Justice Department used it in the Russia investigation.
If Mueller substantiates some of the dossier's contents, that could create problems for the White House short of the worst-case ""collusion"" allegation that evidently now is off the table.

For example, one claim of the dossier was that powerful Russians may possess compromising material — or so-called kompromat — about Trump and that may have been why he took such sympathetic tone toward Moscow — for fear of it being revealed.
Trump himself has dismissed that idea and said — for example, at his summit in Finland with Russian President Vladimir Putin — that if any such material about him existed, it would have become public by now.
Democrats on the House intelligence committee wrote last year that certain aspects of the dossier have been corroborated — although the details about which aspects were redacted.
Democrats also continue to ask whether Trump may be beholden to Russia or compromised by people in it — and whether that might be true even if, per Barr's letter, Trump's 2016 campaign didn't collude with the election interference.
Mueller's findings about this could change the understanding of the Russia imbroglio yet again.
What did Trump ask, and of whom, involving the various investigations?
Alleged obstruction of justice was a potent threat to Trump because frustrating an investigation is illegal even when there was no underlying crime.
That was another reason why Trump and Republicans welcomed Barr's letter about Mueller's findings so warmly.
And it's one reason why Democrats reacted so strongly to Barr's characterization of Mueller's findings, of which the attorney general wrote : ""'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.' ""
In short, Barr made it sound as though this came down to a judgment call. Barr and Rod Rosenstein, according to the attorney general, were the ones who concluded that Mueller's findings were insufficient to establish that Trump had committed a crime.
So what were those findings?
A number of press reports suggested Trump asked people — intelligence agency leaders, Justice Department or law enforcement officials and White House officials — to take actions that critics called obstruction of justice.
Trump's alleged actions included requests for investigators to ease up on him or friends, for people to be fired or removed — or for safe loyalists to be placed onto cases — and for people to give inaccurate information to Congress.

Were those reports accurate? And if so, how much of the assessment depends on the president's exact words?
Former FBI Director James Comey , for example, told the Senate intelligence committee that Trump said ""I hope you can let this go,"" when alluding to the case of former national security adviser Mike Flynn. Trump, in this telling, did not say: I hereby order you to discontinue your investigation of Flynn.
Trump, as his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen told the House oversight committee , often speaks in a ""code."" Mueller's report may reveal how much the Justice Department's decision not to prosecute on obstruction depended on the substance of his actions and how much on his use of that ""code.""
What were the extent of the active measures?
Two of the ways Russia interfered in the 2016 election have gotten most of the attention:
First, the social media agitation wrought by an office of trolls who sought to amplify divisions among Americans. Second, the use of cyberattacks to steal and release information embarrassing to political targets within the United States.
But there was more to the Russian attack on the 2016 election. Intelligence officers, for example, also launched cyberattacks against state election systems that sought to study them and, in at least one case , extracted information about voters. People walk under a heavy snowfall in front of St. Basil's Cathedral and the Kremlin in Moscow in January. Mladen Antonov / AFP/Getty Images
How many other types of ""active measures"" did the Russians wield in service of their aim to sow chaos and, eventually, help support Trump? Are there any types of interference that haven't been made public?
Mueller's answers about the tools Russia used to interfere in the last presidential election will help Americans prepare to safeguard future elections.
What were the origins of the active measures?
The U.S. intelligence community assessed early on that Putin had ordered the influence campaign ""to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate [Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.""
""Active measures"" are as old as statecraft , but the 2016 campaign represented an unusual spike, one that caught American officials off guard.
What more is known about when, precisely, Putin decided to launch it — and why? Who involved chose the techniques — and why?
Americans have learned a great deal from Mueller's prosecutions about the operational workings of the Kremlin's active measures effort — the movement of the troops in what amounted to a war of information.
What's less clear, for now, were the actions of their generals. Copyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org. © 2019 BPR"
Turkish Democracy Is the Winner in These Momentous Local Elections,carnegieeurope.eu,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://carnegieeurope.eu/2019/04/03/turkish-democracy-is-winner-in-these-momentous-local-elections-pub-78765,"@sinanulgen1
The first explanation has to do with the state of Turkey’s economy, which has in many ways proved to be the best friend of Turkey’s democracy. The elections were held against the backdrop of recession, the first in the country for a decade. Households had started to suffer from the impact of last summer’s currency crisis, which led to higher inflation and eroded standards of living. The economic slowdown has dented employment prospects, with general unemployment inching up to 14% in November and youth unemployment to 24%. Unlike some authoritarian jurisdictions, Turkey is not a rentier state that can rely on commodity revenues to buy the political loyalty of its citizens. Turkish governments have to create the conditions for a well-functioning and stable market economy in order to satisfy the aspirations of the electorate. Any longstanding departure from the principles of good governance – which includes the degradation of the rule of law, transparency and accountability, as well as political and economic freedoms – will exact first an economic and then inevitably a political price. That is the shock that came to the surface last Sunday.
The second explanation relates to a dramatic change in the performance of Turkey’s long-belittled opposition. This time, the opposition managed to outmanoeuvre Erdoğan and his party. Firstly, the centre-left CHP and nationalist/centre-right IYI party alliance performed better than the government alliance in terms of voting behaviour. In places where there was a joint candidate with a CHP background, the IYI party electorate voted wholesale for the CHP, and vice versa. In contrast, the MHP constituency was divided in its support for AKP candidates, especially in the metropolitan areas of western Turkey. The opposition alliance also received a strong boost from the tactical voting of the pro-Kurdish HDP electorate.
Even more important, however, were the candidates themselves. Both in Ankara and Istanbul, the opposition fielded candidates that were willing and able to reach out beyond their core and natural constituencies. In Ankara, Mansur Yavas got a majority of the nationalist vote. In Istanbul, Ekrem Imamoglu was able to draw a share of the conservative vote. He consolidated his image as an emerging leader with his astute management of the crisis the night of the election when the AKP candidate, the former prime minister Binali Yildirim, declared victory prematurely.
The consequences of the opposition’s victory in these local elections will be significant. But they have to be placed in the right context – which is that, despite this setback, Erdoğan and AKP remain the dominant force in Turkish politics. On Sunday, the government alliance received 51% of the national vote. But victory at these municipal elections will embolden the political opposition. It stands to benefit from controlling local governments in Turkey’s economic heartland.
The opposition is now in command of the cities that make up 65 % of the nation’s GDP. Its immediate challenge is to match and outperform the service delivery standards achieved by AKP local governments over the past decades. In the longer term, it will need to cement its alliance at the national level, something that will be facilitated by a more inclusive model of local governance including merit-based staffing policies to replace the ideology-based patronage of the AKP years.
For Erdoğan, the challenge will be to overcome the perception of weakness in the wake of a major electoral loss. His immediate concern will be the shape of the economy. His political fortunes will depend on how soon he can return Turkey to a path of sustainable growth. The risks are not negligible given that superficial steps will no more suffice. Deep reforms tackling Turkey’s democratic deficit and rule of law will also be needed.
Local elections have demonstrated that despite having achieved a remarkable degree of power centralisation, Erdoğan and the AKP remain vulnerable to economic and political undercurrents, just as should be the case in a normal democracy. So in many ways, the winner on Sunday was the image of Turkey’s polity, both at home and abroad. Despite being saddled with big problems, Turkish democracy demonstrated its resilience and vibrancy, and hinted at a future beyond populist and divisive politics. End of document"
Elections in Ukraine and Slovakia Offer a Glimpse into Russia's Future,carnegie.ru,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://carnegie.ru/2019/04/03/elections-in-ukraine-and-slovakia-offer-glimpse-into-russia-s-future-pub-78766,"@AndrKolesnikov
There are many differences between Zuzana Čaputová, who won the Slovakian presidential election on March 30, and Volodymyr Zelensky, who won in the first round of Ukraine’s election on March 31.
Čaputová can boast of a wealth of experience in human rights work along with a history of successfully challenging the state.
Zelensky has nothing but his reputation as a popular showman, whose on-screen role as a an ordinary guy who accidentally ends up becoming president appears to be a case of fiction becoming reality. And yet, there are many more qualities that unite them.
In a world in which election results are often determined by voters aged 65 and over, they are young. Their core audience, as surveys have shown, is made up of 18-30 year-olds.
For this, they have brought young people to the polling stations in places where no one has given a thought to the youth vote for a long time. They speak a different language: not the dialect of those on the left or the right, with empty promises, but a rhetoric that appeals on moral grounds.
Zelensky’s dream of a peaceful country is something that voters in war-torn Ukraine can relate to: a state without the grim vision of incumbent President Petro Poroshenko. Zelensky was also not afraid of offering ambitious plans rather than figures in his manifesto; instead of advertisements offering Ukrainians work in Poland, he dreamed of ads offering Poles work in Ukraine.
Maybe Zelensky’s push to appeal to Polish workers is an utopia, but voters perceive it as a clear goal, and one that’s not connected with the neverending hybrid war with Russia that must be won, through means yet unclear.
Čaputová declared ‘evil’ as her main opponent. When a seasoned politician says, “if we don’t change anything now, it will be too late,” it comes across somewhat vapid, but when it comes from the lips of a human rights defender who shut down a landfill site following a 14-year-old battle, it looks like a very concrete promise.
Zelensky and Čaputová do not look politicians. A charismatic 45-year-old divorcee and mother of two, Čaputová has charmed a Slovakia that has been heading in the same conservative direction as Poland and Hungary has in recent years. And (yet), Čaputová won the election despite the Catholic Church declaring it a sin to vote for her because of her liberal attitude to abortion and same-sex marriage.
Meanwhile, in Ukraine, it turns out that 41-year-old fun-loving Jewish comedian Zelensky is what voters need and want following Sovietized leaders Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma, the revolutionaries Viktor Yushchenko and Yulia Tymoshenko, and the militant oligarch Petro Poroshenko, who cites Russian President Vladimir Putin’s name so frequently as if to suggest the country had no other problems.
Their respective parties, Progressive Slovakia and Servant of the People, are new and unrepresented in their countries’ parliaments. It’s hard to define them along the narrow lines of left or right-wing, the nearest approximation perhaps being populist, or liberal-populist.
This being said, it’s hard to call Čaputová a populist: her human rights and anti-corruption agenda is absolutely vital and tangible in a country that appears to have finally snapped out of a stupor, following the shocking murder of the investigative journalist Ján Kuciak and his girlfriend just over a year ago.
Čaputová’s opponent in the election was MarošŠefčovič, a politician who, five years ago, would have been considered the perfect candidate, thanks to his experience and macho image. Now, this is only important to less than half of voters.
Poroshenko’s final campaign message was “Think”— i.e., don’t trust glib talkers; trust experienced professionals. But if the output of is corruption, monopolization, and the inability to implement reforms over the last few years, then why not entrust the running of the country to someone with relatively no experience?
So it seems that what voters want then is new leaders that operate outside the system, speak a new kind of language and present short but vibrant manifestos. For that, it’s not essential to be far left or far right; it’s important to be different. With this, perhaps extremism is going out of fashion.
And while this might appear far from Russian politics, the muted discontent that has been growing, manifesting itself in protest voting in regional elections or in the resistance to landfill sites, is gradually giving rise to a new kind of politician in Russia too. Russians might not yet be ready to accept this challenge because they don’t believe it’s genuine.
Further down the line? It might be too late then."

And NO! It's not all paid that way. When you're talking about a young man whose ""bulletproof"" as liberals love to call young white males who have not foolishly married. Yet. Your deductibles will be through the roof. So it is a great thing if you're a young buck who never needs a doctor. Which they don't exist.
And then, here comes some stuck up baby boomer whose saddled you and your descendants with their San Francisco lifestyle choices for all of eternity with an impossible national debt; whose bragging about living off you for the rest of their decadent, and stupid lives.

Were you home schooled, miss a few grades, or what exactly is your problem?
Fascism is a distinctly far-right phenomena that grew out of the totalitarian European nations in the 1930s, uniting around ultra-nationalist ideology, nativist, anti-immigrant policies, racial identity, and tight cooperation between the state and private industry. This does not only define the politics of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, but increasingly the posture of the US under the Trump administration. So the good ol' US of A, has for the first time in its existence, flirted with Fascism as a matter of national policy. We never have had, and never will have, a Marxist state, a far-left, dictatorship of another kind.
So technically, as an all-out, absolute Trump supporter/cultist, that technically makes you a fascist, by definition."

That's just what ""the state"" (which has been run by leftists for a century or more) wanted you to believe. Fascism is far more closely aligned with the proposed globalist left's new world order than Constitutionalists. It was started in earnest along about the time Wilson was President and is very much affiliated with the advent of the Federal Reserve.
The ONLY reason the establishment and their minions in the main stream media are non-stop Trump bashing is because he is not going along with their plan. Because he cares about America and Americans first. Actually, it's the same thing with Putin and Russia, for that matter. Neither one is going along with it, therefore THEY are anathema to the entrenched globalists.
If the truth be known, this country is probably headed to a far worse iron-fisted communist state than Russia ever was. (It just won't be apparent to many until it's way too late.)
