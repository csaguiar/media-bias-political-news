* I can’t wait to see how the bank responds: “Two House committees have issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions for information on President Donald Trump’s finances. The chairs of the House Intelligence and Financial Services committees said in statements to NBC News on Tuesday that they are working in tandem to probe the president’s financial ties.”
* Hmm : “The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia argued in a court filing Monday that the Washington Post’s request to release sealed and redacted records related to Paul Manafort’s case should be rejected because of the existence of several ‘ongoing investigations.’”
* A sensible reversal : “Immigration officials last week deported the spouse of a U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan in 2010, leaving the couple’s 12-year-daughter in Phoenix, then abruptly reversed its decision on Monday when the deported man was allowed to return to the U.S.”
* More on this story tomorrow: “Three House Democratic chairmen on Monday launched a probe into reports that the White House pressured immigration enforcement officials to release migrants into the districts of political adversaries.”
* This controversy hasn’t gone away: “Rep. David Schweikert is running up big legal bills as the House Ethics Committee investigates the Arizona Republican’s dealings with his former top aide and other employees.”
* Poorly designed tax policy : “The flood of fiscal stimulus from the Republican tax cut bill is about to slow to a trickle…. The juice it was supposed to inject in the economy will likely soon run out, just in time for the presidential election year. The fiscal stimulus of the tax bill will likely continue this year, but once 2020 arrives, many economists say the short-term growth effects will probably run out.”
* What a mess : “NRATV has allegedly told the National Rifle Association that it can take key financial information about the groups’ relationship from its cold dead hands, according to a lawsuit the NRA filed on Friday.”

GOP senators turn their attention to Clinton email probe,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/gop-senators-turn-their-attention-clinton-email-probe,"Republican presidential candidate Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) speaks at the Growth and Opportunity Party, at the Iowa State Fair Oct. 31, 2015 in Des Moines, Iowa. Photo by Steve Pope/Getty GOP senators turn their attention to Clinton email probe 04/17/19 09:20 AM By Steve Benen Last summer, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) not only expressed confidence in the outcome of the 2018 midterm elections, he also boasted about what he’d do if elevated to the chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Near the top of the senator’s list of priorities: the Hillary Clinton email probe.
Graham wasn’t kidding . Indeed, we were reminded yesterday that Graham is both focused on the Clinton email probe and recruiting some friends for his endeavor.
A trio of top Republican senators are doubling down on their demand for the Justice Department to hand over information on the handling of the probe into Hillary Clinton’s private email server.
Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) – the chairmen of the Judiciary, Homeland Security and Finance committees, respectively – sent a letter Tuesday to Attorney General William Barr arguing that now that special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe has wrapped up, the department should hand over the requested documents.
It’s possible the GOP senators have forgotten this pesky detail, but the Justice Department inspector general’s office already examined the probe into Hillary Clinton’s private email server and it discredited the conspiracy theories .
As the New York Times ’ David Leonhardt explained last year, “Federal investigators and prosecutors did not give preferential treatment to Clinton. They pursued the case on the merits. They were guided by, as the inspector general’s report puts it, ‘the prosecutor’s assessment of the facts, the law, and past Department practice.’”
There was no pro-Clinton bias. As Rachel explained on the show 10 months ago, the Justice Department’s exhaustive review determined that the reason Clinton wasn’t charged was because there simply wasn’t reason to charge her. The investigation into her emails was handled properly.
And yet, there are Graham, Johnson, and Grassley, on the eve of the Mueller report’s release, turning their attention once more to partisan conspiracy theories surrounding Clinton and emails, raising questions that have already been answered.
Is it any wonder Democratic senators are laughing at them ?
The Hill had this report a few months ago.
Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), asked about Graham’s plans, started laughing and compared them to the “thrilling days of yesteryear.”
“This is going to be like the History Channel it turns out. Instead of taking a look at the current issues, Lindsey Graham wants to go back and answer important questions about the Bermuda Triangle and Hillary Clinton,” Durbin told The Hill.
Durbin said he was “concerned” about Graham’s plans but quipped that “you know there is that question about Jimmy Carter which he probably wants to ask.”
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), another member of the panel, said maybe Graham should “investigate Benghazi some more too” – an apparent reference to a years-long House probe that Democrats considered a political stunt.
Graham, Johnson, and Grassley will very likely impress conservative media and their party’s far-right base with their latest efforts – but no one else.
Perhaps, in their eyes, no one else matters.

GOP moves a little further away from 'party of health care' label | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/gop-moves-little-further-away-party-health-care-label,"By Steve Benen For the most part, there are no significant political differences among vaccination opponents. As Politico reported last night, however, there’s an increasingly obvious political difference when it comes to policymakers working on the issue.
Most Republicans are rejecting Democrat-led state bills to tighten childhood immunization laws in the midst of the worst measles outbreak in two decades, alarming public health experts who fear the nation could become as divided over vaccines as it is over global warming.
Democrats in six states – Colorado, Arizona, New Jersey, Washington, New York and Maine – have authored or co-sponsored bills to make it harder for parents to avoid vaccinating their school-age children, and mostly faced GOP opposition. Meanwhile in West Virginia and Mississippi, states with some of the nation’s strictest vaccination laws, Republican lawmakers have introduced measures to expand vaccine exemptions, although it’s not yet clear how much traction they have.
In the not-too-distant past, policymakers working on stopping the spread of preventable infectious diseases wouldn’t have been overly concerned with partisan political splits. Officials would’ve simply followed the science, consulted with experts, prioritized public health, and approved appropriate policies.
But in 2019, it appears more than a few GOP officials have adopted their own unique posture on the issue.
Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted in recent weeks that the Republican Party is well on its way to becoming the “party of health care.” Perhaps that was premature.
Indeed, before becoming president, Trump peddled bizarre theories about vaccinations, making the public discussion even more difficult. Politico ’s report added:
[O]fficials worry they are “three Trump tweets away” from an even more polarized situation, noted MIT political scientist Adam Berinsky, who has studied communication around politicized public health and scientific issues.
In Texas, the Tea Party and related groups created an anti-vax PAC in 2015. It hasn’t yet gotten its chosen candidates elected, but the very existence of a vaccine-oriented political action committee shows the political salience is growing. Influential voices on the right, including Rush Limbaugh, Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones, have all raised suspicions about vaccines.
“There’s a credulity gap between the parties in regard to science that wasn’t there 25 years ago,” Berinsky said.
If Republicans want to be the “party of health care,” they can start acting like it.

* The new national Monmouth poll shows Donald Trump’s approval rating dipping from 44% last month to 40% now. While Gallup recently found a bump in presidential support following the release of Bill Barr’s memo, other polling isn’t yet pointing to a broad shift.
* While Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) weighs a re-election bid despite being under criminal indictment, the Republican incumbent did not receive a campaign contribution from literally any individual in the first three months of 2019. Collins did, however, receive a couple of checks from political action committees.
* In Connecticut’s state House special election yesterday, Tammy Exum (D) won by a two-to-one margin, keeping a “blue” seat in Democratic hands. That said, at a national level, Democratic performance in special elections in 2019 isn’t quite as strong as the results we saw in 2018.
* As the Stop & Shop strike continues in the northeast, several Democratic presidential candidates have expressed their support for striking workers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who brought them coffee and donuts over the weekend.
* Dan Baer, who served as the Obama administration’s Ambassador for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, launched a Democratic U.S. Senate campaign in Colorado this week, hoping to take on Sen. Cory Gardner (R). More recently, Baer served as head of his state’s Department of Higher Education.
* The latest Marquette Law School poll found Trump with a 46% approval rating in Wisconsin, a swing state he narrowly carried in 2016 with 47% of the vote.
* Add Illinois to the list of states weighing new measures that would require presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns as a prerequisite to appearing on the ballot.
* And in Arizona’s U.S. Senate race, Democratic leaders are no longer waiting for possible primary contenders: the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has officially endorsed retired astronaut Mark Kelly.

Some White House staffers worry about exposure in Mueller report | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/some-white-house-staffers-worry-about-exposure-mueller-report,"By Steve Benen As the investigation into the Russia scandal unfolded over the course of many months, plenty of White House officials did what Donald Trump refused to do: they spoke to investigators and answered their questions.
In theory, so long as they were truthful, the aides’ cooperation with the probe seems like an inherently good thing. But in practice, as NBC News reported yesterday, some White House staffers are concerned about possible cameos in the Mueller report, due to be released tomorrow morning.
Some of the more than one dozen current and former White House officials who cooperated with special counsel Robert Mueller are worried that the version of his report expected to be made public on Thursday will expose them as the source of damaging information about President Donald Trump, according to multiple witnesses in the investigation.
Some of the officials and their lawyers have sought clarity from the Justice Department on whether the names of those who cooperated with Mueller’s team will be redacted or if the public report will be written in a way that makes it obvious who shared certain details of Trump’s actions that were part of the obstruction of justice probe, people familiar with the discussions said. But, they said, the Justice Department has refused to elaborate.
As one former White House official put it, in reference to White House officials, “They got asked questions and told the truth, and now they’re worried the wrath will follow.”
How worried? One person close to the White House told NBC News there is “ breakdown-level anxiety ” among some current and former staffers who cooperated with the investigation.
It’s important to emphasize that the president’s own attorneys told aides they should cooperate with the special counsel’s probe. As best as we can tell from the outside, those directions did not come with a wink and a nod – staffers were encouraged to answer investigators’ questions, and so they did.
But these same aides are suddenly faced with the prospect of appearing in the Mueller report, alongside revelations that their volatile president may not appreciate.
Indeed, the NBC News report is important, if for no other reason, because it offers a peek behind the curtain: if these staffers didn’t have damaging perspectives to offer, they wouldn’t be nervous right now .
In other words, if White House aides sat down with investigators, answered questions fully and honestly, and left confident that they hadn’t said anything that would cast Trump in a negative light, they wouldn’t have any cause for concern.
The fact that some are feeling “breakdown-level anxiety” offers a pretty big hint that they conveyed information to Team Mueller that didn’t make their boss look especially good.
Over the last week or so, the president himself has appeared, to put it mildly, highly agitated over what Americans may soon learn about Mueller’s findings. But let’s not forget those who work on his team, who are apparently quite nervous, not because they’re worried about Trump’s fate, but rather, because they’re worried about their own.

* There’s simply no reason for this : “The Trump administration is re-imposing limits on the amount of money Cuban Americans can send to relatives on the island and ordering new restrictions on U.S. citizen, nonfamily travel to Cuba, national security adviser John Bolton said Wednesday.”
* Bill Barr finds another way to make Trump happy: “The nation’s top prosecutor broadened the Trump administration’s authority to detain asylum seekers who cross the border illegally by declaring Tuesday that they are not entitled to bond hearings.”
* I guess we’re supposed to be thankful for her restraint : “White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump says her father asked her if she was interested in taking the job of World Bank chief but she passed on it.”
* How’s the whole “drain the swamp” thing going ? “Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has a new job: a more than $100,000-a-year post with a gold mining firm that’s pursuing project approvals involving the federal agency that Zinke left fewer than four months ago.”
* Keep in mind, Dowd hasn’t actually read the Mueller report: “John Dowd, President Donald Trump’s former lawyer, is calling the Mueller report ‘pure mischief’ and ‘not fair,’ believing that it will cause undue problems for the president.”
* Family separations : “Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union said in a federal court filing Monday night that the Trump administration’s one- to two-year timetable for reuniting potentially thousands of separated migrant families shows ‘a callous disregard for these families and should be rejected.’”
* A case we’ve been following: “A new victim has gone public in the Jeffrey Epstein case, filing a sworn affidavit in federal court in New York Tuesday, saying that she was sexually assaulted and her then-15-year-old sister molested by Epstein and his companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, in 1996.”
* The predictable reaction : “On Monday, the Trump administration followed through on its promise to formally label a segment of Iran’s military forces ‘terrorists.’ Today, Tehran fired back with its own provocative move: It now considers all US troops in the Middle East to be terrorists too.”

Ivanka Trump says she passed on opportunity to lead World Bank | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/ivanka-trump-says-she-passed-opportunity-lead-the-world-bank,"By Steve Benen Donald Trump recently conceded that he considered one of his adult daughters, White House aide Ivanka Trump, to lead the World Bank. In fact, the president told The Atlantic that he also saw her as a possible ambassador to the United Nations, but also thought she’d be a good fit at the World Bank because, as he put it, “she’s very good with numbers.”
It now appears the president did more than just contemplate this possibility.
White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump says her father asked her if she was interested in taking the job of World Bank chief but she passed on it.
In an Associated Press interview, President Donald Trump’s daughter said Wednesday she was happy with her current role in the administration. She spoke during a trip to Africa to promote a global women’s initiative.
Ivanka Trump says her father raised the job with her as “a question” and she told him she was “happy with the work” she’s doing…. Asked if her father had approached her about other top jobs, Ivanka Trump said she’d “keep that between” them.
There’s still some question as to the exact nature of the discussion. There’s a qualitative difference between a president asking, “Is this a position you might be interested in?” and a president saying, “I’m offering you this job.”
But in either case, we’re looking at a very strange dynamic.
As we discussed last week, it was shortly after the 2016 elections when Ivanka Trump said she would not take on a role in her father’s administration.
As regular readers know , it was a commitment she quickly abandoned. Ivanka Trump soon had a West Wing office , a staff , a policy portfolio , and a presence on the international stage .
We now also know, because her father admitted it on the record, that the president also had a conversation with her about possibly leading the World Bank – despite having none of the necessary qualifications or background – but she passed on the opportunity.
Imagine for a moment what Republicans would be saying if 80,000 votes in the Rust Belt went the other way and President Hillary Clinton were offering all of these opportunities to Chelsea Clinton.

Mueller report details Trump's efforts to undermine Russia scandal probe | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/mueller-report-details-trumps-efforts-undermine-russia-scandal-probe,"By Steve Benen As you’ve probably heard, the Justice Department released a redacted version of report late this morning, and while it’s impossible to summarize a 448-page document in two sentences, this Associated Press report struck me as quite compelling.
Public at last, special counsel Robert Mueller’s report revealed to a waiting nation Thursday that President Donald Trump tried to seize control of the Russia probe and force Mueller’s removal to stop him from investigating potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Mueller laid out multiple episodes in which Trump directed people around him to try to influence or curtail the Russia investigation after the special counsel’s appointment in May 2017.
Broadly speaking, we’re dealing that explored three central questions: did Russia attack American elections, did our adversaries have partners in Donald Trump’s political operation, and did Trump obstruct the investigation into what transpired.
The first question appears to have been answered in definitive fashion. Literally, the second sentence of the Mueller report says, “The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion.” It’s a detail the Republican president has never acknowledged, at least not publicly, and it’s an assessment that skeptics of the Russia scandal have long resisted, but by fair measure, the debate over this has run its course.
On a related note, the Mueller report went on to note that the investigation “established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome.” That, too, is a fairly obvious detail that both the president and other skeptics of the scandal have long resisted.
On the second question, related to possible cooperation between the Russian attackers and the campaign they were determined to help, the Mueller report also noted Trump’s political operation “expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts.”
What’s more, the Republican campaign “showed interest in WikiLeaks’ releases of documents and welcomed their potential to damage” Hillary Clinton.
And while there’s no shortage of redactions in relevant parts of the Mueller report, it leaves little doubt that there were extensive connections between Russians and Trump insiders, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s briefings with Konstantin Kilimnik, whom “the FBI assesses to have ties to Russian intelligence.”
The report added that while the connections between Moscow and Trump’s campaign didn’t rise to the level of criminal misconduct, the investigation did identify “numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.”
But perhaps the most striking aspect of the report, at least for me, are the elements referred to in the aforementioned Associated Press excerpt. For all of Attorney General Bill Barr’s talk this morning about White House “cooperation’ with the investigation, there can be little doubt that Trump personally and directly took repeated ongoing – and not just by refusing to sit down for an interview.
It’s obviously a tough thing to summarize in a blog post – I’m going to hope you’ll watch tonight’s show – but the case for obstruction is remarkably strong.
“[T]he investigation established that several individuals affiliated with the Trump Campaign lied to the Office, and to Congress, about their interactions with Russian-affiliated individuals and related matters,” the Mueller report noted. “Those lies materially impaired the investigation of Russian election interference.”
The president personally made “non-public efforts to control” the special counsel probe,” the report added, and engaged in efforts “in both investigation.”
It went to say, “[I]f we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state.” They made no such statement, Trump’s hysteria about “no obstruction” notwithstanding.
In fact, reading the document, it seemed at times that the president would face even more serious legal jeopardy if only members of his team did more to follow his instructions: “The president’s efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.”
Those requests included Trump’s efforts to, among other things, fire Mueller before the investigation’s end.
These two paragraphs are personal favorites, highlighting a conversation between the president and then-White House Counsel Don McGahn.
The President also asked McGahn in the meeting why he had told Special Counsel’s Office investigators that the President had told him to have the Special Counsel removed. McGahn responded that he had to and that his conversations with the President were not protected by attorney-client privilege. The President then asked, “What-about these notes? Why do you take notes? Lawyers don ‘t take note s. I never had a lawyer who took notes .”
McGahn responded that he keeps notes because he is a “real lawyer ” and explained that notes create a record and are not a bad thing. The President said, “I’ve had a lot of great lawyers, like Roy Cohn. He did not take notes.”
On more than one occasion, the Mueller report added that the investigators’ findings would’ve been more complete, were it not for all of the lying and deletions of relevant messages.
It’s probably safe to say I could get a couple hundred blog posts out of the Mueller report, but for now, I’ll just say this: if Donald Trump thinks this document is good news, he’s fooled himself into believing complete nonsense.

If the president was willing to “fully” cooperate, wouldn’t he have agreed to answer investigators’ questions?
We learned in the Mueller report that investigators considered a subpoena to compel Trump to answer questions, but they ultimately passed, concluding that the legal fight would create excessive delays in the probe. The special counsel’s office instead agreed to a written Q&A with the president.
As the Washington Post noted , it didn’t go especially well.
They covered four primary topic areas: the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016, the Russian effort to interfere with the election, the proposed development project in Moscow and contacts with Russia or Russia-related issues during the campaign and transition. In total, the Mueller team asked 38 distinct questions with 37 follow-ups.
Trump offered 22 distinct answers. In 19 of those answers, he claims not to remember or recall some particular issue. Often, those failures to remember what happened constitute the entirety of his response.
Questions related to obstruction of justice weren’t answered at all.
The Mueller report noted, in reference to Trump’s responses, “We viewed the written answers to be inadequate.” Imagine that.
But to appreciate what makes this even more amazing, it’s worth revisiting how proud the president was in his answers.
Circling back to our earlier coverage , Trump originally claimed he was eager to sit down with investigators to answer their questions. When the president’s legal defense team realized he’d inevitably lie, they negotiated the terms of a written interview, about which Trump was eager to boast .
“I write the answers.” Trump told reporters six months ago. “My lawyers don’t write answers, I write answers. I was asked a series of questions. I have answered them very easily. Very easily…. The questions were very routinely answered by me. By me. Okay?”
As it turns out, the Republican answered the questions “very easily” because it doesn’t take a lot of effort to skip over difficult lines of inquiry, while writing, “I don’t remember” in response to the others.
Trump has bragged more than once that he has “one of the great memories of all time” I’m starting to think that might not be altogether true.

Trump can't let go of his preoccupation with Obama | MSNBC,www.msnbc.com,Steve Benen,04-19-2019,2019,4,http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-cant-let-go-his-preoccupation-obama,"By Steve Benen Donald Trump didn’t have a whole lot to say about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report yesterday afternoon, though the president did get around to sharing a predictable thought via Twitter: he blamed his predecessor.
“Anything the Russians did concerning the 2016 Election was done while Obama was President. He was told about it and did nothing! Most importantly, the vote was not affected.”
Nearly everything in Trump’s tweet was wrong. The vote was affected . Barack Obama did a lot more than “nothing,” and he would’ve done more were it not for Mitch McConnell’s opposition. The “anything the Russians did…” suggests Trump may still have some doubts as to the nature of the Russians’ attack, which is an issue that does not lend itself to skepticism.
But routine nonsense is less interesting to me than Trump’s ongoing preoccupation with the president who preceded him. I thought it was at least possible that the Republican, in time, would stop obsessing over the recent past, but by some measures, Trump fixates on Obama nearly as much as Hillary Clinton.
Yesterday, for example, Trump blamed Obama for the Russia attack. Earlier this week, Trump made up a story about hearing from a “big tough guy” who was “crying” because Obama ruined his life . Last week, Trump focused his attention on his approval rating – as compared to Obama’s .
Earlier that day, Trump tried to defend his family-separation policy by falsely claiming it was actually Obama’s policy . Four days earlier, Trump went after Joe Biden by condemning Obama .
Three days earlier, Trump told the National Republican Congressional Committee, “By the way, the carbon and all of the things flying up in the air, you know, the carbon footprint? President Obama used to talk about the carbon footprint and he’d hop on Air Force One, a big 747 with very old engines, and he’d fly to Hawaii to play a round of golf. Now, you tell me, the carbon footprint. But that’s the way it is.”
Obama, incidentally, never flew to Hawaii solely to play a round of golf.
The week before that, Trump suggested Obama was responsible for orchestrating a conspiratorial scheme against the Republican campaign in 2016.
I’m reminded of this Politico piece from two years ago which highlighted the Republican’s “obsession.”
Donald Trump just can’t quit Barack Obama.
From entering politics as the chief promoter of the birtherism conspiracy – complete with claims of mysterious calls coming in to him with new information to detectives he claimed he sent to Hawaii but were never heard from again – to waking up Saturday morning tweeting, “How low has President Obama gone to tapp [sic] my phones,” Obama’s always there for Trump.
Two years later, is anyone prepared to argue that Trump’s focus has changed?
As we discussed a while back, at a certain level, I can understand the fixation. Obama was a successful, popular president, whose stature appears even greater when compared to his successor.
But that’s all the more reason for Trump to choose a different foil.

* South Florida : “Federal authorities today announced that John Kless, a 49-year-old resident of Tamarac in Broward County, called three Democrats at their Washington, D.C. offices April 16 and left voicemail messages threatening murder.
