By J. D. Heyes
In February POTUS Donald Trump, acting on the advice and counsel of his Homeland Security officials and political counsel, declared a national emergency along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Painting the declaration with the usual brushes of “bigotry,” “racism,” and “hate,” Democrats wasted no time in mounting opposition to the declaration, which they managed to push through the House of Representatives.
Unfortunately, the GOP-controlled Senate also approved legislation opposing the president’s declaration. Undeterred, however, POTUS issued his first legislative veto, and the House was unable to override it.
But rather than help the president address the growing crisis, Democrats and some RINOs in Congress have since pivoted to other issues that are far less important or pressing — like gun control, the president’s taxes, and seeing the complete report on the Russian collusion hoax filed recently by special counsel Robert Mueller.
Meanwhile, the border crisis has only gotten worse — so much so, in fact, that seasoned Border Patrol agents and others living along the southwestern boundary are now witnessing a crush of illegal immigrants in numbers they’ve never seen before.
And our country’s ability to handle all of them has been overwhelmed.
As noted by The Wall Street Journal in early March, Border Patrol arrests of migrant families reached an all-time high, which led to the chief of Customs and Border Protection then to declare the system is at “the breaking point.”
The paper reported further:
From October through February, border agents arrested 136,150 people traveling in families at the southern border. Those figures exceeded the record for a full, 12-month period; 107,212 people were arrested during the federal fiscal year that ended in September.
More than 66,400 people were arrested in February, making it the busiest month since President Trump took office and the busiest February since 2008. Since 2013, when the U.S. Customs and Border Protection began counting family units, there have been 2.6 million total apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border. “Really, we’ve never seen anything like this before”
Of course, it’s appropriate to ask who is behind migrant invasions, what is the ultimate purpose for them, and — importantly — what can the U.S. government do to exert the kind of pressure on those responsible to get them to stop. And it’s very likely those questions are either being asked or have been answered already, and ‘diplomatic efforts’ are taking place behind the scenes to deal with the problem.
But in the meantime, the “situation is not sustainable,” said CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan last month. “The system is well beyond capacity and remains” at the point of failure.
“The surge numbers are just overwhelming the entire system,” he added.
Cities along the Tex-Mex border are especially hard-hit. McAllen, Texas, for example, according to USA Today — hardly a conservative/Republican media organ — reported that asylum seekers are being released into the city at a rate exceeding 800 per day . They have been herded into church shelters, makeshift camps, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement shelters, which are full to capacity.
“It’s staggering,” McAllen City Manager Roy Rodriguez told the paper. “Really, we’ve never seen anything like this before.”
Theresa Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, who was a CBP policy adviser under Presidents George W. Bush and Obama, put the situation even more bluntly: “This is a system-wide collapse.”
But is it? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who is safely ensconced in an upstate mansion when she’s home or surrounded by gates and guards in Washington, D.C., has accused the president of fomenting fear with the “illusion” of an emergency at the border. Other Democrats have said similar things .
Record apprehensions, services taxed beyond their limits, and American cities pushed beyond their capacity to handle the overflow of humanity sounds like a pretty convincing national emergency.

German Football Association president Reinhard Grindel has bowed to pressure and resigned over a watch gift worth Ksh500, 000. Grindel received the gift from Ukrainian businessman and Uefa vice-president Grigoriy Surkis.
He claimed ignorance over the value or brand of the watch but apologized for his action. He said: “The price of the watch was £5,152 (about Ksh 500,000). I did not know the brand or its value at the time. “I apologise for my less-than-exemplary action of accepting the watch.”

Grindel had served as the president of the football body for three years.

Pennsylvania took in more revenue than expected in March, but the state’s overall revenue collections for 2019 still lag behind the same point in 2018.
The Independent Fiscal Office on Monday released its “ Monthly Trends Report ,” indicating that the state took in $4.55 billion in revenue last Month, $2 million more than the IFO had projected and $228.9 million more than the state took in during March 2018.
The revenue generated in March goes some way to covering this year’s decline vs. last year. So far in 2019 Pennsylvania has collected $24.8 billion. At the same point last year, that number was $25.3 billion, a difference of $523.6 million.
Despite lagging 2018’s numbers, the state is actually doing better for 2019 than the IFO had expected, running at 1.6 percent better than it expected when it comes to revenue.
Among the revenue subcategories where the state performed well in March were the corporate net income tax, the insurance premiums tax, personal income tax and sales and use tax. Lagging revenue sectors included the gross receipts tax and the cigarette tax.
“Sales and use tax (SUT) was above estimate ($8.4 million) for the month,” the IFO reported. “The surplus from higher than anticipated nonmotor vehicle collections ($12.2 million) was partially offset by lower motor vehicle collections (-$3.8 million).”
While Pennsylvania has enjoyed strong tax collections the past couple of years, allowing the state to put money into its rainy day fund for the first time since the 2008 recession, some observers have argued that simply allowing government to grow, even without launching large new spending initiatives, is setting the state up for difficulties in the future and stifling economic growth.
Colleen Hroncich, a senior fellow at the Commonwealth Foundation, a public policy nonprofit, argued recently that a Taxpayer Protection Act would allow the state to maintain financial security in good times and bad while reducing the burden on taxpayers.
“[T]he commonwealth’s total operating budget, which includes the General Fund and Shadow Budget, has more than tripled since 1970 (adjusted for inflation),” Hroncich wrote. “This growth amounts to $4,503 more per resident, or $18,014 per family of four.”
She argued that the TPA wouldn’t preclude government growth in good times, just that it would have to be a deliberate decision rather than something that automatically outpaces economic growth.
“The Taxpayer Protection Act’s spending limits would begin to reverse Pennsylvania’s unsustainable spending trend,” she wrote. “Like properly used reins, there would be some give. The TPA allows government to grow – it just limits that growth to a reasonable amount tied to population increase and inflation. Moreover, the TPA-imposed spending limit may be exceeded if approved by a supermajority of the General Assembly.” Dave Lemery is the Pennsylvania & New Hampshire News Editor for Watchdog.org .

Shane Jones under further pressure over Ministerial responsibilities and influence,yournz.org,Pete George,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://yournz.org/2019/04/03/shane-jones-under-further-pressure-over-ministerial-responsibilities-and-influence/,"2017 General Election Shane Jones under further pressure over Ministerial responsibilities and influence
Shane Jones has been seen by some as a ticking political time bomb. He already must have tested the Prime Minister’s mettle in trying to keep Ministers in line, especially Ministers from other parties in the coalition.
Jones has, according to some, stepped more significantly over a ministerial line.
NZ Herald: Shane Jones wades in against NZTA over legal case against Northland trucking company NZ First’s Shane Jones has stepped into the middle of legal action between the NZ Transport Agency and Northland’s biggest logging transport operator, even though he holds the portfolio of Associate Transport Minister. Jones said he was speaking as the Regional Economic Development Minister when he expressed concern to the Herald about a case between the NZ Transport Agency and Semenoff Logging. “I’m concerned about the economic implications flowing from issues between NZTA and Semenoff Logging,” Jones said, following a High Court decision last Monday where the transporter won temporary suspension of a ban on its licence. On March 15, NZTA revoked Semenoff’s transport services licence over a range of safety issues, due to take effect on March 22. But on March 20, the business of the ex-Whangarei mayor Stan Semenoff hit back and sought a temporary stay on that licence ban, although the case is yet to go to a full hearing.
Jones is related to Semenoff. Justice Mark Woolford said in his March 25 decision in the High Court at Auckland that the Whangarei company is “the largest logging haulage company in Northland … responsible for 50 per cent of Northland’s wood flow and log haulage.” Jones said his concern was over the agency’s court action last month. That saw Semenoff’s licence revoked and followed two audits revealing 116 speed and traffic-related offences in four years, a high percentage of vehicles failing on brake system faults, driver fatigue and behaviour, breaches of work time and rest time rules and pervasive logbook issues. Jones said: “Constitutionally, I must not comment on the High Court case. Both parties are entitled to state their views before the court. On the question of regional development, obviously, forestry is a key and jobs are incredibly important to our growth.
“I’m concerned about the future of 1000 jobs in Northland which could be on the line due to the High Court case. The High Court case doesn’t prohibit the first citizen of the provinces from advocating on behalf of economic development.
“As associate transport minister, obviously safety issues are incredibly important. Now you can understand why I am a great enthusiast of upgrading the railway line for Northport,” Jones said yesterday. Paul Goldsmith, National’s transport spokesman… …said Jones should not be commenting on the NZTA case at all. “Given the issue is soon to be in front of the courts, it is inappropriate for him to be commenting. This is basic stuff. It shows, once again, a lack of discipline from the minister.
In Parliament today: SPEAKER : Before I call question No. 8, I will indicate to the House that the member asking the question has written to me pursuant to Standing Order 115(2).
Standing Order 115(2):
115 Matters subject to judicial decision
(1) Matters awaiting or under adjudication in, or suppressed by an order of, any New Zealand court may not be referred to in any motion, debate, or question, including a supplementary question, subject always to the discretion of the Speaker and to the right of the House to legislate on any matter or to consider delegated legislation.
(2) To enable the exercise of the Speaker’s discretion under paragraph (1), a member who intends to refer to such a matter must give written notice to the Speaker of this intention.
Question No. 8— Regional Economic Development 8. Hon PAUL GOLDSMITH (National) to the Minister for Regional Economic Development : Does he stand by all his statements and actions? Hon SHANE JONES (Minister for Regional Economic Development) : Yes. Hon Paul Goldsmith : After he told the New Zealand Herald yesterday, “Constitutionally, I must not comment on the High Court case.”, referring to a case between the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) and Semenoff Logging, why did he then proceed to comment on the case? Hon SHANE JONES : Naturally, I won’t comment further on the case. The principles of comity and privilege are important constitutional privileges that define our system, but there is no stone that should be put upon the tongue of the champion of the regions to talk about the implications of decisions that our Government may, from time to time, be held accountable for. Hon Paul Goldsmith : Has he discussed the case with any officials or ministerial colleagues; if so, who? Hon SHANE JONES : I have had absolutely nothing to do with the decision associated with the NZTA, and, indeed, that’s why the court case exists, as people are entitled to test whether or not statutory authority has been exceeded. I have not raised this matter with my fellow transport Ministers, and I have had one discussion—very brief—with the CEO of the NZTA. His name eludes me; he’s a short-term traveller. SPEAKER : Order! Order! The member will withdraw that last reflection on a member outside of— Hon SHANE JONES : I withdraw and apologise. Hon Paul Goldsmith : Is Stan Semenoff his mother’s cousin, as he told the Otago Daily Times in 2009 when explaining a $2,000 donation from him? Hon SHANE JONES : During the 2008 election, I declared, in 2009, that I had received a $2,000 koha—contribution. Stan Semenoff’s great-great-grandmother is my mother’s great-great-great-grandmother.
Following that: National say Shane Jones has waded into a matter before the courts – Jones says he hasn’t Regional Economic Development Minister Shane Jones says he is entitled to talk about challenges in the regions, after criticisms that he was wading into a matter before the courts. This follows National’s Paul Goldsmith saying Jones had “serious questions” he needed to answer about his recent comments. Goldsmith said it was “constitutionally inappropriate for any minister to wade in on a matter before the courts”. Act Leader David Seymour said Jones’ conduct falls short of the expectations for Ministers to behave in a way that upholds the “highest ethical standards”.
In the House today, Jones said he won’t “comment further” on the case. Speaking to reporters after he left the House, he elaborated. “Obviously, I’m entitled to continue to talk about challenges in the regions. I specifically said I was not commenting on that court case.” He said his focus was on the issues – in this case, “the supply chain impact in the North in the Forestry and logging”. “I have not commented on anything to do with the innards of that court case, although the judicial review is still to happen, this was an injunction or something like that. “It’s important that we don’t embroil ourselves in court cases. There is no court case at this stage, because it hasn’t begun.” He said his comments were not made with his Associate Minister of Transport hat on – “I made those remarks as the Minister of Regional Economic Development”. Outside the House, he said the conversation was not about Semenoff. “He knows that I did not discuss the innards of this court case. It had to do with another statement that Meredith Connell had made in the newspaper.” The selective use of ministerial hats has been a contentious issue in the past. Share this:"
CNN’s Russia Obsession Wasn’t Journalism—it Was Activism,westernfreepress.com,James Ledbetter,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://westernfreepress.com/cnns-russia-obsession-wasnt-journalism-it-was-activism/,"0 0
From the day President Trump announced his bid for president in 2015 up until now, the leftist media has attacked him relentlessly. They do it no matter what he does. He could announce the cure for cancer and they would blame cancer on him.
Interestingly, If you bothered watching CNN and MSNBC in the past 24 hours, you may have noticed they have a new obsession, and a new target to feign their moral outrage at, and they have decided to hyperventilate and go wall-to-wall with hysterical coverage about Trump, Mueller, and the Mueller report. ( RELATED: Jerry Nadler Calls for Vote to Subpoena Full Mueller Report )
CNN claims to be journalists, but attack Trump–acting as activists. Journalists are responsible for presenting the facts to the American people. Yet, CNN is pushing an agenda. With their Russia obsession now fully revealed as baseless, liberals have perversely legitimated the monstrous Trump. “Trump begins post-Mueller ‘reset’ by strafing Democrats, media” https://t.co/UonhFynU10
— Doug Henwood (@DougHenwood) March 25, 2019
The media in this country has zero credibility. The whole time Mueller was investigating, they claimed to have evidence that Trump colluded with Russia. Now, Mueller has released his report and the leftists are apoplectic.
Additionally, Democrat politicians are still saying the same things they were saying before Mueller finished his report. How is that not activism?
AG William Barr released a summary stating, (With direct quotes from Mueller) that there was no evidence of collusion. The left refuses to believe Barr. Now, Barr has announced that he and Mueller are working together to issue a version of Mueller’s report that is redacted to protect jurors and third party individuals.
Mueller stated in the report, in his own words, that his probe “did not establish” any conspiracy or coordination between Donald Trump’s campaign members and the Russian government to interfere with the election. ( RELATED: WATCH: Laura Ingraham Shares Her Own “Creepy Joe” Me Too Moment )
However, that isn’t good enough for the Democrats. They want Barr to break the law and release the unredacted report. You can’t get any clearer than that.
Moreover, CNN and MSNBC are nothing more than extensions of the Democratic Party, all things leftist, and pretty much all they do is parrot alt-left media talking points and of course, attack President Trump 24/7, all in an attempt to damage, delegitimize his presidency.
Yet, they can’t figure out why their ratings have dropped: Cable News Rankings Saturday March 30"
"If e-cigarettes help smokers quit, treat them as any other prescription medicine",thehill.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/436951-if-e-cigarettes-help-smokers-quit-treat-them-as-any-other-prescription,"If e-cigarettes help smokers quit, treat them as any other prescription medicine By Dan Romer, opinion contributor — 04/02/19 02:30 PM EDT The views expressed by contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill View Latest Opinions >> The secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar and the outgoing commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Scott Gottlieb, recently declared the “e-cigarette craze” among teenagers an epidemic . There has been a nearly 80 percent increase in current e-cigarette use among high-school-age teenagers over the previous year, they said, citing the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey, and an almost 40 percent increase in teens using e-cigarettes on 20 or more of the past 30 days. Despite the rapid rise in trial and use of e-cigarettes among youth, this newer nicotine-delivery system has mainly served to supplement the use of other tobacco products among teens. The overall prevalence of tobacco use in youth has not changed in recent years. It's not surprising given the widespread dual and triple use of tobacco products among youth. ADVERTISEMENT Use of any tobacco product seemingly encourages use of other products and one that delivers such a potent dose of nicotine is likely to make this situation worse. Adolescents who start using e-cigarettes will likely try other tobacco products, including regular cigarettes. Manufacturers of e-cigarettes clearly try to have it both ways. Juul, manufacturer of the most popular e-cigarette, sells flavors such as mango, crème, fruit and mint, all the while claiming their product is for adult smokers only. In March, the FDA limited retail sales of fruity flavors in an effort to keep them out of convenience stores and gas stations , where teens and children might readily obtain them. But as the FDA apparently realizes, this will not be enough to keep these products out of the hands of adolescents. Writing in the Washington Post, Azar and Gottlieb recently asked the industry “to step up with meaningful measures to reduce the access and appeal of e-cigarettes to young people.” The response so far from Juul has been a $10 million TV ad campaign to promote its highly addictive product. These ads claim that their product is an alternative way for adult smokers to transition away from regular cigarettes. And they produce anecdotal evidence that adults have used them to stop using regular cigarettes. They are doing this despite the fact that it has no public health benefit for those not currently using cigarettes – and despite the fact that these devices have not been approved by the FDA as an effective cessation treatment. So, here’s a suggestion. If these products are meant to shift cigarette smokers away from their habit, and if that is where their value lies, then let FDA evaluate their effectiveness as a smoking cessation device for smokers. If they prove to be effective, make e-cigarettes available by prescription only. A recent trial in the U.K. found that e-cigarettes were about as effective as medications such Chantix in helping smokers to quit. But even this evidence suggests that if it is an effective cessation device, it should only be available by prescription for those addicted to cigarettes. It is now clearer than ever that the introduction of the e-cigarette as a smoking cessation product should never have been allowed to enter the tobacco market over-the-counter. The widespread availability of e-cigarettes is clearly antithetical to public health even if the product helps some adult users of cigarettes to give up that even more dangerous habit. As a result, the FDA is now forced to spend taxpayer money to design an educational media campaign to be released this summer to warn adolescents about the hazards of nicotine addiction caused by e-cigarettes. It is also evident that the FDA is conflicted about the best way to stop the use of tobacco. It is pursuing the idea of essentially eliminating nicotine from tobacco products in the hopes of making these products unappealing . But at the same time, it is intrigued by the strategy put forth by the makers of e-cigarettes to allow proliferation of a new product that, when inhaled, delivers high doses of nicotine. At some point, these conflicting strategies must be reconciled. The makers of e-cigarettes probably welcome the possibility that their product will eventually become the only item on the market that promises to deliver strong doses of nicotine without harm to its users. However, even if e-cigarettes turn out to be free of health costs, something which is far from clear, making it a prescription drug would at least recognize its potential for abuse as an addictive substance that could hook generations of adolescents on this product. Users of cigarettes should welcome the idea of purchasing e-cigarettes by prescription because as a treatment for a medical condition, it should be covered by health insurance. Getting nicotine at reduced or no cost should appeal to cigarette users. And the tobacco industry should not oppose it because if e-cigarettes can be proven to be an effective cessation device as they claim, the industry will garner profits from it — just as manufacturers of any other popular medical treatment. What the industry should not be permitted to do is to claim that the product is a cessation device and at the same time be allowed to sell it over the counter to current non-users of cigarettes, especially adolescents. Some may argue that making it available by prescription only will not prevent its misuse by teens. There are certainly cases in which prescription drugs seep into the hands of persons who do not have the condition that the drug is designed for. But this would happen with far less ease for e-cigarettes than occurs today. Imagine if stimulants that are prescribed for conditions such as ADHD were available over the counter. Would we allow this knowing the likelihood of abuse? If not, why should we allow another addictive product marketed as a cessation device for smokers be sold over the counter and made more readily available to teens?

Wrap yourself up like a burrito in a tortilla blanket,www.providencejournal.com,"Abigail Rosenthal, Austin American-Statesman",04-04-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/zz/entertainmentlife/20190403/wrap-yourself-up-like-burrito-in-tortilla-blanket?rssfeed=true,"Wrap yourself up like a burrito in a tortilla blanket
Ever pulled a hot tortilla off the comal and thought that life would be almost perfect if you could wrap yourself up in it? Or do you frequently wrap yourself in a blanket and pretend to be an actual burrito? It won’t quite be the same thing, but you can fulfill those dreams by getting your own blanket that looks like a tortilla.
Reddit user u/Kotaay posted a collage of the burrito blanket showing it in three different states of being, complete with griddle marks and coming in a perfect circle. It proved to be a very popular idea. Burrito filling always has seemed very cozy -- why not achieve maximum coziness in a tortilla blanket?
Burrito blanket fromr/INEEEEDIT
No telling where u/Kotaay got that particular blanket, but there’s a very similar one available on Etsy, and there’s one on Amazon that comes in three different diameters. Burritoblanket.com is also an option, though they’re currently sold out.
If you’re more partial to corn over flour or towels over blankets, Walmart has a corn tortilla beach towel so you can take your love for tacos everywhere, including the beach or pool.

CAIRO- Islamic State claimed to have kidnapped and killed a Canadian citizen in Burkina Faso in January, but security sources said they believed he actually died during a botched attempt by a criminal gang to sell him on to another group.Canadian geologist Kirk Woodman's body was found on Jan. 16, two days after his abduction by a dozen gunmen at a mining site operated by Vancouver-based Progress Minerals in the northeast of the landlocked West African country. Burkina Faso officials said he had been shot, and his body was dumped in an area that is under growing threat from Islamist militants, some with links to Islamic State and al Qaeda.In an article trumpeting Islamic State's insurgencies in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, the group's weekly Al-Naba newspaper detailed an operation to kidnap and kill Woodman and showed a photograph of what it claimed was his driver's license.The Islamic State newspaper said ""the kidnapping and killing of a Canadian crusader"" has increased the West's interest in ""the war of the Mujahideen"" in Burkina Faso.Two security sources in Burkina Faso, however, told Reuters that they thought Woodman was abducted by a criminal gang and killed as it tried to sell him on to presumed jihadists.Woodman's body was left in the desert by ""the Caliphate soldiers,"" Al-Naba said, though it put a date on Woodman's execution using the Islamic calendar that would equate to Jan. 25 - several days after the body was actually found.

PARIS - Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven nations meet on Friday in France to prepare for the leaders' summit in August, but the absence of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo underscores how tough agreeing common ground between allies has become.Ten months after US President Donald Trump threw the efforts of other leaders to show a united front into disarray by leaving early, backing out of a joint communique and criticizing his Canadian host, senior diplomats are scrambling to avoid a repeat episode. France, which took over the rotating presidency of the group of major industrialized nations, has scaled back its ambitions, counting on minor advances in areas where consensus can be found easily, including the dangers of cyber crime for democracy and tackling inequalities between men and women.""The idea is to avoid losing energy on texts that do not bring much, whereas what (President) Emmanuel Macron wants is that our presidency makes it possible to advance on specific topics,"" said a senior French diplomat ahead of the meeting on Friday and Saturday in the Brittany seaside resort of Dinard.Along with the United States and France, the group includes Japan, Germany, Britain, Italy, Canada and the European Union. The ministerial meeting is critical to ensuring that when the leaders convene in Biarritz in August, they are largely in agreement.But tensions between the United States and its European allies, particularly over trade, climate issues and the nuclear deal with Iran, have meant that where they were once in agreement, they now seek the lowest common denominator.""The G7 has become the United Nations of democracies. It's the same divisions and blockages,"" said Dominique Moisi, a special adviser to the IFRI foreign relations think tank in Paris.""Can we come up with a common position on Russia, China, the Middle East? It's damage limitation.""The US State Department gave no reason why Pompeo was not attending even though he had no other engagements in his diary.His deputy, John Sullivan, will replace him for broad discussions, including on the crisis in Venezuela, Iran's destabilizing behavior in the Middle East and the denuclearization of North Korea, the State Department said.""Symbolically, it sends a pretty negative message: Pompeo has better things to do,"" said a seasoned G7 diplomat based in Paris. ""The US is isolated, but the US dictates the tempo and we fit in behind.""

The vast majority of President Trump’s nominees to the federal district courts have been blocked by Democrats in the Senate. Some of them have languished for more than a year, without an up-or-down floor vote on their confirmation.
Tuesday afternoon Democrats rejected a fair compromise offered by Senate Republicans to break the logjam. On a nearly party-line vote, the Senate killed Senate Resolution 50 which would have established a new procedure to facilitate timely confirmation of nominees approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Sixty votes were needed to advance S.Res. 50, and even though Republicans enjoy majority control of the Senate, they cannot muster the super-majority to attain cloture on changing the rules for nominees. So this leaves Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with only the nuclear option to overcome Democratic obstructionism.
While the Senate has promptly confirmed Trump’s nominees to the Courts of Appeal and the Supreme Court, Democrats have blocked dozens of excellent nominees to the lower courts. There are an astounding 133 vacancies today in federal district courts and 13 more vacancies will arise soon.
But under current Senate rules, Democrats are forcing several days of delay in confirming each district court judge whenever any senator wants to stall it. At this rate, President Trump would be denied his ability to fill a significant percentage of the trial court vacancies and Democrats hope keep these vacancies unfilled until after the next presidential election. View Cartoon
District courts are the tribunals that conduct all federal trials and they are where the vast majority of federal judiciary decisions are made. These are the courts that have repeatedly issued injunctions against President Trump, which he then has to run up on appeal to get them overturned months later.
It is federal district courts which issue injunctions in favor of Planned Parenthood virtually any time it demands them. It can take years to overturn those injunctions on appeal and often the appellate court simply remands the case back to the same district court, which then rules for Planned Parenthood again.
This means that while the U.S. Courts of Appeal have the last say in many cases, the federal district courts are the place where most litigation occurs. As a practical matter, continued liberal control of the district courts means never-ending judicial activism.
So it is not surprising that Democrats have done everything they can to continue their grip on the district courts. By causing seemingly endless hours of debate on each and every district court nominee, Democrats have frustrated the ability of President Trump to obtain confirmation of his judges at the trial level.
Democrats have obstructed district court nominees to such an extent that it has taken an average of 133 days – more than a third of a year – for the Senate to vote on a nominee after approval by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service found that 37 district court nominees still await a floor vote after approval by the Judiciary Committee.
In some states, such as Missouri, not a single judicial nominee has been confirmed during the more than two years that Trump has been president. Indeed, since January both senators from Missouri are Republican and thus not even senatorial courtesy can be blamed, whereby a senator from the state can block a nominee by failing to return a blue slip.
Mississippi is another conservative state which has not had a single Trump judge appointed to a federal district court there. One vacancy has been pending for more than a year in its Southern District and another vacancy is expected there at the end of this month.

In Texas, another solidly Republican state, its Southern District, which includes Houston, has three vacancies. The Northern District of Texas, which includes Dallas, has five vacancies and five nominees by President Trump await confirmation by the Senate.
Senator Mitch McConnell expressed his justified frustration about this obstinance by the Democrats. He observed that their intransigence on these district court nominees “is unsustainable for the Senate and for the country,” and warned that it does not bode well for a future Democratic president either, because Republicans would return the favor in blocking his nominee.
If Democrats had supported Senate Resolution 50, then this gridlock on judges could have been amicably and sensible resolved. S.Res. 50 would have shortened the post-cloture time for a floor vote on presidential nominees, which means that Trump’s nominees could be brought to a vote without undue delay.
By rejecting this compromise, Democrats have made the nuclear option necessary to shut down the endless filibustering of these good Trump nominees. Majority Leader McConnell should next implement this option to proceed, with only a simple majority vote, to change the rules in order to hold timely floor votes on Trump’s district court nominees.
