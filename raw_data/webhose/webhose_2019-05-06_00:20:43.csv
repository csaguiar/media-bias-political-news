A national security and humanitarian crisis exists at the U.S.-Mexico border — but, for Democrats, it is not critical enough to join with Republicans to fix broken border control and immigration systems.
Instead of seeking compromise and solutions, Democrats seek to thwart the law and give more attention, aid and comfort to illegals than citizens. “Sanctuary cities” and providing social services have only encouraged illegal immigration, overburdened local governments, and prevented Americans from enjoying the benefits of services they pay for but cannot access.
We are at a near-systemwide meltdown at the southern border. As Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen
The statistics don’t lie. Despite the Democrats’ claims, this is not a “manufactured crisis."" ADVERTISEMENT
Late last year, DHS apprehended an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 migrants per month at the southern border.
Last month, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) apprehensions surpassed 100,000 – the highest monthly total in more than a decade. March 2019 apprehensions were 142 percent higher than in March 2018. On March 27, CBP officers saw the highest total daily apprehensions in more than a decade — 4,117 migrants caught at ports of entry in a single day.
So far this year, approximately100 large groups of migrants have arrived at our border. At the current rate, we are on track to apprehend 1 million migrants at the border this year.
Prior to 2013, one out of every 100 migrants sought asylum. Now, that number has skyrocketed to one out of every 10. President Trump Donald John Trump Top senators warn Turkey: Choose between Russia missile system or US fighter jet Former Michelle Obama aide: 'Not sure' if voters got 'honesty and accountability' in Biden's video response How Republicans are battling judicial obstructionism today MORE has warned repeatedly that our border is overwhelmed. Our immigration system was not designed to handle this volume, and our weak borders are being exploited by human traffickers, drug smugglers and violent gangs like MS-13.
Obama administration border officials agree there is a crisis at the southern border. President Obama’s DHS secretary, Jeh Johnson, has said that “we are truly in a crisis.” One former Obama Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official said that the “stunning numbers” are causing a “legitimate crisis.”
Yet, congressional Democrats have been unwilling to work with President Trump to secure the border. The Democrats who have announced so far as 2020 presidential candidates continue to oppose any border wall, have voiced support for tearing down existing barriers, or have called for ICE to be abolished.
On Tuesday, 2020 presidential candidate and former Obama Housing and Urban Development secretary Julian Castro Julian Castro Meet the longshot yogi from the Rust Belt running for president Will it take more deaths or disaster for Washington to fix immigration and border security? CNN announces string of 2020 town halls MORE (D-Texas) called for decriminalizing border crossings.
Now is the time for Republicans and Democrats in Congress to act, to close “catch and release” immigration loopholes, and to address the root causes of the crisis at the border. They also need to address the millions of illegals who have been here for decades, as well as the “Dreamers,” those who were brought here as children.
We need to fix a broken visa system, and we must improve the “E-Verify” program to allow needed foreign labor access to American employment as needed and wanted.
The main job of government is to prevent harm, not merely respond to it. Often, it seems that it takes a catastrophic event before the country unites to deal with something that could and should have been prevented.
We are near that stage now.
It’s time to put politics aside and to make 2019’s immigration crisis a priority, instead of the 2020 presidential election cycle.
Perhaps when Democrats come to love their country more than they hate Donald Trump, that will be the time when problems get solved and the nation is served.
But let’s not wait to unite through mourning after some terrible migrant-related tragedy. Let’s act now through duty, honor and patriotism to fix a broken immigration system that has been caused, tolerated and exacerbated by both political parties, by our leaders in Congress and White House administrations, for too long.

Homestead detention facility to deny Democratic congresswomen access,floridapolitics.com,Jacob Ogles,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://floridapolitics.com/archives/292911-homestead-detention-facility-to-deny-democratic-congresswomen-access,"Homestead detention facility to deny Democratic congresswomen access
Democrats say denying access violates the law. Share this: April 6, 2019 A Homestead refugee detention facility plans to deny three Florida congresswomen access to the facility. U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Donna Shalala and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, all Democrats, planned to visit the Homestead Office of Refugee Resettlement . The representatives issued a joint statement slamming the decision. “Denying entry to oversee the conditions and care provided to the unaccompanied children in the Homestead facility would not only be a breach of transparency and confidence in the care provided there, it would violate the law,” the statement reads. Wasserman Schultz and then-U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson were similarly denied entry to the facility last year. After that happened, the statement notes, Congress took action. “Congress specifically addressed it by ensuring Members would have unencumbered access to such facilities to conduct our constitutionally mandated oversight responsibilities,” the statement reads. “Given long-held concerns about the Homestead facility’s lack of staffing, space, education and other services, the recent announcement by the Department of Health and Human Services that it will dramatically expand the number of beds there merits immediate scrutiny.” Wasserman Schultz sponsored the access law. President Donald Trump ’s administration this week announced a major expansion in the Homestead facilities, from 2,350 to 3,200 later this month. That comes after a boost from 1,350 beds to 2,350 beds in January. In total, Democrat point out, that’s a 140-percent increase in child bed capacity in just four months.
Notably, Shalala and Mucarsel-Powell toured the facility after the last expansion in beds. The detention of refugees and treatment of immigrants and family separation by federal officials became a major campaign issue last year. But this moves beyond political debate and into lawlessness, the congresswomen said. “The Department’s initial refusal to allow entry there under these current circumstances is deeply troubling,” the statement reads. “Violating the law is never acceptable, and certainly not in this critical moment.” Other Congressional leaders already warned that if officials denied visitation to members of Congress, there could be consequences. U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, chair of the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, on Friday said so much in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar . “The representatives intend to visit the facility to conduct oversight of the condition of the facility and care received by the unaccompanied alien children,” DeLauro wrote. “If the Department of Health and Human Services denies them access, the Department would be in violation of the law.” She urged the department to ensure Homestead officials complied with statute.

On February 15, Donald Trump declared a state of national emergency in order to fund his “ great, great ” border wall without having to go through Congress. There is, of course, no emergency, despite the rape fantasy that the president has regularly tried to pass off as public policy. In speech after speech, including his declaration of that emergency, he has told the same story: The United States needs a border wall to prevent sex traffickers from driving women into the country, bound with duct tape. Ad Policy
“Women are tied up,” he typically says . “They’re bound. Duct tape put around their faces, around their mouths. In many cases they can’t even breathe.”
It’s a scenario he’s only continued to elaborate over time. “They have tape over their mouths, electrical tape, usually blue tape, as they call it. It’s powerful stuff. Not good. And they have three, four, five of them in vans, or three of them in back seats of cars.” As they approach ports of entry, he swears, the vehicles carrying them “get off the road, and they drive out into the desert and they come in, they make a left turn—usually it’s a left, not a right.”
Fact-checkers and experts in border sex trafficking have been quick to insist that they know of no such incidents, however elaborately imagined—not one. Instead, most women and children forced into prostitution, they report, enter the country through legal ports of entry.
Border Patrol headquarters even sent out a request asking agents to provide any evidence whatsoever that might help support the president’s tall tales. None apparently did. It’s worth noting that Trump first added stories of duct-taped women to his border repertoire in early January, not too long after the heartbreaking news broke of the discovery of two Saudi sisters, 16 and 22, found dead in New York City’s Hudson River, duct-taped together. Their deaths were ruled suicides, committed after the United States denied them asylum and ordered them deported to Saudi Arabia, a close American ally. Their bodies even washed up on West 68th Street and Riverside Drive, close to Trump Place Condominiums. (He seems inescapable.)
In any case, one doesn’t need Sigmund Freud to grasp the crude displacement evidently underway here. By narrating the “crisis” on the border in a pornographic manner, painting it as a hellscape ruled by MS-13 murderers and rapists, President Trump is undoubtedly using ever more salacious fables to sublimate guilty desires, as well as his and the nation’s complicity in hellish atrocities.
Currently, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, has nearly 50,000 migrants in custody. That’s roughly the number of people Canada incarcerates in its entire prison system. And no one knows how many migrant children the United States is detaining, except that the number is much higher than the 2,737 listed in court documents. The Department of Health and Human Services can’t even provide journalists with an accurate count: “The total number of children separated from a parent or guardian by immigration authorities is unknown” is all its spokespeople can say.
Many of those children are housed in tent compounds in the desert or vacant Walmarts, forced to eat in shifts and sleep on the floors of chain-link cells covered only by a thin, metallic blanket. In one Florida detention center, children are packed “like sardines” in large halls stacked with bunk beds with little room even to walk. At such places, they are reportedly taunted or even sexually terrorized, either by staff or older migrants . They are overprescribed psychotropic drugs to numb them, given pills to make them sleep, and often refused medical attention when sick.
Border Patrol agents have even reportedly snatched babies from their mothers as they were breastfeeding them. Families have been tear gassed at the border and children have already died in Border Patrol custody (though “custody” is undoubtedly too soft a word to describe what the United States is doing to the progeny of nearby republics). “These kids are incarcerated,” said an MSNBC reporter who visited one of the detention complexes.
Some of the incarcerated migrant children are then delivered to a Christian adoption service with links to Trump’s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos. According to the Associated Press, the Trump administration has all but given up trying to reunite children placed in “sponsor” homes with their actual families, since returning them, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, “would present grave child welfare concerns.” Make Heaven Weep
Racial and sexual violence on the border has a long history. In Washington’s 1846 war on Mexico, for instance, which established the current boundary between the two countries, state militia volunteers and Army regulars rampaged across that region, burning churches, raping women, and scalping men.
On February 9, 1847, for example, a member of an Arkansas volunteer regiment raped a Mexican woman near the regiment’s camp at Agua Nueva in the state of Coahuila and Mexicans retaliated by killing a US soldier. In response, more than 100 of those Arkansas volunteers cornered a group of war refugees in a cave. Screaming “like fiends,” according to one witness, they raped and slaughtered their victims, even as the women and children among them were “shrieking for mercy.” By the time it ended, scores of Mexicans lay dead or dying on a cave floor thick with clotted blood. Many of them had been scalped. (That’s hardly surprising, since more than a few of those US Army volunteers had, in the pre-war years, made their livings on those same borderlands by scalping Apaches for bounty money, or “barbering” them, as one Texan scalp-hunter put it.)
Even before that massacre, General Winfield Scott, commander of US forces, wrote Washington to complain of other atrocities being committed by such volunteers, organized under the command of future president Zachary Taylor. The crimes of Taylor’s men, Scott said , were so heinous they would “make Heaven weep.”
When the war ended, Washington had taken all of Mexico’s northern territories, including all or parts of present-day Arizona, New Mexico, California, Nevada, western Colorado, Utah, and southwestern Wyoming. About 500,000 square miles, home to an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 people, had been added to the United States. The Immigration and Naturalization Service’s Chief Pimp
Sexual violence only continued, committed by members of the Border Patrol (founded in 1924) and other security forces like the Texas Rangers .
Starting in the 1970s, ever more middle-class families in the United States began hiring undocumented Mexican women as live-in servants, cooks, maids, and nannies. Many of them found themselves far from home in peonage-like conditions, unable to leave the houses in which they worked. Some of those women quickly found themselves not just trapped, but sexually and emotionally battered. One was locked in a house in Nevada for months, according to a witness: “She worked from sunup to way after dark. She requested that her wages be sent to her father in Mexico. No money was ever sent to her father. This went on for about a year and a half. Then she flipped—she became insane, broke out of the house and ran down the street. That’s when the Border Patrol got her.”
Others were raped by their employers and, if they complained, beaten or told that they would be handed over to the Border Patrol, which came to double as a labor procurement service for wealthy households and large ranchers. During those years, in fact, the Border Patrol and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) were notoriously corrupt, violent federal institutions. In Texas, Border Patrollers worked closely with ranchers, delivering workers to their properties (including one owned by Lyndon Johnson when he was still president), then raiding those properties just before payday and deporting the same workers. “The ranchers got their crops harvested for free, the INS men got fishing and hunting privileges on the ranches, and the Mexicans got nothing,” a New York Times reporter, John Crewdson, wrote .
An investigation into INS corruption revealed that agency officials traded young Mexican women caught at the border to the Los Angeles Rams for season tickets. One such official was known within the INS as the service’s “ chief pimp .” Part of his job was to help other officials and politicians, including New Jersey Democrat Peter Rodino (who presided over Richard Nixon’s impeachment in the House of Representatives), “get laid” by arranging visits to Mexican brothels.
In his memoir, a former guard, Tony Hefner, described the INS detention center in Port Isabel, Texas—overflowing in the 1980s with refugees from President Ronald Reagan’s Central American wars—as essentially a rape camp. There, underage Salvadoran women, summoned by the center’s guards and wardens, were forced to dance, watch gore films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , and submit to sexual demands. They were given abortion pills in case such encounters resulted in pregnancy. Human Prey
For decades, the border also gave liberty to nativist fantasies, as vigilantes of one sort or another ran wild there.
In the era after the United States lost its war in Vietnam and began to make its fast turn toward deindustrialization, such fantasies became ever more sadistic. In 1990, for instance, a group of San Diego high-school students fashioned themselves into a neo-Nazi paramilitary group, calling themselves the Metal Militia, and began staging “war games” on the border, hunting down and robbing migrants. The spree was notable in that it was covered by a new broadcasting network, Fox, on a show called The Reporters .
Racism and nativism would become Fox News’ bread and butter, but here it went for sensationalism, titling the episode “ Human Prey .” Its host, former Newsday investigative journalist Bob Drury, depicted migrants sympathetically. In a wide-lapeled white blazer, he interviewed one vigilante who estimated that there were about 10 militant groups in the San Diego County area who would “hunt, track, and stalk” migrants for sport. The film crew accompanied one such group as they captured a family, including a baby and a terrified grandmother.
Drury linked this upsurge in border extremism to the end of the Vietnam War: many of the vigilantes were veterans of that war. Others were teenagers who modeled their tactics, including the setting of booby traps, on Vietnam War movies they had seen. The most disturbing portions of Drury’s report were his interviews with vigilantes. Disguised so as not to be recognizable, they expressed unalloyed hate. “Grab a kid,” one said, discussing his favored method of terrorizing migrants, and “nobody is going to do anything.” Rome at the Colosseum
“Human Prey” helped launch a genre of TV “border patrol porn.” Even before Trump came on the political scene, the National Geographic channel ran five seasons of Border Wars . Since then, more such shows have aired, including Discovery Channel’s Border Live and Netflix’s Border Security . Copying the style of law-and-order series like Cops , these shows offer viewers ride-alongs with Border Patrol agents as they guard the country’s frontier. The set-up is familiar: greenish night-goggle cinematography, Black Hawk helicopters, battered-down doors, and sunrise jeep runs through mesquite scrub. While driving, Border Patrol agents in dark sunglasses hold forth on life, duty, manhood, and their occasional doubts, as an unseen camera films them from the passenger seat or back seat.
One episode from season two of Border Wars , “ Lost in the River ,” reveals a common, often deadly Border Patrol practice: the use of helicopters and all-terrain vehicles to scatter border crossers, forcing them ever deeper into the dangerous desert or fast-flowing rivers. It’s a game—patrollers play scatter, chase, catch; migrants surrender or die—that pits desperate people with next to no resources against one of the best-funded, high-tech, armed-to-the-teeth law enforcement agencies on earth. “We’ll let him tire himself out. If he wants to run, we’ll let him run,” says one agent. “You kind of have to pick your battles, and I usually pick the one who runs the most.… We’ve got bodies running all over the place.… It’s a never-ending game for us.”
Some of those migrants are chased back into Mexico, others caught, but many simply disappear and die, either from drowning or dehydration. Those that do make it to the United States go on to work at some of the lowest-paying but essential jobs around: they pick crops, slaughter and pack meat, clean houses, tend to the sick, watch kids—and for the privilege of all this, the federal government has put them through a dystopic death race, which is then transformed into reality-show entertainment for the masses. Watching such spectacles on cable TV, it’s hard not to feel that the United States is now ancient Rome—an empire that, in its later years, held compassion to be a vice —and the whole of that southwestern desert our Colosseum.
Occasionally, these shows humanize immigrants, but only long enough to super-humanize their pursuers. In one Border Wars episode, a group of 24 detained migrants sit around in the cold morning desert air, looking alternately scared and bored. “It tugs at your heart string[s],” says one of the Border Patrollers who chased them down. “When you see people that are in a bad position, you know, it’s tough, it plays on you emotionally as an agent, even though you have a job to do. To keep America safe.” None of these shows, however, reveal what happens off screen, including reports that Border Patrollers gratuitously tackle non-resisting migrants, beat those they catch, piss on their belongings, destroy their sources of drinking water, and deny them humanitarian aid.
If the images that do appear on screen sooner or later come to numb the moral senses and if viewers need to up the ante, they can always click on PornHub, which offers a whole subgenre of actual Border Porn, including actors dressed as border agents and as migrants: “If you are caught, you are fucked,” is the title of one video.
“Like the Sabine virgins,” the New York Herald wrote a century and a half ago about how Mexicans would come to enjoy being ruled by Washington, Mexico “will soon learn to love her ravishers.” Trump’s Necromancers
Maybe there’s a better metaphor than describing the United States as decadent Rome. Maybe Trump’s wall, whether built or not, is psychologically refashioning the country into a besieged medieval fortress, complete with its own cult of martyrs. As a candidate, Trump campaigned with the victims (or the families of victims) of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, using their grief to stoke grievances. As president, one of his first acts was to establish a government office charged with providing support services to “victims of crimes committed by removable aliens.” (Never mind that such aliens have a lower crime rate here than the general population.) Trump’s never happier than when, at one of his rallies or speeches, he’s able to call the name of someone who had a family member killed or raped by an undocumented immigrant.
A few years before Trump’s election, as Robin Reineke of the Colibri Center for Human Rights has reported, the sort of men who would later become Trump’s followers began showing up at Tea Party conventions with binders full of photographs of migrant corpses, gruesome images of the desiccated remains of those who had died in the desert trying to enter the United States. The anti-migrant activists who displayed such books of the dead claimed they were humanitarians, trying to raise support to build a wall to stop poor migrants from crossing over and so dying. But really they, like the president today, were necromancers, a kind of American priesthood of the lost frontier, offering a new litany of hate and using the fetish pornography of death to reassure racists that their cruelty was actually kindness.

“A bill to let gun owners legally carry handguns without obtaining a state-issued license is dead after an activist, upset that the measure had stalled, was met last week by state troopers outside the Lake Jackson home of House Speaker Dennis Bonnen (R),” the Austin American Statesman reports.
Bonnen said that the activist’s “gutless intimidation tactics” exposed no-license carry as a bad idea, dooming the legislation.
He added: “I could no longer watch as legislators and their families are incessantly harassed by fanatical gun-rights activists who think laws preventing criminals from carrying a gun should be repealed.” Barr’s Spin Job About Political Wire

Trump Lawyers Seek To Block IRS From Releasing His Taxes To Congress,www.nationalmemo.com,Cody Fenwick,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/trump-lawyers-block-irs-releasing-taxes/,"Cody Fenwick April 6, 2019 Share
Reprinted with permission from Alternet .
It’s April, which means the deadline for all Americans to file their tax returns is fast approaching. President Donald Trump, however, is facing another, much more daunting deadline: The day his taxes must be turned over not to the IRS, but from the IRS to Democrats in Congress.
Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, has instructed the IRS to hand over six years of the president’s taxes , as well as that of eight of his business entities, by April 10.
And as the deadline approaches, the president is clearly getting desperate.
Initially, he told reporters that he is “not inclined” to hand over his taxes, citing his bogus excuse that he doesn’t want to release them while he’s under audit. Then, on Friday, an administration official told CNN that the committee’s demands will be fought all the way to the Supreme Court, saying, “”This is a hill and people would be willing to die on it.” (It’s not clear why the official was granted anonymity to defend the president on this matter.)
And then Trump’s lawyer sent a letter to the Treasury Department, saying:
If the IRS acquiesces to Chairman Neal’s request, it would set a dangerous precedent. As Secretary Mnuchin recently told Congress, he is “not aware that there has ever been a request for an elected official’s tax returns.” For good reason. It would be a gross abuse of power for the majority party to use tax returns as a weapon to attack, harass, and intimidate their political opponents. Once this Pandora’s box is opened, the ensuing tit-for-tat will do lasting damage to our nation.
“Our firm welcomes the opportunity to represent President Trump in his capacity as a taxpayer,” said lawyer William Consovoy, who is handling the matter for the president. “The requests for his private tax information are not consistent with governing law, do not advance any proper legislative purpose, and threaten to interfere with the ordinary conduct of audits. We are confident that this misguided attempt to politicize the administration of the tax laws will not succeed.”
It was a ridiculous argument on many grounds. First, the chair sent the instructions to the IRS, and the law is clear that that the agency must comply. Second, one of the main reasons this is an unusual step is that, since President Richard Nixon, every president has released their taxes during the campaign. And third, Trump already promised to release his taxes but then he reneged and provided a transparently false excuse. And he compounded this betrayal by keeping stakes in his sprawling business interests, raising a disturbing specter of his conflicts of interest in foreign policy and beyond.
Congress undoubtedly has a legitimate interest in conducting oversight of these matters. But Neal’s request was even more specific — he said he wants the returns to as a part of his committee’s evaluation of presidential audits.
“There’s unconditional black letter law that says the committee can request any tax returns it wants in writing and the Treasury Dept ‘shall furnish’ them (in closed executive session unless the taxpayer otherwise consents), but hey go off anyway new counsel,” noted legal analyst Luppe Luppen .
Former federal prosecutor Joyce Vance noted: “The request went from Congress to the IRS. Trump is not a party to that proceeding & should have no more opportunity to intervene than any other private citizen. But, this does demonstrate the lengths he’ll go to to keep you from seeing his taxes.”
It’s clear Trump is desperate not to have his taxes released. It’s not clear if that’s because there’s something truly damaging in them, something humiliating, or simply that he relishes a fight that can waste his opponents’ time and energy. But at some point, we are likely to find out.

‘They’ Are Americans. Period.,www.nationalmemo.com,Connie Schultz,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/they-are-americans-period/,"Connie Schultz April 6, 2019 Share
More than a decade ago, when I was a reporter at The Plain Dealer , management invited a number of us in the newsroom to a special training session on how to report about race. I don’t remember the exact year we did this — it was long before I left the paper in 2011 — but I will never forget my most uncomfortable moment.
The moderator for the discussion was Keith Woods, who at the time was dean of faculty for The Poynter Institute, a school for journalists in St. Petersburg, Florida. He is now vice president of newsroom training and diversity at NPR.
Woods is that rare leader who can be fierce and kind at the same time, which made it easy for us to invest in the mission of his work without feeling like idiots for not seeing the need before he showed up. We were a room full of journalists with uninformed good intentions.
At one point, Woods talked about the importance of mentioning a source’s race only when it is relevant. I could feel the heat climbing up my neck and setting my cheeks on fire. I regularly identified expert sources as black or Latino.
Woods nodded as soon as I mentioned it. He was already familiar with that particular habit of mine, and asked why I so regularly did that. I explained that I was trying to inform our mostly white readers that people of color are smart, too.
With Woods’ guidance, offered through a series of questions, it didn’t take long for me to see how I was doing it wrong. I was so eager to include minority voices in all kinds of stories, but identifying them as such wrongly suggested that what was most noteworthy about them was their race, rather than their expertise. They are experts, period.
That session with Woods was a turning point for me as a journalist, and later as a columnist. I’ve been thinking about it this week after the Associated Press announced changes in its style manual, which is the language bible for most newsrooms in the country.
As Merrill Perlman explained in Columbia Journalism Review:
“Writing about race and ethnicity always requires care, and the stylebook has consolidated many of its entries under a new section, ‘race-related coverage.’
Among its revised advice is to avoid accusatory expressions like ‘racially charged,’‘racially motivated,’ and ‘racially tinged’: or ‘similar terms as euphemisms for racist or racism when the latter terms are truly applicable.'”
That definition, she adds, “is often open to interpretation.” Still, this is good news. We lose readers’ trust when we pretend not to see what is unfolding before their eyes.
The new AP Style cautions against “using racist or any other label as a noun for a person; it’s far harder to match the complexity of a person to a definition or label than it is a statement or action.”
This sounds too much like those editors who insist we can’t call someone a racist — or a liar — because we can’t know what a person is thinking. By this logic, we could never call Ku Klux Klan members racists because, in their minds, they may just be demonstrating a preference for white sheets.
Again, we must avoid pretending we can’t see what’s unfolding right in front of us.
Donald Trump is dumping again on Puerto Rico, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and remains in dire need of help that has never come. “I’ve taken better care of Puerto Rico than any man ever,” Trump said last week. “They’ve got to spend the money wisely. They don’t know how to spend the money.”
They. Do you see what he’s doing there?
A reminder for the president of the United States: Puerto Ricans are fellow Americans.
Trump tweeted this week that Puerto Rico has received $91 billion in federal aid, and misused all of it. As multiple news organizations have reported, this is a lie. Not all of them are calling it a lie, because we can’t know if maybe Trump just can’t add and subtract, I guess. Just as we can’t know for sure that Trump’s repeated false attacks on an entire island of minorities has anything do with his racism.
So far, Puerto Rico has received only $11.2 billion of the $41 billion allocated. That hasn’t stopped Trump from, in that same tweet, denouncing Puerto Rico’s public officials as “grossly incompetent, and who “only take from the USA….”
From the USA. Again, a reminder for the president of the United States: Puerto Ricans are fellow Americans, of the USA.
We know why he is denying this without the slightest glimpse into his mind.

Alabama Senator Tells IRS To Stop Picking On Southern Poor,www.nationalmemo.com,Paul Kiel,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/alabama-senator-tells-irs-to-stop-picking-on-rural-poor/,"Paul Kiel April 6, 2019 Share
On Monday, ProPublica published a map showing where IRS audits are most concentrated . The South stood out.
The reason is because of an intense focus at the IRS on auditing recipients of the earned income tax credit . The EITC is one of the country’s largest antipoverty programs, in the form of a tax refund for low-income workers, especially those with children. The typical EITC recipient earns less than $20,000 per year.
In practice, the IRS’ emphasis on EITC recipients means states with concentrations of low-income workers see the highest audit rates. One of those states is Alabama. Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL), wasn’t pleased .
“To take such a large portion of limited IRS resources and to focus them so intensely on rural communities in Alabama and the Southeast makes little fiscal sense,” Jones wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig. “Moreover, the practice appears to be blatantly discriminatory.” (An agency spokesperson previously told ProPublica that audit subjects are chosen without regard to race or where the taxpayer lives.)
The map, which stemmed from a study by Kim M. Bloomquist, formerly a senior economist in the tax agency’s research office, showed that the highest audit rates were to be found in rural, mostly African American counties in the South. Among states, Alabama had the fifth highest audit rate in the country, behind Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana and Florida.
“In an effort to focus its resources and ensure fair treatment of all taxpayers, I believe the IRS should undertake a full and thorough review of the policies and practices that led to such a disparate geographic impact of its annual audits,” Jones wrote. He ended his letter with a number of questions about IRS audit policies.
As we explained in December , Republicans in Congress have pressured the IRS since the 1990s to prevent payments of the credit to people who aren’t eligible for it. Meanwhile, critics, some within the IRS, such as Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson, have long criticized the focus on EITC audits as disproportionate, especially since IRS studies show that far more revenue is lost through cheating by those higher up the income scale. Furthermore, in recent years, budget cuts have hampered the IRS’ ability to pursue wealthy taxpayers , while audits of EITC recipients, which are largely automated, have been slower to decline . The result is an increasingly unequal mix of audits.
Lawmakers will have an opportunity to ask Rettig about the audit choices in a hearing next Wednesday before the Senate Finance Committee.
“There are two tax codes in America, and there are also two enforcement regimes,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-OR), the committee’s ranking member. “It takes significant resources to go after wealthy tax cheats with savvy lawyers and accountants, and the IRS simply doesn’t have those resources after years of Republican attacks. Ensuring wealthy taxpayers pay what they owe shouldn’t be a partisan issue, and this will be a focus with Commissioner Rettig.

Trump’s Newest Self-Enrichment Scheme? ‘Writing’ A Book,www.nationalmemo.com,Joe Conason,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/trumps-newest-money-making-scheme-writing-a-book/,"Oliver Willis April 6, 2019 Share
Trump is reportedly planning to “write” a memoir of his time in the White House, in yet another craven attempt to profit from his presidency.
The Daily Beast reports that Trump has been going on and on to his underlings about the project. One source told the outlet that Trump has said, “that’ll go great in a book,” at least once to refer to something that just happened in a social situation — which tells you a lot about where Trump’s priorities are while he holds America’s top leadership position.
That source also said that a Trump memoir would be used to chronicle his unpopular presidency, “dish dirt,” and complain about the media.
In other words, it would be a book-length version of Trump’s Twitter diatribes — and it probably wouldn’t even be written by Trump. Trump has published numerous books , but they are usually written by a ghostwriter or co-written with someone more competent than Trump.
It would also be yet another way for Trump to make a quick buck from his time in the White House.
“I do think he’d be able to get his supporters to buy it as merchandise,” a source within the publishing industry told the Daily Beast .
Trump has often used presidential events to double as fundraisers for his reelection campaign. He has used official speeches to model campaign hats that are for sale. He has even used a presidential initiative, the so-called “space force,” to move product by slapping a logo on shirts and hats to be sold through his campaign.
Trump has also used the presidential spotlight to highlight his various properties and golf courses, which are then sell memberships and hold events — often charging more than normal, because buyers know that they’re also buying access to the president. Trump hasn’t divested from his holdings in these entities, so the profits go in his pocket.
But while Trump might be able to use a book to milk his supporters for more cash, the Daily Beast also notes that a Trump book — unlike past bestsellers from Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, along with First Ladies Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama — would likely face a cold reception from most Americans.
Trump’s past books show no serious literary aspirations, and there is scant evidence that he has ever read a book in its entirety.
Trump is a con man, and his supporters are his marks. Any “book” he writes about his unpopular presidency will be just another money-making scheme. Share this..."
Trump Claims Electrical Workers Back Him — But They Know He Stiffed Them,www.nationalmemo.com,Oliver Willis,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/trump-claims-electrical-workers-back-him-but-they-know-he-stiffed-them/,"Oliver Willis April 6, 2019 Share
As former Vice President Joe Biden was addressing the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) on Friday, Trump tweeted to try to bring attention back to himself.
“I’ve employed thousands of Electrical Workers. They will be voting for me!” he wrote .
There’s just one problem with Trump’s belief that electrical workers will vote for him based on his record as an employer: He has stiffed electrical workers for millions over dollars over the years.
In fac
“According to thousands of lawsuits filed against him and his companies, when union contractors were hired, Trump developed a reputation for stiffing some, delaying payment to others and shorting workers on overtime and even minimum wage,” the IBEW report said.
The union also noted that the lawsuits “included 60 for not paying his bills, 24 violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and four corporate bankruptcies that left hundreds of contractors with dimes, nickels, even pennies on the dollar.”
Trump’s poor treatment of contractors, particularly those who do electrical work, continued right until he won the election.
Days after he was inaugurated, Trump was sued by AES Electrical for $2,075,731.61 worth of work on his hotel in Washington, D.C. The company alleged that Trump had only offered to pay one-third of the money that was owed.
AES noted the “repeated practice of the Trump organizations on various projects” of trying to nickel-and-dime contractors to avoid paying bills in full. The company later dropped its suit.
Trump has made a habit for years of simply refusing to pay contractors the money he promises them, a practice he reportedly picked up from his father.
That’s one reason why, in 2016, IBEW endorsed Hillary Clinton over Trump for the presidency. Union president Lonnie Stephenson wrote at the time: “As a president of the largest union in the electrical industry, I want someone in the White House who will make it easier, not harder, for working families to come together and speak up for themselves.”
Electrical workers saw through Trump’s campaign rhetoric during the last election, and opposed him both because of his anti-worker policy ideas and his history of scamming electricians in particular.
Since taking office, Trump has hurt union workers and farmers by launching an unnecessary trade war . His administration has also stripped away crucial labor protections that help workers.
None of that is likely to convince electrical workers — or anyone else, really — to support him.

What Happened To Rod Rosenstein — And When Will He Testify?,www.nationalmemo.com,Cody Fenwick,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/what-happened-to-rod-rosenstein-and-when-will-he-testify/,"Cody Fenwick April 6, 2019 Share
Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller to lead the Russia investigation, and he oversaw the probe until his boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, was forced to resign from the Justice Department.
But as the end of the investigation becomes ever more mired in controversy — driven by the actions of Attorney General Bill Barr and his lack of transparency — Rosenstein’s absence from the public stage is growing increasingly conspicuous.
Some of Barr’s most controversial decisions involve Rosenstein directly. In his letter summarizing the “principal conclusions” of the investigation, Barr said that Mueller had declined to reach a decision about whether President Donald Trump had committed the crime of obstruction of justice in the course of the probe, the special counsel left “it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.” (It is far from clear this is what Mueller intended, however; many suspect he wanted Congress to make the final judgment.)
Barr said that he and Rosenstein together reached the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to conclude Trump obstructed justice.
Since this letter has come out, though, we have yet to hear publicly about Rosenstein’s thoughts on the matter from the man himself. (The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.)
This is significant for several reasons. Rosenstein, as the official who deemed it necessary to appoint Mueller in the first place, has more credibility than Barr in the investigation. He was also a much more bipartisan pick to supervise the investigation — he was confirmed by a vote of 94-6 in the Senate, while Barr’s nomination was approved in a divisive 54-45 vote. The deputy attorney general consistently defended the investigation even as Republicans and the president maligned and attacked him. From this perspective, if he spoke out and affirmed Barr’s decisions, it could give them more credibility.
On the other hand, Rosenstein is in some ways even more conflicted than Barr. Arguably, Barr should have recused from the investigation because he drafted a memo attacking Mueller’s investigation the summer before he was appointed to the head of the Justice Department. But there’s an even clearer reason why Rosenstein should have been recused from the obstruction investigation: He is a key witness in any case against the president.
That’s because it was Rosenstein who wrote the justification that Trump used to fire former FBI Director Jame Comey. Comey was then overseeing the Russia investigation in May 2017, and while Rosenstein’s memo argued for his ouster because of his actions during the Hillary Clinton email case, Trump later admitted on TV that he fired the director because of “the Russia thing.”
This act triggered the obstruction investigation. But while Rosenstein was involved in this central act, he still oversaw the investigation for nearly two years, and we have now learned that he was a part of making the final decision about whether Trump’s behavior was criminal.
“It is very odd for someone to be supervising the investigation for which they are a witness, let alone a central witness to the underlying act,” Jed Shugerman, a professor at Fordham Law School, told The Atlantic . “It compromises the conclusion that they did not find a criminal act, because it gets Rosenstein off the hook in several ways.”
While this issue had been discussed in media, few major figures publicly called for Rosenstein’s recusal — perhaps because, for the reasons mentioned above, he was viewed as being almost uniquely credible. Now that assessment must be revisited. (Sessions, the attorney general at the time of Mueller’s appointment, was recused because he was involved in Trump’s campaign. For that very reason, though, it seems he shouldn’t have been involved in Comey’s firing, as he was.)
And in recent days, multiple outlets have reported that members of Mueller’s team are fuming about Barr’s handling of the investigation’s final report, believing he has misled the public about how damaging the findings are for the president. In response, Barr’s Justice Department appears to be going on offense. This only makes the fact of Rosenstein’s absence from the public stage even more troubling — is he really going to sit back while his boss and the vital investigation he oversaw are feuding?
This is particularly perplexing because Rosenstein was initially expected to leave the Justice Department in March. CNN reported in mid-March, though, that he decided to stay on longer to be a “heat shield” for any “fallout” from the Mueller probe .
Right now, he doesn’t seem to be absorbing any heat. So why did he stick around?
All of these circumstances surrounding the still developing conclusion of the Russia investigation make it paramount that Rosenstein come forward, address the concerns, and provide satisfactory answers. Congress is already preparing to have Barr testify, and Mueller will almost certainly be called before lawmakers. Rosenstein, too, must make an appearance and explain his actions to the American people. Share this..."
Poll: Trump Approval Plummets In Five Key Swing States,www.nationalmemo.com,Oliver Willis,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalmemo.com/poll-trump-approval-plummets-in-five-key-swing-states/,"Oliver Willis April 5, 2019 Share
Trump’s approval rating has fallen double digits in five key states that he won since the election. The data shows that in addition to his overall poor approval Trump faces electoral college headwinds before the 2020 election.
In Morning Consult’s most recent survey , Trump is down in the following swing states: Florida (-24 points), Ohio (-20), Michigan (-19), Wisconsin (-18), and Pennsylvania (-17).
In 2016, Trump won all of those states, which together represent 93 electoral votes. Trump’s electoral vote margin of victory was 74 points that year.
By recent comparison, President Barack Obama defeated John McCain by 192 electoral votes in 2008 and Obama beat Mitt Romney by 126 electoral votes in 2012.
Trump also lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes .
Since being sworn in, Trump has never had the support of 50 percent or more of the American people when national polls are averaged.
Even in states where he is likely to win re-election, like Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Wyoming, Trump has seen steep double-digit declines in support.
The poor showing could very well be the result of a presidency swimming in corruption, incompetence and bigotry. Trump’s sole major legislative accomplishment was the tax scam, which rewarded the uber-wealthy and giant corporations and has been resoundingly panned by average Americans.
With the aid of congressional leaders like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Trump has been able to pack federal courts and the Supreme Court with right-wing mediocrities of questionable moral character .
But Americans do not approve. In the first national election under Trump’s leadership, his party lost control of the House of Representatives by a national popular vote margin of over 9.7 million votes .
When Trump and his ideas are on the ballot, most voters vote against them. And now, in the states he will need the most to win a second term, he is under water.

Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown Joins Bipartisan Group Introducing Bill Sanctioning China for Opioid Trafficking - Tennessee Star,tennesseestar.com,Andrew Shirley,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/07/ohio-senator-sherrod-brown-joins-bipartisan-group-introducing-bill-sanctioning-china-for-opioid-trafficking/,"Democratic Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown joined a bipartisan group of six Senators Thursday to introduce a bill that would sanction any country involved in the trafficking of illegal opioids into the United States.
According to the U.S Department of Justice and Drug Enforcement Administration’s 2018 National Drug Assessment , synthetic opioids, specifically fentanyl, secretly created and trafficked into the United States is “responsible for the ongoing fentanyl epidemic.” The majority of these opioids are produced in China and then trafficked into America through Mexico, making these two countries primarily responsible for the current US epidemic. They noted these drugs are “now the most lethal category of opioids used in the United States…Fentanyl suppliers will continue to experiment with new fentanyl-related substances and adjust supplies in attempts to circumvent new regulations imposed by the United States, China, and Mexico.” Because of this, the highest quality of fentanyl carries the street name: “China White.”
S.1044. “A bill to impose sanctions with respect to foreign traffickers of illicit opioids, and for other purposes” intent, per the summary message provided by the bill’s sponsors:
This targeted sanctions legislation would give U.S. law enforcement and sanctions officials more tools to combat the trafficking of opioids into the United States. The legislation would direct the President to publicly identify foreign traffickers of opioids on an annual basis and use a number of precision economic and financial sanctions policy tools to cripple their operations, including denying access to U.S. markets, freezing their assets and blocking transactions with U.S. financial institutions.
Cosponsoring the bill, alongside Senator Brown is; Senator Tom Cotton [R-AR], Senator Marco Rubio [R-FL], Senator Robert Menendez [D-NJ], Senator Jeanne Shaheen [D-NH], Senator Pat Toomey [R-PA].
As previously reported, fentanyl is now a national epidemic. Ohio is one of the states most affected by the deadly drug, despite some of the most comprehensive drug preventative measures in the country. Since 2010, synthetic opioids deaths in Ohio rose from 175 to 2,296.
While both major political parties in the country are aggressively divided, the opioid epidemic is one issue where they have consistently found common ground. President Donald Trump made opioids a keystone issue throughout his entire 2016 campaign for the White House. The bill is expected to move swiftly through the legislative process. The bill also dovetails specifically into another key issue that has defined much of the national political discourse.
President Trump has been a consistent critic of trade imbalances with China and Mexico. While former Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was less assertive about the issue, her primary challenger, Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders was also aggressively in favor of addressing trade with China and Mexico. Should this law be enacted, it could become a key point of leverage in potential trade talks that would have bipartisan support.

Under Turnbull the government had an identical policy. The PM should tell us that this is no longer the case. Under the policy, emission standard for cars would be ratcheted down to 105g CO2 per Km as is the case in Europe and California. This would force people out of their current useful cars and give them a choice of either a tiny petrol driven or an electric car. The way this standard is to be implemented is to require importers to reach that 105g average. This means they can still sell cars with higher emission levels provided they sell plenty at the lower levels. Watch the price of useful cars go up! Other people will hang on to older cars (not good for road safety) but will be hit by the second tranche – a hike in the petrol excise. Eventually the control freaks will get their way.

“Well it depends how flat your battery is,” Mr Shorten said. You can listen to the audio here.
To be fair – it does depend on how flat your battery is – on that logic you can fill up your petrol tank on $10. It just depends on how empty your tank is.
Shorten is shamefully employing an old sales con trick. It’s akin to a store advertising, say: “up to 50% off everything”, when only one (or a few) particular items are 50% off, but everything else is considerably less discounted.

From the BMW link in post:
In order to meet the demands of fast charging at high capacity, cooled HPC (High Power Charging) cables made by Phoenix Contact are used, which are fully CCS-compatible. The cooling fluid is an environment-friendly mixture of water and glycol, allowing the cooling circuit to be half-open. This makes maintenance comparatively straightforward as compared to hermetically sealed systems that use oil, e.g. in terms of refilling the cooling fluid.
One challenge was ensuring that the cooling hoses in the charging line were not squeezed when connected to the charging station, as would happen with a conventional cable gland. In the present instance this would impair the cooling flow and therefore cooling efficiency. This problem was solved by Phoenix Contact by means of a specially developed wall duct with defined interfaces for power transmission, communication and cooling as well as integrated tension relief.
Depending on the model, the new ultra-fast charging station can be used for vehicles fitted with both 400 V and 800 V battery systems. Its charging capacity automatically adapts to the maximum permitted charging capacity on the vehicle side. The time saved as a result of the increased charging capacities is demonstrated in the example of the BMW i3 research vehicle. A single 10-80 % SOC charging operation now only takes 15 minutes for the high-voltage battery, which has a net capacity of 57 kWh. This can be achieved on the vehicle side by means of a specially developed high-voltage battery combined with an intelligent charging strategy. The latter includes precise preconditioning of the storage temperature at the start of charging, temperature management during the charging operation itself and a perfectly coordinated charging capacity profile over time. The charging operation is carried out via a novel multi-voltage network on the vehicle side using a high-voltage DC/DC (HV-DC/DC) converter, transforming the required 800 V input voltage of the charging station to the lower 400 V system voltage of the BMW i3 research vehicle. The HV-DC/DC system also gives the vehicle reverse compatibility, allowing it to be charged at both old and future charging stations. A key factor in ensuring reliable operation is secure communication between the vehicle and the charging station. For this reason, standardisation issues relating to interoperability are also being investigated and submitted to standardisation bodies.
The Porsche research vehicle with a net battery capacity of approx. 90 kWh achieves a charging capacity of more than 400 kW, thereby allowing charging times of less than three minutes for the first 100 km of range.
These are water cooled leads and batteries operating at high currents and voltage. These are experiments. They show there is a long way to go if fast charging is to be common place. Not. Ready. For. Primetime."

Grand National: Tiger Roll becomes first back-to-back winner since Red Rum,trendgossipnow.com,Trend Gossip Now,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://trendgossipnow.com/grand-national-tiger-roll-becomes-first-back-to-back-winner-since-red-rum/,"Grand National: Tiger Roll becomes first back-to-back winner since Red Rum By 0 Listen to the moment Tiger Roll won the Grand National for a second time Tiger Roll won a thrilling Grand National to become the first horse since Red Rum 45 years ago to win the Aintree race back-to-back.
The 4-1 favourite, ridden by Davy Russell, was level with Magic of Light (66-1) going over the last fence, but pulled clear to repeat last year’s win.
Ruby Walsh finished third on Rathvinden (8-1) with Walk in the Mill (25-1) fourth.
Russell said: “I can’t believe this has happened.”
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, the 39-year-old Irishman added: “Two Grand Nationals is a dream and beyond anything I thought I would ever achieve.
“I love Liverpool. They have the most spectacular sporting event. It touches the world – I’m just so happy to be involved.
“It’s brilliant news if this is the worst day for the bookies! If the taxi driver and the baker raise a glass to Tiger Roll, that is the beauty of it all.”
It was a third National success for trainer Gordon Elliott, who as well as last year also won with Silver Birch in 2007.
However, Willie Mullins-trained Up For Review suffered a fatal injury after it was brought down at the first, becoming the race’s first fatality since 2012.
Of the other fancied horses, Anibale Fly made a bad mistake towards the end of the first circuit but ran on to finish fifth, while 2017 winner One For Arthur came sixth. Tiger Roll the history maker Tiger Roll was carrying weights of 11st 5lbs – 6lb more than last year
Not since the legendary Red Rum in 1974 had a horse successfully defended the Grand National.
Red Rum added a third in 1977 to become one of the all-time greats, and now Tiger Roll has sealed his place in Aintree folklore.
Tiger Roll was the overwhelming favourite and is the shortest-priced winner since Poethlyn (11-4) exactly 100 years ago.
Tiger Roll’s odds came despite carrying more weight than last year, although he had shown his wellbeing by winning his two most recent starts, firstly over hurdles and then in the Cross Country Chase at the Cheltenham Festival in March.
The nine-year-old’s chances were played down before the race by his owner, Ryanair tycoon Michael O’Leary.
And the smallest horse in the field did not feature at the front for the opening two thirds of the race, but timed his charge perfectly in the closing stages.
He looked the strongest over the final three fences and, after taking the last, Tiger Roll cruised clear to win by two-and-three-quarter lengths.
O’Leary said afterwards: “It’s unbelievable. It’s a phenomenal training performance by Gordon. It’s brilliant that he keeps bringing this horse back at Cheltenham better than ever and Aintree better than ever.
“And what a ride by Davy – fantastic. It’s unbelievable, to win two Grand Nationals is just incredible.” The win is the second consecutive Grand National victory for owner Michael O’Leary (left) and jockey Davy Russell A ‘dream’ third win for emotional Elliott
Elliott had 11 horses taking part and before the race he defended his record number of runners, saying: “I wasn’t born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I don’t come from a horse background.
“Everything I have, I’ve worked very hard for it. I’ve got five or six different owners, they’ve all paid their entry fee, they’re all entitled to have a runner in the race.”
After the win, the Irishman said: “Winning this is special, I just can’t wait to get home to see all my family and friends.
“I was trying to watch all of mine, I can’t believe it. I never once thought he was going to win until he crossed the line, because I could remember last year. He didn’t tie up this year.
“I don’t get upset too often, but I’m emotional today. For my whole yard and everyone involved it’s unbelievable – you dream about this.” Gordon Elliott had 11 of the 40 horses in the race ‘Grand National’s newest legend’– analysis
BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght:
Winning successive Grand Nationals has become something of a ‘Holy Grail’ for Aintree winners, even more so because the last back-to-back winner was the iconic Red Rum, but we had begun to wonder whether it might be an impossible dream.
However, Tiger Roll barely put a foot wrong as he took his exalted place in the Aintree history books as its newest legend – a big word that, but it fits this little horse perfectly.
So much about the race revolves around its heritage and they will be talking about this horse, his extraordinary trainer and this day for decades to come. ‘Tiger Roll is a once in a lifetime horse’– what the rest said
Magic of Light trainer Jessica Harrington: “I didn’t expect her to run that well. I wasn’t even going to bring her because we thought the fences would be too big.
“All the way round I couldn’t believe how easily she was going. She was going so well – then I saw Tiger Roll on the inside. Tiger Roll is just amazing – he’s even better this year. He’s the most gorgeous little horse, and so accurate at his fences.”
Rathvinden trainer Willie Mullins: “Tiger Roll is a phenomenon. For an ex-Flat horse – he’s not a typical four-mile chaser – but he’s got some appetite for racing with a great eye for jumping. He’s once in a lifetime.”
Walk in the Mill jockey James Best: “That was brilliant – it was a lot of fun. He travelled a lot better early doors than I thought he would and jumped for fun. I didn’t see Tiger Roll until over the last three fences – and what a horse he is.” "

Smart utility meters put out approximately one watt, about the same as a cell phone, and that is only at small short intervals, just long enough to spurt out a few packets of data. The exaggeration about smart meters is another bit of off the wall hysteria. It's only a little more power than a child's toy walkie talkie. Q) Do you mean smart meters contain an intentional RF transmitter? A) Sometimes. When a smart meter contains an RF transmitter: The frequency of operation is typically in the 902 MHz and 2.4 GHz bands. Power output is typically 1 watt in the 902 MHz band and much less in the 2.4 GHz band. The intended range of a transmitter in a smart meter is typically very localized. While the utility-side radio needs to reach a neighborhood concentrator, typically mounted on a nearby pole, smart meters can also mesh through other smart meters to communicate with the concentrator. (using five hops or less) See Figure 2. The smart meter only communicates when it is commanded to do so, typically several times a day.

Bearing witness to root causes of Honduras migration at Radio Progreso People's World,www.peoplesworld.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.peoplesworld.org/article/bearing-witness-to-root-causes-of-honduras-migration-at-radio-progreso/,"Bearing witness to root causes of Honduras migration at Radio Progreso April 4, 2019 11:23 AM CDT By Rabbi Brant Rosen Our SHARE-El Salvador and Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity delegation meets with Radio Progreso
The invitation for our Root Causes Pilgrimage to Honduras came from Radio Progreso, a Jesuit-owned radio station based in the city of El Progreso. As one of the few independent media voices in Honduras, Radio Progreso does extensive work in advancing human rights, promoting peace, supporting community-based initiatives, and advocating for environmental justice across the country. The station broadcasts its transmissions in nearby San Pedro Sula and the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa to an estimated audience of 1.5 million people.
Radio Progreso is led by Father Ismael Moreno , known to everyone in Honduras as “Father Melo.” Father Melo is one of the most important grassroots leaders in the country and a fierce proponent of human rights. In a time of increasing threats to freedom of speech, Radio Progreso is one of the most fiercely dependable sources of truth in the country.
In 2001, Padre Melo founded a companion project of Radio Progreso, Equipo de Reflexión, Investigación y Comunicació n (ERIC), which provides grassroots investigation and reporting of the many forms of injustice and violence that plague Honduran activists and peasants working to reform the political and economic structures that stifle the development of the country’s poor and marginalized people. Melo has been the director of the radio station since 2006.
It’s difficult to understate the courage of institutions like Radio Progreso. In 2011 , correspondent Nery Jeremías Orellana was gunned down; three years later, marketing manager Carlos Mejía was stabbed to death. The station has also been vandalized repeatedly over the years, After the station was critical of the fraudulent 2017 elections, its antenna was destroyed by vandals . Father Melo himself lives with the constant threat to his life and wellbeing; his entry into public activism followed the brutal 1989 assassinations of his mentor, Jesuit Fr. Ignacio Ellacuría , and five confreres at the University of Central America in El Salvador.
We also spent the morning touring the station and learning about its work from the staff. As I quickly learned, Radio Progreso understands its work as a radio station in service of its role as an advocacy organization on behalf of the Honduran people. As it was explained to us, ERIC plays an important role in researching and conveying news to its listeners on critical issues such as: Political malfeasance; The corruption of the electoral system; The effects of the highly militarized local and national police; Threats, intimidation and murder delivered against local people, human rights activists, environmentalists and farmers who oppose the ongoing environmental destruction caused by internationally financed hydroelectric dams, extractive industries, agribusiness, and the newly developed tourism industry; The violence of criminal drug cartels which frequently have links to Honduran government officials; The grieving families whose migrating children who have mysteriously disappeared on the way to the U.S.
During a presentation by Father Melo and the staff, we participated in a moving ceremony which included an offering of gifts from our delegation. Among others, my friend and colleague Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb brought Father Melo a braid of sweet grass from the Lakota tribe at Standing Rock as a symbol of friendship and shared resistance.
After visiting the station, our delegation broke up into three groups and boarded buses for trips to different regions throughout the county. My group embarked on a 6-hour ride to Bajo Aguán. We made many stops along the way, however, including a lovely seaside stop at La Ceiba beach on the northern coast.
We arrived in time for dinner and a briefing on the political situation in Bajo Aguán. It was an unforgettable visit—I’ll go into detail in my next post.

"Capsaicin, the Chemical That Makes Chili Hot, Could One Day Be Used to Treat Lung Cancer",www.newsweek.com,Kashmira Gander,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/capsaicin-chili-treat-lung-cancer-1387183,"On 4/6/19 at 7:00 PM EDT Share Health
Scientists believe the chemical which gives chili its spicy kick could one day be developed into a drug to treat lung cancer. The study focused on the effects of the compound capsaicin on the lung disease adenocarcinoma, which accounts for around 40 percent of all cases of lung cancer.
Study co-author Dr. Jamie Friedman of the department of Biomedical Sciences at the Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine, Marshall University, told Newsweek : ""The ability of cancer cells to spread to distant sites—a process called metastasis—is responsible for the deadliness of this disease.
""Once a cancer has spread to secondary locations it is difficult to treat. Any novel therapy to combat metastasis could be of great use for treating lung cancer patients. What is exciting about our study is that capsaicin is a natural compound being used as an anti-metastatic agent.""
The authors of the new study wanted to build on existing evidence showing capsaicin appears to stop the spread of melanoma, prostate, and a cancer of the connective tissue of the bile ducts.
But capsaicin can cause nasty side effects including skin redness, nausea, intensely teary eyes, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and burning diarrhea. So the team compared whether compounds similar to capsaicin (capsiate and capsiconiate) had the same cancer-fighting powers but without the side effects.
Tests on lung cancer cells showed capsiate stopped cancer cells from invading other cells—the process just before metastasis—whereas capsiconiate had no effect. Meanwhile, experiments in mice revealed animals who ate capcaisin had fewer metastic cancer cells compared with mice who didn’t take the compound.

Capcaisin seems to work against this common form of lung cancer by stopping a protein called Src from activating.
“Current studies in our lab have shown that capsaicin has the ability to sensitize lung cancer to the effects of chemotherapeutic agents,"" explained Friedman. ""Our future studies are aimed at designing capsaicin analogs which will be non-pungent and retain the anti-tumor activity of capsaicin.""
The researchers were inspired to study capsaicin because observational studies in the past have shown that countries such as Thailand and India, where diets traditionally consist of spicy foods, have lower incidence of lung cancer.
“This observation triggered ideas that maybe the spicy food consumption had something to do with these lower cancer incidences,” said Friedman.
One day, the team hopes capsaicin could be developed into anti-metastic treatments for lung cancer, to be used alongside other therapies.
The findings were presented at the American Society for Investigative Pathology annual meeting during the 2019 Experimental Biology meeting. The research therefore hasn’t been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
Martin Ledwick, head information nurse at the charity Cancer Research UK, told Newsweek : “It’s always good to see new research being carried out that might one day improve cancer treatment.
“Preventing cancer invading and spreading is a key area for cancer research. This study may give scientists further leads to try and develop new treatments that stop this happening. However, this is early lab-based research and it isn’t known yet if or how it might translate into being a useful treatment.” "

Britain is running out of choices and time for Brexit.
Facing an April 12 deadline to provide the EU with a Brexit proposal or crash out of this bloc, lawmakers rejected all the options — and fulfilled for new votes to try to agree to a strategy. Get alerts:
With May clinging to hope of persuading Parliament to rear her Brexit bargain if she requests a fourth moment, check out the likely choices: NO DEAL
Business groups, economists and politicians believe leaving the world’s biggest trading bloc without an arrangement would be disastrous. It would impose tariffs bring traditions tests that may cause gridlock and could spark shortages of goods.
Brexiteer lawmakers in May’s Conservative Party dismiss this as”Project Panic” and argue for what they call a”clean Brexit.” They’ve encouraged her to creep up preparations to leave the bloc with no agreement on April 12 and not to undermine.
That remains the default place unless a deal is accepted, Brexit is canceled or the EU grants Britain an additional extension, although parliament has voted repeatedly to rule out an Brexit.
May says the only way to guarantee Britain doesn’t leave the EU is for Parliament to back her bargain — which lawmakers have already rejected three days.
___
After two years of discussions, Britain and the EU struck a divorce deal putting out the terms of the death from the bloc and also giving a rough outline of future relations.
But lawmakers on each side of the Brexit divide have rejected it. Lawmakers believe it keeps Britain tied to EU rules. Pro-EU legislators argue it’s worse than the U.K.’s recent status as an EU member.
Though the defeat, by 58 votes, was that the most narrow yet it has thrown out twice. It had been rejected by asserting if it was accepted to quit, after some lawmakers were won over by May.
May is contemplating one final drive this week, arguing that the failure to rear another bargain of Parliament means that her agreement is the best option.
___
SOFT BREXIT
four different suggestions to the rejected deal of May, Parliament voted on Monday after lawmakers seized control of their program from the authorities.
None got a majority, but the volatility revealed that a good block of support for a”soft Brexit” that could maintain close financial ties between Britain and the EU. A plan to maintain the U.K. within an EU customs union, ensuring smooth commerce in goods, had been defeated by just three votes.
Those options have been ruled by may out, because adhering to EU trade rules would restrict Britain’s ability to devise new trade prices across the world.
But tweaking her agreement could profit May votes in Parliament. It also will be welcomed by the EU and could allow Britain to leave the bloc.
___
NEW BREXIT REFERENDUM
Parliament narrowly rejected a suggestion for a referendum on remain or whether to leave the EU.
It was endorsed by opposition parties, plus some of May’s Conservatives .
Her government has mastered holding a second referendum on Britain’s EU membership, saying voters in 2016 left their decision to leave.
However, with branches in both Parliament and in May’s Cabinet, yanking the folks in a fresh plebiscite the choice could be regarded as the only way.
___
BREXIT DELAYED
The solution to your”no-deal” departure is to postpone Brexit for at least several months, and possibly over a year, to sort out the mess. Even the EU is frustrated with all the impasse and has stated if Britain includes a new Brexit plan, it will grant yet another postponement.
The bloc is loath to have a departing Britain engage in the May 23-26 European parliament elections, but when Brexit has been postponed that would have to be achieved. However, EU Council President Donald Tusk has urged the bloc to give Britain a Brexit extension if it intends to change course.
A delay raises the chances of an ancient election, which could encircle Parliament and break the deadlock.

As a female engineer, I think that this has created more difficult relationships at work and become harmful to normal and necessary networking opportunities for women."

Forty years ago, half of Christendom believed that life began at birth. You pro-lifers are fighting against the taken for granted beliefs of many of your own forefathers, and then you castigate those who still adhere to such beliefs--which you simplify down greatly--as if such were completely inappropriate. Make no mistake: .The abortion debate is as great a Christian upon Christian disagreement as the Reformation, except that in this case, large numbers of Protestants have joined the opposing view owing mostly to the advent of modern ultrasounds and materialism. For the pro-life Protestant what is conclusive is ""live,"" animated flesh on a modern high-res ultrasound and propoganda from a Roman Catholic extremist.
