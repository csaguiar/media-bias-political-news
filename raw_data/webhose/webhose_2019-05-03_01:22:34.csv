The troops, of the 3rd Battalion Parachute Regiment based at Merville Barracks in Essex, were seen peppering a large image of the Labour leader with hard wax rounds at a shooting range in Kabul, Afghanistan. Politicians and the public condemned the footage online and the Ministry of Defence said it had launched an investigation, adding their behaviour fell 'well below the high standards the Army expects'. Meanwhile Labour described the video as 'alarming' and called for urgent action to be taken. It is understood the paratroopers involved have been spoken to and will soon return to the UK as their tour is coming to an end. Some Twitter users claimed the video was fake, but it has been verified by military officials. A Labour Party spokeswoman said: 'This behaviour is alarming and unacceptable. We have confidence in the MoD to investigate and act on this incident.' The target appears to show the party leader speaking at a podium with the Labour logo in front of him. The video also includes the caption 'Happy with that.' "

If this was the case, the US would have the technology to take power out in one single blow instead of just causing severe harm. Both sides argue their story. Venezuelan people are tired of this inhuman situation.

Carrying 35 tons of cargo, the two aircraft delivered 99 Russian military specialists, headed by the first deputy commander-in-chief of the Land Forces, Colonel General Vasily Tonkoshkurov (Noticierodigital.com, March 23; see EDM, March 28).

Wednesday, April 3, 2019 BTRTN March 2019 Month in Review: Mueller Time Masks a Dreadful Month for Trump on Signature Issues Tom with the BTRTN March 2019 Month in Review. THE MONTH When the final chapter of Donald Trump’s sad, dark and weird presidency is written, history will record March, 2019 as perhaps his finest month. Now it is no great accomplishment to avoid being named as an unindicted co-conspirator – it’s not exactly up there with defeating Hitler, creating the Marshall Plan, winning the Cuban Missile Crisis, enacting monumental Civil Rights legislation, landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth, signing the Camp David Accords, bringing down the Soviets, or killing Osama bin Laden. But it is something. The Mueller report – when it is finally released – may indeed be a stunning indictment of the Trump Administration, chock full of indictments, sordid shenanigans, evidence of “obstruction;” it will quite possibly serve as a “roadmap” for Democratic-controlled congressional committees and will most certainly be a companion piece to numerous other investigations already underway or passed on to other investigative bodies. But Trump can indeed crow for now about the legal validation of his long-repeated “no collusion, no obstruction” mantra, based on Attorney General Barr’s four-page summary conclusions (Barr indicated that Mueller concluded there was no evidence to support a collusion/conspiracy charge; while Mueller declined to take a position on obstruction, Barr quickly stepped in that void to exonerate Trump.) None of this may matter much in the long run of history, or even in the balance of Trump’s presidency. The month was chock full of setbacks of all kinds for the Trump Administration, on many of his signature issues. The economy . A measly 20,000 jobs were created last month, a number exceeded in Obama’s presidency in 90 out of 96 months, and 86 of the last 88. The Q4 2018 GDP was revised downward to a tepid 2.2%. The Fed has announced that it will suspend any further interest rate increases, and any number of leading indicators are dropping. A sagging economy in an election year is not kind to sitting presidents (see: Bush 41). Immigration . Trump’s “national emergency” declaration was voted down on a bi-partisan basis by both the Democratic-controlled House and the GOP-controlled Senate, thus requiring a Trump veto (the first of his presidency). Now the matter moves on to the courts. Trade . Trump believes that America’s failure is best measured by the size of its trade deficit. Most economists don’t agree, but if Trump wants to keep score that way, he is losing bigly. The trade deficit for 2018 rose to $621 billion, the highest in 10 years. And there is no end in sight, nor any breakthroughs anticipated, in Trump’s negotiations with China. North Korea . Intelligence sources now believe that North Korea has begun rebuilding a satellite launching facility that it began dismantling last year as a sign of goodwill. North Korea has done this in plain sight – they know the world is watching. Kim Jong-un is strategizing, playing chess while Trump stumbles over the checkers. In the aftermath of the Mueller report, Trump, without a shred of common sense, trampled on his own victory parade by suddenly insisting that the GOP would craft new health care legislation to replace Obamacare. This is, of course, the third rail for the GOP, since they never offered an alternative in the Obama years, and failed miserably in their various attempts to develop an alternative in Trump’s administration. Mitch McConnell would prefer ongoing root canal work to another attempt to deal with health care. Also inexplicably, Trump chose to forward a budget that defunded perhaps the most popular program funded (in part) by the federal government: the Special Olympics. It’s hard to fathom the political thinking that drove this cut, and even Trump was forced to “overturn” the directive after watching Betsy Devos twist in the wind for a day. Trump’s quick, effortless solution was to blame the whole mess on Devos. Finally, Trump also failed to deal decisively with the Boeing 737 MAX disaster, as the United States was the last nation to ground the deadline aircraft in the aftermath of two crashes that killed 346 people. How Trump picks up the pieces of his presidency and turns it into a winning story for 2020 is the next drama, twinned with the Democrat’s now launched saga of whom to find to challenge him. TRUMP APPROVAL RATING Trump’s approval rating ticked up one point to 42%, though the reality is that Trump remained smack in the middle of the same zone he has been in is entire presidency. Trump’s highpoint for any month was 46% in February, 2017, the first full month of his presidency, and the low was 38%, just six months later in August, 2017. But most of those months Trump has been in the 40-43% range. No president has operated in such a tight band in his first two years, another sign of the polarized world we live in and that Trump has exacerbated. TRUMP MONTHLY APPROVAL RATING"

58 percent say America not divided into 'haves' and 'have-nots',thehill.com,zbudryk@thehill.com (Zack Budryk),04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/437105-most-in-poll-say-us-is-not-divided-into-haves-have-nots,"58 percent say America not divided into 'haves' and 'have-nots' By Zack Budryk - 04/03/19 09:17 AM EDT
A majority of Americans surveyed in a new Gallup poll say the U.S. is not divided into “haves” and “have-nots.""
Fifty-eight percent of respondents disagreed that such a divide exists, according to the survey, while 41 percent said it does.
Gallup has recorded similar results since 1998 except in 2008, the first full year of the economic recession, when the portion of Americans rejecting the divide reached a low of 49 percent, according to the pollster. ADVERTISEMENT
The number of people saying that such a divide exists, however, is higher than it was in 1988, when 72 percent of respondents said there was no such divide in America compared to just 26 percent who said there was a divide.
Fifty-seven percent of Democratic respondents and 70 percent of black respondents said a divide between haves and have-nots exists.
Overall, 51 percent of nonwhites surveyed believed in a divide between the haves and have-nots, though only 38 percent of Hispanic respondents did, according to Gallup. African-Americans have consistently seen more of a divide between haves and have-nots in the Gallup poll.
Fifty-six percent of those polled see themselves as “haves,” compared to 36 percent who describe themselves as “have-nots.” These figures have been relatively stable for the last 15 years, including during the recession last decade, according to Gallup.
Whites are much more likely to identify as “haves,” at 64 percent, compared to 38 percent of nonwhites.
Gallup collected the data between Feb. 12 and Feb. 28 from 1,932 adults nationwide, with a 3 percentage point margin of error."

Powell, who was nominated to the Fed by former President Obama, was confirmed to a four-year term as chairman of the Fed board by the Senate in January 2018.
Trump on numerous occasions has publicly criticized Powell and the Fed for raising interest rates, blaming the hikes for dips in the stock market.
“Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates, especially since there is very little inflation, and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening, the 3.0% GDP, & Stock Market, would have both been much higher & World Markets would be in a better place!” Trump tweeted last week."
Schiff: Plenty Of Evidence Of Collusion To Continue Investigations | The Daily Caller,dailycaller.com,Phillip Stucky,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://dailycaller.com/2019/04/03/schiff-evidence-collusion-investigations/,"Send WhatsApp
Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff argued Wednesday that there is still plenty of evidence in the public record to continue investigating President Donald Trump for colluding with Russians during the 2016 presidential race in an interview on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”
When asked if he was wrong after Mueller’s report appeared to resolve there was no collusion from Trump or his family, Schiff said:
I think what you see in the public record is direct evidence. When the Russians, through an intermediary, offered dirt on the Clinton campaign as part of what’s described as the Russian government effort to help the Trump campaign, and Donald Trump’s son — who played a pivotal role in the campaign — who says, if it is what you say it is, I’d love it, and sets up a meeting to receive it, it is direct evidence of collusion.
The Chair of the House Committee on Intelligence was then asked why he was so sure there was collusion when Mueller couldn’t find evidence during his two-year investigation into the matter. (RELATED: Don Jr. Takes On ‘Leader Of The Tinfoil Hat Brigade’ Adam Schiff)
Schiff responded:
We won’t know until we get the report. Even looking at that fact pattern, Mueller could conclude that the Trump campaign didn’t know that this was, in fact, the Russian government. Even though it was portrayed as the Russian government, or that the dirt they got during that meeting wasn’t sufficient to prove beyond-a-reasonable-doubt conspirac,y or these other interactions with other Russians with Kilimnik, believed to be linked to Russian intelligence, maybe there wasn’t a sufficient link that could be proven by beyond a reasonable doubt between Kilimnik and the Russian government.
We won’t know until we see the there is no explaining away the eagerness of the president , that he demonstrated publicly, to have Russian help, pay Russians. If you’re listening, hack Hillary’s emails. There is no doubt that the Russians did hack the democratic emails.
Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani demanded Monday that members of the media apologize for spreading theories of collusion after the Mueller report was revealed to not find any evidence of collusion by way of Attorney General William Barr’s summary of the report in a fiery debate on CNN with host Chris Cuomo.
“It’s not very clever. You guys have tortured this man for two years with collusion and nobody has apologized for it. Before we talk about obstruction, apologize!” Giuliani demanded. Cuomo fired back , “Not a chance.”
“How about this network should apologize? I ask you to apologize,” he demanded before tearing into other entities that he thinks should apologize for their coverage. “The Washington Post should apologize and Adam Schiff should apologize. Before we start jamming him up in obstruction, couldn’t we take a day off and say the man was falsely accused?”"

After all, Chinese officials are asserting that they will impartially apply the law to both Bo Xilai, a fallen Communist Party princeling accused of corruption, and human rights activist Chen Guangcheng, who has just escaped years of house arrest by local police.

China Corruption Rule Of Law Bo Xilai Chen Guangcheng The brilliant analytical framework devised by economics Nobelist Douglass North , University of Maryland economist John Joseph Wallis , and Stanford University political scientist Barry Weingast in their 2009 book Violence and Social Orders: A Conceptual Framework for Interpreting Recorded Human History suggests that hope for a speedy Chinese adoption of the rule of law is unfortunately premature.
In Violence and Social Orders , North and his colleagues delineate a critical distinction between what they call “natural states” and “open access orders.” They also look at the history of how a few societies toward the end of the 18th century began the transition from natural to open access.
In their typology, natural states are ruled by a coalition of elites who control access to political power and economic resources. No significant organizations exist independent of the state and access to business, religious, military, and administrative organizations is limited to members of the elite coalition. Personal relationships is how power gets allocated among the members of the coalition. In fact, the idea of elite personal networks of influence and reciprocal obligation is neatly captured by the Chinese word guanxi .
Natural states are organized as patron-client networks in which elite patrons offer protection and channel resources to clients in exchange for their loyalty and support should intra-elite violence break out. Elite coalitions contain violence among non-elites because peace maximizes returns on the resource monopolies they own. Violence breaks out whenever members of an elite coalition think they have more to gain by defecting from the coalition. “Most economies still today,"" North states, ""are natural states.”
In the late 18th century some societies began to transition to open access orders in which enduring organizations exist independently of the state, e.g., formal political parties, advocacy groups, and corporations. The organizations operate under the rule of law. The rule of law means that all persons, institutions, and entities—public and private—including the state itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgated, equally enforced, and independently adjudicated. In the transition to open access orders, subjects become citizens.
The elite coalition that rules China is, of course, the Communist Party. The top organization of that elite coalition is the Politburo and the tip top center of power is the nine-member Standing Committee of the Politburo that oversees day-to-day administration. According to Brookings Institution analyst Cheng Li, there are currently two factions vying for power in the Politburo. One is comprised of the protégés of former President Jiang Zemin and the other is headed up by current President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. The deposed Bo was a member of the Jiang faction. Bo is the son of Bo Yibo, an ally of Deng Xiaoping. Deng reversed Mao Tse-tung’s destructive Cultural Revolution and launched the current drive toward modernization. Many other scions of former Communist revolutionary leaders, known as “princelings,” are part of the Jiang faction.
Later this year, China will undergo its once-in-a-decade leadership transition at the 18th National Party Congress. Bo was seeking to be elevated to the powerful nine-member Standing Committee of the Politburo. Bo had achieved great notoriety and some popularity as the party leader of the inland city of Chongqing by building vast public works projects, launching a crime crackdown, and promoting leftist nostalgia by reviving Maoist themes and songs. Bo’s wife Gu Kailai was known as a successful businesswoman. Bo’s fall from power was precipitated by the flight of his chief of police Wang Lijun to the U.S. consulate where he accused Bo’s wife of poisoning British expatriate businessman Neil Heywood for refusing to smuggle cash out the country for her. Bo is now being investigated for “serious violations” of party discipline. Gu is being investigated for murder.
In April, blind human rights lawyer Chen Guangcheng escaped to the U.S. embassy in Beijing complaining that he and his family have been forcibly detained by local police in their village. Chen had been imprisoned earlier for helping local farmers fight expropriation of their land and suing local officials for forcing women to have abortions in conformity with China’s one-child policy. Chen left the embassy to convalesce in hospital for a broken foot, injured during his escape. Chinese authorities in Beijing have apparently agreed to let Chen leave for the United States to study law.
What ties these two disparate cases together is the assertion by Chinese officials that both will be handled under the rule of law. For example, official statements declare that the investigation of Bo is a “resolute move” by the Party to “continue to unswervingly push forward the rule of law.” With regard to Chen the official China Daily flatly stated , “China is a country under the rule of law. The legal rights of any citizen are protected by its Constitution and laws.” What, if anything, do these official references to the rule of law signify about China’s future?
North and his colleagues identify the establishment of the rule of law (initially among members of the elite coalition) as the first of three “doorstep conditions” needed for the transition from a natural state to an open access order. The other two are the development of public and private elite organizations—including the state itself, whose existences do not depend on specific individuals—and consolidated political control of the military. Essentially the state no longer depends chiefly on the operation of patron-client networks with relationships becoming contractual rather than personal.
What is crucial is that each of the steps toward an open access order must be in the interests of the elites. For example, expanding the rule of law to non-elites give elite members greater opportunities to engage in profitable transactions. The existence of these “doorstep conditions” does not guarantee a transition from a natural state to open access, but North and colleagues persuasively assert that such a transition will not happen without them.
How close is China to standing at the threshold of these three doorstep conditions? Let’s start with the third one first, political control over the military. Up until the economic and political reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) acted as a “party-army” with considerable say in determining who the leaders of China would be. However, National Defense University analysts Michael Kiselycznyk and Phillip C. Saunders find [PDF] that in the last two decades there has been a “markedly reduced role of the PLA in Chinese elite politics.” In fact, none of the current members of the Politburo’s Standing Committee have served in the military. When Bo was ousted there were Internet rumors that a military coup had been attempted. A recent editorial in the Liberation Army Daily warns China’s military to remain loyal to the Party. At the moment it appears that China has successfully met this doorstep condition.
What about the development of permanent and impersonal private and public elite organizations? The idea is that power resides in the office not with the particular officeholder. If the officeholder steps down he retains no power. First, the good news: The ruling coalition does appear to be trying to establish permanent governance organizations whose operation is not dependent on the power wielded by specific individuals. A May 2012 Congressional Research Service study noted [PDF] that “enforcement of age and term limits for top Party and State positions has brought a degree of predictability into otherwise opaque Chinese elite politics.” As has been the practice at the two most recent Party Congresses, officials 68 years of age or older will likely be required to retire at the 18th Party Congress later this year. Newly appointed Politburo members will be 62 years old or younger. In addition, all top officials are limited to two five-year terms. Nevertheless, the abrupt Bo ouster suggests that elite infighting can still upset orderly succession plans.
While the operation of public organizations appears to be being regularized, private organizations outside the state simply do not exist in China. Thus there is no civil society challenge to the Party elites. And China’s communist elite means to keep it that way. As evidence consider that China’s spending on its internal security agencies, e.g., police, prisons, courts, and censors, is greater than its total military spending. The internal security system “maintains stability” by preventing protests against the regime and stopping them from spreading when they do break out. China is clearly far from reaching the second doorstep condition required for transitioning to an open access order.
That gets us to the first doorstep condition, the establishment of the rule of law. The communist elite does appear to be trying to figure out how to regularize the process of selecting future leaders whose power depends, not on their network of personal connections within the elite coalition, but on the bureaucratic interests of the organizations they head. This could be interpreted as a tiny step toward setting up a system of rule of law that applies to members of the elite.
Chinese officials are asserting that the rule of law will apply to both Bo and Chen. This is not going to happen. No further evidence is needed for that claim than how both men were treated prior to the recent imbroglios. As a Communist princeling, Bo’s advancement was facilitated by coalitional politics among members of the elite. As a member of the elite coalition he had access to both economic and political resources which he has evidently used to eliminate enemies and enrich himself and his family.Even his fall from power is the result of coalitional infighting, not anti-corruption efforts.
In the case of Chen, his insistence that local officials actually observe the law with regard to property and abortion got him imprisoned for four years on trumped charges that he had assembled a crowd to disrupt traffic. With regard to the rule of law, Chen’s lawyers were prevented from gathering evidence or interviewing witnesses in his defense. Since he got out of prison he and his family have been imprisoned in their home for the last two years. Even now irate officials have apparently beaten members of his family and arrested a nephew on what seems to be a specious charge of attempted murder as retaliation for Chen’s escape from custody.
The protestations by Chinese officials that their country observes the rule of law ring hollow. A couple of decades of spectacular economic growth may have convinced China’s Communist elite that reining in corruption and establishing the rule of law is not necessary. After all, China has raised incomes tenfold from $350 in1990 to over $3,000 per capita today. However, a 2003 World Bank study [PDF] finds that “entrenched elites in a country can benefit from a worsening status quo of misgovernance and can successfully resist demands for change even as incomes rise.” Under such conditions, economic growth eventually stalls out unless a country transitions to an open access order. As the cases of Bo and Chen illustrate in their own ways, China is still far from the doorstep conditions that would enable a transition to an open access order and guarantee its future prosperity.

National Weather Service Asks For #SafePlaceSelfies Wednesday to Promote Extreme Weather Preparedness,www.newsweek.com,Nina Godlewski,04-02-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/safe-place-selfie-day-nws-when-what-1383767,"On 4/3/19 at 8:30 AM EDT Share U.S.
In an effort to help people prepare for the upcoming severe weather season, the National Weather Service is encouraging people across the United States to take part in a social media campaign Wednesday.
The #SafePlaceSelfie day is in its fourth year and takes place sometime around early spring annually. The day usually happens around the time that tornado season starts. Just one month ago, deadly tornados ripped through Alabama killing more than 20 people .
“Every spring we try to rally the social media community to encourage everyone to take that number one preparedness action, which is knowing your safe location,” Douglas Hilderbrand, the lead on the SafePlaceSelfie campaign told Newsweek .
To participate in SafePlaceSelfie day people simply have to head to their safe place from any kind of natural disaster or extreme weather event whether that be a tornado, hurricane, tsunami, earthquake or any other extreme event and take a photo. The NWS is asking people to then share that photo on social media with the hashtag #SafePlaceSelfie at 11:11 a.m. local time Wednesday.
“The idea came about, sort of tapping into the selfie phenomenon, where we can sort of marry the preparedness action to something that doesn't cost anything, doesn't take a lot of time and is fun,” Hilderbrand said.

Having a set, safe place in the event of a weather emergency, as well as a plan to get there and a plan for communication is key. “It is the number one preparedness action that you can take,” Hilderbrand said about safe places. “If you’re in your safe place you have a much better chance of surviving and not getting injured and being able to walk away from a disaster,” he said.
Part of the reason the NWS is encouraging people to take and post their selfies is to actually show that they’ve taken a step to be more prepared for possible severe weather. “When you take that selfie you’re actually capturing preparedness in action and that’s a very powerful message,” Hilderbrand told Newsweek .
People are encouraged to get creative with their selfies too. Instead of sending traditional photos of standing in a basement or shelter, Hilderbrand said they could change it up. One example he gave was to send a photo from the beach with lifeguards, indicating the safe place is in safe swimming areas in view of trained on-duty lifeguards. Another example would be sitting next to a fireplace to stay safe from the extreme cold.
The NWS compiled some of its favorite selfies from years past of those who participated to show some examples for those looking to participate in the day.

Algeria’s Unrest Unsettles the Saudi/UAE-led Bloc,lobelog.com,Giorgio Cafiero,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://lobelog.com/algerias-unrest-unsettles-the-saudi-uae-led-bloc/,"Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)
By Giorgio Cafiero
In 2011, there was much optimism in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) that the so-called Arab Spring revolts would make the region more democratic. Yet over the past eight years, the MENA region has become increasingly authoritarian. This year, Egypt’s head of state is essentially securing his presidency for life while Sudan cracks down on protestors, Gulf monarchies grew more autocratic, and the Arab world is basically accepting Syria’s regime back into the regional diplomatic fold. The idea that the Arab Spring is “dead” provides a sense of comfort to the Gulf leaders who shuddered at the earlier wave of revolutionary activism.
Officials in Riyadh and other Gulf capitals are determined to prevent a repeat of 2011. The crackdown on dissenters and oppositionists (both Islamist and secular) in these counter-revolutionary countries since 2011 has been especially harsh. But the leaders of the Saudi/United Arab Emirates (UAE)-led bloc of “counter-revolutionary” states have done much more than tighten their grip at home. In the words of Marc Lynch, this anti-revolutionary bloc has “rewired the entire region trying to prevent another Arab Spring.” So, for instance, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi provided diplomatic, economic, and military support for Bahrain’s Al Khalifa rulers in 2011, bankrolled the Egyptian coup of 2013, sponsored Libya’s General Khalifa Haftar, and blockaded the only “pro-Arab Spring state” in the Gulf, Qatar.
Nonetheless, street demonstrations across Algeria and Sudan throughout late 2018/2019 suggest that the Arab Spring is not dead. The leadership in Saudi Arabia and other “pro-status quo states” in the Arab world fear that bottom-up change in Algeria and Sudan could spread across international borders. Bruce Riedel argues that Saudi officials observing events in Algeria “are worried about the implications of an increasingly incapacitated, elderly leader being ousted by popular demonstrations and demands for a more open political system—both anathemas to the Saudi absolute monarchy.” Recent protests in Iraq , Jordan , Lebanon , Morocco , and Tunisia also inform this view that “the Arab street is regaining its voice” in 2019.
The leadership in Riyadh is likely hoping that Algeria’s “deep state” (the Algerian military, security apparatus, and business tycoons) remains in power in the Maghrebi country. Just as Saudi Arabia backed Algeria’s military in 1992—with financial aid and by encouraging George H.W. Bush to follow suit—the leadership in Riyadh will likely attempt to help the Algerian authorities maintain their grip over the country, particularly in the wake of Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s recently announced resignation.
Yet with perpetually low oil prices, a costly war in Yemen, and its own ambitious economic reform program, Riyadh may not have sufficient funds to help Algeria’s leaders maintain power, particularly on top of financial obligations to Egypt and other Arab states. Moreover, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) has a reputational problem in Algeria. Protestors demonstrated against his visit to the country last year, and the Algerian president also snubbed him by canceling their meeting. It’s unclear whether Riyadh can convince the Trump administration to back Algeria’s army.
The worst-case scenario in Algeria from Saudi Arabia’s perspective would be an anti-status-quo political order emerging in Algiers. Riyadh fears an Islamist ascendancy in Algeria, similar to Egypt in 2011/2012, particularly against the backdrop of anger on the Arab street resulting from Arab states’ warming up to Israel. In February, Abdul Razzaq Muqri, head of Algeria’s Muslim Brotherhood-aligned party, the Movement for a Society of Peace, attacked Riyadh and Abu Dhabi for allegedly supporting Trump’s “Deal of the Century.” He declared that “Saudi Arabia is exploiting its influence and connections to enforce the Deal of the Century and normalize relations with the Zionist entity, while the UAE is concocting the scheme with the occupation state to concretize such [a] plot.” In a grander geopolitical context, officials in Riyadh as well as Abu Dhabi are nervous about Algerian Islamists on friendly terms with Qatar and Turkey shaping the country’s post-Bouteflika era and further distancing Algeria from the kingdom’s influence.
At the Arab League summit held last month in Tunis, there was much consensus in discussions about Algeria and Sudan’s deepening crises. But even as they band together to collectively oppress the will of their citizens, while ignoring the need for reforms that can address underlying grievances, these authoritarian governments are not laying the foundations for long-term stability. If the basic needs of a population are not met and the public is not satisfied with government services, civic anger will inevitably boil over in resistance to authorities, no matter how oppressively they govern.
What happens next in Algeria, where ordinary citizens are banding together against military, business, and political elites, will matter heavily for the future of the region. Ultimately, most authoritarian regimes in the Arab world appear to have learned the wrong lessons from the events of 2011 and now believe that only more repression can bring stability to unstable corners of the region. Algeria’s ruling elite embraces such thinking at its own peril. Share this: "

He predicted health care “will be a great campaign issue” for Republicans and said the party “will always support pre-existing conditions!” The president backed off a previous demand earlier this week for Congress to quickly pass a replacement for the Affordable Care Act after McConnell warned him in a private conversation that the upper chamber would not take up the issue ahead of 2020. “We had a good conversation yesterday afternoon and I pointed out to him the Senate Republicans’ view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives,” McConnell told reporters Tuesday. Trump on Tuesday also said divided government played into his thinking, while indicating he initially wanted Congress to act soon. “I wanted to delay it myself. I want to put it after the election because we don’t have the House,” the president told reporters in the Oval Office. The Trump administration thrust ObamaCare back into the spotlight last week after it agreed with a judge’s ruling that the entire law should be struck down. Trump then prodded GOP lawmakers to come up with a replacement. “The Republican Party will become the Party of Great HealthCare! ObamaCare is a disaster, far too expensive and deductibility ridiculously high — virtually unusable! Moving forward in Courts and Legislatively!” he tweeted last Thursday. His decision rattled Republican lawmakers, who have struggled to rally around an alternative health care plan since the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010. Republican leaders in Congress almost immediately distanced themselves from any effort to tackle an ObamaCare replacement. Democrats won control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections in large part by running on the issue of health care, pointing to the GOP Congress’s failed attempts to repeal former President Obama’s signature law."

"Conservative claims win in Wisconsin Supreme Court case, but recount likely",thehill.com,Reid Wilson,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/437100-conservative-claims-win-in-wisconsin-supreme-court-case-but-recount,"Conservative claims win in Wisconsin Supreme Court case, but recount likely By Reid Wilson - 04/03/19 08:52 AM EDT A conservative former adviser to ex-Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) claimed victory in a closely fought race for a state Supreme Court seat in Wisconsin early Wednesday, potentially cementing a Republican-leaning majority for years to come. With all but a small handful of precincts reporting, Judge Brian Hagedorn clung to a narrow 6,000-vote lead — or about four-tenths of a percentage point — over Judge Lisa Neubauer, the candidate backed by Wisconsin’s Democratic Party. ADVERTISEMENT “The people of Wisconsin have spoken, and our margin of victory is insurmountable,” Hagedorn said in an early-morning statement. “The voters chose to have a Court that keeps personal political beliefs out of the courtroom and applies the law as written.” The Associated Press had not yet called the race, and it was not immediately clear how many absentee votes had yet to be counted. A recount is likely if the results remain that close; state law allows a losing candidate to request a recount if the results are within 1 percentage point. The results are a significant blow to Democrats, who hoped to rebuild a liberal majority in the next Supreme Court election, in 2020. If Hagedorn’s lead holds, he would be the fifth conservative on the seven-member court, replacing the state’s longest-serving justice, liberal Shirley Abrahamson. Hagedorn’s win is an early sign that Wisconsin remains at the fulcrum of the national political debate. Walker won his two terms as governor, as well as a recall election, by the slimmest of margins. Gov. Tony Evers (D) beat Walker in 2018 by just 30,000 votes. Both Democrats and Republicans see Wisconsin as a critical stop on their path to 270 electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election, and Republicans striking a win even when Democratic enthusiasm is so high will be seen as a promising sign for President Trump "

A political advocacy group with ties to the Republican Party is launching a advertisement campaign slamming the Democratic party and Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, according to CNN on Wednesday. American Action Network told CNN that the campaign would launch later this week, spending six figures to question Omar for criticizing congress members' support for Israel. In February, Omar said at an event, “I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is okay to push for allegiance to a foreign country.” Many Jews took this statement as a reminder of the antisemitic trope of dual loyalty. The ad says Omar ""keeps hurling anti-Semitic slurs."" including images of tweets such as the now-deleted tweet from 2012, where Omar wrote ""Israel has hypnotized the world."" Omar tweeted this before she was an elected congressional representative. According to the political group, the online ad will target swing voters. Omar declined to respond to the report. Republican's in Minnesota, the state Omar represents have also tried to besmirch Omar's name. They have filed a campaign finance complaint saying that she allegedly spent $6,000 of campaign funds for personal uses. Sinclair Broadcasting said that the state's campaign finance board is preparing to issue a ruling.

Budget allocates $24.7M to improve voting process — publicly funded elections delayed | The Legislative Gazette,www.verifiedvoting.org,The Voting News,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.verifiedvoting.org/budget-allocates-24-7m-to-improve-voting-process-publicly-funded-elections-delayed-the-legislative-gazette/,"Apr 3 2019 » The Voting News
Election reformers are seeing mixed results in the new state budget passed this week. On one hand, New Yorkers will now be able to vote before Election Day, register to vote online, and polls will open earlier for upstate primaries. Additionally, employers will be required to give all workers three hours of paid time off to vote, and with a new $14.7 million allocation, voters will be able to sign in at polling places using an electronic sign-in book. The e-poll books keep track of data such as voter registration, voting history and verification and identification of voters. This will bring the state’s system up to date with 21st century technology. More than half of the states in the U.S. use electronic polling books already. On the other hand, many good-government groups and activists are angry that the budget did not establish a system of publicly financed campaigns that rely on a small-donor matching system, coupled with lowered contribution limits. Instead, a commission will study the feasibility of such a system for legislative and statewide offices, and will issue a report in December. Proposed by the Fair Elections for New York campaign, a small-donor matching system would give a voice to New Yorkers who cannot afford to donate large sums of money to political candidates. It is also seen as a system that allows more people to run for political office."

The 14 nominees donated an average of just over $350,000 each to the inaugural committee, which is now under federal investigation . Six of the nominees have stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate. One nomination has been delayed for about two years, according to NBC. ADVERTISEMENT
The report notes that presidents often appoint donors to such positions.
Former President Obama nominated Kirk W.B. Wagar, who donated more than $200,000 to Obama and other Democrats during his reelection campaign, as ambassador to Singapore, while former President George W. Bush’s ambassador to Sweden and Liechtenstein, Mercer Reynolds, donated more than $100,000 to Republicans.
The total numbers are what makes Trump's situation unique, according to NBC.
Most modern presidents, including Obama and Bush, have nominated about two-thirds career diplomats and one-third political appointees for ambassadorships, according to the report. The split is closer to about half and half for the Trump administration, NBC reports, citing data from the American Foreign Service Association .
According to the analysis, the Trump administration has also fallen behind on ambassador confirmations. By this point in their first terms, Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama had seen 96, 84 and 89 percent of their nominees confirmed, respectively, while only 66 percent of Trump’s have been confirmed.
R. Nicholas Burns, who served as undersecretary of State and ambassador to NATO under Bush and as ambassador to Greece under both Bush and Clinton, says the disparity is largely due to the White House’s slowness in submitting nominations.
""What I don't know is if some of these people are being held up by the Democrats,"" Burns told NBC. ""That sometimes happens.""

Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce argued Tuesday night that the ""average man"" would be fired for ""what Joe Biden Joseph (Joe) Robinette Biden Two more women accuse Biden of inappropriate touching Trump taunts Biden amid misconduct allegations: 'You having a good time, Joe?' Biden controversy splits Dems on generational, political lines MORE is doing"" after a total of four women have claimed the former vice president touched them in appropriately in the past.
The comments came during a discussion with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who said that he while he found Biden to be ""weird"" and his behavior ""creepy,"" he also hoped American society wasn't getting to a place where people couldn't hug each other. Carlson added that he found the Democratic Party ""appalling hypocritical and power hungry"" on the issue of sexual harassment. ADVERTISEMENT
“What Joe Biden is doing, the average man if he did it at work, would be fired,"" Bruce told Carlson. ""There's a difference between hugging somebody, and we've all been through that, and in Mr. Biden's case, in the new case and in the [Lucy] Flores case, there was a restraint of someone physically. In the Flores case, he restrained her by her shoulders. In other cases, he retrains women by holding their jaw line or neck area.""
""The Washington Post said he placed his hands on [Flores's] shoulders. He was restraining her. This his face moved into her hair. It was an intimate action you would normally reserve for a loved one or spouse or someone you know and love. Then after awhile slowly kissed the back of her head. That's not hugging someone,"" Bruce added.
Flores, a former Nevada assemblywoman, wrote in an op-ed for The Cutt that Biden made her deeply uncomfortable by sniffing her hair and kissing the back of her head at a 2014 campaign event.
Biden said in the statement issued over the weekend that he has ""offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort.""
""And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately,"" he added. ""If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully.""
Three other women have come forward in recent days, alleging Biden touched them inappropriately.
One of the women, Caitlyn Caruso, told The New York Times that she was 19 when Biden rested his hand on her thigh during a sexual assault forum in Las Vegas. She also told the newspaper that she squirmed to let him know it was making her uncomfortable.

WESTERLY, R.I. (AP) — Police say a car stolen in Connecticut has crashed into the gates of singer Taylor Swift's beachfront Rhode Island home.
Westerly Police Chief Shawn Lacey tells The Sun of Westerly that officers in the neighboring Rhode Island town of Hopkinton started pursuing the vehicle at about 1 a.m. Tuesday.
He says the car sped away from several attempts to stop it, reaching speeds of up to 65 mph. The vehicle eventually crashed into the wall outside Swift's property in Westerly before ricocheting into the main entrance gate at an estimated speed of 35 mph.
The driver, 19-year-old Shykeim Edwin Lewis, of Hartford, Connecticut, faces several charges and was held on $10,000 bond. No attorney was listed in online court records.
The car's three other occupants were not charged.

The disrupters—two female students—shouted at the border patrol officers from outside the classroom, and later moved inside. The encounter was partly, but not entirely, captured on video: The women can be seen yelling at the cops and daring the event's student-organizers to call the cops on them."

That being said, the First Amendment doesn't protect violating other people's rights with your speech.
If the organizers want to sue the protestors in question for damages, such as for whatever expenses were involved in holding the event, then that should only require a preponderance of the evidence in a civil trial--rather than a criminal charge."

We have all seen a number of aggrieved using tactics meant to bring any speech or discussion with which they disagree to a (sometimes literal) screeching halt. Is that what happened here? Was that the intent?
The protestor's case wasn't helped by the claim she felt ""unsafe"" by a person in the same room into which she just barged. That's blatantly disingenuous. Additionally, the protest could have easily gotten its point across to attendees as they entered and exited the meeting.
When two competing speech rights occur as they did here, I am not inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to those attempting to convey less useful and calmly presented information."

If you were to put together a comedy-based lecture on etiquette, presented in homage to the slapstick stylings of John Ritter and Charlie Chaplain, I think the rest of us should protect the integrity of your event, even if Ken Shultz totes a lectern up on stage and begins presenting the teachings of Emily Post in the style of William F. Buckley.
It really shouldn't matter if you are ""protesting"" or simply being a jerk. If you are disrupting someone else's event, that is disorderly conduct and you should stop. So walking into the middle of a 5 year old kid's birthday party at the pavilion at the local park and singing ""Do Wah Diddy Diddy Dum Diddy Do"" at the top of your lungs over and over just because you felt like it should be treated exactly the same as walking into the middle of a young republicans meeting and screaming your political chants at them."

Is it really exercising free speech, or is it good old-fashioned disorderly conduct?
If I show up at an Obama or Trump event, do I get to disrupt it because I disagree with their policies? How much? 5 minutes? 10 minutes? Does everyone get a turn? Does it make a big difference if I go inside or if I drive up outside a public square where they are speaking and blast my favorite polka in protest of their policies on Poland?
What if I want to protest the murder of horses to support the baseball industry? Can I take the field at the local public park and disrupt the little league game?
Protesting is one thing... usurping the platform of others might be something else altogether - since you are inherently violating their rights in the process."

IF IF IF there was a conspiracy to shut down the event, I'm not sure they should escape criminal charges just because their premeditated and willful effort to shut down the event was unsuccessful.
Sometimes, in our libertarian desire to defend the First Amendment, we lose sight of the fact that the First Amendment doesn't protect violating people's rights with our speech any more than the Second Amendment protects our right to violate people's rights with our guns. Threatening to shoot someone if they don't empty the cash register isn't protected by the First Amendment and neither are perjury in a criminal trial nor fraud.
Conspiring to violate other people's rights shouldn't be protected by the First Amendment either. I don't have a libertarian problem with treating premeditated murder differently from accidentally killing someone when driving drunk, and I certainly don't see why evidence of premeditation should be excluded from testimony in a criminal trial on the basis of the First Amendment.
If the defendants talked about shutting this event down on social media, or something, again, I'm not sure a criminal conspiracy shouldn't be prosecuted just because the willful attempt to violate someone's rights was ultimately unsuccessful."
