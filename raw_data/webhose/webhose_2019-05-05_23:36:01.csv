You can be strong by yourself all you want.... You might be stronger than me by yourself, but I bring my friend STEVE SMITH and our neighbors over to your place and your singular strength becomes quite unimpressive. And your stuff becomes our stuff.
This is the driver of all things human. Language, social interactions, loyalty, altruism, teamwork.... we are down an evolutionary path that favors group dynamics over the individual.
But this also probably explains the natural splintering into groups that we display in studies like the ""hand out two different colored T-shirts"" experiments. Because initial groups would be extended family - which carry your genes. Then groups of related families in your tribe. Also more genetically similar to you.
So both war and peace are built in to our genetic heritage. And so is cheating... stealing from your neighbor is advantageous if you don't get caught. So is hooking up with his wife. Hence the need for the 10 commandments."

So now nobody learns that running your mouth too much will get you a punch in the nose.
It started with women, as the societal prohibition on violence against women pivoted from ""the taming of the shrew"" to ""never lay hands on a woman, no matter what"". So women were emboldened to indulge their rhetorical weaponry. Hence the violent rhetoric of the ""-studies"" fields.
And as Adam Carolla pointed out in ""In 50 years we'll all be chicks"", this inevitably spread to all layers of society.
So you want to know why we are so uncivil to one another? It is because incivility no longer comes with the consequences of a punch in the nose."

I do. And it isn't going away terribly quickly if my diagnosis is correct.
It is because of something seemingly unrelated - the near total defeat of violence in our society.
Even in the mid-70's there was a veneer of formality and politeness over society. You would never call an adult acquaintance or stranger by their first name, you would say ""Mr. Gillespie"", not ""Nick"". You would say ""Sir"" or ""Ma'am"".
Why? Because there was always the possibility that causing someone serious offence might result in getting punched in the nose, or worse. For all of history prior to that moment, people carried weapons in public. Not just guns, but knives, clubs, cudgels, etc. So you signaled your intention to avoid violence by acting with respect in public."

Any disclosure of this data to the government unavoidably has a testimonial aspect, therefore a compelled disclosure is expressly prohibited by the 5th Amendment. This principle pre-dates U.S. Independence (Entick v. Carrington), represents the original intent behind the 4th and 5th Amendments, and was affirmed 100 years afterwards in Boyd v. United States (1886). Quote: :
""The seizure or compulsory production of a man's private papers to be used in evidence against him is equivalent to compelling him to be a witness against himself, and, in a prosecution for a crime, penalty or forfeiture, is equally within the prohibition of the Fifth Amendment.
Both amendments relate to the personal security of the citizen. They nearly run into, and mutually throw light upon, each other. When the thing forbidden in the Fifth Amendment, namely, compelling a man to be a witness against himself, is the object of a search and seizure of his private papers, it is an ""unreasonable search and seizure"" within the Fourth Amendment. ""
So what are we presently talking about? About creative pseudo-legal sophistry developed for the purpose of granting the government powers that the Founders did not intent to give."

There's just too many bad statistics for black Americans that have nothing to do with white Americans. Things like lower high school graduation rates, lower test scores, higher instances of stds, higher rates of children born out of wedlock, higher rates of abortion..etc etc.
White people aren't blocking the doors to the school bus each morning and the people at rite aid aren't hiding the condoms when a black guy walks in.
The issues will never be solved until black people embrace individual liberty and take more responsibility for themselves. And if not themselves, they need to start with their kids then."

I was recently watching a movie about Aboriginal peoples in AU. And I know people who collect their artworks and stick them in museums. So I've thought about how different groups of people value things differently. For example, when you buy a painting from an Aboriginal, the money goes into a sort of Trust, administered by the gallery or a non-profit, to keep the money from disappearing overnight, because their culture is one of community property. If you were to hand one of them a million dollars cash, on his or her way to the store they'd be asked, by each person they met, for some of that money. And the money would be given without question. Upon arriving at the store, the artist might have a couple bucks left, and they'd think nothing of it. So whitey makes sure the artist can't do that by holding the money in trust and doling it out a little at a time. Is that fair? Is that moral? I really can't decide. But what it shows you is that the descendants of Europeans define ""success"" as independence derived from financial security, and the Aboriginals define it in a totally different way."

What is America trying to accomplish for the descendants of Africans? It's possible that whitey has been trying to define their success in terms that are not shared or valued by the recipients of the supposed largess. Which makes it a never-ending fools errand.
And if that possibility is denied, is that claiming that they are just too stupid to ""succeed""? It's possible that not enough of them give a damn about external measures of ""success"" or else they would have moved heaven and earth to attain it in the last 150 years, and they would have seen through the destructive ""helping"" that appears, on the surface, to have derailed so much initiative.
Contrast the experience of the Chinese in America. Also physically distinct from Europeans, they were easy to single out for grotesquely unfair treatment. However, Chinese culture happens to define success in much the same way as Europeans do. So they just didn't take ""no"" for an answer.
I might be full of shit. Thinking out loud here."

Here's a question for conservatives. What would they do if government at all levels, in league with private enterprise at all levels, intentionally discriminated against them for 100 years, forcing them to live in substandard housing, attend substandard educational institutions from elementary through high school, prevented them from attending state-run universities, refused them access to government-sponsored home mortgages, refused them the right to purchase new homes in the suburbs, did not allow them to obtain veterans benefits, prevented them from working in responsible government jobs, made them ineligible for Social Security benefits, forced them to live in segregated federal housing, etc. What remedies would conservatives pursue to right the social and economic wrongs done to them by 100 years of government action and policy?

There is a court chase where a defendant wanted to refuse a pardon on the grounds that the defendant considered accepting it to be an admission of guilt.

And which one of those has anything to do with rapists in the caravan? Trump's horseshit about rapists in the caravan was horseshit--regardless of whether it was literally true!
Is any of this getting through? Do you imagine it's necessary to believe that rapists in the caravan is an important issue--so important that it doesn't matter whether someone supports securing the border so long as they believe in rapists in the caravan?
If we were to rank immigration issues in order of their importance, would anything be lower on the list than Trump's claims about rapists in the caravan? Do you not see that by defending Trump's claims about rapists in the caravan, we undermine support for border security in the minds of the American people?
Do you or do you not support border security regardless of whether there were rapists in the caravan, and if the question of whether there were rapists in the caravan doesn't change your opinion on border security, then why are you willing to defend the idea that there were rapists in the caravan?

I suspect you were in favor of securing the border regardless of whether there were any rapists in the caravan, weren't you? If that's your position, then why not start from that point?

And given the behavior of the FBI and DoJ while he's actually been in office, and the non subsiding derangement of his political opponents, he'd be taking a huge risk not to pardon himself on the way out, for any and all offenses that his enemies might choose to investigate him for.
So if I were on his legal team I wouldn't be worrying too much about whether he can self pardon - there's no such limitation in the text, and currently the ""living constitutionalists"" are in the minority on SCOTUS.

It's easy to get lost trying to defend literal interpretations, especially when literal interpretations don't really matter.
The Iraq War was justified on the basis Saddam Hussein was a collaborator with Al Qaeda with a WMD program. Some people have pointed to some forgotten stockpiles that were discovered years after the fact (and never used) as if spending $1.3 trillion and losing the lives and limbs of thousands of American heroes were somehow justified because someone somewhere literally found an empty shell with traces of WMD in it. If you want to defend the Iraq War, don't hang your hat on a literal interpretation of whether Saddam Hussein had WMD.

I'd add another Trump outrage that probably came up after press time. Trump threatens to close our southern border. The media including Reason, are apoplectic. Mexico scrambles to limit entry at it's southern border. Trump praises their efforts. Crisis averted. When I tell people that Trump is an ordinary president, I always get a look of shock in response. But in terms of policy it's all been done before. Where he differs from his predecessors is in the threat he represents to the entrenched federal power structure, the deep state and the media. I think Twitter is probably the worst thing that has happened to the culture in a very long time and for Trump to shoot his mouth off there on a regular basis is frankly offensive to me. He comes off more like the loudmouth at the end of the bowling alley bar than a serious statesman. But baiting and befuddling his avowed enemies in the media and political class is pretty obviously an intentional and winning strategy. That they don't seem to understand this is pretty hilarious.
I'd personally be a lot happier if the media would ""normalize"" the Trump presidency so I could go back to my comfort zone of endlessly bitching about the president instead of defending him. The longer this goes on the more I like this guy. And yeah I also voted for Gary."

None of anything you've written here has anything to do with Trump's horseshit statements. They're things that are true regardless of whether the things Trump says are horseshit. The things you're saying are true or not regardless of anything Trump says about rapists and Al Qaeda in the caravan. My question is why we feel compelled to defend Trump's horseshit when the underlying issues and policies are legitimate regardless of what Trump says or whether his defense of them are literally true.
Trump didn't claim there was a danger of Al Qaeda in the caravan because it was literally true. He made that claim because it helps legally justify his executive actions as Commander-in-chief.
We need to not be like Jane Fonda. No ""Hanoi Jane"", you don't have to swear up and down that the North Vietnamese are treating our POWs well--when they're actually being tortured. You can oppose the Vietnam War without pretending that everything everyone says on your side must be literally true. Horseshit is said in defense of good causes all the time--especially by politicians. If Trump said that capitalism is better than socialism because capitalism means that everyone gets free steaks for dinner from the government, that doesn't mean he's wrong about capitalism being better than socialism. It just means that he's full of shit."

If we consider leaders from 1919 were to be told that man-made climate change would be occurring over the next 100 years they would have two options: reduce all use of carbon resulting 100 years of stagnation or allow it to continue as expected and face an unknown future. Now we jump back to 2019 and we can easily observe that stagnation would have been awful (technologies that would have been discovered were not because resources were not allowed to be used that would have been required) and that advances in science and engineering has put us in a better position to address these issues. Now let's jump forward to 2119 and look back and consider the same options from 1919. If we choose stagnation then we would be looking at over population and a world where most have moved back into greater poverty due to the world wide depression that continues to that day. If we choose the unknown future, we see that various scientific discoveries, engineering marvels, and increased wealth has resulted in a cleaner world that has normalized and where humans have greater control over weather and nature in general. Of course we will still have the mainstream media so... fear."

This is the ""community standards"" argument: ""Everyone wants this movie banned because it's too popular.""
