Federal prosecutors pick up Trump's slack on this key issue (Opinion),us.cnn.com,Jennifer Rodgers,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/opinions/homegrown-terrorism-threat-rodgers/index.html,"Jennifer Rodgers is a CNN legal analyst, a lecturer-in-law at Columbia Law School and a former federal prosecutor in the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. The opinions her own; view more opinion articles at CNN.
(CNN) The threat of homegrown terrorism, including white supremacist terrorism, appears to be on the rise . Headlines are full of recent terrorist attacks carried out by people with white supremacist views; they include the Tree of Life synagogue killer, the Coast Guard lieutenant charged with plotting a major attack on politicians and news anchors perceived to be left-leaning (he has pleaded not guilty ), the New Zealand mosque killer, and the mail bomber Cesar Sayoc.
Jennifer Rodgers In 2017, federal law enforcement officials, in an intelligence bulletin, acknowledged the persistent threat white supremacist terrorism presented, but the Trump administration seems to have ignored the findings. President Donald Trump for his part refuses to acknowledge that white nationalism in this mold is a rising terror threat, preferring to downplay these men as lone attackers with mental illnesses who have nothing to do with him and his divisive rhetoric. Recently, echoing the 2017 findings, FBI Director Christopher Wray testified that white supremacy is a ""persistent, pervasive threat."" Despite expert analysis, though, we may be moving in the wrong direction: it was recently reported that the Department of Homeland Security has disbanded an intelligence and analysis unit dedicated to the threat of homegrown violent extremists, though DHS claimed it was more of a reorganization. Read More Cesar Sayocs can be found almost anywhere in America. Presidents should take heed This is why it is so important for federal prosecutors handling these cases to forge ahead and continue their vital work, as the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York did in the Cesar Sayoc case. For a number of days last October, the nation was gripped by the news that pipe bombs had been mailed to the homes and offices of numerous people (and a news organization -- CNN) having something notable in common: all had been repeatedly disparaged and attacked by President Donald Trump. We were riveted again when the FBI made an arrest in the case: Sayoc, a Florida man who apparently built the pipe bombs in a white van plastered with pro-Trump propaganda. On March 21, this case was resolved when Sayoc pled guilty in Manhattan federal court to a superseding information charging 65 counts, covering all of the 16 pipe bombs he sent to victims around the country. Sayoc will be sentenced in September. The sentencing guidelines range agreed to by Sayoc and prosecutors, which the judge must consider but is not bound by, is life imprisonment. And one of Sayoc's counts of conviction carries a mandatory minimum of 10 years imprisonment to be served consecutive to whatever sentence is imposed on the other counts. What to expect in the case against pipe bomb suspect Cesar Sayoc Practically speaking, this means that Sayoc will serve between 10 years and the rest of his life in prison. While we won't know until the fall what Sayoc's sentence is, securing this plea was a good move by prosecutors for a number of reasons. Prosecutors simply don't have enough time to take all of their cases to trial. Reduced charges are offered to people like Sayoc because a plea offers benefits for both parties: Sayoc escaped the possibility of conviction on more counts with mandatory minimum sentences, and prosecutors got a certain result without having to use precious resources on a trial. This will allow Southern District prosecutors to focus on other matters, including the upcoming death penalty-eligible terrorism trial of Sayfullo Saipov for allegedly using his van to murder eight people on the West Side Highway in October 2017. He pleaded not guilty, but has offered to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty. JUST WATCHED Hate propaganda reaching historic levels, ADL says Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Hate propaganda reaching historic levels, ADL says 02:22 Guilty pleas also benefit the public by providing finality. Unlike a conviction at trial, after which defendants may -- and often do -- continue to profess their innocence, Sayoc's guilty plea required him to admit that he has committed the charged crimes, under oath and in public. Although he later sent a letter to the judge saying that the pipe bombs were meant to intimidate -- not hurt anyone -- the public can rest assured that Sayoc is guilty, and the plea obtained ensures that he will be sentenced to a lengthy prison term. Even in cases with strong evidence like this one, trials carry elements of uncertainty, and terrorism trials can be uniquely challenging and draining of prosecutorial resources. Given the nature of the charges, issues of security are paramount. Terrorism trials also generate a great deal of publicity, which can affect other trial participants, including witnesses' willingness to testify, and jurors' willingness to serve. Jurors may see press reports, which can endanger a guilty verdict on appeal, despite the warnings judges give to avoid them. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Finally, trials in terror cases are usually complicated procedurally and complicated in terms of the evidence presented. In the Sayoc case, government lawyers indicated that at trial they might have needed experts in multiple areas , including explosives, forensic chemistry, and DNA and fingerprint analysis. Of course, we should be able to rely on our President, our intelligence communities, and our investigative agencies to take these threats seriously and act accordingly. Hopefully they do. But at least Sayoc's guilty plea is a sign that the criminal justice system part of our government is working to deter those who would wish to follow in Sayoc's footsteps."
Alphabet-owned company is delivering espresso via drone in Australia,edition.cnn.com,Matt McFarland,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/alphabet-drone-delivery/index.html,"Washington, DC (CNN Business) It's been more than five years since Jeff Bezos unveiled Amazon's drone delivery plans on ""60 Minutes."" Since the excitement, progress has been slow.
But in a development that points to the field's potential, Wing, the drone delivery company of Google's parent company Alphabet, announced Tuesday that it's delivering food and other items within minutes to a limited number of homes in the suburbs of Canberra, Australia's capital. Interest in drone delivery exploded in December 2013 when Bezos said drone delivery was likely four or five years into the future. But Amazon has only announced a small trial in Cambridge, England, near where it has tested drones. Drone deliveries in the United States have been more limited as companies wait on regulations that will allow fully autonomous drones to fly without being directly monitored by a human. A North Dakota golf course has delivered food to players, and drone startup Flirtey has done 7-11 deliveries in Nevada. Your medical supplies could soon arrive by drone But the biggest drone delivery programs to date are happening overseas . Zipline, a Silicon Valley-based startup, says it's made 12,000 medical deliveries in Rwanda since 2016. The drones have sped up deliveries to remote clinics, which can be difficult to access by road. Zipline says it will expand to Ghana later this month. Read More At first, Wing's deliveries will be limited to 100 households in three suburbs, Crace, Palmerston and Franklin. Wing expects to gradually expand to two more neighborhoods in the coming months. Delivery will be free for the first three months. While Wing may appear ahead of Amazon today, there's still a long way to go before any company is a clear leader. Drone delivery companies face questions about safety and public acceptance. Some neighbors may consider drones a nuisance and privacy invasion if they're loudly landing in backyards at all hours. Google previously showed off videos of its drones as they lowered packages to the ground on a rope rather than landing in a backyard. The approach lessens the risk of a drone crashing into a person, pet or property at the delivery site. Amazon declined to comment for this story."

Brooklyn measles outbreak: New York City declares a public health emergency,us.cnn.com,Susan Scutti,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/measles-new-york-emergency-bn/index.html,"(CNN) New York City has declared the measles outbreak affecting the Orthodox Jewish community in Williamsburg to be a public health emergency, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday.
Unvaccinated people living in select ZIP codes will be required to receive the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, known as MMR, to curtail the outbreak and protect others, he said. 78 new measles cases reported nationwide since last week, CDC says Under the mandatory vaccinations, members of the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene will check the vaccination records of any individual who may have been in contact with infected patients. Those who have not received the MMR vaccine or do not have evidence of immunity may be given a violation and could be fined $1,000. ""Every hour, every day matters here. If people would just go and get vaccinated, there's no cause for a fine,"" de Blasio said. ""It's not our goal to issue violations. We want to simply solve the problem."" New Yorkers should call 311 to access a list of facilities that can provide the measles vaccine at low or no cost, de Blasio said. Read More Outbreak began in October The public health emergency comes in response to 285 cases of measles reported in Brooklyn and Queens since the beginning of the outbreak in October. The same outbreak is responsible for 15 cases of measles in Orange County, New York, and 168 cases in Rockland County, New York. The outbreak began when, according to health officials, an unvaccinated child became infected with the illness while visiting Israel. 5 things to know about measles ""Since then, there have been additional people from Brooklyn and Queens who were unvaccinated and acquired measles while in Israel. People who did not travel were also infected in Brooklyn and Rockland County,"" the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene says. Of the 285 New York City cases, the range of ages has been 1 month to 66 years, with 246 children affected, Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said Tuesday. Five of 21 hospitalized cases have been admitted to the intensive care unit, she added. Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Dr. Herminia Palacio warned of ""measles parties,"" where parents bring together unvaccinated children with a sick child to intentionally spread the disease. ""Avoid this practice,"" Palacio said. Measles parties are dangerous because the disease can be fatal. ""This vaccine is safe,"" she added, noting that it not only protects your child, it protects other people. ""A variety of misunderstandings and frank untruths that are being propagated through a variety of channels."" Despite problems, there are hopeful signs, Barbot noted. Since September, 8,000 people have been vaccinated. Measles outbreaks nationwide Measles is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable respiratory illness characterized by a rash of flat red spots. Symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. Amid measles outbreaks, Facebook considering how to reduce spread of anti-vaccine content Measles can also lead to death when complications become too severe, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 1 child out of every 1,000 who get measles will develop encephalitis -- swelling of the brain -- that can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability. As many as 1 out of every 20 children with measles will get pneumonia, the agency reports. ""You can be infectious four days before you actually develop the rash,"" Barbot said. Measles is an airborne disease, so a sneeze can spread it, and infectious germs can last two hours after a person has left the room. ""There's nothing in Talmudic law that prohibits vaccination,"" Barbot said. Nationwide, measles outbreaks have been reported in 19 states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington. At least 465 cases of measles have been reported across the United States since January 1, according to numbers shared by the CDC on Monday. Measles rarely kills in the US -- but when it does, here's how The total number of measles cases nationwide this year ""is the second-greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since measles was eliminated in 2000,"" the CDC says. That threshold was reached last week when the national total for the year surpassed last year's total of 372. The largest outbreak was in 2014, when there were 667 cases reported nationwide due to several large outbreaks. Along with the outbreak affecting Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community, Rockland County in upstate New York is also experiencing a high number of measles cases within its own Orthodox Jewish community. As of Friday, the county reported 153 confirmed cases, though state health officials noted that additional cases have not been reported. Last month, in an effort to contain this outbreak, Rockland County banned unvaccinated people under age 18 from public places. Late Friday, acting state Supreme Court Justice Rolf Thorsen issued a restraining order to block the county from enforcing the ban. Rockland County Executive Ed Day said Tuesday that he plans to appeal the judge's decision. He and members of the county's Department of Health spent the weekend working on potential strategies for thwarting the outbreak that ""jumped from 151 cases to 168 in just 10 days,"" he said. ""We are taking the steps we can take while waiting for the court to move forward."" Rockland County Commissioner of Health Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert explained that the county is in the process of developing new criteria to identify specific unvaccinated people who have been exposed to the measles in order to issue orders that require them to remain at home for 21 days, the length of the illness' incubation period. If caught in violation of this rule, people will be fined, she said. ""The MMR vaccine works faster than the incubation of the disease,"" Ruppert said. ""This disease has affected mainly children in the county,"" she said. ""Stay the heck home if you've been ill or exposed.""
New York City's mayor said a legal action like the one that blocked Rockland County's ban will not hinder its mandatory vaccination policy. The city's legal department has looked into the mandatory vaccination ""extensively,"" de Blasio said. ""We are absolutely certain we have the right to do this. If anyone is thinking of a legal challenge, we are absolutely comfortable that we will win that case."" He also emphasized the danger measles poses to children, pregnant women and immune-compromised people, who are at highest risk of an infection. ""We saw only two cases in New York City in 2017, so we have a very serious situation on our hands,"" de Blasio said. ""We cannot allow this dangerous disease to make a comeback in this city. We have to stop it now."""
"Whitening strip ingredient is harmful to deep layer of teeth, research says",us.cnn.com,"Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/whitening-strips-study/index.html,"(CNN) Hydrogen peroxide, the active ingredient in over-the-counter whitening strips, may be harmful to the layer under the enamel of teeth, according to research presented Tuesday at a scientific meeting.
Teeth are made up of three layers: the outer enamel, an underlying dentin layer and connective tissue that binds it to the gum. The middle layer, dentin, is rich in proteins, of which collagen is the most abundant. This affordable at-home teeth whitening kit is a game-changer Most studies on the safety of hydrogen peroxide have focused on enamel. The chemical is known to penetrate the enamel and reach the dentin, although in miniscule amounts, explained Dr. Edmond Hewlett, associate dean at the UCLA School of Dentistry and spokesman for the American Dental Association, who was not involved in the new study. Kelly Keenan, senior author of the study and associate professor of chemistry at Stockton University in New Jersey, said in a statement that she and her colleagues ""sought to further characterize what the hydrogen peroxide was doing to collagen."" Essentially, all whitening products in the United States contain hydrogen peroxide and/or carbamide peroxide, according to the American Dental Association. Read More Using entire teeth and artificial saliva, the researchers watched the collagen in dentin break down into smaller proteins when treated with hydrogen peroxide, according to the results, presented at the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology meeting . ""Our results show that treatment with hydrogen peroxide concentrations similar to those found in whitening strips is enough to make the original collagen protein disappear,"" Keenan said. Hewlett cautions against generalizing results obtained in extracted teeth, as they may not represent the same environment as a person's mouth. Because the research is in its early stages, it's unknown to what extent the dentin is damaged, what this would mean for patients and whether the damage is permanent, he said.
""The tooth-whitening products that the abstracts are talking about have been around for decades and used by millions and millions of people,"" he said. ""As far as the integrity of the tooth being damaged, that has not emerged."" The most common side effect that dentists see after the use of whitening strips is tooth sensitivity, which is transient and does not represent underlying damage of the tooth, he said. Hewlett recommends looking for products that have the American Dental Association seal of acceptance, which means they have been tested for safety and effectiveness by the organization."
Nearly 300 US mumps cases reported in March,us.cnn.com,"Debra Goldschmidt, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/mumps-cases-us-cdc-bn/index.html,"(CNN) There have been 426 cases of mumps reported in the United States this year as of March 29, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
That's an increase of 275 cases in the last month. Previously, the CDC reported 151 cases of mumps as of the end of February. Mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease that is caused by a virus. It is spread through saliva or mucus by coughing, sneezing or talking, and sharing eating utensils or cups, according to the CDC. It can also spread when an infected person touches items or surfaces that are then touched by someone else who picks up the virus. Outbreaks usually occur among people who have close contact, such as on college campuses and among sports teams. Read More Symptoms can appear 12 to 25 days after a person is infected and can include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness and loss of appetite. The hallmark is swollen glands under the ears that are tender. But not everyone has symptoms, especially if they are experiencing a mild case of the illness. The best way to prevent mumps is with a vaccine. According to the CDC, the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is 88% effective when two doses are given.
Temple University is in the midst of an outbreak. As of March 29, ""106 cases of mumps have been diagnosed among Temple students and people outside of the university over the last month,"" Mark Denys, the university's director of student and employee health services, said in an update to students last week. There were more than 2,000 cases of mumps reported in the United States in 2018."
Mueller report: Barr gives new clues about what to expect,edition.cnn.com,Marshall Cohen,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/mueller-report-clues-barr-testimony/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General William Barr gave some new clues Tuesday about what special counsel Robert Mueller's report will look like when the Justice Department releases it in the coming days.
Barr's comments came at a House subcommittee hearing, where he was peppered with questions about the Russia investigation and a host of other department issues. Here's a breakdown of what you need to know. The wait is almost over. Barr said he will release a redacted version of Mueller's report ""within a week."" He said everything is on track to meet his goal of sending the report to Congress by mid-April, a timeline that he laid out in a letter to lawmakers last month. There will be redactions. This wasn't groundbreaking. But it demonstrates that Barr is holding steady to his position that there must be redactions in the report. So far, Barr has resisted demands from top Democrats to provide a full, unredacted copy to Congress. Read More Four types of redactions. The four categories of redactions are: Grand jury material, classified information, details about ongoing investigations , and information that harms ""privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties."" 4 key takeaways from William Barr's testimony on the Mueller report T he report will be colorful. Every redaction will be explained in the public version of Mueller's report. Barr told the subcommittee: ""We will color-code the excisions from the report and we will provide explanatory notes describing the basis for each redaction."" Many cooks in the redaction kitchen. Mueller's team is helping Barr black out grand jury material and sensitive information about ""peripheral players...who shouldn't be charged,"" Barr said. The intelligence community is scrubbing the report for national security secrets. And federal prosecutors are redacting details about their ongoing investigations. No plan for executive privilege. President Donald Trump has previously said he wants the full report to be public. Barr told lawmakers that there was ""no plan"" for him or anyone else to assert executive privilege over parts of the report, which would trigger further redactions."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has ""offered more leadership"" on climate change ""in one day or in one week"" than President Donald Trump, former Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday.
The comments from Kerry, who served under President Barack Obama, came during a House Oversight Committee hearing on climate change and its impact on national security. Asked by Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, about the affordability of Ocasio-Cortez's signature Green New Deal proposal, Kerry defended the proposal and criticized Trump's leadership on the issue. ""I think you said that you are not sure of the science (behind climate change studies). But my focus is on how we are going to move forward and, you know, we all have differences on one piece of legislation or another,"" Kerry said. ""But in proposing what she has proposed together with Sen. (Ed) Markey, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez has in fact offered more leadership in one day or in one week than President Trump has in his lifetime on this subject."" He continued: ""So we're talking about it. And my question is where is your proposal? Did you have any hearings on it in the last few years? Mostly on Benghazi if I recall when I was up here (as secretary)."" According to the committee's website, the hearing was called in order to ""examine the threat of climate change to the United States, including national security, and the need for leadership to combat this threat."" Read More Last month, Kerry co-signed a letter sent by dozens of former national security officials to Trump expressing concerns about how the administration was handling climate change. The letter came on the heels of a Washington Post report saying the administration was considering creating a committee tasked with studying whether climate change poses a national security threat. ""We are deeply concerned by reports that National Security Council officials are considering forming a committee to dispute and undermine military and intelligence judgments on the threat posed by climate change,"" the letter read."
How Trump's DHS purge puts homeland security at risk,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Zachary B. Wolf,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/trump-dhs-purge/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump is in the midst of a shakeup -- "" near-systematic purge "" -- of leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, the umbrella agency that oversees both border protection and immigration enforcement, Trump's top priorities as President.
The agency itself was created out of a massive shakeup, while the country was still reeling from the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and when lawmakers wanted to foster better coordination to protect the country. The new department was meant to ""focus the full resources of the American government on the safety of the American people."" That's how President George W. Bush put it when signed the bill creating the massive new agency in 2003. There were several mentions of border security in that speech. The word immigration did not come up. The political winds have clearly changed. Trump is pushing the focus of DHS in a new direction even though policing immigration and borders is only one part of what DHS does today. It is the central government agency charged with keeping the country safe from natural disaster, terror attack, and guarding the perimeter of the nation. Trump's effort to expunge the leadership at DHS could destabilize the portion of the government most responsible for safety within the country's borders. Read More From 22 agencies to 1 DHS DHS has key roles in emergency and natural disaster response, counterterrorism, airplane safety, detecting nuclear weapons, coordinating cybersecurity and infrastructure security efforts, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service and the Federal Protective Service. It's a lot. For Trump, DHS has been a focal point of his frustrations with a government he is responsible for but feels constrained by. He'd rather ignore laws protecting civil liberties of immigrants and find ways around a Congress that does not share his vision for a border wall. Apprehensions at the southern border have increased this year, but they are down dramatically from the time when DHS was created . But given DHS has such a broad portfolio, it has been the locus of other Trump frustrations as well. It oversees FEMA, which is at the center of the government's roles in emergency response and everyday safety, aspects of the presidency that have proven uncomfortable for Trump. While he clearly enjoys donning his presidential windbreaker and touring disaster sites to promise federal funds, he has picked fights with local politicians over that funding and wants to withhold any more from Puerto Rico. During the record-setting partial government shutdown, unpaid and struggling TSA workers and unpaid Coast Guard service members who fall under DHS became the faces of collateral damage over his repeated demands for border wall funding. The agency was intentionally created to sew the country's safety systems together. But that interconnected net is also the reason that when Trump decided to partially shut the government over Congress again denying him money for his border wall, it affected such a large portion of the government. Empty offices There are six vacancies among DHS top leadership listed on the agency's website -- along with eight top officials working in an ""acting"" capacity. That doesn't include DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who is on her way out, or Randolph ""Tex"" Alles, the Secret Service Director, who is on his way out, too. It also doesn't count the potential departure of a top Nielsen deputy, Claire Grady, who would have to leave in order for Trump's preferred new acting DHS head, Customs and Border Protection commissioner Kevin McAleenan to potentially be able to take over in an acting capacity. That's a lot of open positions for one of the largest organs of the US government. More than 205,000 people work for the DHS, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management . The largest single subagency is the Transportation Security Administration, with its nearly 45,000 screeners who are the front-line face of the federal government to millions of flying Americans. ""It's creating a large amount of uncertainty at the very head of an organization -- the only organization in the US government whose primary mission is security the homeland,"" David Lapan, a former spokesman for DHS who worked with Nielsen and is now openly critical of Trump's actions, said on CNN Tuesday. ""If we are looking at adversaries and they are watching closely this is the exact type of situation they're looking for to exploit,"" he said. Re: DHS -- ""If we are looking at adversaries and they are watching closely this is the exact type of situation they're looking for to exploit"" pic.twitter.com/K7XAsexiuK
— Zach Wolf (@zbyronwolf) April 9, 2019 The focus of DHS senior leadership has clearly shifted in the direction of immigration enforcement. The first item listed as a priority in the department's $47.5 billion budget request for 2020 is ""securing our borders."" The second priority listed is "" Enforcing our immigration laws ."" TSA, which is the largest employer at DHS, only gets 8% of DHS funding in the budget request. Customs and Border Protection combined with Immigration and Customs Enforcement accounts for 33% of the DHS budget. Citizenship and Immigration Services accounts for another 5%, while FEMA, the subagency with the largest single budget request, gets 31%, although that includes an additional $12 billion for disaster relief. A response to 9/11 attacks After the attacks on the World Trade Center, Pentagon and in Pennsylvania in 2001, lawmakers wanted to reorganize the government to foster coordination between agencies. Days after the attacks, the Bush administration had created a new office of Homeland Security and within 14 months he was signing the legislation to reformat the government. The department also didn't live up to its initial vision as counterintelligence operations from the FBI and elsewhere were not placed under the new agency. Looking back, it feels like the massive department was created with incredible speed, but there were complaints at the time that Bush and the administration were moving too slow because they wanted more authority to hire and fire people working at DHS and by limiting the power of federal employee unions and stripping workers in DHS of collective bargaining. Those new limitations were later thrown out by the courts. No political appointees like the ones Trump is purging would be protected by those unions. And neither would the acting heads he's installing to run the agency without input from the Senate. Supporters have praised the moves. ""There has been deliberate foot-dragging and I think that's why you're seeing the White House take the necessary steps to clean house at DHS and put people in, hopefully, who will quickly execute what the President orders,"" said Kris Kobach, a Trump supporter and immigration hard liner and former secretary of state for Kansas, on Fox News Monday. Trump himself denied any sort of housecleaning at DHS when he spoke to reporters at the White House Tuesday and said what's going on there is nothing big. He complained about unfriendly courts and ""the worst laws of any country anywhere in the world"" standing in the way of his immigration policy. He said the mission he cares about is tamping down on immigration and on people coming across the border. ""What we need - homeland security. That's what we want. There's no better term. There's no better name,"" he said. ""We want homeland security and that's what we're going to get."""
Oprah donates $2 million to Puerto Rico hurricane recovery efforts,edition.cnn.com,Veronica Stracqualursi,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/oprah-puerto-rico-donation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Oprah Winfrey is pitching in $2 million to help Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from Hurricane Maria in 2017.
The Hispanic Federation and the Flamboyan Arts Fund announced the donation from the media mogul in a statement Monday. One million dollars will support Puerto Rico's long term recovery needs, while the other half will go toward preserving the island's arts and culture. Winfrey said her donation was inspired by Broadway star and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda, who is a New York native of Puerto Rican descent and co-founded the Flamboyan Arts Fund. ""I was so moved by Lin-Manuel Miranda's commitment to bring 'Hamilton' to Puerto Rico and support the community that served him growing up that I wanted to join in the revitalization efforts of an island so rich in culture, beauty and heritage,"" Winfrey said in a statement Monday.

Nearly 3,000 people died after Hurricane Maria hit. Puerto Ricans were left without power, water and shelter for months.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu greets supporters, alongside his wife Sara, at his Likud party headquarters on election night.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived at the Likud party election headquarters in Tel Aviv on Tuesday night to crowds chanting ""Bibi"" and fireworks on stage.
If Netanyahu was at all worried about his future after initial exit polls showed him in a tight race against rival Benny Gantz, he didn't show it.
""This is a night of great victory,"" Netanyahu said, adding that Likud had seen an ""amazing success.""
""I'm very touched that, for the fifth time, the people of Israel have believed in me.""
Despite his confident speech, the inconclusive exit polls mean a tense night beckons for Netanyahu as he waits to see if his dream of becoming Israel's longest ever serving leader will be fulfilled. He would pass the founder of the state, David Ben Gurion, during the summer. 31 min ago Palestinian Authority Prime Minister tells CNN: ""We will live with dangerous Israeli politicians"" From CNN’s Andy Carey and Abeer Salman in Jerusalem
Following the closing of the polls in Israel, Palestinian Authority (PA) Prime Minister Dr. Mohammad Shtayyeh offered a pessimistic view of the outcome, saying, “the competition in Israeli elections is between those who want to annex Palestinian territories and those who want to maintain the status quo.” Speaking to CNN from Ramallah, the PA Prime Minister said, “we will live with dangerous Israeli politicians.”
Exit polls have the race too close to call between sitting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his challenger, former Israeli general Benny Gantz. Netanyahu has called for the annexation of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Gantz called Netanyahu’s comments ""irresponsible.""
The PA Prime Minister said, “no party has a peace plan” and added the Israeli elections have shown current Israeli politics is right wing and “does not recognize Palestinian rights.” 32 min ago Benny Gantz hails 'historic' night for his party Benny Gantz addresses supporters at his election headquarters.

Speaking in front of a crowd of his supporters at the Blue and White party's election night headquarters, Benny Gantz called it a ""historic"" night and described his centrist party as ""the winners,"" despite exit polls showing there was no clear winner.
""In elections there are losers and winners, and we are the winners,” Gantz said.
Thanking Benjamin Netanyahu for his service, Gantz vowed to form the next coalition government and said he would be the prime minister for ""everyone,"" not just those who voted for him.
“It is not that we don’t understand, we understand that the real results we have to wait for and over the coming days we will do as necessary to form the next government.” 32 min ago Gantz and Netanyahu supporters celebrate following exit poll results From CNN's Ofri Eshel in Tel Aviv
Blue and White supporters were ecstatic over their party's performance in the election. One supporter, 43-year-old Zehorit, hailed the result's potential impact on LGBT rights. But another, 32-year-old Ido, cautioned that other exit polls were still too close to call. Zehorit, 43 (holding the rainbow flag): “We won, this means finally equality for LGBT in Israel! I feel that I am an equal citizen in Israel now.” Zehorit, 43 (holding the rainbow flag): “We won, this means finally equality for LGBT in Israel!

Rivals Benny Gantz and Benjamin Netanyahu have both claimed victory in the Israeli election after exit polls showed the race too close to call.
""We won! The Israeli public has had their say!"" Blue and White leader Gantz said. ""Thank you to the thousands of activists and over a million voters. These elections have a clear winner and a clear loser. Netanyahu promised 40 seats and lost. The President can see the picture and should call on the winner to form the next government. There is no other option!”
Netanyahu said: “The right-wing bloc led by the Likud won a clear victory. I thank the citizens of Israel for the trust. I will start forming a right-wing government with our natural partners as soon as tonight.”

Leader of the Blue and White party Benny Gantz (right) and leader of the Likud party Benjamin Netanyahu (left).
While none of the exit polls carried out during Israel's general election Tuesday showed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party in the lead, that does not mean he won't be able to form the next government.
Either party will have to secure the support of other smaller parties to form a governing majority in the 120-seat parliament.
Two exit polls showed Netanyahu on track to form Israel's next government, with support from the religious right. A third poll showed results too close to call.
Israeli Channel 12 showed Benny Gantz's Blue and White party virtually neck and neck with Likud, with the religious-right coalition taking 60 seats and Gantz's coalition taking the same, with support of the Arab parties.
Kan Channel 11 showed the religious-right coalition with 64 seats, versus a Gantz bloc with 56. And Channel 13 projected the religious-right wing coalition with 66 seats, 12 more than a Gantz coalition.
No party ever ends up with an outright majority after elections, and these results are just preliminary. Both men may end up with a chance to form a government, and the smaller parties will play a key role in coalition-building.
However it is extremely unlikely that the Arab parties would become full coalition partners in any government. 4 hr 13 min ago Bibi dealt blow by exit poll showing rival Gantz ahead, but results too close to call
Benjamin Netanyahu's re-election hopes are hanging in the balance as an Israeli exit poll suggested his main rival Benny Gantz’s party had taken four more seats than Netanyahu’s party in parliament.
An exit poll conducted by Israel’s Channel 12 projected Netanyahu’s Likud party with 33 seats and Benny Gantz’s Blue and White party with 37 seats.
Here are the full results from the Channel 12 poll: Likud - 33"

The fact is, Woods is the hot topic any time he tees it up at Augusta -- four Green Jackets in a devastating spell from 1997 to 2005 are proof enough of his credentials. Plus, in the 10 Masters he has played since that last win, he has finished out of the top six only three times.

— Masters Tournament (@TheMasters) April 9, 2019 But this year, Woods is the fittest he has been in years after spine-fusion surgery in 2017 halted what threatened to be a sad demise to a remarkable career, and he is forging a fresh era into his 40s off the back of an 80th PGA Tour title and first victory since 2013 at the season-ending Tour Championship in September. ""I've got a pretty good library in my head of how to play the golf course,"" said Woods, who last year also briefly led the Open before finishing tied sixth and was runner up at the US PGA. ""I've had some success here."" He added: ""Winning at East Lake confirmed to me I can still win again."" Read More He may not be the favorite -- Rory McIlroy is the leading fancy -- but the possibility of Woods resuming his major quest by adding a 15th, 11 years after his last, is quite the redemption tale. Victory at the revered Augusta National this week would put him just one Green Jacket behind record holder Jack Nicklaus, whose mark of 18 majors Woods is also chasing. ""I would just never rule him [Woods] out. Greatness is still in him,"" said Phil Mickelson, who is chasing a fourth Masters title, of his old adversary.

Tiger Woods grabs first tour win in five years. 01:19 'Very special place' The last 43-year-old to win the Masters was Ben Crenshaw in 1995, while the oldest Masters champion was Nicklaus, who put the gloss on his illustrious major career with a sixth Green Jacket at the age of 46 in 1986. But if age is against him, Woods is the highest-ranked player (at 12th) of all former champions in the field.

— Masters Tournament (@TheMasters) April 8, 2019 Even without Woods, the Masters is the one golf event even non golfers are glued to. It's a spring rite, a sporting spectacle at a revered venue layered in rich history and dripping in tradition. The vivid greens, ice-white sand of the bunkers and explosions of iridescent pinks and reds of blooming azaelas make for a brilliant backdrop, in stark contrast to the raffish Washington Road strip beyond the fence. It's a bucket-list event and the difficulty of getting tickets -- a yearly lottery offers a limited number of day passes, but the waiting list for weekly badges is long-since closed -- adds to the allure. For the players, Augusta places a premium on length and second-shot accuracy -- knowing where to miss is often touted as one of the keys -- while a sharp short game and deft putting stroke is required on the slick, sloping greens. When the tournament really hots up on Sunday afternoon, the roars accompanying great shots will explode like incendiaries and reverberate around the towering pines like nowhere else in golf. ""This is unlike any other golf tournament. It's just a very special place,"" said Woods.

Since putting himself on the brink of the grand slam when he won the 2014 Open Championship, McIlroy has struggled to properly contend despite finishing in the top 10 each time. Last year, he began the final day three shots behind Patrick Reed in the final group but slipped back as the American clinched his first major. However, McIlroy has been in sublime form this season, culminating in victory in the Players Championship at Sawgrass, and many suspect this is the week he will add to his tally of four majors for the first time since 2014. The Northern Irishman has been reading books on sports psychology of late, and credits a new mental attitude with his stellar start to the year. ""Look, I'm not going to go live with the monks for a couple of months in Nepal,"" said McIlroy, who tees off with Rickie Fowler and Australian Cameron Smith in the group behind Woods Thursday.

The Texan, a three-time major champion, has struggled of late, but in five Masters appearances he has won, finished second twice, come third and 11th. Spieth's wire-to-wire victory in 2015 and dominance for three rounds in 2016 suggested he was the new king at Augusta. But a meltdown on the treacherous short 12th scuppered his bid for back-to-back titles. A final-round 64 to finish third behind Reed last year showed Spieth can plot his way around even when he isn't at his best.

The parents, who were charged last month with conspiracy to commit fraud, were charged on Tuesday in a superseding indictment with conspiring to launder bribes and other payments through a charity run by Rick Singer, the mastermind of the scam, as well as by transferring money into the United States to promote the fraud, prosecutors said. Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying $500,000 to Singer's fake charity to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew recruits, even though the daughters did not participate in the sport. The couple appeared last week in federal court in Boston, but they have not publicly indicated how they plan to plea. Prosecutors want prison time for Felicity Huffman and other parents who pleaded guilty in college admissions scam In addition, Gamal Abdelaziz, Diane and Todd Blake, I-Hsin ""Joey"" Chen, Elizabeth and Manuel Henriquez, Douglas Hodge, Michelle Janavs, Elisabeth Kimmel, William McGlashan Jr., Marci Palatella, John Wilson, Homayoun Zadeh and Robert Zangrillo were also charged in the superseding indictment. Read More Thirty-three wealthy parents were among 50 people arrested last month in a sprawling investigation that officials dubbed ""Operation Varsity Blues."" Prosecutors said the parents used their wealth to cheat on standardized tests for their children and bribe college administrators and coaches who had say over who was admitted. The added charges come just a day after 13 other parents, including actress Felicity Huffman, and one coach agreed to plead guilty in the case. Huffman, the former star of ""Desperate Housewives,"" pleaded guilty to paying $15,000 to the charity known as Key Worldwide Foundation to facilitate cheating for her daughter on the SATs, the complaint said. In a statement, she expressed ""deep regret and shame over what I have done."" She has a plea hearing set for May 24 in federal court in Boston, prosecutors said on Twitter . Mounting troubles for Loughlin The money laundering charge is another blow for Loughlin, the ""Full House"" actress who was dropped by the Hallmark Channel and other brands in the wake of last month's charges. Sephora also ended a makeup partnership with her daughter, the social media influencer Olivia Jade, who was a student at USC. Loughlin's daughters were recruited to USC as coxswains -- the crew member responsible for steering -- even though they did not row competitively or otherwise participate in crew, the criminal complaint says. She and Giannulli even sent Singer photos of each daughter on an ergometer, the rowing machine, the complaint says. Lori Loughlin's 'When Calls The Heart' co-star offers message of support ""I wanted to thank you again for your great work with (our older daughter), she is very excited and both Lori and I are very appreciative of your efforts and end result!"" Giannulli allegedly wrote in an email to Singer that is included in the complaint. Also on Tuesday, attorneys representing some of the parents charged in the superseding indictment filed a letter with the US District Court chief judge in Boston, stating prosecutors were engaging in ""judge shopping."" The letter said that their clients shouldn't be included in the same indictment as David Sidoo, another parent charged last month with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. The attorneys charge that the move to include them in one indictment along with Sidoo is a maneuver by the US Attorney's office to evade the random assignment of judges. Citing that none of their clients have connections to or have done business with Sidoo, the attorneys say that the prosecutors' plan to join their clients into the Sidoo indictment ""is a clear form of judge shopping."""

US Magistrate Judge Thomas DiGirolamo accepted the government's argument at a detention hearing in Maryland, ordering Rondell Henry detained as he awaits trial and the government's investigation is ongoing. At the hearing on Tuesday, Assistant US Attorney Thomas Windom said Henry was by his own admission inspired by ISIS and that, if released, he would be a danger to the community. The judge accepted Windom's argument and rejected an offer by a public defender on Henry's behalf to keep him on house arrest in the custody of his family and 24 hour monitoring. The Justice Department announced the allegation against Henry on Monday and said he had been arrested in connection with the vehicle theft last month. Read More Speaking to reporters Monday evening, Prince George's County Chief of Police Hank Stawinski of Maryland said he had not been able to inform the county ""immediately"" about the event, but stressed his belief that the area was safe. On Tuesday, Windom said Henry had spent time ""watching videos posted by the Islamic State"" and was in agreement with the infamous militant group's calls for violence against civilians. ""He considered it brave to murder innocent civilians,"" Windom said. Windom said that last month, Henry ""literally walked out the door"" of his job, in the middle of his shift and looked for a vehicle to run people down with. He followed someone in a U-Haul and stole the vehicle, Windom said, and drove out to Dulles International Airport early in the morning and ""essentially cased the airport"" before leaving and heading to National Harbor in Maryland, where he walked around looking for a place to attack with the U-Haul. He was apprehended by law enforcement the next morning, according to Windom. Windom said there was corroborating video surveillance at Dulles and National Harbor, evidence of interest in ISIS from Henry's phone and Henry's own statements backing the government's arguments. Henry has been charged with transportation of a stolen vehicle, although Windom said the investigation was ongoing, including as it related to terrorism. Michael CitaraManis, an attorney for Henry, noted he had only been charged with the stolen vehicle and accused the government of trying to ""control the narrative"" as he counseled the court to be cautious -- and even suspicious -- of the government's claims. He noted, as did the judge, that Henry had no criminal history and was a naturalized citizen after coming to the United States from Trinidad and Tobago some 11 years ago. He also said it appeared Henry's ""rights have been violated"" and noted confusion by Henry's family after his arrest, saying they even reported him as a missing person. A local report on Patch.com from last month showed he had been thought to be missing after leaving work and the unfolding events alleged by the government. Jennifer Moore, acting special agent in charge of the FBI's Baltimore field office, told reporters after the hearing that what had begun on some law enforcement levels as a missing person's case had quickly turned into something else. She stressed the FBI's regular call for people to report suspicious behavior: ""If you see something, please say something."""

First on CNN: Pence to visit US-Mexico border on Thursday - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Dana Bash,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/mike-pence-border-visit/index.html,"(CNN) Vice President Mike Pence plans to visit the US Border Patrol Station in Nogales, Arizona, on Thursday, where he will be briefed by Customs and Border Protection agents and tour the border wall, according to a White House official.
The trip comes amid controversy surrounding the departure of President Donald Trump's homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, reports of additional officials being purged and confusion about Trump's border security plans and policies . Pence has been a staunch supporter of Trump's immigration efforts. Speaking last month at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Atlanta, Pence said: ""I don't have to tell any of the ICE agents gathered here that we have a crisis on our southern border.' Trump denies reports he will reinstate family separation border policy ""But that crisis on our southern border is driving drugs and crime and human trafficking here in the streets of Atlanta. You face it and you confront it every day. And you face it oftentimes without regard to your personal safety,"" Pence said. Read More Earlier Tuesday, Trump denied reports that his administration is looking to resume the separation of parents and children at the border. Senior administration officials had told CNN's Jake Tapper that in the last four months or so, the President had been pushing then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to enforce a stricter and more widespread ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy -- not just the original policy started by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and undone by the President once it was criticized -- that called for the prosecution of individuals crossing the border illegally between ports of entry, resulting in the separation of parents from children. According to multiple sources, the President wanted families separated even if they came in at a legal port of entry and were legal asylum seekers. The President wanted families separated even if they were apprehended within the US. He thinks the separations work to deter migrants from coming. ""He just wants to separate families,"" said a senior administration official. Trump repeatedly denied that was the case on Tuesday. ""We're not looking to do that, no. We're not looking to do that,"" Trump said. But, he added, ""when you don't do it, it brings a lot more people to the border."" ""Now, I'll tell you something, once you don't have it, that's why you have many more people coming. They are coming like it's a picnic, like 'let's go to Disneyland,' "" Trump said."

Can Congress see the Mueller grand jury information? - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Katelyn Polantz,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/congress-grand-jury-information/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General William Barr said on Tuesday that he doesn't plan to ask a court for permission to release grand jury details in the Mueller report, but Barr has more say in the matter than just asking a judge.
""My intention is not to ask for it at this stage,"" Barr told a House committee. Barr argued that he sees no provision that could permit him to release grand jury material. Yet grand jury secrecy rules and exceptions aren't completely agreed upon in the court system -- and the situation that Barr is in has its own set of specifics and nuances. The rules do give some leeway to the attorney general in certain circumstances, and don't give broad authority to judges, at least at this time in Washington's federal courts, over the release of material from the secret proceedings. The rules that govern disclosures from the grand jury give the most authority to the Justice Department. Read More They outline how in several circumstances ""an attorney for the government"" can give grand jury information to help other criminal investigations and even share grand jury information with intelligence or national security officials if the matter involves foreign intelligence agencies. So, under that part of the rule, if Congress needed secret parts of the Mueller report for intelligence considerations, Barr could choose to disclose those to members. No court needed there. Barr says redacted version of Mueller report to be released within a week Under ""the national security/foreign intelligence exception to grand jury secrecy, the attorney general can provide grand jury information to the chairs of the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees without asking for court permission,"" Ted Boutrous, a First Amendment litigator who recently asked a federal court for information in a grand jury case related to Mueller, wrote on Twitter Tuesday. In fact, the courts are left out of much of that kind of decision-making. The US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit bolstered this reading earlier this month , in a decision that said federal judges couldn't broadly release grand jury documents, even involving investigations of historical importance that happened long ago. ""Nothing"" in the grand jury rules ""suggests a district court has authority to order disclosure of grand jury matter outside the enumerated exceptions,"" the court wrote in a case about a 1950s grand jury proceeding that has current implications for Mueller. (A different federal appeals court in the southeastern US disagreed earlier this year.) How courts can get involved in disclosing grand jury information is a smaller set of circumstances, according to the rules. One of those situations: A judge can disclose grand jury material ""preliminary to or in connection with a judicial proceeding,"" the rules say. During the Watergate era, as Congress sought to investigate whether to impeach the President, a federal judge found that the House of Representatives could function ""simply as another grand jury,"" according to a case of that era. In that situation, an impeachment proceeding in Congress for President Richard Nixon allowed the House to get access to grand jury materials. A situation like that, in theory, could arise again."
Border Patrol officials say they will follow law in hearing asylum claims - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Veronica Stracqualursi,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/homeland-security-trump-hearing-asylum-claims/index.html,"(CNN) Two top officials with US Customs and Border Protection firmly stated Tuesday that they would abide by the law in hearing asylum claims at the southern border if President Donald Trump were to order agents to bar migrants from seeking asylum.
During a hearing before the Senate Homeland Security Committee, Randy Howe, the executive director of CBP's Office of Field Operations, said the agency would be ""bound"" to hear from individuals claiming asylum if they cross into the United States at a port of entry. ""If they enter the United States across the boundary line at the port of entry and they claim asylum, we would be bound to hear that asylum claim,"" Howe told the committee. CNN reported that when Trump visited Calexico, California, last Friday, he told border agents to not let migrants in. After Trump left, agents sought further advice from their leaders, who told them they were not giving them that direction. Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada asked Howe and Rodolfo Karisch, the chief patrol agent of the Rio Grande Valley sector, on Tuesday if they would be following instructions from the President. Read More ""We know what the law is and our attorneys are here to advise us,"" Howe said, adding, ""I will follow the guidance that we receive from our attorneys."" Karisch said that although illegal entry would result in arrest, it would also ""not stop"" someone from making an asylum or credible fear claim. ""If they cross between the ports of entry, they are violating US immigration law, so they will be placed under arrest, but that still will not stop them from making an asylum or credible fear claim."" Karisch said. ""But in effecting an entry into the country between the ports of entry, they are in violation of the law and they will be arrested."" The Trump administration also recently attempted to expand its policy of returning some asylum seekers to Mexico to await their immigration court hearings, but a federal judge in California on Monday blocked the policy . Trump has derided the asylum program as ""a scam ."" Rosen then asked what concerns they have in implementing Trump administration policies. ""We've taken an oath of office to defend this country,"" Karisch said. ""Our officers every day go out there and perform a job. It doesn't stop them from addressing the asylum, the credible fear, the different things that they have."" Karisch argued that the Border Patrol officers do their jobs ""as humanly as we possibly can, but understanding is that we do have laws in this country, people have to abide by those laws."" ""So you're saying, if someone presents themselves for asylum, you will take them in regardless of what the President has instructed you to do?"" Rosen asked. ""If they enter the United States between the ports of entry, they will be apprehended. That will not stop them from making an asylum claim,"" Karisch reiterated."
There's trouble in OPEC and oil prices are up 50% - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Matt Egan,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/investing/oil-prices-opec-libya-venezuela/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Venezuela is in chaos. Iran is grappling with US sanctions. And now there's a surge of violence in Libya . Trouble in these three OPEC nations has helped send US oil prices climbing back above $64 a barrel.
The latest OPEC turmoil amplifies the supply constraints imposed by the cartel's kingpin. Saudi Arabia has slashed production as well as exports to the United States in a bid to engineer higher prices and balance its budget. Despite record-shattering US oil production, US oil prices have spiked 50% since plummeting to $42.53 a barrel on Christmas Eve. And gasoline prices are creeping higher just as the American economy grapples with a slowdown . ""The oil supply story is bullish,"" said Shin Kim, head of supply and production at S&P Global Platts. ""The potential for an escalation of the conflict in Libya has renewed significant risks to oil production."" US oil prices hit a five-month high of $64.79 a barrel on Tuesday morning before retreating. Read More ""I wouldn't be surprised to see oil prices hit $70 before mid-summer,"" said Ryan Fitzmaurice, energy strategist at Rabobank. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is already above $71 a barrel for the first time since mid-November. 'Grave security crisis' Clashes in Libya in recent days raise the risk that the war-torn country's 1.3 million barrels of daily oil production will be imperiled. Libya's UN-backed government said it repelled an attack by rebels over the weekend after briefly losing control of Tripoli's airport. As prices have rallied, all of this money has poured back into the market. That's definitely kept a bid under prices.""
Ryan Fitzmaurice, Rabobank
""OPEC's perennial 'problem child' producer"" is facing a ""grave security crisis,"" Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients. The United States military pulled a contingent of trips from Libya over the weekend, citing the nation's ""increasingly complex and unpredictable"" security situation. Libya's oil output was sidelined for years due to a bloody civil war. But production has been on the rise again in recent months. Actual supply has not yet been impacted, but oil traders are monitoring the situation closely. ""The market gets skittish. If Libya were to go out, oil prices could easily spike $5 to $10 from current levels,"" said Ben Cook, portfolio manager at BP Capital Advisors. Sanctions, blackouts hit Venezuela While Libya is front-and-center right now, the turmoil in Venezuela has been a bigger driver of actual supply trouble. Venezuela has been hit by the Trump administration's sanctions on state oil company PDVSA. The United States imported zero barrels of crude from Venezuela during the final three weeks of March, according to US government statistics . It's a sharp decline from weekly imports of around 600,000 barrels per day before the sanctions were announced in late January. The United States has never gone a full month without importing oil from Venezuela since the government began tracking this metric in 1973. Venezuela's oil output was further derailed by mass blackouts in the country, which has added to the nation's humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, oil investors are watching for the Trump administration to drop clues on whether it will extend waivers that have allowed countries to keep buying oil from Iran. The waivers were announced last summer and contributed to a supply glut that sent crude prices crashing into a bear market. $4 gas is nearly a reality for many Americans ""Those waivers were largely politically driven,"" Cook said, pointing to last fall's midterm elections. ""We don't have that this time."" OPEC and its allies will likely take a victory lap when leaders meet in June in Vienna. The group's production cuts successfully lifted oil prices in short order. Saudi Arabia has been especially aggressive. The world's leading oil exporter has sharply cut shipments to the United States as a way to demonstrate its commitment to balance the market. What about the US shale oil boom? Another driver for higher oil prices: bullish bets made by hedge funds and other financial players. After going bearish on oil last year, these trend-following traders have gone long on crude in recent months. Those speculative positions can exaggerate price swings. ""It's been pretty dramatic,"" said Rabobank's Fitzmaurice. ""As prices have rallied, all of this money has poured back into the market. That's definitely kept a bid under prices."" The most stunning part of the oil rebound is that it's come in the face of blockbuster production from the United States. America is set to surpass Saudi Arabia in a 'remarkable' oil milestone America pumped a record 10.96 million barrels per crude a day in 2018, up by 17% from the year before, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That trend accelerated in December when US output hit an all-time monthly high of 11.96 million barrels per day. The explosive US growth isn't expected to end either. Lifted by the shale oil boom, the EIA expects US output to average 12.3 million in 2019 and 13 million in 2020. How will Trump respond? It's possible the oil price spike will encourage President Donald Trump to renew his criticism of OPEC . Previous attacks have caused short-term declines in oil prices. The Trump administration could also release barrel s from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the nation's emergency stockpile of oil. But Fitzmaurice doubts such a move would provide lasting relief. ""I would expect them to wait until peak driving season before using the bullets they have,"" he said."
Kirsten Gillibrand: Americans deserve a brave president (Opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Kirsten Gillibrand,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/opinions/america-deserves-brave-president-kirsten-gillibrand/index.html,"Kirsten Gillibrand is the junior US senator from New York and a Democratic presidential candidate. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.
(CNN) Several weeks ago, I launched my presidential campaign in front of Trump International Hotel with a message that I believe in so strongly: When Americans join together to reject hate and division, hope rises, fear loses and, most importantly, bravery wins.
Bravery is exemplified by the millions of Americans who have tirelessly spoken out against this administration's cruel policies toward women , Muslims , the LGBTQ community and immigrant families at our border . They have spoken out because President Donald Trump is tearing apart the moral fabric of this country. He continues to demonize the vulnerable and he punches down. Kirsten Gillibrand He does all of this because he wants us to believe he is strong. He is not. The President is a coward. That's not what we deserve. So many Americans are making a choice to resist the backward pull of this administration and push us toward a better future. And we need a president who is worthy of their bravery. That is why I'm running for president of the United States. Read More We need to fight for an America where power truly belongs to the people, where our politicians care about everyone in this country -- and lead not from weakness or ego but from strength of character. I know we can be that America. But it means starting at the root of many of our problems -- greed. Right now, special interests are displacing the voices of the people of this country. Find me a so-called unsolvable problem, and I will point you to the greed and corruption standing in the way of solutions to it. The tide is turning against the NRA Polluter profits take precedence over drinking water. Predatory lenders get special access to the White House and are allowed to take even more advantage of the most vulnerable customers. And the National Rifle Association, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in America, stops popular common-sense gun reform, while stray bullets kill children in our communities. Dark, unaccountable money is at the heart of this outrageous inaction. We need to crack open our government, flip the switch and let the light flood in. That's exactly what I did when I came to Washington and challenged Congress by making my meetings, finances and earmark requests public with my Sunlight Report . In fact, I was the first member of Congress to put this information on my website, and it was not popular with a lot of my colleagues, who said I was setting the bar for transparency way too high. I rejected that notion then, and I reject it now. The American people deserve to know their elected officials are working for them -- not special interests. It's why I wrote and tirelessly pushed Congress to pass the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act in 2012. I fought to make it illegal for members of Congress to line their pockets and profit from insider information. Public servants shouldn't enrich themselves from the offices they hold.

Gillibrand releases 12 years of taxes, including 2018 01:36 And I will keep leading on transparency within my own office and campaign. That's why I am not taking any money from corporate political action committees, federal lobbyists or individual super PACs. That's why I was the first presidential candidate to release my 2018 taxes, and have put 12 years of tax returns online -- going back to my first year in public office. And as president, I will fight for publicly funded elections to reduce the influence of wealthy donors and special interests. I believe it's the closest thing we have to a silver-bullet solution to so many of our challenges. It would change the way Washington works overnight. Our president should govern based on the principle that our democracy only works when elected leaders hear directly from all Americans, regardless of their financial status. Only then -- once we address the greed in Washington -- can we finally start making progress on the problems we face. But here is what I have also learned over the years. To take on the issues that matter the most, America needs a leader who is willing to be brave. I have learned that bravery means standing up to the powerful and summoning the courage to confront them head-on. The real national emergency is not at the border That's what I did when I first ran for Congress in a 2-to-1 Republican district that nobody thought I could win. Except for my mother, which tells you a lot about her. People told me: ""It has more cows than Democrats -- you just can't win!"" But I took those long odds, and I won. And the next election, I won again -- that time by a 24-point margin . Why? Because I never forget who I serve. I stood up to greed and voted against the bank bailout. I stood up to corruption by making insider trading illegal for members of Congress. I stood up to bigotry and fought to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell."" And it's why I'm proud to have stood up to Trump and voted against his Cabinet nominees -- more than anyone else in the US Senate. I will go toe-to-toe with anyone to do the right thing. Whether it's powerful institutions, the President -- or even my own party. We have big fights in front of us that we can't afford to lose.

These hemp farmers are making a killing on the CBD industry - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Parija Kavilanz,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/success/hemp-farmer/index.html,"Blue Forest Farms used to grow hundreds of acres of kale, squash and pumpkins. But it has since switched its focus to a different cash crop: hemp.
The farm, which is located in Erie, Colorado, has dedicated 150 acres to growing hemp so far -- and it's still planting. ""We're now expanding it to 1,000 acres,"" said McKenzie Mann, Blue Forest's production manager. About 500 acres will come from land previously used to grow kale and squash. Farmers across the United States have been rushing into hemp ever since President Donald Trump signed the Farm Bill into law in December. The legislation removed hemp from the government's controlled drug category, triggering a surge in demand for cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical that is derived from hemp and marijuana plants. Blue Forest Farms in Colorado plans to dedicate 1,000 acres of its land to hemp this year. CBD is non-psychoactive, meaning it won't get you high. (THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the chemical in cannabis that does that). Instead, CBD extracted from hemp is marketed for everything from pain relief to reducing inflammation, stress and anxiety, and it is sold in an array of products from shampoos and oils to pet treats and granola. Read More Farms that were already growing hemp are seeing both demand and profits surge, while farmers who have never grown hemp before are rushing to plant it in their fields. ""There's a lot of excitement in the farming community because hemp is seen as a high-return crop. There are many farmers around the country who are struggling to make ends meet and they're looking for an alternative like hemp to boost revenue,"" said Eric Steenstra, president of VoteHemp, a non-profit that advocates for the commercial sale of hemp. Suddenly, CBD is everywhere. Here's what's next Mann has been fielding multiple calls a day from farmers around the country. ""They're corn farmers, wheat farmers. They want advice on how to grow hemp,"" he said. Blue Forest charges $35 to $40 per pound for the high-quality hemp it sells for CBD extraction. That compares to about $1 a pound for the kale it sells. The company declined to disclose its total sales of hemp last year but said the category is very profitable for the business and it expects its hemp sales to double this year. Mann said the price of hemp went up slightly after the Farm Bill was signed. Industry watchers say the price could stay at these levels or inch even higher if supply for CBD doesn't meet the demand. But if too many farmers get into the hemp business, the market could become saturated and prices could start falling, Mann noted. Last year, just over 78,000 acres of hemp was grown in the US, up from 9,649 acres in 2016, according to VoteHemp's 2018 Hemp Crop Report . More than just CBD ""There's a lot of excitement in the farming community because hemp is seen as a high return crop.""
Eric Steenstra, president, VoteHemp
Total sales for hemp-based products in the US were about $1.1 billion in 2018, and are expected to more than double by 2022, according to New Frontier Data, a market research firm focused on the cannabis industry. Much of those gains will stem from demand for CBD products. But hemp can also be used for a variety of other products, such as fibers, clothing, rope and building materials. ""It's important to take a longer-term picture of the hemp market,"" said Steenstra. ""Right now, CBD is the hot commodity and is a significant driver of the market and profit for farmers. But as an agricultural crop, hemp has significant market potential for grain and fiber."" After it was legalized in December, hemp has become one of the most lucrative crops for US farmers. Andy Rodosevich is cofounder of Hemp Depot, a Colorado Springs, Colorado, business that operates its own farms and is a distributor of CBD and hemp products. ""My advice to farmers is learn as much as you can about it and then enter at your own risk.""
Randy Wenger, corn farmer
The company planted 5.2 million hemp plants in 2018. ""This year we are planting three times that number. We're trying to keep up with demand for CBD and scale up production,"" said Rodosevich. Hemp Depot charges $35 to $40 for a pound of the high-end hemp it sells for CBD products. Last year, the business sold about 25,000 pounds of hemp, helping the farm log a total of $10 million in sales. This year, he expects to sell 350,000 pounds with total sales crossing $50 million. Rodosevich said the goal for next year is to sell 2 million pounds. He says he's also gotten calls from enthusiastic farmers asking for advice on how to grow hemp. He understands the excitement but tries to set reasonable expectations for them. More from Success What happened when these women found out what male colleagues made

""While hemp is unbelievably profitable for farmers, growing it has its challenges,"" he said. For starters, the seeds aren't cheap. Good quality seeds guaranteed to provide high CBD levels and low amounts of THC that fall below the federally mandated 0.3% threshold, can range from $1 to $2 each. Hemp farming is also labor intensive. While large-scale farms use machinery for growing traditional crops like wheat and corn, specific machinery for planting and harvesting hemp is still lacking. So hemp farms rely on manual labor for planting, harvesting and removing weeds. Randy Wenger, a corn and wheat farmer whose 5,000 acre farm in Yuma County, Colorado, has been in the family since 1919, tried hemp farming for the first time last year. ""I was looking for an alternative crop that could be profitable for me and wouldn't break the bank,"" he said. Randy Wenger with his wife on his family farm in Colorado. Even though he sought advice from other hemp farmers and researched farming techniques online, it was still a challenge. He was surprised at how much manual labor was needed to tend to hemp. ""You can spend a lot of money just on the labor,"" he said. She thought flowers were a waste of money. Until selling them brought in millions The hemp he was growing for CBD didn't turn out to be the best quality either. 'It was a total failure,"" said Wenger. Nevertheless, he is willing to try again. ""CBD is a popular topic,"" said Wenger. ""But my advice to farmers is, learn as much as you can about it and then enter at your own risk.""

SpaceX faces a key test in the upcoming launch of its biggest rocket,edition.cnn.com,Jackie Wattles,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/spacex-falcon-heavy-arabsat/index.html," SpaceX wants to compete with its arch rival in the lucrative business of launching ultra-heavy satellites into space. That's why the second-ever launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket — and the first to carry a payload for a paying customer — will be a key milestone for SpaceX .
Falcon Heavy will vault a pricey communications satellite into orbit for Saudi Arabia-based Arabsat. Liftoff was scheduled for Wednesday evening from Kennedy Space Center in Florida , but SpaceX postponed the launch. It said in a tweet that the next launch opportunity is Thursday. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy is by far the most powerful operational rocket in the world. And with a sticker price of $90 million, it is also about a third of the price of its closest competitor, United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy . Introducing a new ultra-powerful rocket has allowed SpaceX to compete directly with arch rival United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, for lucrative government contracts that require heavy-lift launch vehicles. Falcon Heavy has already been chosen for a few contracts, including a $130 million contract to launch an Air Force satellite that was awarded just four months after its inaugural flight in February 2018. Read More The rocket is expected to be used primarily for US military missions, and to launch spy satellites and hefty commercial telecom satellites . Sending Elon Musk's roadster to space Falcon Heavy's debut flight last year attracted massive attention, in part because CEO Elon Musk decided to launch his own luxury Tesla Roadster as the test payload. The car, which was carrying a space-suited mannequin nicknamed Starman, was vaulted into outer space and is expected to orbit the sun for the foreseeable future. Thousands of people came to SpaceX's launch site in Florida to watch the spectacle. Even more watched a stream online. Part of Falcon Heavy's appeal is the fact that its hardware is reusable. It has three rocket boosters, which are strapped together during launch and are designed to then break apart and make pinpoint landings back on Earth. The boosters can then be refurbished and used again, which SpaceX says drastically reduces the cost of spaceflight. When the rocket flew last year, its two side boosters made synchronized landings on side-by-side ground pads in Florida. But the middle booster missed a seaborne platform it was designed to land on, and instead splashed into the ocean. SpaceX is expected to attempt to land all three this week. Elon Musk's Tesla roadster launched from the Falcon Heavy rocket in February 2018 with a dummy driver named Starman. Falcon Heavy's first customer The satellite SpaceX will launch on Wednesday will update satellite coverage for Arabsat, which is based in Riyadh and delivers hundreds of television channels and radio stations to homes across the Middle East and North Africa. Lockheed Martin built the satellite, along with a second one, for Arabsat as part of a batch of contracts worth $650 million. When Arabsat announced the contracts in 2015, it said at the time that it planned to launch the Arabsat 6A satellite aboard Falcon Heavy. That was back when SpaceX was still expected to test Falcon Heavy later that same year. Before the rocket finally launched more than two years later, Musk suggested to several news outlets, including CNN, that the rocket could explode. Musk's casual mentions of a potential explosion spooked Arabsat executives, according to Bloomberg . SpaceX chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell flew to Saudi Arabia to reassure them that the Falcon Heavy would be reliable. Though Falcon Heavy's inaugural launch ultimately went off without a hitch, SpaceX will now have to repeat that success with the added risk of carrying a multimillion dollar satellite. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy has twice the power and costs about one third as much as United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy. The version of the Falcon Heavy that will fly this week will not be exactly the same as the previous mission: The Falcon Heavy's rocket cores will be more powerful, making use of upgrades to SpaceX's smaller workhorse rocket, the Falcon 9. Falcon Heavy is not expected to fly nearly as often as its smaller counterpart, which has completed more than 20 missions since last February. Falcon Heavy only has five missions on its manifest so far."
Ted Lieu shows video of Candace Owens on Hitler at hate-crimes hearing,edition.cnn.com,Caroline Kelly,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/ted-lieu-candace-owens-exchange-hitler-house-hearing/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A Democratic congressman and a conservative activist clashed during a hearing on white nationalism Tuesday over the right-wing provocateur's prior comments calling Adolf Hitler's sense of nationalism ""fine.""
During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on ""Hate Crimes and the Rise of White Nationalism,"" Rep. Ted Lieu of California played a clip of Candace Owens, of the conservative group Turning Point USA, discussing Hitler. ""In congressional hearings, the minority party gets to select its own witnesses. And of all the people that Republicans could have selected, they picked Candace Owens,"" Lieu said. ""I don't know Ms. Owens -- I'm not going to characterize her. I'm going to let her own words do the talking. So I'm going to play for you the first 30 seconds of a statement she made about Adolf Hitler."" Lieu then played a clip of Owens describing Hitler's motive ""to make Germany great"" as ""fine."" ""I actually don't have any problems at all with the word nationalism,"" Owens says in the clip. ""I think that it gets -- the definition gets poisoned by elitists that actually want globalism. Globalism is what I don't want. So when you think about -- whenever we say nationalism, the first thing people think about -- at least in America -- is Hitler. You know, he was a national socialist, but if Hitler had just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, OK, fine. The problem is that he wanted -- he had dreams outside of Germany. He wanted to globalize, he wanted everybody to be German, everybody to be speaking German.""

""It does, Mr. Lieu,"" Hershenov replied. ""I know that Ms. Owens distanced herself from those comments later, but we expressed great concern over the original comments."" Owens accused Lieu a few minutes later of thinking that African-Americans are ""stupid."" ""I think it's pretty apparent that Mr. Lieu believes that black people are stupid and will not pursue the full clip in its entirety. He purposefully presented an extracted clip,"" she said, before committee Chairman Jerry Nadler interjected. The New York Democrat stressed that ""it is not proper to refer disparagingly to a member of the committee"" and ""the witness may not refer to a member of the committee as 'stupid,' "" telling Owens not to make such comments again. She replied, ""I didn't refer to him as 'stupid.' That's not what I said. That's not what I said at all. You didn't listen to what I said."" The conservative activist accused Lieu of mischaracterizing her remarks and called Hitler ""a homicidal, psychopathic maniac that killed his own people -- a nationalist would not kill their own people."" Lieu ""purposefully wanted to give you a cut-up similar to what they do to Donald Trump to create a different narrative,"" Owens added. ""That was unbelievably dishonest and he did not allow me to respond to it, which is worrisome and should tell you a lot about where people are today in terms of trying to drum up narratives."""
Bernie Sanders to release 10 years of tax returns by Monday,edition.cnn.com,Kate Sullivan,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/bernie-sanders-millionaire-tax-returns/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Bernie Sanders said Tuesday he's a millionaire -- which will be confirmed when he releases 10 years of tax returns in the coming days.

If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too."" 2020 Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), R, speaks at a campaign rally in Grand Park on March 23, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) The details of how Sanders became a millionaire will come to light when he releases his tax returns. Campaign manager Faiz Shakir told CNN Sanders' returns will be made public ""on or before"" Monday, the tax filing deadline for 2018. The Vermont independent has repeatedly promised to release the information ""soon."" On Tuesday, Shakir said, ""It will be done before the tax filing date is over. To my perspective, that is soon. I appreciate that there's been a lot of concerns that have been raised by a number of people but this will soon be over."" The release will likely quiet a growing din of concern over the release of Sanders' tax returns, which are expected to reflect an increase to his income through the sales of his book. But the unveiling will also open up Sanders, who released a single year of returns during the last campaign, to increased scrutiny -- the kind befitting his frontrunner status in this increasingly competitive and crowded Democratic primary field. Read More Speaking to CNN, Shakir said that Sanders ""believes in opportunity for all, and the fact that he is somebody who has personally benefited from that opportunity is something that he feels should be a shared opportunity with everyone else. He's made some money off a book. And I think that the opportunity that he has had is evaporating for so many others. He feels that strongly."" ""Particularly as you get into future generations of Americans, it's less likely that somebody with little income could become a millionaire,"" Shakir added. ""That is an ethic I think that truly does guide him. There's nothing about any of these tax returns or the money or anything that'll come out that'll change that fundamental fact one bit."" Sanders' book, ""Our Revolution,"" was released in November 2016, a week after Donald Trump won the presidency. It claimed a spot on The New York Times' bestseller list. The book is about his bid for the presidency and the grassroots movement he worked to create while running against, and ultimately losing to, Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. His most recent book, ""Where We Go from Here: Two Years in the Resistance,"" was published in November 2018 and outlines the blueprint for his 2020 presidential run. Sanders entered the race in February. Sanders, who has been pressed on a timetable for his taxes everywhere from the halls of Congress to the airwaves of Comedy Central, now plans to turn the focus on Trump, who has never made public his own. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, recently said congressional Democrats -- who have formally requested them from the Internal Revenue Service -- will ""never"" see Trump's returns. ""Hey Mr. Trump,"" Sanders said after pledging on ""The Daily Show"" to releasing a decade of returns, ""do the same thing."" During his interview with the Times, Sanders pushed back on comparisons between himself and the President. ""Not being a billionaire, not having investments in Saudi Arabia, wherever he has investments, all over the world, mine will be a little bit more boring,"" he said."

The agreement concludes a 14-year-long investigation into the school's use of affirmative action in its admissions process after someone who did not end up applying to the school filed a complaint with the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights in 2004. The Department of Education's office began the investigation in July 2005, according to department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill. The agreement states that the school of medicine will stop considering race and/or national origin ""as part of the holistic admissions process."" If the school decides to use race as a factor in the admissions process again, it must notify the Department of Education and provide a ""reasoned, principled explanation"" for why it plans to do so, according to the agreement. The complainant said that the Texas Tech School of Medicine's ""expected use of race as one of many factors in the admissions process"" was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, according to a letter from the Department of Education obtained by CNN. The Department of Education conducted interviews at the school in 2016, but had not conducted any follow-up interviews to collect additional information since, Texas Tech University System Vice Chancellor and General Counsel Eric Bentley wrote in a letter. The Department of Education sent the school the proposed agreement in November 2018, according to Bentley. Education spokeswoman Hill said the school requested an agreement prior to the conclusion of the department's investigation. Read More A 2016 Supreme Court decision, Fisher v.

Bentley wrote in the letter that he believed Texas Tech's School of Medicine ""is in compliance with the Fisher standard"" but that the school would enter into the agreement ""in an effort to resolve this matter and focus on educating future health care professionals.""

Stacey Abrams: Trump's denial of renewing family separations 'misleading the American public',edition.cnn.com,Caroline Kelly,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/stacey-abrams-family-separation-cnntv/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams said Tuesday that she thinks President Donald Trump will reinstate the practice of separating families at the southern border despite his public denials that he is looking to do so.
""I believe that he intends to restart a program that is vicious, that is ineffective, and that is long-term harmful not only to the children and families that he separates, but to the core of who we are as Americans,"" Abrams said. She also accused him of being xenophobic, specifically toward people of color. Abrams doesn't think 2020 Democratic field is too crowded ""I believe that he is misleading the American public as he often does -- in part because he has no real plan other than to push forward his, I think, very strong xenophobia that is unfortunately directed largely at South America and Central America, but I think at large is directed at people of color,"" she added. Trump denied earlier on Tuesday that his administration is looking to resume the separation of parents and children at the US-Mexico border.

Ilhan Omar defends herself after calling Stephen Miller a 'white nationalist' When asked whether she agreed with Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar calling senior White House adviser Stephen Miller a white nationalist , Abrams replied, ""I believe that what we have seen from Stephen Miller is vestiges of white nationalism."" ""The problem is we've never been able to fully investigate who he is and where he stands because he holds a position that is not subject to public vetting,"" she added. ""And that's one of the deepest concerns that I have, that this is a person who's directing the Department of Homeland Security -- the third largest agency in this nation, that's responsible for protecting us -- but the person who is pulling the strings does not seem to care about protecting many Americans."""

The memorial was defaced with ""racist and other deplorable language,"" CNN affiliate WRAL reported, citing an email from interim Chancellor Kevin M. Guskiewicz. The memorial has since been cleaned, WRAL reported. Barnett also is accused of vandalizing an outdoor art installment near the university's Hanes Art Center, police said. The vandalism comes during a school year in which a separate statute on campus -- a Confederate monument called "" Silent Sam "" -- was toppled by protesters.

Wade's #OneLastDance tour-- what he's calling his final season -- is coming to a close; while not officially out of the NBA playoff chase, the Miami Heat's chances seem unlikely. Before Wade plays Tuesday night in what is likely his final game for the Heat at American Airlines Arena, Budweiser has released an advertisement honoring him. The ad touches on the jersey swapping Wade has become known for in his final season; he's gifting opposing players and soon-to-be-former adversaries his jersey after games. But this time, the tables are turned on the 16-year NBA veteran, who does not know who will appear in the ad. Read More Each person walking out of the darkness of a dimly lit basketball court instead present Wade with a piece of clothing that's significant to them. His mother, Pastor Jolinda Wade, recounted the difficult times Wade and that he and his family had to endure while growing up in Chicago and how Wade in recent years bought her a church at which she could preach. She gifted him her ministry robes. ""I am more proud of the man you have become, than the basketball player,"" she says to her son in the video. ""You are bigger than basketball."" When Merrilyn Beard-Breland's Florida house burned down in 2010, the gifts for 10 children and two grandchildren went up in smoke, too. Dwyane Wade gifted the family with a $1,000 shopping spree. Beard-Breland gifted him a shirt she made. ""You're not Wade the basketball player -- the legend,"" Andrea Oliver says to Wade in the video. ""You're the human being that took the time and on his on wrote my brother's name on his shoe."" Wade dedicated the remainder of his 2017-2018 NBA season to Oliver's brother, Parkland school shooting victim Joaquin Oliver . Wade was Joaquin's favorite player; she gave him the jersey Oliver wore in his final championship. Tamar Johnson gave Wade her graduation cap and gown. Wade paid for her scholarship to Marquette University; she was the first person in her family to graduate from college. When Danny Arzu met Wade at one of his basketball camps at Miami's Overtown Youth Center, he says his life changed. That experience inspired him to not only rise up, but to give back to his community as a mentor at the center. He gifted Wade the suit jacket he wore to his first job interview. While the full film is four minutes, Budweiser tells CNN it will be airing a 90-second version on the local broadcast of Tuesday's game."

(CNN) I don't think my closeted teen self would've believed the last few weeks of Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign could have happened. But I've watched in awe as it has unfolded.
My gratitude and amazement gave way to a different set of emotions this week when conservative provocateur Erick Erickson started attacking Buttigieg , implying that because Buttigieg is Episcopalian -- a denomination known for its more progressive positions on social issues -- ""he might not actually understand Christianity more than superficially."" Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons This is a common trope among some evangelical Christians on the right, impugning other more liberal Christians as somehow less ""real"" or authentic in their faith. Full-on rage set in when Erickson followed up his tweet with a blog post arguing that while Trump is morally problematic, Buttigieg is ""no better a Christian than Donald Trump"" because he's gay. ""This is why progressive Christianity is so corrupt and flawed. As much as Buttigieg makes a valid critique on the President's behavior and evangelicals excusing that behavior, Buttigieg wants to reject the inconvenient parts of faith he does not like,"" said Erickson, referring to Buttigieg's positions on homosexuality and abortion. ""He wants to have it both ways and in reality is showing he is no better a Christian than Donald Trump. "" Progressives all over the country are challenging the fundamentalists' stranglehold on what it means to be Christian. And in Buttigieg, we have an amazing role model whose mere existence as a gay Christian running for president inspires me. Buttigieg has leaned into his faith, giving interviews about his religious beliefs and appearing to incorporating it into his stump speech. Read More Pete Buttigieg on faith, his marriage and Mike Pence ""My marriage to Chasten has made me a better man. And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God,"" Buttigieg said on Sunday of the former Indiana governor while speaking at the LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington. ""That's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand: That if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator."" Those words hit especially close to home as I prepare to get married myself this June. My fiancé, one of the first gay people to be ordained in the Presbyterian Church (USA), and I will gather with family and friends at Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary for a wedding ceremony presided over by a United Church of Christ minister currently serving on staff at Highland Baptist Church. The ceremony will take place just months after an openly gay Episcopalian man announces his run for president. What an amazing moment to witness God's love and justice expanding before our very eyes across the many branches of the Jesus movement and across the entire United States. ""When I think about where most of Scripture points me, it is toward defending the poor, and the immigrant, and the stranger, and the prisoner, and the outcast, and those who are left behind by the way society works,"" Buttigieg told CNN and USA Today commentator Kirsten Powers. He's also highlighted how he ""wanted to be married in the church"" and was glad the Episcopal Church had embraced same-sex marriage so he could get married in his own church. Karen and Mike Pence's astonishing moral hypocrisy ""It's unusual for Democratic presidential candidates to talk about faith as often as Buttigieg does,"" one report noted . ""It's groundbreaking that he uses his marriage to another man to illustrate his personal relationship with God."" Let's address Erickson's wrong-headed comparison of Buttigieg and Trump head-on. The president is a racist, misogynist, thrice-married, anti-immigrant, wealth-obsessed braggart who is credibly accused of (though has denied) sexually harassing and groping women and claims he's never sought forgiveness in his entire life. How can all of that be outweighed by Buttigieg being gay? Even if you disagree with the idea that LGBTQ people are born equal in rights and dignity, putting Buttigieg in the same moral time zone as Trump would get you flunked out of any second-grade Sunday School class. I'm happy to report that when the rage subsided, I could see the attack on Buttigieg revealed something encouraging at the same time: Conservatives and fundamentalists are noticing progressive Christians. That's a sign of our growing influence and visibility. Christianity's future looks more like Lady Gaga than Mike Pence There's a growing push toward LGBTQ inclusion across the many strands of American Christendom. Fundamentalists are worried, and worried people make outlandish attacks like Erickson's. Even the Mormon Church is taking steps toward greater LGBTQ inclusion. And progressive Christians are becoming more vocal in other ways , including the revival of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Poor People's Campaign by the Rev. Dr. William Barber II to the Nuns on the Bus and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's writing about how her faith informs the need for criminal justice reform. ""Nearly 40 years after some prominent evangelical Christians organized a Moral Majority movement to promote a conservative political agenda,"" NPR reported, ""a comparable effort by liberal religious leaders is coalescing in support of immigrant rights, universal health care, LGBTQ rights and racial justice.""

I served communion on Sunday at Highland Baptist Church in Louisville, which is one of my routine duties as a deacon. But this Sunday in particular, the significance of being able to serve in this role as a gay man really hit me in the moments before the service began. A deep sense of gratitude, joy and peace overcame me : for my faith community embracing same-sex marriage in 2014, for all the LGBTQ people who came before me and helped bend the moral arc of the universe, and for the many people of faith who remain in discriminatory communities but are pushing them toward equality from within. I believe my marriage, like Pete Buttigieg's and his husband's, will move me closer to God and I believe the rise of progressive Christians is pushing the entire church closer to God as well."
Hearing on climate change and national security becomes an angry partisan clash,edition.cnn.com,Nicole Gaouette,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/house-climate-natsec-hearing/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A House Oversight Committee hearing to examine the impact of climate change on national security -- including military bases ravaged by extreme weather events -- devolved into partisan sniping, personal attacks and efforts to deny climate change represents a threat.
Committee chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, opened the hearing by raising the record-breaking March floods at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, home to US Strategic Command, and the wreckage Hurricane Florence inflicted in September on North Carolina's Camp LeJeune, where a Marine commander warned the impact of climate-related events has degraded Marine Corps readiness. Beyond the domestic impact, Cummings quoted Director of National Security Daniel Coats' assessment that heat waves, droughts and floods are likely to fuel competition for resources, social discontent, migration and tension between states. ""There may be differences of opinion on how we should respond, but there should be no uncertainty about whether we respond,"" he said. Surreal spectacle Read More That proposition was never put to the test. Instead, the hearing became a surreal spectacle in which one side tried to address an issue that the other side largely refused to accept is valid. US Air Force says it needs nearly $5 billion for hurricane and flood damage Republicans used the hearing to assail Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman New York Democrat, and the Green New Deal legislation she has championed. GOP members attacked the scientific consensus on climate change, argued Pentagon spending on climate preparedness is a waste of money, and complained the witness panel didn't include those anyone who denies climate change is a problem. They bristled at criticism of President Donald Trump's proposal to form a panel to question the scientific consensus on climate change and whether it poses a national security threat -- despite Pentagon and intelligence community assessments that it does just that. And they attacked one witness in particular -- former Secretary of State John Kerry, an architect of the US entry into the Paris Agreement from which Trump withdrew -- in particularly personal terms. Playing ""the 1% card"" Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, said it was appropriate that someone ""with a pseudo-science degree is pushing pseudo-science in front of our committee today."" Kerry has a political science degree from Yale. He also accused the former senator of playing ""the 1% card,"" a reference to Kerry's personal wealth, after the former Secretary suggested taxes on the wealthy might be part of an answer to fund climate solutions. At another point, Rep. Mark Green, a Tennessee Republican, urged that lawmakers ""look at all the climate theories with a critical eye"" and in the meantime argued that any Pentagon spending on climate preparedness is a waste of money. ""If we spend a Department of Defense dollar on non-war fighting capability it decreases our war fighting ability,"" Green said. ""We must not use a single dollar of the Department of Defense budget to address the climate change issue."" That's not what Pentagon officials say. The military impact The top commander of the US Air Force said last week that the effects of climate change across the globe are a source of conflict the US may have to respond to militarily. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein told the Senate Armed Services Committee the brutal 8-year civil war in Syria is a prime example. The conflict began ""because of a ten-year drought,"" and caused the movement of Syrian citizens to places ""where they were not getting any support and therefore a civil war began."" Goldfein added ""we have to respond militarily very often to the effects globally of climate change."" Lawmakers lambast Pentagon climate report Domestically, Pentagon officials have been struggling with the impact of climate change within the US as well. ""We desperately need the supplemental funding to recover from the natural disasters that hammered Tyndall and Offutt,"" Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said at a Heritage Foundation event in March. The Air Force requested $1.2 billion in supplemental funding for fiscal year 2019 and $3.7 billion over the next two fiscal years to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and recover Offutt Air Force Base. Without supplemental funding now, Pentagon officials say the Air Force will have to cut critical facility and readiness requirements, increasing Air Force wide operational risks and negatively impacting the recovery of Tyndall and Offutt. Military bases ""There are other decisions we'll have to make if we don't [have supplemental funding] by May or June,"" Wilson said. ""These are just the first decisions that we had to make yesterday ... 61 projects in 18 states are not going to happen because we have not gotten a disaster supplemental for Tyndall."" Marine Corps Commandant Robert Neller warned in September of similar damage to the military, saying the flooding damage at Camp LeJeune means ""one-third of the combat power of the Marine Corps is degraded and will continue to degrade."" Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who represents the District of Columbia, noted that the Pentagon recently released a Congressionally mandated report that examined the vulnerability of military bases to climate events and found that 36 bases are vulnerable to wildfires , 43 to drought and 53 face recurrent flooding caused by sea level rise and storm surges. ""That's the defense department speaking,"" Holmes said. Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, another key witness who served under President Obama agreed, saying that climate issues are ""a centerpiece for national security because not only does it affect the infrastructure, it affects readiness and preparation."" 'On and on' Seventeen F-22 fighter aircraft are ""out of the lineup"" because of hurricane damage at Tindell Air Force Base in Florida, he said. At Fort Bragg in North Carolina, ""they can't train, they've got to rebuild, they've got to shift their people and their structures and their planning. You could go on and on."" ""It is very clear that planning for climate change is not some frivolous waste of time or waste of money,"" Hagel said. ""It is essential to our troops and to their wellbeing and to the national security of our country."" The hearing included surreal exchanges, including one between Massie, who kept asking Kerry about levels of carbon dioxide being far higher millions of years ago, suggesting concerns about their rise now are overblown. ""But there weren't human beings -- it was a different world, folks,"" Kerry said. When Massie asked how carbon dioxide rose to such levels without humans, Kerry said it involved geological events. When Massie asked, ""did geology stop when we got on the planet?"" an irritated Kerry said, ""this is just not a serious conversation,"" he said. 'More leadership ...than President Trump has in his lifetime' Republicans repeatedly used the hearing to criticize the Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal proposal. Hagel repeatedly pointed out that the hearing wasn't about the bill, but Kerry took the opportunity to defended the proposal and criticized Trump's leadership on the issue. ""We all have differences on one piece of legislation or another,"" Kerry said. ""But in proposing what she has proposed together with Sen. (Ed) Markey, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez has in fact offered more leadership in one day or in one week than President Trump has in his lifetime on this subject."" Some Republicans raised questions about the cost of dealing with climate change -- particularly its impact on jobs. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, raised the costs of the proposed approach to climate change. And Republican Rep. Carol Miller of West Virginia emphasized that while she cared about climate change as a mother and grandmother, she saw the energy industry as a crucial employer in her district and that ""quality of life directly corelates with access to affordable energy."" ""The problem is ... we have been doing this in a way that's simply not sustainable,"" Kerry said. ""There's no country in the world that's living sustainably today."" ""You talk about your children and your grandchildren, if we don't protect our environment your grandchildren have a pretty tough go in 20, 30 years."""
Democratic senators call on ICE to reinstate policy protecting pregnant migrants,edition.cnn.com,"Katie Bernard, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/democrat-senators-letter-pregnant-migrants/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Over a dozen Democratic senators, including numerous presidential hopefuls, are demanding the reinstatement of an Obama-era policy against holding pregnant migrants in detention centers.
In a letter to Ronald Vitiello, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, lawmakers referenced reports of miscarriages and mistreatment of pregnant women following the Trump administration's repeal of a policy which required the immediate release of pregnant women last year. ""In addition to receiving inadequate medical care, women report having been shackled around the stomach while being transported and mistreated physically and psychologically by ICE and CBP agents,"" the letter says. ""Women have shared stories of being ignored during their miscarriages by agents who refused to respond to the medical emergencies these women were facing."" The request comes in the middle o f major personnel changes in the Department of Homeland Security , seemingly driven by the administration's desire to get tougher at the border. The changes include the departure of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, the withdrawal of the nomination for Vitiello to be made permanent the director of ICE and pending appointment of McAleenan as acting secretary. As the administration denies reports that President Donald Trump is looking to reinstate a zero-tolerance policy of family separation at the border, the senators argued that ICE is incapable of caring for pregnant women in their custody. Therefore, they said the agency should release the women upon detainment. Read More According to the ICE website and spokesperson Danielle Bennett the agency currently addresses pregnant migrants on a ""case-by-case"" basis. The agency provides a variety of prenatal and postpartum care and education as well as abortion services in some cases, Bennett said. ICE declined to comment on the letter. ""Such disturbing incidents underscore the need to return to ICE's previous policy of presumptive release for all pregnant women,"" the letter says. ""ICE does not and cannot meet the medical, mental health, and nutritional needs of pregnant women in immigration detention."" According to the letter, 28 women have had miscarriages in ICE custody the last two fiscal years, citing figures officials gave to the Arizona Republic newspaper in February. The senators called for the agency to ensure appropriate treatment of pregnant women in custody. They also requested documents and information regarding the number of pregnant women in detention since 2017, their condition and protocol for their care. The letter was signed by 2020 presidential hopefuls such as Sens. Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Michael Bennet and Cory Booker as well as other Democratic Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto, Ed Markey, Patty Murray, Ron Wyden, Jacky Rosen, Mazie Hirono, Bob Menendez and Tina Smith."
States say DeVos is hurting efforts to police student loan servicers,edition.cnn.com,Katie Lobosco,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/states-devos-student-loan-protections/index.html,"Washington (CNN) There's a fight brewing between states and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos over who has the power to police student loan servicing companies as consumer advocates question whether the federal government is doing enough to protect borrowers from shady practices.
Democratic attorneys general from 20 states and Washington, DC, sent a letter to the secretary last week saying the Department of Education is blocking access to records requested by law enforcement. ""The department's policy reversal impedes states' ability to enforce the law and shields unprincipled industry actors from regulatory enforcement, harming student loan borrowers nationwide,"" the letter reads. The department has cited privacy reasons when rejecting requests for information over the past year, the attorneys general wrote. The Department of Education argues that it's best for the federal government to monitor the system -- a departure from DeVos' stance about state power on other education issues. She's argued that it should be left up to the states to decide whether teachers have guns in the classroom and to set discrimination rules for private schools that receive public funding. Read More ""Federal loans are federal assets and therefore must be controlled and regulated by the federal government,"" said Elizabeth Hill, a spokeswoman for the department, in an emailed statement. ""A piecemeal, state-by-state approach to regulating federal assets causes confusion for borrowers, makes administration of the loan program more complicated and costly, and thwarts Congress' goals that the program be administered at the federal level,"" she added. DeVos is due to testify Wednesday at the House Education and Labor Committee, where lawmakers are expected to ask her a broad range of questions about the policies and priorities of the department. Data shows DeVos didn't immediately forgive student loans after court order A recent report from the department's inspector general raised questions about federal oversight at a time when the amount of outstanding student loan debt has topped $1.5 trillion -- surpassing credit card and auto loan debt. Many borrowers complain that it's difficult to navigate the confusing system that offers several different repayment plans. The report found that the department ""rarely used"" the contract provisions to hold servicers accountable when they weren't complying with federal rules. The department disagreed with the report's findings. State officials say that both federal and state oversight is needed over the loan servicers, which are hired by the Department of Education to manage the federal student loan program. Some of the servicers are nonprofits, but two of the biggest are private companies, Nelnet and Navient. For years, states have been stepping up to strengthen their own protections for student loan borrowers. In 2015, Connecticut became the first state to adopt a ""student loan bill of rights."" It created the position of a student loan ombudsmen to help resolve complaints from borrowers and established licensing requirements for servicers. Five other states have adopted similar legislation since then, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Betsy DeVos loses lawsuit after delaying student loan protection rule Lawmakers in 14 states have introduced bills this year, as fear grows that the department is scaling back borrower protections. Under DeVos, the department ended an agreement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to share information from loan companies, it's fought state oversight in court and last year it issued a rule that says state regulations are preempted by federal law. ""The department's actions are like throwing sand in the gears, slowing down state law enforcement investigations aimed at protecting student loan borrowers,"" said Seth Frotman, a former student loan ombudsman for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who resigned last year and started a nonprofit called the Student Borrower Protection Center. ""It's very apparent now that if states don't step up, no one will be overseeing this market,"" he added."
Telephone CPR could save lives. States are starting to require 911 operators to be trained for it - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Michelle Lou and Brandon Griggs,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/telephone-cpr-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) When someone calls 911, the time it takes for paramedics to arrive can be the difference between life and death.
Minnesota lawmaker Julie Sandstede knows this. She represents a rural area, where ambulances may take longer to arrive on the scene of a medical emergency. When her husband experienced cardiac arrest in 2011, the dispatcher sent the ambulance the wrong way. Luckily, he was saved by a bystander who performed CPR on him under the guidance of a 911 operator. ""(The operator) was able to assess the situation and give direction to what intervention was needed,"" Sandstede said. ""We were so fortunate."" Her husband, Evan Sandstede, was lucky to have an operator who knew how to walk someone through CPR. But that's not always the case. Read More Heart attacks: What you should know ""When I learned that not all 911 operators are trained in how to instruct CPR over the phone, I couldn't believe it,"" Sandstede said. ""I was shocked. ... This is unconscionable."" This legislative session, the Democratic lawmaker has proposed legislation in Minnesota that would require all 911 operators to be trained in telephone CPR. Telephone CPR is the process in which a 911 operator helps the caller identify cardiac arrest with a short script and provides ""just-in-time"" instructions on how to provide CPR, said Dr. Michael Kurz, chairman of the American Heart Association's Telecommunicator-CPR Task Force. Sandstede proposed the bill after she was approached by the American Heart Association, which has been lobbying for these kinds of laws nationwide. At least six states already require telephone CPR At least six states already require 911 operators to be trained in telephone CPR, according to the American Heart Association. They are Louisiana, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Indiana, West Virginia and Maryland. However, the American Heart Association has been lobbying for all states to adopt telephone CPR requirements. The organization said it would be a cost-effective way to increase the survival rates of people who experience cardiac arrest outside a hospital. Widespread implementation of telephone CPR would include three to four hours of initial training and a yearly refresher, said Kurz. ""When we talk about public health interventions, this is a relatively low-cost, very high-yield way to improve public health,"" he said. Sandstede said her bill is modeled after Wisconsin's law , which was enacted in 2018 and set aside $250,000 for telephone CPR training. Telephone CPR could increase survival rates About 350,000 sudden cardiac-arrest events occur in the United States each year, and survival rates nationwide average about 10%, Kurz said. A 2018 Cleveland Clinic survey found that 54% of Americans say they know how to perform CPR. However, only 11% of respondents knew the correct pace for performing the chest compressions, the survey found. Having a bystander provide CPR before paramedics arrive on the scene can double or even triple the rate of survival, Kurz said. Telephone CPR-trained 911 operators can identify whether someone is going into cardiac arrest with two questions, and can provide CPR instructions in about 20 seconds. Heart attacks are on the rise among young women, study shows ""The public largely assumes that if you call 911, you'll receive instructions on whatever the medical emergency is,"" Kurz added. ""In reality, we know that there's a very large disconnect."" Some people think that telephone CPR is equivalent to practicing medicine and only physicians who are licensed should do that. However, Kurz said that is a misconception that is hindering public health."

Benjamin Netanyahu's re-election plans in limbo as Israeli election too close to call - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Oren Liebermann,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-election-exit-poll-intl/index.html,"Jerusalem (CNN) Benjamin Netanyahu's hopes of securing a record fifth term as Israeli Prime Minister are on hold for the moment, after early results showed a tight election race with his main rival.
Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party appear neck and neck with the centrist Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz, with more than 90% of votes counted. Both sides are projected to win 35 seats each based on actual results, report Israel's Channel 12 and 13. Netanyahu's Likud party has secured 26.28% of the vote so far, while Gantz's Blue and White has 25.97% -- a difference of less than 13,000 votes, according to the results from the Central Elections Committee. But Netanyahu may have the advantage when it comes to putting together a coalition. His bloc, made up of the right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties, has 65 seats according to the latest results. A center-left bloc led by Gantz looks to have only 55 seats. To form a governing coalition, a candidate will need to put together 61 seats in the Israeli Knesset. Read More This picture could yet change if some of the smaller right-wing parties decide to support Gantz, a move observers say is unlikely. With no clear winner having yet to emerge, both Netanyahu and Gantz claimed victory on Tuesday evening. ""The right-wing bloc led by the Likud won a clear victory. I thank the citizens of Israel for the trust. I will start forming a right-wing government with our natural partners as soon as tonight,"" Netanyahu said. Gantz, meanwhile, said the election had one clear winner and that he, not Netanyahu, should be called on to form the next government. ""We won! The Israeli public has had their say!"" Gantz said in a statement. ""These elections have a clear winner and a clear loser. Netanyahu promised 40 seats and lost. The President can see the picture and should call on the winner to form the next government. There is no other option!"" Officially, it's up to Israel's President to decide who is tasked with forming the next government. He announces his decision after consulting with the heads of the political parties that have secured enough votes to enter the Knesset. These consultations take a few days, and the President is likely to announce his decision about a week after the elections. Netanyahu prepares to cast his vote on Tuesday. Gantz waves to his supporters after casting his vote earlier Tuesday. Netanyahu's veer to the right A tense night beckons for Netanyahu as he waits to see if his dream of becoming Israel's longest ever serving leader will be fulfilled. He would pass the founder of the state, David Ben Gurion, during the summer. Most of the final pre-election polls on Friday showed Netanyahu trailing by a few seats to Gantz. Casting himself as the underdog, Netanyahu veered sharply to his right in the final days of the campaign, pledging to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected, and warning his voter base that the end of his strong right-wing government would signal the beginning of a weak left-wing government. How Israel's political debate moved from peace talks to annexation Netanyahu fought the election in the face of looming indictments for bribery and breach of trust offenses. His campaign sought to portray his pending indictments as a witch-hunt led by left-wing elites and fed by the media. As CNN discovered when it visited a Likud stronghold in Beersheva, that message resonated strongly with many blue-collar Israelis. The local Likud organizer in the town compared Netanyahu to Moses, saying, ""The more they go after him, the stronger he becomes."" The election was called in December, ostensibly after the government gave up on efforts to get a new military draft law through Parliament. Netanyahu believed the timing was right -- sending voters to the polls before any indictments were brought against him, and with a message he could sell to the electorate. Speaking to his Likud lawmakers on the day the election was called, he said the outgoing government had ""outstanding achievements"" on which to campaign. Gantz enters the fray At first facing a diverse array of opponents, Netanyahu saw his challenge crystallize after a dramatic announcement in February, which saw three former army chiefs come together with a former TV news anchor-turned-politician to create the Blue and White party. The name was simple but significant. Blue and White are the colors of the Israeli flag. The message was equally simple: Blue and White had been created to reclaim the state of Israel from Prime Minister Netanyahu. The man who would lead that campaign and present himself as the anti-Netanyahu candidate was Gantz, a former head of the army, who had held that position under Netanyahu, fighting two wars in Gaza during his tenure. Bibi forever? Supporters in Netanyahu's heartland think so Gantz's entry into the political arena had been widely anticipated, and, indeed, hoped for in many quarters. Blue and White's polling numbers quickly surged, turning it into a two-horse race. The campaign was hard and personal. After it emerged that Iran had allegedly hacked Gantz's phone, Netanyahu questioned whether he could be trusted to keep the country safe if he couldn't look after his phone. Netanyahu loyalists also suggested Gantz had abandoned a dying soldier after an attack many years ago in the West Bank town of Nablus. Blue and White rejected the slur, and Gantz was also cleared by a military inquiry. For his part, the Prime Minister announced he intended to sue Gantz and his key ally, Moshe Ya'alon, after the latter suggested Netanyahu could be guilty of treason in connection with an investigation into military procurement. The ""Ultimate Deal"" lurks in the background During the race, Netanyahu -- known to supporters and detractors alike as ""Bibi"" -- focused on burnishing his status as a global player with close ties to both the President of the United States and the President of Russia. In a visit to Washington during the campaign, Donald Trump signed a proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, in defiance of the overwhelming international consensus. And in the election's closing days, on a visit to Moscow, Netanyahu was able to personally thank Vladimir Putin for Russia's key role in locating the body of an Israeli soldier who had been missing in Lebanon for nearly 37 years. As the election went into its final days, most polls showed Gantz with a slim lead over his rival. But the same polls suggested that Netanyahu's route to building a successful coalition would be more straightforward, due to the number of other right-wing parties projected to win seats. Why Trump and Netanyahu desperately need each other Lurking in the background throughout the campaign was the prospect that President Trump is set to unveil his plans soon for the ""Ultimate Deal"" -- his name for a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. Nevertheless, the conflict did not play a key role in the campaign, and there was little discussion by the main parties of the merits or otherwise of pursuing a two-state solution. And whatever coalition gets built, there remains the ticking clock that is the Attorney General's intention to indict Netanyahu pending a hearing within the next few months. One more hearing is expected over the summer. Any decision by the Attorney General to press forward and bring charges is certain to change the political landscape once again. As counting gets underway, a word of caution: exit polls in Israel, as in many other places, are notoriously unreliable. Four years ago, all three main Israeli networks' exit polls were badly off. All of them significantly underestimated Netanyahu's tally of seats, and two of the three actually suggested he would lose to his then-chief rival, Isaac Herzog. In the event, Netanyahu secured 30 seats to Herzog's 24."
5G network: List of US cities where it's available now,edition.cnn.com,Ahiza Garcia,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/5g-network-us-cities/index.html,"San Francisco (CNN Business) 5G, the next generation of ultra-fast wireless, is now available in the US. But the catch is you'll need to be in the right city with the right device to access it.
The technology has been touted as a major breakthrough that will allow for better video streaming and more technical advancements such as connecting self-driving cars. The US has made some solid ground catching up to China's existing 5G presence. In fact, a recent report published by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), which represents the US wireless communications industry, found the US and China are now tied for first place in 5G readiness . But analysts don't expect to see widespread adoption in the US until around 2020. Here's where you can get it now from Verizon and AT&T. T-Mobile and Sprint, which are set to merge, also have plans for 5G networks, but those likely won't roll out until 2020. Read More Verizon Last week, Verizon launched the first 5G-enabled phone that can be used on a 5G network in select areas of Chicago and Minneapolis. In Chicago, mobile 5G coverage is concentrated in areas such as the West Loop and South Loop and around landmarks such as Union Station, Willis Tower and Millennium Park. In Minneapolis, 5G is available downtown and in areas such as US Bank Stadium. But you'll need the moto z3 phone and a special 5G moto mod attachment, which looks like a small battery pack, to access it. The good news is its mobile 5G network is expected to expand to over 30 cities by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Verizon's 5G home service, which works like broadband internet, is already available in select parts of these cities with a 5G router: Houston Indianapolis Los Angeles Sacramento, Calif. AT&T AT&T, which owns CNN's parent company WarnerMedia, launched its 5G network in several cities in late 2018. But for now it's only accessible via a Netgear Nighthawk 5G Mobile Hotspot — not a 5G-enabled phone. To access some of the benefits of 5G, visitors or residents of these cities will need to connect their Wi-Fi devices to the hotspot: Atlanta Austin, Texas Charlotte, N.C. Dallas Houston Indianapolis Jacksonville, Fla. Los Angeles Louisville, Ky. Nashville, Tenn. New Orleans Oklahoma City Orlando, Fla. Raleigh, N.C. San Antonio San Diego San Francisco San Jose, Calif. Waco, Texas As 5G coverage grows, the technology will also improve.

Judge blocks policy forcing some asylum seekers to remain in Mexico There were approximately 92,000 arrests of undocumented migrants for illegal entry on the southern border in March, up from 37,390 last March. Overall in March, there were more than 103,000 individuals apprehended along the border, or encountered at a port of entry and deemed ""inadmissible."" ""The Border Patrol is facing unprecedented humanitarian and border security crisis. We're seeing record numbers of apprehension, large groups and numbers in custody and we've arrived at the breaking point,"" said Border Patrol official Brian Hastings. RELATED: How Trump's DHS purge puts homeland security at risk Read More In February, there was a record number of family apprehensions, and ""unfortunately, March apprehension levels are again record setting and cause dire concerns for us,"" said Hastings. The agency apprehended 53,000 family members, primarily from primarily from northern triangle last month. First on CNN: Pence to visit US-Mexico border on Thursday ""As a last resort"" on March 19, Border Patrol began releasing non-criminal families directly from its custody with notices to appear in court. Since then, over 11,000 family members have been released either to nongovernmental shelters or bus stations. Combined efforts of releasing individuals from CBP custody as well as surging resources to the border have helped reduce capacity, but ""apprehensions continue to rise,"" said Hastings.

"Judge orders detainment for Rondell Hendry, man accused of attempting ISIS-inspired vehicle attack - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Eli Watkins,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/maryland-national-harbor-rondell-henry/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A federal judge ordered a Maryland man detained on Tuesday following an accusation by the government that he was inspired by ISIS and stole a van with the intention of running over innocent people.
US Magistrate Judge Thomas DiGirolamo accepted the government's argument at a detention hearing in Maryland, ordering Rondell Henry detained as he awaits trial and the government's investigation is ongoing. At the hearing on Tuesday, Assistant US Attorney Thomas Windom said Henry was by his own admission inspired by ISIS and that, if released, he would be a danger to the community. The judge accepted Windom's argument and rejected an offer by a public defender on Henry's behalf to keep him on house arrest in the custody of his family and 24 hour monitoring. The Justice Department announced the allegation against Henry on Monday and said he had been arrested in connection with the vehicle theft last month. Read More Speaking to reporters Monday evening, Prince George's County Chief of Police Hank Stawinski of Maryland said he had not been able to inform the county ""immediately"" about the event, but stressed his belief that the area was safe. On Tuesday, Windom said Henry had spent time ""watching videos posted by the Islamic State"" and was in agreement with the infamous militant group's calls for violence against civilians. ""He considered it brave to murder innocent civilians,"" Windom said. Windom said that last month, Henry ""literally walked out the door"" of his job, in the middle of his shift and looked for a vehicle to run people down with. He followed someone in a U-Haul and stole the vehicle, Windom said, and drove out to Dulles International Airport early in the morning and ""essentially cased the airport"" before leaving and heading to National Harbor in Maryland, where he walked around looking for a place to attack with the U-Haul. He was apprehended by law enforcement the next morning, according to Windom. Windom said there was corroborating video surveillance at Dulles and National Harbor, evidence of interest in ISIS from Henry's phone and Henry's own statements backing the government's arguments. Henry has been charged with transportation of a stolen vehicle, although Windom said the investigation was ongoing, including as it related to terrorism. Michael CitaraManis, an attorney for Henry, noted he had only been charged with the stolen vehicle and accused the government of trying to ""control the narrative"" as he counseled the court to be cautious -- and even suspicious -- of the government's claims. He noted, as did the judge, that Henry had no criminal history and was a naturalized citizen after coming to the United States from Trinidad and Tobago some 11 years ago. He also said it appeared Henry's ""rights have been violated"" and noted confusion by Henry's family after his arrest, saying they even reported him as a missing person. A local report on Patch.com from last month showed he had been thought to be missing after leaving work and the unfolding events alleged by the government. Jennifer Moore, acting special agent in charge of the FBI's Baltimore field office, told reporters after the hearing that what had begun on some law enforcement levels as a missing person's case had quickly turned into something else. She stressed the FBI's regular call for people to report suspicious behavior: ""If you see something, please say something."""
Hearing on climate change and national security becomes an angry partisan clash - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Nicole Gaouette,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/house-climate-natsec-hearing/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A House Oversight Committee hearing to examine the impact of climate change on national security -- including military bases ravaged by extreme weather events -- devolved into partisan sniping, personal attacks and efforts to deny climate change represents a threat.
Committee chairman Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, opened the hearing by raising the record-breaking March floods at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, home to US Strategic Command, and the wreckage Hurricane Florence inflicted in September on North Carolina's Camp LeJeune, where a Marine commander warned the impact of climate-related events has degraded Marine Corps readiness. Beyond the domestic impact, Cummings Quote: d Director of National Security Daniel Coats' assessment that heat waves, droughts and floods are likely to fuel competition for resources, social discontent, migration and tension between states. ""There may be differences of opinion on how we should respond, but there should be no uncertainty about whether we respond,"" he said. Surreal spectacle Read More That proposition was never put to the test. Instead, the hearing became a surreal spectacle in which one side tried to address an issue that the other side largely refused to accept is valid. US Air Force says it needs nearly $5 billion for hurricane and flood damage Republicans used the hearing to assail Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman New York Democrat, and the Green New Deal legislation she has championed. GOP members attacked the scientific consensus on climate change, argued Pentagon spending on climate preparedness is a waste of money, and complained the witness panel didn't include those anyone who denies climate change is a problem. They bristled at criticism of President Donald Trump's proposal to form a panel to question the scientific consensus on climate change and whether it poses a national security threat -- despite Pentagon and intelligence community assessments that it does just that. And they attacked one witness in particular -- former Secretary of State John Kerry, an architect of the US entry into the Paris Agreement from which Trump withdrew -- in particularly personal terms. Playing ""the 1% card"" Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, said it was appropriate that someone ""with a pseudo-science degree is pushing pseudo-science in front of our committee today."" Kerry has a political science degree from Yale. He also accused the former senator of playing ""the 1% card,"" a reference to Kerry's personal wealth, after the former Secretary suggested taxes on the wealthy might be part of an answer to fund climate solutions. At another point, Rep. Mark Green, a Tennessee Republican, urged that lawmakers ""look at all the climate theories with a critical eye"" and in the meantime argued that any Pentagon spending on climate preparedness is a waste of money. ""If we spend a Department of Defense dollar on non-war fighting capability it decreases our war fighting ability,"" Green said. ""We must not use a single dollar of the Department of Defense budget to address the climate change issue."" That's not what Pentagon officials say. The military impact The top commander of the US Air Force said last week that the effects of climate change across the globe are a source of conflict the US may have to respond to militarily. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein told the Senate Armed Services Committee the brutal 8-year civil war in Syria is a prime example. The conflict began ""because of a ten-year drought,"" and caused the movement of Syrian citizens to places ""where they were not getting any support and therefore a civil war began."" Goldfein added ""we have to respond militarily very often to the effects globally of climate change."" Lawmakers lambast Pentagon climate report Domestically, Pentagon officials have been struggling with the impact of climate change within the US as well. ""We desperately need the supplemental funding to recover from the natural disasters that hammered Tyndall and Offutt,"" Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said at a Heritage Foundation event in March. The Air Force requested $1.2 billion in supplemental funding for fiscal year 2019 and $3.7 billion over the next two fiscal years to rebuild Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and recover Offutt Air Force Base. Without supplemental funding now, Pentagon officials say the Air Force will have to cut critical facility and readiness requirements, increasing Air Force wide operational risks and negatively impacting the recovery of Tyndall and Offutt. Military bases ""There are other decisions we'll have to make if we don't [have supplemental funding] by May or June,"" Wilson said. ""These are just the first decisions that we had to make yesterday ... 61 projects in 18 states are not going to happen because we have not gotten a disaster supplemental for Tyndall."" Marine Corps Commandant Robert Neller warned in September of similar damage to the military, saying the flooding damage at Camp LeJeune means ""one-third of the combat power of the Marine Corps is degraded and will continue to degrade."" Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who represents the District of Columbia, noted that the Pentagon recently released a Congressionally mandated report that examined the vulnerability of military bases to climate events and found that 36 bases are vulnerable to wildfires , 43 to drought and 53 face recurrent flooding caused by sea level rise and storm surges. ""That's the defense department speaking,"" Holmes said. Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, another key witness who served under President Obama agreed, saying that climate issues are ""a centerpiece for national security because not only does it affect the infrastructure, it affects readiness and preparation."" 'On and on' Seventeen F-22 fighter aircraft are ""out of the lineup"" because of hurricane damage at Tindell Air Force Base in Florida, he said. At Fort Bragg in North Carolina, ""they can't train, they've got to rebuild, they've got to shift their people and their structures and their planning. You could go on and on."" ""It is very clear that planning for climate change is not some frivolous waste of time or waste of money,"" Hagel said. ""It is essential to our troops and to their wellbeing and to the national security of our country."" The hearing included surreal exchanges, including one between Massie, who kept asking Kerry about levels of carbon dioxide being far higher millions of years ago, suggesting concerns about their rise now are overblown. ""But there weren't human beings -- it was a different world, folks,"" Kerry said. When Massie asked how carbon dioxide rose to such levels without humans, Kerry said it involved geological events. When Massie asked, ""did geology stop when we got on the planet?"" an irritated Kerry said, ""this is just not a serious conversation,"" he said. 'More leadership ...than President Trump has in his lifetime' Republicans repeatedly used the hearing to criticize the Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal proposal. Hagel repeatedly pointed out that the hearing wasn't about the bill, but Kerry took the opportunity to defended the proposal and criticized Trump's leadership on the issue. ""We all have differences on one piece of legislation or another,"" Kerry said. ""But in proposing what she has proposed together with Sen. (Ed) Markey, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez has in fact offered more leadership in one day or in one week than President Trump has in his lifetime on this subject."" Some Republicans raised questions about the cost of dealing with climate change -- particularly its impact on jobs. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, raised the costs of the proposed approach to climate change. And Republican Rep. Carol Miller of West Virginia emphasized that while she cared about climate change as a mother and grandmother, she saw the energy industry as a crucial employer in her district and that ""quality of life directly corelates with access to affordable energy."" ""The problem is ... we have been doing this in a way that's simply not sustainable,"" Kerry said. ""There's no country in the world that's living sustainably today."" ""You talk about your children and your grandchildren, if we don't protect our environment your grandchildren have a pretty tough go in 20, 30 years."""

"Texas Tech School of Medicine will not consider race in admissions process, per agreement with Trump administration - CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Ellie Kaufman,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/ed-dept-texas-tech/index.html,"(CNN) The Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Medicine will not consider race or national origin as a factor in its admissions process, according to an agreement the school entered with the Department of Education in February.
The agreement concludes a 14-year-long investigation into the school's use of affirmative action in its admissions process after someone who did not end up applying to the school filed a complaint with the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights in 2004. The Department of Education's office began the investigation in July 2005, according to department spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill. The agreement states that the school of medicine will stop considering race and/or national origin ""as part of the holistic admissions process."" If the school decides to use race as a factor in the admissions process again, it must notify the Department of Education and provide a ""reasoned, principled explanation"" for why it plans to do so, according to the agreement. The complainant said that the Texas Tech School of Medicine's ""expected use of race as one of many factors in the admissions process"" was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, according to a letter from the Department of Education obtained by CNN. The Department of Education conducted interviews at the school in 2016, but had not conducted any follow-up interviews to collect additional information since, Texas Tech University System Vice Chancellor and General Counsel Eric Bentley wrote in a letter.

Bentley wrote in the letter that he believed Texas Tech's School of Medicine ""is in compliance with the Fisher standard"" but that the school would enter into the agreement ""in an effort to resolve this matter and focus on educating future health care professionals."" The school planned to inform all staff to discontinue consideration of race and national origin in admission in a memo by March 1, 2019, per the agreement, and by removing references to race and national origin as admissions factors in university materials by Sept. 1, 2019, according to Hill.

Democratic senators call on ICE to reinstate policy protecting pregnant migrants - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,"Katie Bernard, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/democrat-senators-letter-pregnant-migrants/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Over a dozen Democratic senators, including numerous presidential hopefuls, are demanding the reinstatement of an Obama-era policy against holding pregnant migrants in detention centers.
In a letter to Ronald Vitiello, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan, lawmakers referenced reports of miscarriages and mistreatment of pregnant women following the Trump administration's repeal of a policy which required the immediate release of pregnant women last year. ""In addition to receiving inadequate medical care, women report having been shackled around the stomach while being transported and mistreated physically and psychologically by ICE and CBP agents,"" the letter says. ""Women have shared stories of being ignored during their miscarriages by agents who refused to respond to the medical emergencies these women were facing."" The request comes in the middle o f major personnel changes in the Department of Homeland Security , seemingly driven by the administration's desire to get tougher at the border. The changes include the departure of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, the withdrawal of the nomination for Vitiello to be made permanent the director of ICE and pending appointment of McAleenan as acting secretary. As the administration denies reports that President Donald Trump is looking to reinstate a zero-tolerance policy of family separation at the border, the senators argued that ICE is incapable of caring for pregnant women in their custody. Therefore, they said the agency should release the women upon detainment. Read More According to the ICE website and spokesperson Danielle Bennett the agency currently addresses pregnant migrants on a ""case-by-case"" basis. The agency provides a variety of prenatal and postpartum care and education as well as abortion services in some cases, Bennett said. ICE declined to comment on the letter. ""Such disturbing incidents underscore the need to return to ICE's previous policy of presumptive release for all pregnant women,"" the letter says. ""ICE does not and cannot meet the medical, mental health, and nutritional needs of pregnant women in immigration detention."" According to the letter, 28 women have had miscarriages in ICE custody the last two fiscal years, citing figures officials gave to the Arizona Republic newspaper in February. The senators called for the agency to ensure appropriate treatment of pregnant women in custody. They also requested documents and information regarding the number of pregnant women in detention since 2017, their condition and protocol for their care.

During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on ""Hate Crimes and the Rise of White Nationalism,"" Rep. Ted Lieu of California played a clip of Candace Owens, of the conservative group Turning Point USA, discussing Hitler. ""In congressional hearings, the minority party gets to select its own witnesses. And of all the people that Republicans could have selected, they picked Candace Owens,"" Lieu said. ""I don't know Ms. Owens -- I'm not going to characterize her. I'm going to let her own words do the talking. So I'm going to play for you the first 30 seconds of a statement she made about Adolf Hitler."" Lieu then played a clip of Owens describing Hitler's motive ""to make Germany great"" as ""fine."" ""I actually don't have any problems at all with the word nationalism,"" Owens says in the clip. ""I think that it gets -- the definition gets poisoned by elitists that actually want globalism. Globalism is what I don't want. So when you think about -- whenever we say nationalism, the first thing people think about -- at least in America -- is Hitler. You know, he was a national socialist, but if Hitler had just wanted to make Germany great and have things run well, OK, fine. The problem is that he wanted -- he had dreams outside of Germany.

Owens accused Lieu a few minutes later of thinking that African-Americans are ""stupid."" ""I think it's pretty apparent that Mr. Lieu believes that black people are stupid and will not pursue the full clip in its entirety.

The New York Democrat stressed that ""it is not proper to refer disparagingly to a member of the committee"" and ""the witness may not refer to a member of the committee as 'stupid,' "" telling Owens not to make such comments again. She replied, ""I didn't refer to him as 'stupid.' That's not what I said. That's not what I said at all. You didn't listen to what I said."" The conservative activist accused Lieu of mischaracterizing her remarks and called Hitler ""a homicidal, psychopathic maniac that killed his own people -- a nationalist would not kill their own people."" Lieu ""purposefully wanted to give you a cut-up similar to what they do to Donald Trump to create a different narrative,"" Owens added.

Pence himself has not responded to the pointed attacks, but on Tuesday, second lady Karen Pence and the vice president's spokesperson pushed back on Buttigieg's critcisms. ""They've always had a great relationship,"" Karen Pence said on Fox News host Brian Kilmeade's radio show on Tuesday.

Ryan Francis Barnett, 31, and Nancy Rushton McCorkle, 50, were arrested Monday by UNC police, accused of vandalizing the Unsung Founders Memorial on the early morning of March 31 on the university's Chapel Hill campus, the school said. The memorial was defaced with ""racist and other deplorable language,"" CNN affiliate WRAL reported, citing an email from interim Chancellor Kevin M. Guskiewicz. The memorial has since been cleaned, WRAL reported. Barnett also is accused of vandalizing an outdoor art installment near the university's Hanes Art Center, police said. The vandalism comes during a school year in which a separate statute on campus -- a Confederate monument called "" Silent Sam "" -- was toppled by protesters. Read More Barnett, of Sanford, North Carolina, and McCorkle, of Newberry, South Carolina, were arrested on initial charges of vandalism and ethnic intimidation, UNC police arrest reports say. Barnett also faced a preliminary charge of public urination, the reports say. The arrest reports do not say how Barnett and McCorkle came to be suspects in the Unsung Founders Memorial vandalism. Police investigating the incident had been reviewing surveillance footage, WRAL reported. CNN's attempts to reach Barnett and McCorkle for comment weren't immediately successful. Barnett is scheduled to appear in court on April 22, and McCorkle is scheduled to appear on April 25, according to their arrest reports.

Trump denied earlier on Tuesday that his administration is looking to resume the separation of parents and children at the US-Mexico border. On Monday, senior administration officials told CNN's Jake Tapper that in the last four months or so, the President had been pushing then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to enforce a stricter and more widespread ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy.

Bernie Sanders to release 10 years of tax returns by Monday - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Kate Sullivan,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/bernie-sanders-millionaire-tax-returns/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Bernie Sanders said Tuesday he's a millionaire -- which will be confirmed when he releases 10 years of tax returns in the coming days.
The Democratic presidential candidate made no apologies for his growing nest egg; in an interview with The New York Times , he said, ""I wrote a best-selling book. If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too."" 2020 Democratic presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), R, speaks at a campaign rally in Grand Park on March 23, 2019 in Los Angeles, California. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) The details of how Sanders became a millionaire will come to light when he releases his tax returns. Campaign manager Faiz Shakir told CNN Sanders' returns will be made public ""on or before"" Monday, the tax filing deadline for 2018. The Vermont independent has repeatedly promised to release the information ""soon."" On Tuesday, Shakir said, ""It will be done before the tax filing date is over. To my perspective, that is soon. I appreciate that there's been a lot of concerns that have been raised by a number of people but this will soon be over."" The release will likely quiet a growing din of concern over the release of Sanders' tax returns, which are expected to reflect an increase to his income through the sales of his book. But the unveiling will also open up Sanders, who released a single year of returns during the last campaign, to increased scrutiny -- the kind befitting his frontrunner status in this increasingly competitive and crowded Democratic primary field. Read More Speaking to CNN, Shakir said that Sanders ""believes in opportunity for all, and the fact that he is somebody who has personally benefited from that opportunity is something that he feels should be a shared opportunity with everyone else. He's made some money off a book. And I think that the opportunity that he has had is evaporating for so many others. He feels that strongly."" ""Particularly as you get into future generations of Americans, it's less likely that somebody with little income could become a millionaire,"" Shakir added. ""That is an ethic I think that truly does guide him. There's nothing about any of these tax returns or the money or anything that'll come out that'll change that fundamental fact one bit."" Sanders' book, ""Our Revolution,"" was released in November 2016, a week after Donald Trump won the presidency. It claimed a spot on The New York Times' bestseller list. The book is about his bid for the presidency and the grassroots movement he worked to create while running against, and ultimately losing to, Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. His most recent book, ""Where We Go from Here: Two Years in the Resistance,"" was published in November 2018 and outlines the blueprint for his 2020 presidential run. Sanders entered the race in February. Sanders, who has been pressed on a timetable for his taxes everywhere from the halls of Congress to the airwaves of Comedy Central, now plans to turn the focus on Trump, who has never made public his own. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, recently said congressional Democrats -- who have formally requested them from the Internal Revenue Service -- will ""never"" see Trump's returns. ""Hey Mr. Trump,"" Sanders said after pledging on ""The Daily Show"" to releasing a decade of returns, ""do the same thing."" During his interview with the Times, Sanders pushed back on comparisons between himself and the President. ""Not being a billionaire, not having investments in Saudi Arabia, wherever he has investments, all over the world, mine will be a little bit more boring,"" he said."
States say DeVos is hurting efforts to police student loan servicers - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Katie Lobosco,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/states-devos-student-loan-protections/index.html,"Washington (CNN) There's a fight brewing between states and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos over who has the power to police student loan servicing companies as consumer advocates question whether the federal government is doing enough to protect borrowers from shady practices.
Democratic attorneys general from 20 states and Washington, DC, sent a letter to the secretary last week saying the Department of Education is blocking access to records requested by law enforcement. ""The department's policy reversal impedes states' ability to enforce the law and shields unprincipled industry actors from regulatory enforcement, harming student loan borrowers nationwide,"" the letter reads. The department has cited privacy reasons when rejecting requests for information over the past year, the attorneys general wrote. The Department of Education argues that it's best for the federal government to monitor the system -- a departure from DeVos' stance about state power on other education issues. She's argued that it should be left up to the states to decide whether teachers have guns in the classroom and to set discrimination rules for private schools that receive public funding. Read More ""Federal loans are federal assets and therefore must be controlled and regulated by the federal government,"" said Elizabeth Hill, a spokeswoman for the department, in an emailed statement. ""A piecemeal, state-by-state approach to regulating federal assets causes confusion for borrowers, makes administration of the loan program more complicated and costly, and thwarts Congress' goals that the program be administered at the federal level,"" she added. DeVos is due to testify Wednesday at the House Education and Labor Committee, where lawmakers are expected to ask her a broad range of questions about the policies and priorities of the department. Data shows DeVos didn't immediately forgive student loans after court order A recent report from the department's inspector general raised questions about federal oversight at a time when the amount of outstanding student loan debt has topped $1.5 trillion -- surpassing credit card and auto loan debt. Many borrowers complain that it's difficult to navigate the confusing system that offers several different repayment plans. The report found that the department ""rarely used"" the contract provisions to hold servicers accountable when they weren't complying with federal rules. The department disagreed with the report's findings. State officials say that both federal and state oversight is needed over the loan servicers, which are hired by the Department of Education to manage the federal student loan program. Some of the servicers are nonprofits, but two of the biggest are private companies, Nelnet and Navient. For years, states have been stepping up to strengthen their own protections for student loan borrowers. In 2015, Connecticut became the first state to adopt a ""student loan bill of rights."" It created the position of a student loan ombudsmen to help resolve complaints from borrowers and established licensing requirements for servicers. Five other states have adopted similar legislation since then, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Betsy DeVos loses lawsuit after delaying student loan protection rule Lawmakers in 14 states have introduced bills this year, as fear grows that the department is scaling back borrower protections. Under DeVos, the department ended an agreement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to share information from loan companies, it's fought state oversight in court and last year it issued a rule that says state regulations are preempted by federal law. ""The department's actions are like throwing sand in the gears, slowing down state law enforcement investigations aimed at protecting student loan borrowers,"" said Seth Frotman, a former student loan ombudsman for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau who resigned last year and started a nonprofit called the Student Borrower Protection Center. ""It's very apparent now that if states don't step up, no one will be overseeing this market,"" he added."
Mike Pence to visit US-Mexico border on Thursday - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Dana Bash,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/mike-pence-border-visit/index.html,"(CNN) Vice President Mike Pence plans to visit the US Border Patrol Station in Nogales, Arizona, on Thursday, where he will be briefed by Customs and Border Protection agents and tour the border wall, according to a White House official.
The trip comes amid controversy surrounding the departure of President Donald Trump's homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, reports of additional officials being purged and confusion about Trump's border security plans and policies . Pence has been a staunch supporter of Trump's immigration efforts. Speaking last month at a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Atlanta, Pence said: ""I don't have to tell any of the ICE agents gathered here that we have a crisis on our southern border.' Trump denies reports he will reinstate family separation border policy ""But that crisis on our southern border is driving drugs and crime and human trafficking here in the streets of Atlanta. You face it and you confront it every day. And you face it oftentimes without regard to your personal safety,"" Pence said. Read More Earlier Tuesday, Trump denied reports that his administration is looking to resume the separation of parents and children at the border. Senior administration officials had told CNN's Jake Tapper that in the last four months or so, the President had been pushing then-Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to enforce a stricter and more widespread ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy -- not just the original policy started by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and undone by the President once it was criticized -- that called for the prosecution of individuals crossing the border illegally between ports of entry, resulting in the separation of parents from children. According to multiple sources, the President wanted families separated even if they came in at a legal port of entry and were legal asylum seekers. The President wanted families separated even if they were apprehended within the US. He thinks the separations work to deter migrants from coming. ""He just wants to separate families,"" said a senior administration official. Trump repeatedly denied that was the case on Tuesday. ""We're not looking to do that, no. We're not looking to do that,"" Trump said. But, he added, ""when you don't do it, it brings a lot more people to the border."" ""Now, I'll tell you something, once you don't have it, that's why you have many more people coming. They are coming like it's a picnic, like 'let's go to Disneyland,' "" Trump said."
Son Heung-min strikes late to give Tottenham the edge over Manchester City,us.cnn.com,"Matias Grez, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/football/tottenham-hotspur-manchester-city-uefa-champions-league/index.html,"Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London (CNN) Before Tuesday's Champions League quarterfinal against Manchester City, Tottenham's long-serving defender Jan Vertonghen, now in his seventh year in north London, said the opportunity to move into a new stadium comes only ""once in a generation"" for players and fans.
Though the move was intended to usher in a new era and help Spurs take its place at European football's top table, the Belgian urged supporters to be patient, reminding them the team ""need time to build history"" in its new $1.3 billion home. Had this first-leg been at Wembley -- the national stadium which, at times, made for an uncomfortable temporary home for Spurs -- few would have given Mauricio Pochettino's side a chance against City. Tottenham had failed to beat Guardiola's team in its previous four meetings, losing three of those, and City was on an indomitable run of 22 wins from 23 matches. But Tuesday's game felt special. The fans sensed it, too, creating a deafening, near-constant noise in the lead-up to kick off -- and the players responded. Read More Although last Wednesday's homecoming victory against Crystal Palace was an historic moment for the club -- ""a truly emotional evening,"" as manager Pochettino described it -- the match against City offered Spurs the opportunity to prove it could truly make this new house a home. Strange City XI Tottenham's attacking trio of Harry Kane, Son Heung-min and Dele Alli was rabid from the first whistle, not allowing City's defenders to rest for a moment. It was the latter who would create the first chance of the match, winning the ball back in midfield and playing it wide to Moussa Sissoko. Tottenham's 17,500-capacity south stand, modeled on Borussia Dortmund's famous 'Yellow Wall.' READ: How 'Little Seoul' fell in love with its favorite Son The Frenchman returned the pass, lofting the ball into the box for Alli to run onto. His connection was crisp but the ball fizzed over Ederson's crossbar. For all its experience at the top level, City appeared nervous. Much was made of its inability to deal with the pressure at Anfield at this same stage last season, finishing that match on the wrong end of a 3-0 humbling. Despite the cacophony of noise inside the stadium, you could almost hear the collective sound of 120,000 eyebrows being raised as Manchester City's lineup was announced. There was only a place on the bench for star midfielders Kevin De Bruyne and Leroy Sane, while Bernardo Silva -- arguably's City's best player this season -- was left out entirely. In came Riyad Mahrez, much maligned when called upon this season, and the lesser-spotted Fabian Delph, filling in for Benjamin Mendy at left back. But with 10 minutes on the clock, and with City having barely left its half, the visiting side was gifted a route into the match. In his first foray forward, Raheem Sterling jinked and weaved his way inside onto his right foot and struck at goal, only to be denied by a last-ditch block by Danny Rose. Referee Bjorn Kuipers initially pointed for a corner, before the video assistant referee advised him to view the pitch-side monitor for a potential stray hand from the English left back. The Dutch official needed to watch merely two replays to change his decision and award what was a clear penalty. Unable to watch the same replays Kuipers had, the Spurs supporters were incensed with the decision and the sound of 60,000 simultaneous boos rumbled through the stadium. Hugo Lloris saves Sergio Aguero's first-half penalty. READ: Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's bizarre miss forces PSG to wait for Ligue 1 title Up stepped Sergio Aguero, faced not only by Hugo Lloris in the Tottenham goal but also the vast, imposing single-tier stand at the south end of the stadium. Modeled on the stand which houses Borussia Dortmund's famous 'Yellow Wall,' the 17,500 fans erupted as Lloris guessed the right way and palmed away Aguero's tame penalty. Rising Son It would prove to be City's only real chance in a match which, from then on, looked like Tottenham's to win. From Lloris' save, six white shirts broke forward and descended onto Ederson's goal. By the end of the move, City had desperately hauled 10 of its 11 players back into the box to defend, something which would become a running theme. The half-time whistle drew a deafening roar from the home fans, who sensed this night could be different. This was only the second time in their history that Tottenham had reached this stage of the Champions League, last time being comprehensively beaten by Real Madrid. Harry Kane was forced off with injury in the second half. READ: Bayern Munich thump Borussia Dortmund in Bundesliga, Barcelona close in on Liga title Having never previously reached the semifinals, Spurs felt it was its place for the taking. Though Tottenham suffered a considerable blow midway through the second half, with talisman Harry Kane limping off down the tunnel after rolling his ankle awkwardly under a challenge from Delph, the home side pressed on undeterred. With barely 10 minutes left on the clock, Son feinted his way past Delph and drilled a low shot through Ederson in the City goal. If anyone thought the noise inside had the stadium had been raucous previously, the fans hit new decibels celebrating the South Korean's goal. ""As a team, we never give up,"" Son told BT Sport after the match. ""We fought for 90 minutes. We were more clinical than them and deserved to win. ""I like this stadium -- it's amazing to play here and I'm really, really grateful for the opportunity."" Though Pochettino and Co. will wait anxiously for the results of Kane's scan ahead of the second-leg in eight days time, Tottenham can, for tonight at least, celebrate a victory that makes this daunting stadium feel a little more like home.

Madonna to play at Eurovision song contest in Tel Aviv,us.cnn.com,"Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/middleeast/madonna-eurovision-tel-aviv-israel-scli-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Pop star Madonna is expected to perform two songs at the Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv, Israel in May.
Concert promoters Live Nation Israel, which first broke the news, said in a Facebook post that the performance on May 18 will be ""both historical and hysterical"" and include a classic track and a new song. Madonna's press team also confirmed the icon's appearance in a statement to CNN. However, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the 40-nation strong competition, said the singer's participation in Eurovision was still unconfirmed. ""The EBU can confirm that no final decisions have been made, or agreements signed, regarding the interval acts and potential guest performers for Eurovision Song Contest 2019,"" the EBU press office said in a statement to CNN.

In a letter to the Guardian published in September 2018, the group of artists said: ""We, the undersigned artists from Europe and beyond, support the heartfelt appeal from Palestinian artists to boycott the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 hosted by Israel. ""Until Palestinians can enjoy freedom, justice and equal rights, there should be no business-as-usual with the state that is denying them their basic rights."""
Royal baby name: What will it be?,us.cnn.com,Lauren Said-Moorhouse,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/uk/royal-baby-name-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) Spring has arrived in the UK and, amid the chaos of Brexit, another countdown is in full swing. Any day now, Britain's Duke and Duchess of Sussex will become parents for the first time .
Excitement has been mounting since last October when the couple announced the impending arrival of their child ""in the spring of 2019."" While the exact due date remains shrouded in mystery, Meghan reportedly told members of the public at a royal engagement in January that she was due to give birth at the end of April or in early May. And now Meghan is in the final trimester of her pregnancy, speculation over the baby's gender and name has reached fever pitch. What's in a name? Read More Like any new parents, Meghan and Harry will undoubtedly have been considering baby names for some time and may have already decided on their favorites. There aren't any royal rules for choosing names but the British Royal Family likes to honor those who came before them. Bookmakers have Diana (Harry's mother's name) and Victoria (Harry's great, great, great grandmother) as their hot picks for a girl, while for a boy popular royal names Arthur and Edward, as well as Philip (a nod to Harry's grandfather), top the lists. Meghan's mother Doria Ragland is pictured with Harry's father, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla in May 2018. ""They will most likely honor the grandparents within the middle names of the child,"" explains Wendy Bosberry-Scott, spokeswoman for the etiquette experts Debrett's. ""If the child is a girl, Elizabeth is a favorite for a middle name and it would be a lovely idea to honor the Duchess's mother with a middle name. For a boy, the names Arthur, George, Albert, David and Charles are favorites within the senior royals."" We can also count on Baby Sussex being given a fair few names. Queen Elizabeth II bestowed four names on each of her four children. Current heir apparent Prince Charles's full name is in fact Charles Philip Arthur George. Meanwhile father-to-be Prince Harry's full name is Henry Charles Albert David. Harry's brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, has continued the tradition of multiple names with all three of his children. Will Baby Sussex be a prince or princess? Baby Sussex will become the seventh in line to throne, but that doesn't automatically make the new addition to the royal family a prince or princess. Harry's great, great, great grandfather King George V restricted use of the titles Prince and Princess to certain senior members of the Royal Family. However, the Queen could step in to overrule that decree -- as she did with William and Catherine's younger children, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. ""If the Queen had not issued a Letters Patent in 2012, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis would now be styled as the children of a Duke,"" Bosberry-Scott says. ""The 2012 Letters Patent was a reflection of the then upcoming changes to the Succession to the Crown Act, which in 2013 ended the system of male primogeniture, and meant that Princess Charlotte kept her place in the line of succession when her younger brother was born."" Bosberry-Scott says if the child is a boy he will most likely use his father's second peerage title, Earl of Dumbarton. And if the baby is a girl, she will likely be known as Lady (first name) Sussex. Conversely, Harry and Meghan may choose to pass on titles altogether, as Queen Elizabeth's granddaughter Zara Phillips did with her daughters Mia Grace and Lena Elizabeth. Bosberry-Scott says declining a title is not unheard of. ""There have been occasions when a title has been declined, such as when the Honorable Angus Ogilvy -- the younger son of the 12th Earl of Airlie -- married Princess Alexandra in 1963. He was offered an Earldom but declined."" When will we find out the name? Traditionally, the first to know of a royal birth is the reigning monarch. As well as Queen Elizabeth II, British Prime Minister Theresa May and the Governor General of each Commonwealth nation will be informed, along with the rest of the royals and Meghan's family in the United States. A notice is placed on an easel in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace in London to formally announce the birth of a baby boy to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2018. If Meghan goes into labor overnight, royal aides are unlikely to wake the resting sovereign and so the news will be kept under wraps until the following morning. Ultimately, Bosberry-Scott says the baby's name will be announced ""when Buckingham Palace decides to release it."" ""Traditionally the official announcement of the birth is placed on an easel just inside the gates of Buckingham Palace, but today social media is also used."""

This Alphabet-owned company is delivering espresso via drone in Australia,us.cnn.com,Matt McFarland,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/alphabet-drone-delivery/index.html,"Washington, DC (CNN Business) It's been more than five years since Jeff Bezos unveiled Amazon's drone delivery plans on ""60 Minutes."" Since the excitement, progress has been slow.
But in a development that points to the field's potential, Wing, the drone delivery company of Google's parent company Alphabet, announced Tuesday that it's delivering food and other items within minutes to a limited number of homes in the suburbs of Canberra, Australia's capital. Interest in drone delivery exploded in December 2013 when Bezos said drone delivery was likely four or five years into the future. But Amazon has only announced a small trial in Cambridge, England, near where it has tested drones. Drone deliveries in the United States have been more limited as companies wait on regulations that will allow fully autonomous drones to fly without being directly monitored by a human. A North Dakota golf course has delivered food to players, and drone startup Flirtey has done 7-11 deliveries in Nevada. Your medical supplies could soon arrive by drone But the biggest drone delivery programs to date are happening overseas . Zipline, a Silicon Valley-based startup, says it's made 12,000 medical deliveries in Rwanda since 2016. The drones have sped up deliveries to remote clinics, which can be difficult to access by road. Zipline says it will expand to Ghana later this month. Read More At first, Wing's deliveries will be limited to 100 households in three suburbs, Crace, Palmerston and Franklin. Wing expects to gradually expand to two more neighborhoods in the coming months. Delivery will be free for the first three months. While Wing may appear ahead of Amazon today, there's still a long way to go before any company is a clear leader. Drone delivery companies face questions about safety and public acceptance. Some neighbors may consider drones a nuisance and privacy invasion if they're loudly landing in backyards at all hours. Google previously showed off videos of its drones as they lowered packages to the ground on a rope rather than landing in a backyard. The approach lessens the risk of a drone crashing into a person, pet or property at the delivery site. Amazon declined to comment for this story."

Pence himself has not responded to the pointed attacks, but on Tuesday, second lady Karen Pence and the vice president's spokesperson pushed back on Buttigieg's critcisms. ""They've always had a great relationship,"" Karen Pence said on Fox News host Brian Kilmeade's radio show on Tuesday. ""It's funny because I don't think the vice president does have a problem with him, but I think it's helping Pete to get some notoriety by saying that about the vice president."" Buttigieg to Pence: 'If you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me -- your quarrel, sir, is with my creator' The comment comes after Alyssa Farah, Pence's spokeswoman, tweeted that Pence -- as governor -- responded to the mayor's coming out in 2015 by saying he holds Buttigieg ""in the highest personal regard. I see him as a dedicated public servant and a patriot."" Karen Pence responded to that on Tuesday. Read More ""I'm just like, 'Pete, did you not like that,' because that's what the vice president said about him,"" she said. ""So what's the problem with that?"" Buttigieg appeared to respond to the comments from Pence's orbit on Tuesday, tweeting, ""People will often be polite to you in person, while advancing policies that harm you and your family. You will be polite to them in turn, but you need not stand for such harms. Instead, you push back, honestly and emphatically. So it goes, in the public square."" Buttigieg, most recently, targeted Pence at a fundraiser for the LGBTQ organization Victory Fund on Sunday. ""If me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade,"" Buttigieg said. ""And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me -- your quarrel, sir, is with my creator."" Buttigieg's comments came hours after he made critical comments about evangelical voters' support of President Donald Trump during an appearance on ""Meet The Press.""

Disaster aid issues unlikely to be resolved before 2-week Congress break,edition.cnn.com,Lauren Fox,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/disaster-aid-congress-stalled-recess/index.html,"(CNN) Talks over a $13.5 billion disaster relief bill have hit a ""standstill,"" according to a top Senate Republican involved in the negotiations and are not likely to be resolved ahead of a two-week congressional recess that starts at the end of the week.
That means victims of floods, hurricanes, drought and other natural disasters will have to wait even longer to get needed aid. Disaster relief package remains stalled in Congress ""We made a substantial offer over the weekend that the Democrats rejected,"" said Sen. Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama who chairs the Appropriations Committee. ""Right now, we're at a standstill."" Shelby added that it is ""possible but not probable"" an agreement could be reached before the recess. At issue, are disagreements between President Donald Trump, backed by his Republican allies on the Hill, and congressional Democrats over how much funding to provide for Midwestern states suffering after from massive floods and whether to add more money for Puerto Rico, which is still recovering from 2017's Hurricane Maria . Read More Trump opposes more money for the territory, outside of $600 million for food stamps, in part, because he argues the government there hasn't spent the money it's been allocated already. The Republican offer would make it easier for Puerto Rico to tap Community Development Block Grant funds available to it and didn't include controversial policy riders related to abortion and border wall funding in the House-passed Democratic bill, according to a person familiar with it. A senior Democratic aide explained why they opposed the GOP proposal. Hurricane disaster aid was faster in Texas and Florida than in Puerto Rico, study says ""The Republican 'offer' does not guarantee any new funding for Puerto Rico or ensure the already-allocated funding will ever actually be released by the administration and be disbursed to Puerto Rico in the first place. Instead, the Republican plan inflates a pot of funding that all disasters can take from and says Puerto Rico is eligible only after it spends the funding that the administration is refusing to release,"" the aide said. The ""Republican offer also does not include funding to help rebuild damaged water systems in Puerto Rico."" Sen. Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York and the leader of his party in the chamber, expressed frustration that some Republicans are fighting for aid to their states but won't support it for Puerto Rico and said the Democratic-controlled House will never go along with a plan that doesn't include the territory. ""If they want aid for other areas, they ought to treat every part of America fairly,"" he said at a news conference."
5G network: List of US cities where it's available now,us.cnn.com,Ahiza Garcia,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/5g-network-us-cities/index.html,"San Francisco (CNN Business) 5G, the next generation of ultra-fast wireless, is now available in the US. But the catch is you'll need to be in the right city with the right device to access it.
The technology has been touted as a major breakthrough that will allow for better video streaming and more technical advancements such as connecting self-driving cars. The US has made some solid ground catching up to China's existing 5G presence. In fact, a recent report published by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA), which represents the US wireless communications industry, found the US and China are now tied for first place in 5G readiness . But analysts don't expect to see widespread adoption in the US until around 2020. Here's where you can get it now from Verizon and AT&T. T-Mobile and Sprint, which are set to merge, also have plans for 5G networks, but those likely won't roll out until 2020. Read More Verizon Last week, Verizon launched the first 5G-enabled phone that can be used on a 5G network in select areas of Chicago and Minneapolis. In Chicago, mobile 5G coverage is concentrated in areas such as the West Loop and South Loop and around landmarks such as Union Station, Willis Tower and Millennium Park. In Minneapolis, 5G is available downtown and in areas such as US Bank Stadium. But you'll need the moto z3 phone and a special 5G moto mod attachment, which looks like a small battery pack, to access it. The good news is its mobile 5G network is expected to expand to over 30 cities by the end of the year. Meanwhile, Verizon's 5G home service, which works like broadband internet, is already available in select parts of these cities with a 5G router: Houston Indianapolis Los Angeles Sacramento, Calif. AT&T AT&T, which owns CNN's parent company WarnerMedia, launched its 5G network in several cities in late 2018. But for now it's only accessible via a Netgear Nighthawk 5G Mobile Hotspot — not a 5G-enabled phone. To access some of the benefits of 5G, visitors or residents of these cities will need to connect their Wi-Fi devices to the hotspot: Atlanta Austin, Texas Charlotte, N.C. Dallas Houston Indianapolis Jacksonville, Fla. Los Angeles Louisville, Ky. Nashville, Tenn. New Orleans Oklahoma City Orlando, Fla. Raleigh, N.C. San Antonio San Diego San Francisco San Jose, Calif. Waco, Texas As 5G coverage grows, the technology will also improve. Verizon is set to be the first US carrier to get the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G , a smartphone that won't require an attachment to access 5G. It's expected to hit stores later this spring in the US."

There's trouble in OPEC and oil prices are up 50%,us.cnn.com,Matt Egan,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/investing/oil-prices-opec-libya-venezuela/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Venezuela is in chaos. Iran is grappling with US sanctions. And now there's a surge of violence in Libya . Trouble in these three OPEC nations has helped send US oil prices climbing back above $64 a barrel.
The latest OPEC turmoil amplifies the supply constraints imposed by the cartel's kingpin. Saudi Arabia has slashed production as well as exports to the United States in a bid to engineer higher prices and balance its budget. Despite record-shattering US oil production, US oil prices have spiked 50% since plummeting to $42.53 a barrel on Christmas Eve. And gasoline prices are creeping higher just as the American economy grapples with a slowdown . ""The oil supply story is bullish,"" said Shin Kim, head of supply and production at S&P Global Platts. ""The potential for an escalation of the conflict in Libya has renewed significant risks to oil production."" US oil prices hit a five-month high of $64.79 a barrel on Tuesday morning before retreating. Read More ""I wouldn't be surprised to see oil prices hit $70 before mid-summer,"" said Ryan Fitzmaurice, energy strategist at Rabobank. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is already above $71 a barrel for the first time since mid-November. 'Grave security crisis' Clashes in Libya in recent days raise the risk that the war-torn country's 1.3 million barrels of daily oil production will be imperiled. Libya's UN-backed government said it repelled an attack by rebels over the weekend after briefly losing control of Tripoli's airport. As prices have rallied, all of this money has poured back into the market. That's definitely kept a bid under prices.""
Ryan Fitzmaurice, Rabobank
""OPEC's perennial 'problem child' producer"" is facing a ""grave security crisis,"" Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients. The United States military pulled a contingent of trips from Libya over the weekend, citing the nation's ""increasingly complex and unpredictable"" security situation. Libya's oil output was sidelined for years due to a bloody civil war. But production has been on the rise again in recent months. Actual supply has not yet been impacted, but oil traders are monitoring the situation closely. ""The market gets skittish. If Libya were to go out, oil prices could easily spike $5 to $10 from current levels,"" said Ben Cook, portfolio manager at BP Capital Advisors. Sanctions, blackouts hit Venezuela While Libya is front-and-center right now, the turmoil in Venezuela has been a bigger driver of actual supply trouble. Venezuela has been hit by the Trump administration's sanctions on state oil company PDVSA. The United States imported zero barrels of crude from Venezuela during the final three weeks of March, according to US government statistics . It's a sharp decline from weekly imports of around 600,000 barrels per day before the sanctions were announced in late January. The United States has never gone a full month without importing oil from Venezuela since the government began tracking this metric in 1973. Venezuela's oil output was further derailed by mass blackouts in the country, which has added to the nation's humanitarian crisis. Meanwhile, oil investors are watching for the Trump administration to drop clues on whether it will extend waivers that have allowed countries to keep buying oil from Iran. The waivers were announced last summer and contributed to a supply glut that sent crude prices crashing into a bear market. $4 gas is nearly a reality for many Americans ""Those waivers were largely politically driven,"" Cook said, pointing to last fall's midterm elections. ""We don't have that this time."" OPEC and its allies will likely take a victory lap when leaders meet in June in Vienna. The group's production cuts successfully lifted oil prices in short order. Saudi Arabia has been especially aggressive. The world's leading oil exporter has sharply cut shipments to the United States as a way to demonstrate its commitment to balance the market. What about the US shale oil boom? Another driver for higher oil prices: bullish bets made by hedge funds and other financial players. After going bearish on oil last year, these trend-following traders have gone long on crude in recent months. Those speculative positions can exaggerate price swings. ""It's been pretty dramatic,"" said Rabobank's Fitzmaurice. ""As prices have rallied, all of this money has poured back into the market. That's definitely kept a bid under prices."" The most stunning part of the oil rebound is that it's come in the face of blockbuster production from the United States. America is set to surpass Saudi Arabia in a 'remarkable' oil milestone America pumped a record 10.96 million barrels per crude a day in 2018, up by 17% from the year before, according to the US Energy Information Administration. That trend accelerated in December when US output hit an all-time monthly high of 11.96 million barrels per day. The explosive US growth isn't expected to end either. Lifted by the shale oil boom, the EIA expects US output to average 12.3 million in 2019 and 13 million in 2020. How will Trump respond? It's possible the oil price spike will encourage President Donald Trump to renew his criticism of OPEC . Previous attacks have caused short-term declines in oil prices. The Trump administration could also release barrel s from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the nation's emergency stockpile of oil. But Fitzmaurice doubts such a move would provide lasting relief. ""I would expect them to wait until peak driving season before using the bullets they have,"" he said."

SpaceX faces a key test in the upcoming launch of its biggest rocket,us.cnn.com,Jackie Wattles,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/spacex-falcon-heavy-arabsat/index.html," SpaceX wants to compete with its arch rival in the lucrative business of launching ultra-heavy satellites into space. That's why the second-ever launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket — and the first to carry a payload for a paying customer — will be a key milestone for SpaceX .
Falcon Heavy will vault a pricey communications satellite into orbit for Saudi Arabia-based Arabsat. Liftoff was scheduled for Wednesday evening from Kennedy Space Center in Florida , but SpaceX postponed the launch. It said in a tweet that the next launch opportunity is Thursday. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy is by far the most powerful operational rocket in the world. And with a sticker price of $90 million, it is also about a third of the price of its closest competitor, United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy . Introducing a new ultra-powerful rocket has allowed SpaceX to compete directly with arch rival United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, for lucrative government contracts that require heavy-lift launch vehicles. Falcon Heavy has already been chosen for a few contracts, including a $130 million contract to launch an Air Force satellite that was awarded just four months after its inaugural flight in February 2018. Read More The rocket is expected to be used primarily for US military missions, and to launch spy satellites and hefty commercial telecom satellites . Sending Elon Musk's roadster to space Falcon Heavy's debut flight last year attracted massive attention, in part because CEO Elon Musk decided to launch his own luxury Tesla Roadster as the test payload. The car, which was carrying a space-suited mannequin nicknamed Starman, was vaulted into outer space and is expected to orbit the sun for the foreseeable future. Thousands of people came to SpaceX's launch site in Florida to watch the spectacle. Even more watched a stream online. Part of Falcon Heavy's appeal is the fact that its hardware is reusable. It has three rocket boosters, which are strapped together during launch and are designed to then break apart and make pinpoint landings back on Earth. The boosters can then be refurbished and used again, which SpaceX says drastically reduces the cost of spaceflight. When the rocket flew last year, its two side boosters made synchronized landings on side-by-side ground pads in Florida. But the middle booster missed a seaborne platform it was designed to land on, and instead splashed into the ocean. SpaceX is expected to attempt to land all three this week. Elon Musk's Tesla roadster launched from the Falcon Heavy rocket in February 2018 with a dummy driver named Starman. Falcon Heavy's first customer The satellite SpaceX will launch on Wednesday will update satellite coverage for Arabsat, which is based in Riyadh and delivers hundreds of television channels and radio stations to homes across the Middle East and North Africa. Lockheed Martin built the satellite, along with a second one, for Arabsat as part of a batch of contracts worth $650 million. When Arabsat announced the contracts in 2015, it said at the time that it planned to launch the Arabsat 6A satellite aboard Falcon Heavy. That was back when SpaceX was still expected to test Falcon Heavy later that same year. Before the rocket finally launched more than two years later, Musk suggested to several news outlets, including CNN, that the rocket could explode. Musk's casual mentions of a potential explosion spooked Arabsat executives, according to Bloomberg . SpaceX chief operating officer Gwynne Shotwell flew to Saudi Arabia to reassure them that the Falcon Heavy would be reliable. Though Falcon Heavy's inaugural launch ultimately went off without a hitch, SpaceX will now have to repeat that success with the added risk of carrying a multimillion dollar satellite. SpaceX's Falcon Heavy has twice the power and costs about one third as much as United Launch Alliance's Delta IV Heavy. The version of the Falcon Heavy that will fly this week will not be exactly the same as the previous mission: The Falcon Heavy's rocket cores will be more powerful, making use of upgrades to SpaceX's smaller workhorse rocket, the Falcon 9. Falcon Heavy is not expected to fly nearly as often as its smaller counterpart, which has completed more than 20 missions since last February. Falcon Heavy only has five missions on its manifest so far."
These hemp farmers are making a killing on the CBD industry,us.cnn.com,Parija Kavilanz,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/success/hemp-farmer/index.html,"Blue Forest Farms used to grow hundreds of acres of kale, squash and pumpkins. But it has since switched its focus to a different cash crop: hemp.
The farm, which is located in Erie, Colorado, has dedicated 150 acres to growing hemp so far -- and it's still planting. ""We're now expanding it to 1,000 acres,"" said McKenzie Mann, Blue Forest's production manager. About 500 acres will come from land previously used to grow kale and squash. Farmers across the United States have been rushing into hemp ever since President Donald Trump signed the Farm Bill into law in December. The legislation removed hemp from the government's controlled drug category, triggering a surge in demand for cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical that is derived from hemp and marijuana plants. Blue Forest Farms in Colorado plans to dedicate 1,000 acres of its land to hemp this year. CBD is non-psychoactive, meaning it won't get you high. (THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, is the chemical in cannabis that does that). Instead, CBD extracted from hemp is marketed for everything from pain relief to reducing inflammation, stress and anxiety, and it is sold in an array of products from shampoos and oils to pet treats and granola. Read More Farms that were already growing hemp are seeing both demand and profits surge, while farmers who have never grown hemp before are rushing to plant it in their fields. ""There's a lot of excitement in the farming community because hemp is seen as a high-return crop. There are many farmers around the country who are struggling to make ends meet and they're looking for an alternative like hemp to boost revenue,"" said Eric Steenstra, president of VoteHemp, a non-profit that advocates for the commercial sale of hemp. Suddenly, CBD is everywhere. Here's what's next Mann has been fielding multiple calls a day from farmers around the country. ""They're corn farmers, wheat farmers. They want advice on how to grow hemp,"" he said. Blue Forest charges $35 to $40 per pound for the high-quality hemp it sells for CBD extraction. That compares to about $1 a pound for the kale it sells. The company declined to disclose its total sales of hemp last year but said the category is very profitable for the business and it expects its hemp sales to double this year. Mann said the price of hemp went up slightly after the Farm Bill was signed. Industry watchers say the price could stay at these levels or inch even higher if supply for CBD doesn't meet the demand. But if too many farmers get into the hemp business, the market could become saturated and prices could start falling, Mann noted. Last year, just over 78,000 acres of hemp was grown in the US, up from 9,649 acres in 2016, according to VoteHemp's 2018 Hemp Crop Report . More than just CBD ""There's a lot of excitement in the farming community because hemp is seen as a high return crop.""
Eric Steenstra, president, VoteHemp
Total sales for hemp-based products in the US were about $1.1 billion in 2018, and are expected to more than double by 2022, according to New Frontier Data, a market research firm focused on the cannabis industry. Much of those gains will stem from demand for CBD products. But hemp can also be used for a variety of other products, such as fibers, clothing, rope and building materials. ""It's important to take a longer-term picture of the hemp market,"" said Steenstra. ""Right now, CBD is the hot commodity and is a significant driver of the market and profit for farmers. But as an agricultural crop, hemp has significant market potential for grain and fiber."" After it was legalized in December, hemp has become one of the most lucrative crops for US farmers. Andy Rodosevich is cofounder of Hemp Depot, a Colorado Springs, Colorado, business that operates its own farms and is a distributor of CBD and hemp products. ""My advice to farmers is learn as much as you can about it and then enter at your own risk.""
Randy Wenger, corn farmer
The company planted 5.2 million hemp plants in 2018. ""This year we are planting three times that number. We're trying to keep up with demand for CBD and scale up production,"" said Rodosevich. Hemp Depot charges $35 to $40 for a pound of the high-end hemp it sells for CBD products. Last year, the business sold about 25,000 pounds of hemp, helping the farm log a total of $10 million in sales. This year, he expects to sell 350,000 pounds with total sales crossing $50 million. Rodosevich said the goal for next year is to sell 2 million pounds. He says he's also gotten calls from enthusiastic farmers asking for advice on how to grow hemp. He understands the excitement but tries to set reasonable expectations for them. More from Success What happened when these women found out what male colleagues made

""While hemp is unbelievably profitable for farmers, growing it has its challenges,"" he said. For starters, the seeds aren't cheap. Good quality seeds guaranteed to provide high CBD levels and low amounts of THC that fall below the federally mandated 0.3% threshold, can range from $1 to $2 each. Hemp farming is also labor intensive. While large-scale farms use machinery for growing traditional crops like wheat and corn, specific machinery for planting and harvesting hemp is still lacking. So hemp farms rely on manual labor for planting, harvesting and removing weeds. Randy Wenger, a corn and wheat farmer whose 5,000 acre farm in Yuma County, Colorado, has been in the family since 1919, tried hemp farming for the first time last year. ""I was looking for an alternative crop that could be profitable for me and wouldn't break the bank,"" he said. Randy Wenger with his wife on his family farm in Colorado. Even though he sought advice from other hemp farmers and researched farming techniques online, it was still a challenge. He was surprised at how much manual labor was needed to tend to hemp. ""You can spend a lot of money just on the labor,"" he said. She thought flowers were a waste of money. Until selling them brought in millions The hemp he was growing for CBD didn't turn out to be the best quality either. 'It was a total failure,"" said Wenger. Nevertheless, he is willing to try again. ""CBD is a popular topic,"" said Wenger. ""But my advice to farmers is, learn as much as you can about it and then enter at your own risk.""

Try not to sneeze. These photos show a 'pollenpocalypse' in North Carolina - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Ryan Prior,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/north-carolina-pollen-photograph-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) #ThePollening. It sounds like an M. Night Shyamalan horror film.
If you suffer from pollen allergies, just looking at the above photo may make you want to choke. It was taken Monday by photographer Jeremy Gilchrist, who used a drone to snap aerial pictures of the yellowish green haze blanketing Durham, North Carolina. The pollen wasn't just coating cars and patio chairs -- it was hanging thick in the air. He called it #pollenpocalypse. Gilchrist told CNN he was driving around when he noticed a green cloud in the air. Read More ""It was surprising to see it up that high,"" he said. He's seen pollen shrouds like this before in North Carolina, but from the ground it's difficult to capture their sheer magnitude. So he sent up his drone to a get a better vantage point. The photos look almost like they've been filtered on Instagram. But Gilchrist says he only lightly edited them before posting them to social media. Seen from the drone's perspective they looked ""pretty dull,"" he said, so he added contrast to bump the photos back to the levels usually apparent to the naked eye and resembling how the pollen cloud looked from the ground. Gilchrist, who has also worked as a meteorologist and storm chaser, said pollen can collect in high concentrations in the air like this depending on the amount of recent rain. Yesterday, which was ""breezy and dry,"" helped create the ideal conditions for pollen granules to congregate. He said thunderstorms hit two hours after the original photos were taken. The strong winds swept away the pollen in the air, and the downpour washed away much of the pollen that had settled on the ground. After Gilchrist took the photos, a thunderstorm set in, blowing the pollen cloud away. It's the highest pollen count in the area so far this year The official pollen count in Raleigh, North Carolina, about 20 miles away, was 1778.8 grains per cubic meter of air yesterday, according to North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality. That count is considered ""very high"" and tops the charts for the city so far this year. The pollen spike over the last week comes primarily from the area's trees, which include pine, oak, mulberry, birch and sweet gum. In the latest Weather Channel numbers Tuesday, Raleigh ranks fifth in the nation in pollen severity. Tulsa, Oklahoma, tops that list, followed by Waco, Texas; Springfield, New Jersey; and Georgetown, Texas. The Weather Channel classified the breathing-comfort level in Raleigh Tuesday as ""fair"" but said it would go down to ""poor"" on Wednesday. The haze this week isn't the worst ever recorded by scientists in Raleigh. In 2010, they recorded a count of 3,524 grains per cubic meter, nearly double the count this week, CNN affiliate WRAL reported . But the Raleigh-Durham area isn't typically known for being especially nightmarish for allergy sufferers. In its 2018 ""Allergy Capitals"" report, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America ranked Durham 67th and Raleigh 92nd nationwide in allergy severity. Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the first name of photographer Jeremy Gilchrist."

The public -- not Congress -- will get the first look at the redacted report. Barr made one thing certain. His first agenda item is to release as much of the report as he can to the public at large. And he does not plan on seeking a court order to release grand jury information (which, according to the Federal rules of criminal procedure , must be kept secret unless certain exceptions are met), something Democrats have demanded in recent days. Instead, after the initial release of the report to the public, Barr said he plans to engage with the chairmen of both Congressional judiciary committees in order to deal with potential backlash.

Barr expects to release Mueller report within a week 02:50 He's sticking to his guns and doubling down on his view of what is required of him under the special counsel regulations. Barr was asked what justified him in claiming discretion to withhold information related to the privacy concerns and reputational interests of ""peripheral"" individuals who were not charged in the investigation. He noted that, not only do the special counsel regulations not require any disclosure to the public of any information at all, the Department of Justice's longstanding policy and practice to decline to release damaging or derogatory information about a person if they are not being criminally charged is also guiding his decision-making process. He invoked James Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal here as an example of what not to do. Mueller declined to review Barr's four-page letter. While he emphasized that neither the White House nor the special counsel was involved in the drafting of his now-infamous four-page letter of March 24, 2019, Barr said in the hearing that he did provide Robert Mueller the opportunity to review it, which Mueller declined. In defending his decision to release just the ""bottom line conclusions"" of the special counsel's investigation, Barr insisted that those conclusions were simply ""binary"" -- crimes were either charged or they were not. And while he said he endeavored to use ""as much of the special counsel's own language"" as he could ( which amounted to 101 words ), his letter was never meant to ""summarize"" the report.

737 MAX 8 mixup: Some confused passengers think they're on a plane that's not cleared to fly - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Lauren M. Johnson,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/737-max-in-flight-confusion/index.html,"(CNN) Passengers on a Southwest Airlines flight grew alarmed when they mistakenly thought they were on a 787 MAX 8 aircraft.
The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the popular aircraft in mid-March following two fatal crashes within six months of each other. In October, a Lion Air plane crashed killing all 189 people on board, and in March an Ethiopian Airlines flight went down killing all 157 people on board. But when some passengers looked at the safety cards in their seat pockets, they saw ""787 MAX 8"" printed on them and got worried. A few took to social media to ask Southwest to explain: @SouthwestAir my app says the 737 max 800 is still grounded but that's what my flight from cvg to bwi just was. pic.twitter.com/pgM9jhs9Iq
— understandblue (@understandblue) April 7, 2019 @SouthwestAir Hi, just wondering why I was on a 737 max 8 yesterday. I thought they were grounded until end of May? Nerve wracking! Flight was Dal-cmh 5449.
— A Dog's Brunch (@ADogsBrunch) April 7, 2019 Southwest calmly explained to each confused customer that both aircraft types are printed on the same card. Read More ""Southwest currently offers a FAA-approved Safety Information card for the 737-800 and the 737 MAX 8 that contains safety information applicable to both types of aircraft since the cabin configuration, number of seats (175), and cabin exits are the same for both aircraft types,"" Southwest said in a statement to CNN. ""All 737 MAX 8 aircraft are temporarily grounded, so customers will not be traveling on a MAX 8 aircraft while that grounding is in place,"" Southwest said. Other social media users chastised the confused passengers, noting that both plane types were clearly printed on the card, and asking why they didn't ask their flight attendants to clarify instead of jumping on social media and scaring people. Some offered helpful advice, noting that you can look up the tail number on the airline's website to see what type of craft you're flying, and encouraging flyers to see if the wings matched the unique split design of a 737 MAX 8. But Southwest customers were not the only ones asking questions. Passengers flying Norwegian Air had a similar experience. Norwegian Air responded on Twitter assuring passengers that it prints safety information for its 737 MAX 8 and 737-800 on the same card, as well. Hey!
The Boeing 737-800 shares the safety card with the MAX8. So you're flying one of our 737-800!

Fact-checking Trump's claims that Obama separated families - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Maegan Vazquez,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/fact-check-trump-claim-obama-separated-families/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he's not considering reimplementing his administration's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy, dredging up his earlier claim that President Barack Obama's administration separated migrant families.
""President Obama separated children. They had child separation. I was the one who that changed it,"" Trump said. Facts First: As discussed in a previous fact check , this is false and requires context. Under Obama, children were separated from parents only when authorities had concerns for their well-being or could not confirm that the adult was in fact their legal guardian, but not as a blanket policy. The family separation crisis was triggered last spring when Trump tweaked the status quo he inherited from Obama and ramped up strict enforcement of federal immigration laws that were already on the books. Under past administrations , some border-crossers were occasionally prosecuted, and were thus separated from their families. Read More The main difference between Trump and Obama, experts have said, centers on how they handled immigrants caught near the US-Mexico border. Under Obama, the Justice Department was given broad discretion on who should face criminal charges, and federal prosecutors rarely went after families. But in April 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Justice Department would prosecute 100% of illegal border-crossers in a policy known as ""zero-tolerance."" Adults went to jails and awaited criminal proceedings. Children were sent to detention centers run by the Department of Health and Human Services, and some were eventually placed in foster care. This specific change is what led to the widespread separation of parents and children, according to Jessica Bolter, a researcher with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute who has published 200 pages of reports on Trump's immigration policies. 'Those cages ... were built by President Obama's administration' On Tuesday, the President also claimed ""cages"" were built by Obama to house migrant children. ""Those cages that were shown -- I think they were very inappropriate -- they were built by President Obama's administration, not by Trump,"" the President said. Facts First: This appears to be true but requires context. Many of these processing facilities do pre-date the Trump administration, and were constructed during the Obama administration. These include those where migrants are kept in fenced enclosures, the so-called cages. Given the recent rise in migrants coming to the border, the Trump administration has continued to use the chain-link style fencing enclosures -- at least while migrants are being processed following apprehension. And according to a watchdog report released by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general's office last fall, immigration authorities have sometimes held migrant children in these processing facilities for much longer than they should be. Typically shelters maintained by Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement, the office which handles facilities for unaccompanied minors, do not maintain the same chain-link type fencing often associated with the description of ""cages."" They do, however, confine the children to the shelter properties and many did become overcrowded amid family separations. Outgoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was asked during a March congressional hearing how facilities being used to house unaccompanied minors are different from cages. New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman asked: ""Does it differ from the cages you put your dogs in when you let them stay outside? Is it different?"" Nielsen replied: ""Yes ... It's larger. It has facilities. It provides room to sit, to stand, to lay down."" 'Many more are coming' Trump also claimed that ending the zero-tolerance policy has led to an increase in illegal immigration. ""Now, I'll tell you something, once you don't have it, that's why you have many more people coming. They are coming like it's a picnic, like 'Let's go to Disneyland,' "" Trump said. Facts First: Saying that ending zero-tolerance policy is the root cause for an increase in migration to the US ignores a confluence of other factors. It's true that the number of people arriving at the border are now set to reach levels not seen in a decade, and there has been an increase since the end of the policy. More undocumented immigrants were apprehended along the southern border in March than any month since 2008, according to Customs and Border Protection data released Tuesday . The increase has been paired with a shift in demographics of migrants. There are now more families and children trying to cross into the US, and a majority of the migrants are Central Americans. Family units before the zero-tolerance policy were slightly increasing, and directly after the policy ended, they skyrocketed. Though there was a slight decrease in total apprehensions and inadmissables logged by CBP during the months in 2018 that the zero-tolerance policy was implemented, apprehensions and inadmissables never got back to their historic 2017 lows. But they shifted up after the program was ended, and are continuing to shoot up now. A recent increase in migration also comes alongside a series of other factors pressuring individuals to attempt to enter the US, including deteriorating conditions in their home countries, criminal organizations encouraging migration and threats of an imminent US-Mexico border closure."

Charleston tea plantation: Tour only commercial tea farm in US | CNN Travel,www.cnn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/charleston-tea-plantation-south-carolina/index.html,"Visitors can take a trolley ride to explore Charleston Tea Plantation. Wayne and Angie Eggleston Tea can be grown anywhere that is warm and humid with lots of rainfall and drainage. It could be grown in much of the US South, but it has never been commercially cultivated because tea has traditionally been harvested by hand. Asian and African producers using hand-picked leaves have long dominated the market. At Charleston Tea Plantation, they use a machine harvester to cut the leaves off of the plants. ""Every country has its own sort of flavor,"" Hall says. ""It's a very light, bright, a very smooth and mellow tea that we produce here."" He should know; he's one of only a few remaining trained tea tasters in the United States. Hall's grandfather was an English tea taster and trader who moved to Canada. Hall's father also became a tea taster, and Hall trained on a four-year apprenticeship in England to become a tea taster himself. He worked in the tea-trading industry for years until he came upon the idea of buying the Wadmalaw Island tea plantation. From soil to cup Tea enthusiasts can see the whole process of tea-making at the plantation. All tea comes from the plant Camellia sinensis, the leaves of which are harvested to make tea. Camellia sinensis was brought to South Carolina around the beginning of the 19th century by French botanist André Michaux. The plants were ornamental and not cultivated to produce tea as a commodity. In the 1880s, the US Congress created subsidies to encourage tea cultivation and one of the people who took advantage of this was Charles Shepard. Shepard grew tea in Summerville, about 35 miles from Wadmalaw Island. After Shepard's death in 1915, his Pinehurst Tea Plantation fell into disuse, but the tea plants survived untended until they were transplanted to Wadmalaw Island. Many Indian tea plantations are carved into hillsides because Camellia sinensis bushes need lots of water, but they also require drainage. The Charleston Tea Plantation is flat, but tea can thrive here because the soil is sandy, draining rainfall efficiently into ditches. The tea is harvested every 15 to 18 days during harvest period, which begins in May and lasts until October. At Charleston Tea Plantation, a machine harvester gathers the leaves. The tea bushes themselves have a long lifespan. In fact, Hall says ""when you take a cutting of a plant and form a root system, that plant isn't one year old. It's the same age as the mother plant that you took the cutting from. So basically all these plants here date back to the 1880s."" Related content 22 of the best places to visit in the United States Tea tours A trolley shuttles visitors around the plantation for tours. You can also go inside the processing plant where the tea leaves are washed, chopped, heated and dried. The three main types of tea are differently processed versions of the same Camellia sinensis leaves. Green tea comes from leaves that are not oxidized; black tea from leaves that are fully oxidized; and oolong is partially oxidized, resulting in a flavor that has some of the earthy depth of black tea and some of the herbaceous brightness of green. Inside the processing plant, the tea leaves travel on conveyor belts and into tubs, tanks and ovens -- starting bright green and ending up black. From there you can go to the gift shop where you can take some American tea home, and try your palate as a tea taster. The Charleston Tea Plantation is about a half hour's drive from Charleston. "

(CNN) I don't think my closeted teen self would've believed the last few weeks of Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign could have happened. But I've watched in awe as it has unfolded.
My gratitude and amazement gave way to a different set of emotions this week when conservative provocateur Erick Erickson started attacking Buttigieg , implying that because Buttigieg is Episcopalian -- a denomination known for its more progressive positions on social issues -- ""he might not actually understand Christianity more than superficially."" Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons This is a common trope among some evangelical Christians on the right, impugning other more liberal Christians as somehow less ""real"" or authentic in their faith. Full-on rage set in when Erickson followed up his tweet with a blog post arguing that while Trump is morally problematic, Buttigieg is ""no better a Christian than Donald Trump"" because he's gay. ""This is why progressive Christianity is so corrupt and flawed. As much as Buttigieg makes a valid critique on the President's behavior and evangelicals excusing that behavior, Buttigieg wants to reject the inconvenient parts of faith he does not like,"" said Erickson, referring to Buttigieg's positions on homosexuality and abortion. ""He wants to have it both ways and in reality is showing he is no better a Christian than Donald Trump. "" Progressives all over the country are challenging the fundamentalists' stranglehold on what it means to be Christian. And in Buttigieg, we have an amazing role model whose mere existence as a gay Christian running for president inspires me. Buttigieg has leaned into his faith, giving interviews about his religious beliefs and appearing to incorporating it into his stump speech. Read More Pete Buttigieg on faith, his marriage and Mike Pence ""My marriage to Chasten has made me a better man. And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God,"" Buttigieg said on Sunday of the former Indiana governor while speaking at the LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington. ""That's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand: That if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator."" Those words hit especially close to home as I prepare to get married myself this June. My fiancé, one of the first gay people to be ordained in the Presbyterian Church (USA), and I will gather with family and friends at Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary for a wedding ceremony presided over by a United Church of Christ minister currently serving on staff at Highland Baptist Church. The ceremony will take place just months after an openly gay Episcopalian man announces his run for president. What an amazing moment to witness God's love and justice expanding before our very eyes across the many branches of the Jesus movement and across the entire United States. ""When I think about where most of Scripture points me, it is toward defending the poor, and the immigrant, and the stranger, and the prisoner, and the outcast, and those who are left behind by the way society works,"" Buttigieg told CNN and USA Today commentator Kirsten Powers. He's also highlighted how he ""wanted to be married in the church"" and was glad the Episcopal Church had embraced same-sex marriage so he could get married in his own church. Karen and Mike Pence's astonishing moral hypocrisy ""It's unusual for Democratic presidential candidates to talk about faith as often as Buttigieg does,"" one report noted . ""It's groundbreaking that he uses his marriage to another man to illustrate his personal relationship with God."" Let's address Erickson's wrong-headed comparison of Buttigieg and Trump head-on. The president is a racist, misogynist, thrice-married, anti-immigrant, wealth-obsessed braggart who is credibly accused of (though has denied) sexually harassing and groping women and claims he's never sought forgiveness in his entire life. How can all of that be outweighed by Buttigieg being gay? Even if you disagree with the idea that LGBTQ people are born equal in rights and dignity, putting Buttigieg in the same moral time zone as Trump would get you flunked out of any second-grade Sunday School class. I'm happy to report that when the rage subsided, I could see the attack on Buttigieg revealed something encouraging at the same time: Conservatives and fundamentalists are noticing progressive Christians. That's a sign of our growing influence and visibility. Christianity's future looks more like Lady Gaga than Mike Pence There's a growing push toward LGBTQ inclusion across the many strands of American Christendom. Fundamentalists are worried, and worried people make outlandish attacks like Erickson's. Even the Mormon Church is taking steps toward greater LGBTQ inclusion. And progressive Christians are becoming more vocal in other ways , including the revival of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Poor People's Campaign by the Rev. Dr. William Barber II to the Nuns on the Bus and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's writing about how her faith informs the need for criminal justice reform. ""Nearly 40 years after some prominent evangelical Christians organized a Moral Majority movement to promote a conservative political agenda,"" NPR reported, ""a comparable effort by liberal religious leaders is coalescing in support of immigrant rights, universal health care, LGBTQ rights and racial justice.""

I served communion on Sunday at Highland Baptist Church in Louisville, which is one of my routine duties as a deacon. But this Sunday in particular, the significance of being able to serve in this role as a gay man really hit me in the moments before the service began. A deep sense of gratitude, joy and peace overcame me : for my faith community embracing same-sex marriage in 2014, for all the LGBTQ people who came before me and helped bend the moral arc of the universe, and for the many people of faith who remain in discriminatory communities but are pushing them toward equality from within. I believe my marriage, like Pete Buttigieg's and his husband's, will move me closer to God and I believe the rise of progressive Christians is pushing the entire church closer to God as well."
Kirsten Gillibrand: Americans deserve a brave president (Opinion),us.cnn.com,Kirsten Gillibrand,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/opinions/america-deserves-brave-president-kirsten-gillibrand/index.html,"Kirsten Gillibrand is the junior US senator from New York and a Democratic presidential candidate. The views her own. View more opinion on CNN.
(CNN) Several weeks ago, I launched my presidential campaign in front of Trump International Hotel with a message that I believe in so strongly: When Americans join together to reject hate and division, hope rises, fear loses and, most importantly, bravery wins.
Bravery is exemplified by the millions of Americans who have tirelessly spoken out against this administration's cruel policies toward women , Muslims , the LGBTQ community and immigrant families at our border . They have spoken out because President Donald Trump is tearing apart the moral fabric of this country. He continues to demonize the vulnerable and he punches down. Kirsten Gillibrand He does all of this because he wants us to believe he is strong. He is not. The President is a coward. That's not what we deserve. So many Americans are making a choice to resist the backward pull of this administration and push us toward a better future. And we need a president who is worthy of their bravery. That is why I'm running for president of the United States. Read More We need to fight for an America where power truly belongs to the people, where our politicians care about everyone in this country -- and lead not from weakness or ego but from strength of character. I know we can be that America. But it means starting at the root of many of our problems -- greed. Right now, special interests are displacing the voices of the people of this country. Find me a so-called unsolvable problem, and I will point you to the greed and corruption standing in the way of solutions to it. The tide is turning against the NRA Polluter profits take precedence over drinking water. Predatory lenders get special access to the White House and are allowed to take even more advantage of the most vulnerable customers. And the National Rifle Association, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in America, stops popular common-sense gun reform, while stray bullets kill children in our communities. Dark, unaccountable money is at the heart of this outrageous inaction. We need to crack open our government, flip the switch and let the light flood in. That's exactly what I did when I came to Washington and challenged Congress by making my meetings, finances and earmark requests public with my Sunlight Report . In fact, I was the first member of Congress to put this information on my website, and it was not popular with a lot of my colleagues, who said I was setting the bar for transparency way too high. I rejected that notion then, and I reject it now. The American people deserve to know their elected officials are working for them -- not special interests. It's why I wrote and tirelessly pushed Congress to pass the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act in 2012. I fought to make it illegal for members of Congress to line their pockets and profit from insider information. Public servants shouldn't enrich themselves from the offices they hold. JUST WATCHED Gillibrand releases 12 years of taxes, including 2018 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Gillibrand releases 12 years of taxes, including 2018 01:36 And I will keep leading on transparency within my own office and campaign. That's why I am not taking any money from corporate political action committees, federal lobbyists or individual super PACs. That's why I was the first presidential candidate to release my 2018 taxes, and have put 12 years of tax returns online -- going back to my first year in public office. And as president, I will fight for publicly funded elections to reduce the influence of wealthy donors and special interests. I believe it's the closest thing we have to a silver-bullet solution to so many of our challenges. It would change the way Washington works overnight. Our president should govern based on the principle that our democracy only works when elected leaders hear directly from all Americans, regardless of their financial status. Only then -- once we address the greed in Washington -- can we finally start making progress on the problems we face. But here is what I have also learned over the years. To take on the issues that matter the most, America needs a leader who is willing to be brave. I have learned that bravery means standing up to the powerful and summoning the courage to confront them head-on. The real national emergency is not at the border That's what I did when I first ran for Congress in a 2-to-1 Republican district that nobody thought I could win. Except for my mother, which tells you a lot about her. People told me: ""It has more cows than Democrats -- you just can't win!"" But I took those long odds, and I won. And the next election, I won again -- that time by a 24-point margin . Why? Because I never forget who I serve. I stood up to greed and voted against the bank bailout. I stood up to corruption by making insider trading illegal for members of Congress. I stood up to bigotry and fought to repeal ""don't ask, don't tell."" And it's why I'm proud to have stood up to Trump and voted against his Cabinet nominees -- more than anyone else in the US Senate. I will go toe-to-toe with anyone to do the right thing. Whether it's powerful institutions, the President -- or even my own party. We have big fights in front of us that we can't afford to lose. And we can't possibly win them if we aren't willing to speak out and speak up for what's right. Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

I am running for president to fix what's been broken, to repair our moral fabric and to rebuild the common bonds between us as Americans. This fight is so much bigger than any one election -- it's about making a choice and deciding who we are, and who we are going to be. I believe that we can do this. And I know that, years from now, we will look back on this moment in our history, and we'll be able to say that we were brave enough to do something about it."
Welsh was saved from extinction. Cantonese might not be so lucky - CNN,edition.cnn.com,James Griffiths,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/asia/endangered-languages-welsh-hawaiian-cantonese-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) At work in central Hong Kong, David Hand is surrounded by people speaking Chinese and English. But inside his home, the Welsh language rules.
Hand's three children -- Arwen, Huw and Tomos -- have never lived in Wales, spending their entire lives in Asia. Inculcating his native language in them thousands of kilometers from the only place it is widely spoken wasn't easy. As well as only speaking to them in Welsh himself, Hand hired nannies from Wales -- usually teenagers taking time out between high school and university -- and arranged for them live to with the family. Their Australian mother speaks to them in English. ""As the kids were growing up until the age of five we always had a Welsh speaker at home in addition to me,"" Hand said. Read More ""It's about the mindset of thinking of yourself as Welsh and a Welsh speaker, and compare yourself to a French person or a Spaniard or a German. They wouldn't contemplate not teaching their children their own language."" Despite this, Hand's family is something of a rarity. Many Welsh speakers see their language skills diminish after they leave the country and switch to primarily speaking English or another language. There also aren't the international schools and other institutions available to French, German or Japanese who want their children to grow up speaking a particular language. Nor is the fact that the Hand children speak Welsh remarkable just due to where they live. Only a generation ago, the language was on the verge of dying out completely, joining the hundreds of other languages which have gone extinct in the last half century. Today it is spoken by about half a million people in Wales, or just under 19% of the population -- a rate which has remained stable for almost a decade. The story of the Welsh revival is one of tremendous organizing and effort by activists and politicians, who not only saved their own tongue but also established a blueprint of sorts which can be used by other languages under threat, including Hong Kong's own Cantonese. Such a blueprint is desperately needed. Languages are far more vulnerable than many people realize, and can die out in a single generation if not passed down from parent to child. This year is the United Nations International Year of Indigenous Languages , an event designed to raise awareness of the more than 1,700 languages listed as endangered by UNESCO. More and more languages die out every year. And even as digital tools and communities help in the fight against the decline, some experts warn changes in how we communicate online could drastically accelerate language extinction. Listen to an introduction to Welsh in that language. Language under threat (Iaith dan fygythiad) ""The Welsh language is a vast drawback to Wales, and a manifold barrier to the moral progress and commercial prosperity of the people."" So concluded an 1847 report prepared for the UK government in the wake of widespread social unrest in Wales which much of the English press blamed on the ""lack of education of the Welsh people."" ""It is not easy to overestimate its evil effects,"" the report said of the country's native language, adding ""there is no Welsh literature worthy of the name."" In the wake of the report, Welsh Nots , planks of heavy wood that were hung around students' necks if they were caught speaking Welsh in school, became a common sight across the country. As one teacher wrote in his school's log book in 1870: ""Endeavored to compel the children to converse in English by means of a piece of wood. Offenders to be shut in after school hours."" These attitudes, along with increased immigration to England, helped lead to a staggering drop in the use of Welsh. By the time Plaid Cymru -- the Party of Wales -- was founded in 1925, the number of Welsh speakers had fallen to 37% of the population and appeared headed into terminal decline. Growing up in west Wales in the 1950s and '60s, Toni Schiavone was constantly aware of the language's second-class status in the eyes of the English-speaking elite which governed the country. ""Our culture was being slowly destroyed,"" he said. ""Although I was born and grew up in a Welsh-speaking area, my education was 95% in the medium of English, everything around us was in English. It was being predicted that there would be no Welsh speakers by the turn of the century."" Schiavone was an early member of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg -- the Welsh Language Society -- which organized to protect the country's native tongue via demonstrations and non-violent direct action. Members of Cymdeithas vandalized English-only road signs, staged sit-ins and protests, and campaigned for the establishment of a Welsh-language public television station, which was finally launched in 1982 as S4C. This took no small amount of commitment to the cause. ""In the 1970s people went to jail because road signs weren't available in Welsh, or because they refused to pay the TV license because we didn't have a Welsh language TV channel,"" Schiavone said. Thanks to pressure from groups like Cymdeithas and the growing electoral success of Plaid Cymru, the political winds began to turn in favor of Welsh. In 1993 a law was passed to permit the language's use in court and put it on an equal footing with English for all public services. In decades since, Welsh education has been ramped up nationwide and in 2011 it became the country's official language. The reversal in attitudes came not a moment too soon. At the 1991 census, only 18.5% of the population spoke Welsh, an all-time low. A decade later, however, that figure was more than 20% -- and the language's decline appears to have halted since, stabilizing at about a fifth of the population despite continued immigration from England and other countries. The government of Wales -- which won partial autonomy from the UK in 1997 -- is now thoroughly invested in promoting the Welsh language, setting a target of one million Welsh speakers by 2050, for an estimated population of around 3.5 million. ""We've turned the tide in that people genuinely expected the Welsh language to have been destroyed by now,"" Schiavone said. Listen to an introduction to Hawaiian in that language. Learning by example (Ke aʻoʻia e kahi hiʻohiʻona) Far from being on the verge of extinction, Welsh is often held up today as an example of how grassroots organizing and government support can revive a language. This was the case in Hawaii, where indigenous language activists were facing a much harder task than their Welsh counterparts, according to Gary Holton, a researcher with the Endangered Language Project . ""Almost everywhere the language had ceased to be a first language,"" he said. ""The break in transmission was fairly complete, it required a real effort to jump start the language again ... you had to essentially skip a generation, bring in these grandparents and great-grandparents and get them to interact with preschool-age children."" Ekela Kaniaupio-Crozier was one of the people who helped turn it around. A native Hawaiian speaker, she was a rarity among her school friends, and remembers being the only child attending a language class run by a local church. Despite this, she still struggled to overcome prejudices baked into Hawaiian society against the state's indigenous language. ""I was raised by my grandmother to speak the language. She was very adamant that I speak Hawaiian,"" she said. ""Because I thought it was strange I didn't really choose to speak it back to her but I understood everything."" After university -- in which she trained as a Hawaiian teacher -- Kaniaupio-Crozier became involved in the statewide campaign to revitalize the language. That project has seen remarkable success , leading to a generation of new second-language speakers who are able to pass Hawaiian on to their own children. The language has also become popular among non-indigenous Hawaiians, Holton said, and like in Wales, indigenous names have been restored to many locations. Media has also played a role, with public radio broadcasting a "" Hawaiian Word of the Day "" segment and the state's largest newspaper, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, running a weekly column in the language. Now in her late 50s, Kaniaupio-Crozier is at the cutting edge of digital language preservation and promotion. Along with several other teachers from the Kamehameha School network, she is working alongside a team from the Pittsburgh-based language app Duolingo to create a Hawaiian course for English speakers. On the Slack messaging app and via Skype, Kaniaupio-Crozier and her colleagues liaise with Duolingo developers to come up with bitesize chunks of Hawaiian people can learn and practice on the go through the app's gamified mobile interface. ""It's been interesting,"" she said. ""We're all language teachers, to try and figure out how to do it on this app has been a real challenge. For us to think in those terms, what's most important to somebody, what do they want to see? We had to think different, approach our language teaching differently."" Myra Awodey, a senior Duolingo community specialist, said minority languages had not been ""on our radar"" when the app was first launched. ""To have a big impact we were covering the big languages,"" she said. While there were many requests to add minority languages, developers often couldn't justify focusing on them over more widely used ones. Irish was the company's breakthrough moment. A team of volunteers built out a database for the language and ""blew us away,"" Awodey said. The course now has almost 1 million active learners, or about 60% of the total number of Irish speakers in Ireland itself . About 4 million people have used it at some point, Duolingo said. Since then, Duolingo has added Welsh (330,000 active learners), Esperanto (380,000), and the South American minority language Jopara (340,000), as well as High Valyrian and Klingon, two made-up languages from the TV shows ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Star Trek"" respectively. While serious concerns have been raised over the risk of "" digital language death "" -- whereby indigenous languages are not used on modern communication platforms, hastening their demise -- technology also plays a role in preserving languages. Apps and games, along with YouTube shows and podcasts, are new and increasingly successful ways of keeping a language alive and vibrant. David Hand, the Welsh-speaking Hong Konger, said the previous proliferation of Welsh-language books, music, TV shows and films all helped keep the language alive. Hand runs the St David's Society of Hong Kong , which organizes events for Welsh speakers and expats in the city, as well as fundraising for charity. ""One of the challenges of course about reinforcing (a) language is not to be backward looking,"" he said. ""To make it a living language rather than something to be protected."" But while both Welsh and Hawaiian are seeing a major resurgence, in Hand's adopted home there is increasing concern and paranoia about the future of the city's own native language: Cantonese. Listen to an introduction to Cantonese in that language. Language preservation (語言保育) Nestled at the foot of Castle Peak in Hong Kong's northwest New Territories, the huge white-brick expanse of Harrow International School looms over large green football fields. Students wearing blazers and straw boaters pass under neoclassical arches as they head to class inside the boarding school, reminiscent of a foregone era. But while its look may be old fashioned, Harrow has found itself embroiled in a thoroughly modern controversy. Earlier this year, the school announced it was dropping the traditional Chinese characters used in Hong Kong and Taiwan in favor of the simplified versions favored in China. In a letter to parents, Harrow defended the move as necessary ""to prepare our pupils to be fully literate in the context that Hong Kong will be in by 2047."" That is when the city's current constitutional arrangements expire and it could lose its semi-autonomy and be fully absorbed into China. Institutional support for education was pivotal in the revival of Welsh. It's an approach that has been adopted in Hawaii, Iceland and New Zealand, where the government has pledged to make Maori a core subject in all schools by 2025. However in Hong Kong, many fear Cantonese is heading in the opposite direction. Language has become a key battleground for those pushing back against encroachment from China and seeking to emphasize the city's unique identity in the shadow of its much larger neighbor. Some 144 Chinese languages are listed as in danger by UNESCO, with 24 on the verge of extinction -- including Manchu, the language spoken by the country's former imperial masters. That Cantonese could follow suit can seem alarmist, bordering on ridiculous. About 90% of Hong Kongers -- some 6.8 million people -- speak it as their first language, and a further 73 million people worldwide speak Cantonese or a closely related dialect. Yet the fear is that just as English pushed out Welsh as the dominant language of Wales, Mandarin -- the official language of China -- will increasingly replace Cantonese in Hong Kong, sending the latter tongue into decline. In the past decade, schools across Hong Kong have been encouraged by the government to switch to using Mandarin rather than Cantonese as the primary language in Chinese lessons, which officials say is intended to ""enhance the biliteracy and trilingualism of students."" While less than 20% of primary schools and only 2.5% of secondary schools use solely Mandarin to teach Chinese -- with the majority using a mix of Cantonese and Mandarin -- the figure is growing. Supporters of the policy say Mandarin competency increases the competitiveness of Hong Kongers in the job market and enables them to operate in China, where Cantonese is not widely spoken. There was outrage in October when Education Secretary Kevin Yeung suggested that continued use of Cantonese over Mandarin in the city's schools could mean Hong Kong would lose its competitive edge in the future. Concerns about Cantonese were on display in ""Ten Years,"" a hugely popular Hong Kong movie anthology released in 2016 which predicted a dark future for the city under Chinese rule . In one chapter titled ""Dialect,"" a taxi driver finds himself unable to work after a regulation requires fluency in Mandarin and marginalizes native Cantonese speakers. The man's son speaks primarily Mandarin, and the pair find it hard to communicate in Cantonese. This is already happening across the border in Guangdong province, the region of China where Cantonese (Gwongdungwa) originated. National government policies have been aggressive in pushing Mandarin as the medium of instruction in schools, often at the expense of regional languages and dialects. Television broadcasts and other media have also switched to Mandarin, and most young people in China use Pinyin, a system of inputting Chinese characters based on Mandarin, when they communicate online. ""What is happening with the renaissance of Welsh is the polar opposite of Cantonese,"" said Marco Kwan, editor of Words.hk, a website dedicated to documenting how the city's language is used in daily life. ""To preserve or promote or kill a language is largely dependent on educational policy."" While he says many defenders of the language overstate the risk it faces, Kwan is wary of a ""top-down aversion to Cantonese."" He says this is largely down to city officials and schools seeking to curry favor with the Chinese government by promoting Mandarin teaching in its stead. On the other side of the debate, he pointed to a ""worrying tendency to frame Cantonese as an integral part of the separatist movement, or a revolutionary element, which will make it harder to garner funding and be all the more detrimental to its development."" Holton, the endangered language researcher, was also skeptical of whether Cantonese could ever enter fatal decline due to the sheer number of first-language speakers in the Chinese diaspora. Nevertheless, he was sympathetic to the concerns expressed by many Hong Kongers, and said it was important even for speakers of major languages not to be complacent. ""Language survival is not just about taking speaker numbers into account,"" Holton said. ""Is it used in education, is it used in commerce, or is it only used in the home? ""If policy doesn't support the language, then that makes it difficult regardless of the number of speakers."""
The Trump appointees' dilemma - the law or the President? - CNNPolitics,www.cnn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/donald-trump-kirstjen-nielsen-immigration/index.html,"The law or the President: The Trump appointees' dilemma Analysis by Stephen Collinson, CNN Updated 2:58 AM EDT, Tue April 09, 2019
Washington (CNN) Sooner or later, many of the President's subordinates face the same dilemma.
They can respect the law or they can work for Donald Trump. It's often just not possible to do both.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen became the latest Cabinet member to pay the price for not letting Trump do what he wants -- and on the issue he cares about more than any other -- when she was forced to resign on Sunday.
It was a case of the Trump revolution eating one of its own, since Nielsen, an immigration hardliner, was seen as insufficiently doctrinaire despite becoming the face of the zero-tolerance immigration policy that led to child separations and caused outrage last year.
But CNN reporting makes clear that Nielsen also lost her job because she ultimately came to believe that Trump's wilder impulses on immigration -- an issue that he sees as critical to his reelection in 2020 -- threatened America's security and may have run contrary to the law.
Nielsen is not the first senior Cabinet official to lose their career after coming up against Trump's vision of his own authority -- or his instinct to elevate largely unaccountable appointees, such as domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller or his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
In their own ways, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former FBI Director James Comey and even former Attorney General Jeff Sessions -- the spiritual father of much of the administration's immigration policy -- suffered a similar fate.
Unlike the President, these public servants eventually concluded that the Constitution, the rule of law and the norms of democratic governance rendered some of Trump's behavior unacceptable.
Nielsen's departure, which was accompanied by a White House sweep against her department that also accounted for the director of the Secret Service, sends a signal that Trump is ready to do whatever it takes to stem the crisis on the US-Mexico border, which is threatening to expose his vows to stem the flows of migrants from Central America as hollow.
That will be welcome news for Trump's supporters, who relish his bypassing of the Washington establishment and overwhelmingly back his hard line on immigration and warnings that the US is under siege by an invading tide of criminals.
But the President's desire to honor the faith of his base on immigration eventually made Nielsen's position untenable. Crossing legal lines Trump pushed to close El Paso border, told admin officials to resume family separations and agents not to admit migrants
CNN's Jake Tapper reported on a series of clashes leading up to Nielsen's ouster on Sunday that reveal a President demanding obeisance to his orders, even if they cross legal lines.
A ""ranting and raving"" Trump demanded the closure of the US-Mexico border at El Paso,Texas, in late March, despite being told by Nielsen it was a dangerous idea, according to an attendee at a White House meeting.
Trump has also been pushing to reinstate and escalate the separations of undocumented migrant parents and children at the border, despite the practice being outlawed by the courts and causing bipartisan and international outrage.
The newly purged Department of Homeland Security may well embark on a policy that has been discussed for months that would give migrants at the border a tough decision to make: Remain united as a family in detention or agree to be separated while the parents go through the immigration court process, a senior administration official told CNN's Jim Acosta.
The President also told border agents last week not to let any more asylum seekers into the country, forcing officials to quietly countermand his instructions after he had left the room, Tapper reported.
CNN also reported Monday that Trump is regretting his climb down on a vow to slam shut the southern border -- despite being warned that it could trigger an economic disaster for many Americans.
As the final days of Nielsen's tenure were unfolding, it was Miller, perhaps the only top political figure to the right of Trump on immigration, who engineered a sweep to topple the top leadership in Nielsen's department.
Miller is now in charge of all immigration and border-related issues, according to CNN's Abby Phillip.
His rise is just one front in a widening war between Trump's inner circle and the infrastructure of permanent government that the President has vowed to disrupt.
Trump has in recent months removed irritating checks on his power from the Defense Department and the Justice Department.
Defense Secretary James Mattis left after being surprised by Trump's shock announcement of a Syria troop withdrawal, after being seen as an ""adult in the room"" for much of the first two years of the President's term.
Trump's rhetorical assault on the Federal Reserve is now being stiffened with an attempt to put true believers, such as Stephen Moore and Herman Cain on its board, raising doubts about the independence of the world's most powerful central bank.
On Tuesday, another key figure in Trump's power shuffle will face scrutiny on Capitol Hill.
Democratic lawmakers are likely to question Attorney General William Barr over claims that he was appointed solely because he had written a memo to the Justice Department arguing that special counsel Robert Mueller's obstruction case was legally flawed.
In office, and once Mueller ended his investigation last month, Barr wrote to Congress to say the special counsel had not reached a conclusion on whether Trump had obstructed justice -- but that Barr and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, had decided there was not sufficient evidence to support such a claim.
Barr has yet to release the full report so that members of Congress can make up their own minds. 'Acting' secretaries bolster Trump's power How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen
Elsewhere in Trump's government, a Cabinet stocked with acting secretaries in key positions -- who in many cases lack relevant experience, authority or an independent power base -- seem ill prepared to resist the President.
""I sort of like 'acting,'"" Trump told reporters earlier this year, not hiding the attraction of the departure of Cabinet heavyweights. ""It gives me more flexibility.""
The turmoil in the administration appears to be about more than Trump's effort to consolidate maximum power for himself.
Nielsen's departure, like that of other prominent figures from the Cabinet, also appeared to have been driven by a desire to eradicate any voices that the President does not want to hear.
One of the benefits enjoyed by the global dictators Trump admires so much is they do not have to put up with dissent.
In the democratic context of the US government, the President now appears to be trying to create a similar echo chamber for himself.
Chilling words with an authoritarian lineage such as staff ""purge"" and ""unhinged"" are now being uttered by officials who have spoken to CNN to describe Trump's attitude toward the government and his current mood.
According to multiple reports, Nielsen was frequently put in the position of trying to explain to the President that his radical urges on immigration were dangerous, impossible or unlawful.
In addition to CNN's reporting, The New York Times wrote that Trump used to call Nielsen in the mornings to demand actions that were ""clearly illegal,"" such as halting all asylum claims.
Nielsen is now among other former Trump appointees who discovered that the President's radical beliefs and vision of how to wield his power come up against legal or ethical constraints.
Tillerson, for instance, said last year that he often had to stop Trump from trampling boundaries.
""So often, the President would say, 'Here's what I want to do and here's how I want to do it,'"" Tillerson told former CBS anchor Bob Schieffer.
""And I would have to say to him, 'Mr. President I understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way. It violates the law. It violates treaty,'"" Tillerson said.
Comey testified to Congress that he felt uncomfortable when Trump tried to establish a ""patronage relationship"" with him in violation of the invisible wall between the presidency and the Justice Department and asked him to go easy on his former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President frequently railed against Sessions because Sessions followed his legal obligations and recused himself from the Russia investigation.
And Kelly said his job often involved explaining to Trump the limits of his authority under the law.
But the President never ordered him to do anything illegal, Kelly told the Los Angeles Times in an interview. "
New osteoporosis drug gets FDA approval,edition.cnn.com,Jacqueline Howard,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/osteoporosis-drug-evenity-fda-bn/index.html,"(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration has approved a new treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women who are at high risk of bone fractures.
The FDA announced Tuesday that the drug, called romosozumab, which has the brand name Evenity, works mainly by boosting bone formation and is approved to treat osteoporosis in women with a history of osteoporotic fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture, or those who have not benefited from other types of osteoporosis therapies. ""Today's approval provides women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who are at high risk of fracture with a new treatment that will reduce this risk,"" Dr. Hylton V. Joffe, director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products, said in the announcement. ""But Evenity may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death so it's important to carefully select patients for this therapy, which includes avoiding use in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the previous year,"" he said. Experts streamline guidelines for treating osteoporosis The drug was developed by the pharmaceutical companies Amgen and UCB, which worked together on development since 2004. Read More It is expected to be available from select wholesalers in the United States for physicians to order in about a week, at which time the price will be made publicly available, Amgen spokeswoman Kristen Davis wrote in an email Tuesday. The FDA noted that one dose of Evenity is administered as two back-to-back injections given once a month by a health care professional. No more than 12 doses should be used, so if treatment is still needed after 12 months, other types are encouraged. ""The FDA approval of Evenity represents an important therapeutic development for patients who need a medicine that can rapidly increase bone mineral density and help reduce the risk of future fractures within 12 months,"" Dr. David M. Reese, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen, said in a news release Tuesday. ""Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a significant women's health issue that far too often gets overlooked.

The safety and efficacy of Evenity were tested in two clinical trials involving more than 11,000 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, according to the FDA. Although the trials found the drug to be effective in lowering the risk of a new fracture, the agency noted that there were some side effects, including an increased risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke. The drug packaging comes with a ""boxed warning"" stating those risks and that the treatment should not be used in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the previous year. Other side effects of Evenity include joint pain and headache, and possible reactions or discomfort at the injection sites. Osteoporosis is a disease that involves low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, leading to an increased risk of bone fractures, such as those of the hip, spine and wrist. Of the estimated 10 million people in the United States with osteoporosis, more than 80% are thought to be women ."

""There was no heartbeat today at my scan...so it's over..,"" she said on Instagram . Last week, Baldwin, a fitness guru and the wife of Alec Baldwin, shared her personal story about how she was ""most likely experiencing a miscarriage."" ""I have no shame or embarrassment with this experience,"" Baldwin wrote in an Instagram post. ""I want to be a part of the effort to normalize miscarriage and remove the stigma from it. There is so much secrecy during the first trimester.""
View this post on Instagram I want to share with you that I am most likely experiencing a miscarriage. I always promised myself that if I were to get pregnant again, I would share the news with you guys pretty early, even if that means suffering a public loss. I have always been so open with you all about my family, fitness, pregnancies...and I don't want to keep this from you, just because it isn't as positive and shiny as the rest. I think it's important to show the truth...because my job is to help people by being real and open. Furthermore, I have no shame or embarrassment with this experience. I want to be a part of the effort to normalize miscarriage and remove the stigma from it. There is so much secrecy during the first trimester. This works for some, but I personally find it to be exhausting. I'm nauseous, tired, my body is changing. And I have to pretend that everything is just fine—and it truly isn't. I don't want to have to pretend anymore. I hope you understand. So, this is what is going on now: the embryo has a heartbeat, but it isn't strong, and the baby isn't growing very much. So we wait—and this is hard. So much uncertainty...but the chances are very, very small that this is a viable pregnancy. I have complete confidence that my family and I will get through this, even if the journey is difficult. I am so blessed with my amazing doctor, my dear friends, and my loving family...My husband and my four very healthy babies help me keep it together and have the perspective of how truly beautiful life is, even when it occasionally seems ugly. The luck and gratitude I feel that I am my babies' mommy, is wonderfully overwhelming and comforting. In your comments, please be kind. I'm feeling a bit fragile and I need support. I'm hoping, that by sharing this, I can contribute to raising awareness about this sensitive topic.

Rapper Boosie BadAzz faces drug and gun charges,edition.cnn.com,Kendall Trammell,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/entertainment/boosie-badazz-drug-gun-charges/index.html,"(CNN) Louisiana rapper Boosie BadAzz is facing multiple charges after police in Newnan, Georgia, said they found a gun, marijuana and more than $20,000 in his car during a traffic stop.
The 36-year-old was driving a Dodge Charger down a main thoroughfare in the city, an Atlanta suburb, when he left his lane and almost struck another vehicle Monday afternoon, according to an incident report. When a Coweta County sheriff's deputy turned on his blue lights to pull him over, the rapper maintained his speed and passed the entrances to three businesses where he could have pulled over, the report said. The deputy noticed the driver and passenger -- Antonio Allen, whom the rapper described as his bodyguard -- were moving around a lot and called for a city police officer to back him up, the report said. Police say they found $20,160 in cash, drugs and a gun in the rapper's car. After following the Charger into the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant, the deputy exited his vehicle and ""noticed the odor of green, raw marijuana,"" he said. The rapper didn't have his license on him, he told the deputy, who noticed Allen was keeping his hand between the passenger door and seat. The deputy requested Allen's identification and handed Boosie a notepad on which to write down his name and birthdate. Read More ""I then noticed a faint sound of metal hitting metal, and the passenger moving again,"" the deputy wrote in the incident report. Newnan police arrived, and the deputy asked the rapper to step out of the car, at which point Allen said something about having a gun, the report said. The deputy told Allen to raise his hands in the air and placed Boosie in handcuffs. The ""Wipe Me Down"" rapper told the deputy that Allen had the weapon because he was the performer's security. The Newnan officers found the gun on the passenger-side floorboard, the report said. After putting the rapper in his squad car, the deputy noticed the gun and a bag containing a green, leafy substance that smelled like cannabis, according to the report. He also found a vaping device that he believed to contain THC oil, the deputy said. THC is the primary psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. The Louisiana rapper was reportedly released on a $3,500 bail. A black bag that Boosie put in his lap after the traffic stop contained two bundles of $100 bills in black rubber bands and three $20 bills, the report said. Investigators later tallied the cash at $20,160, according to the report. Officers also found three framed sports jerseys in the trunk. En route to the station, Boosie told the deputy that a friend had given them the gun for protection and the friend would be happy to show up in person and claim it, but the deputy told the rapper police would not be releasing the gun, the report said. The Baton Rouge musician was charged with marijuana possession, possession of THC and possession of a firearm during a felony. He appeared in court Tuesday in Coweta County and was given a $3,500 bail. He has been released from jail, according to CNN affiliate WSB in Atlanta. His attorney, Drew Findling, told CNN that the legal team had not yet had a chance to evaluate the evidence but would conduct its own investigation and move forward with his defense. The rapper has no set court date, he said."
Telephone CPR could save lives. States are starting to require 911 operators to be trained for it,us.cnn.com,Michelle Lou and Brandon Griggs,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/telephone-cpr-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) When someone calls 911, the time it takes for paramedics to arrive can be the difference between life and death.
Minnesota lawmaker Julie Sandstede knows this. She represents a rural area, where ambulances may take longer to arrive on the scene of a medical emergency. When her husband experienced cardiac arrest in 2011, the dispatcher sent the ambulance the wrong way. Luckily, he was saved by a bystander who performed CPR on him under the guidance of a 911 operator. ""(The operator) was able to assess the situation and give direction to what intervention was needed,"" Sandstede said. ""We were so fortunate."" Her husband, Evan Sandstede, was lucky to have an operator who knew how to walk someone through CPR. But that's not always the case. Read More Heart attacks: What you should know ""When I learned that not all 911 operators are trained in how to instruct CPR over the phone, I couldn't believe it,"" Sandstede said. ""I was shocked. ... This is unconscionable."" This legislative session, the Democratic lawmaker has proposed legislation in Minnesota that would require all 911 operators to be trained in telephone CPR. Telephone CPR is the process in which a 911 operator helps the caller identify cardiac arrest with a short script and provides ""just-in-time"" instructions on how to provide CPR, said Dr. Michael Kurz, chairman of the American Heart Association's Telecommunicator-CPR Task Force. Sandstede proposed the bill after she was approached by the American Heart Association, which has been lobbying for these kinds of laws nationwide. At least six states already require telephone CPR At least six states already require 911 operators to be trained in telephone CPR, according to the American Heart Association. They are Louisiana, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Indiana, West Virginia and Maryland. However, the American Heart Association has been lobbying for all states to adopt telephone CPR requirements. The organization said it would be a cost-effective way to increase the survival rates of people who experience cardiac arrest outside a hospital. Widespread implementation of telephone CPR would include three to four hours of initial training and a yearly refresher, said Kurz. ""When we talk about public health interventions, this is a relatively low-cost, very high-yield way to improve public health,"" he said. Sandstede said her bill is modeled after Wisconsin's law , which was enacted in 2018 and set aside $250,000 for telephone CPR training. Telephone CPR could increase survival rates About 350,000 sudden cardiac-arrest events occur in the United States each year, and survival rates nationwide average about 10%, Kurz said. A 2018 Cleveland Clinic survey found that 54% of Americans say they know how to perform CPR. However, only 11% of respondents knew the correct pace for performing the chest compressions, the survey found. Having a bystander provide CPR before paramedics arrive on the scene can double or even triple the rate of survival, Kurz said. Telephone CPR-trained 911 operators can identify whether someone is going into cardiac arrest with two questions, and can provide CPR instructions in about 20 seconds. Heart attacks are on the rise among young women, study shows ""The public largely assumes that if you call 911, you'll receive instructions on whatever the medical emergency is,"" Kurz added. ""In reality, we know that there's a very large disconnect."" Some people think that telephone CPR is equivalent to practicing medicine and only physicians who are licensed should do that. However, Kurz said that is a misconception that is hindering public health."
Pentagon awards nearly $1 billion in emergency funds to build Trump's border wall - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Ryan Browne,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/pentagon-awards-funds-border-wall/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Defense Department announced Tuesday that it had awarded $976 million in contracts to build President Donald Trump's much-sought-after border wall with a completion date for these projects of October 2020.
A $789 million contract was awarded to the Texas-based company SLSCO Ltd. for the construction of border wall in Santa Teresa, New Mexico which is located in the El Paso sector of the border. A second $187 million contract was awarded to the Montana-based Barnard Construction Company for work in Yuma, Arizona. The contracts were awarded by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, a spokesman for the Department of Defense, told CNN that the El Paso sector contract would include the construction of ""30-foot bollard fencing and a five-foot anti-climb plate,"" and that the Yuma Sector project will feature ""18-foot bollard fencing and a five-foot anti-climb plate."" Read More A spokesperson for the Army Corps of Engineers told CNN last month that the plan was to install 46 miles at El Paso and 11 miles of fencing at Yuma. CNN has reported that DHS had asked the Pentagon for assistance replacing existing vehicle barriers with pedestrian fencing, as well as light installation in El Paso and Yuma. These are the first border wall contracts to use Pentagon funds that the Trump administration had repurposed from other Defense Department accounts to support the border wall. CNN previously reported that the contract award was expected as early as Tuesday. The funds for the contracts are to come from the $1 billion that was recently reprogrammed from Army personnel accounts into the 284 counter-drug account that authorizes border barrier construction. That reprogramming has been opposed by some lawmakers in Congress, but the Pentagon has said it does not need congressional approval to shift the funds. As a consequence of the move, Congress has threatened to strip the Pentagon of its ability to transfer funds in the future. Officials had previously told CNN that if the contracts were awarded in mid-April, construction could begin by late May, depending on whether the Department of Homeland Security issues environmental waivers, which is sometimes done to expedite construction. The administration has previously said it plans to shift an additional $1.5 billion in Pentagon funds toward wall construction at some point. That money is separate from the $3.6 billion in military construction funds that the Trump administration has sought to tap into to fund the wall via a national emergency declaration."

Democrats prepare their response to Barr's redacted report - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Jeremy Herb,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/democratic-response-redacted-mueller-report/index.html,"(CNN) House Democrats are prepping a swift response to Attorney General William Barr's plans to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report within the next week , after Barr's first public comments Tuesday did little to quell the Democratic anger over Barr's rollout of the special counsel probe.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler is preparing to ""very quickly"" subpoena the Justice Department and go to court seeking to obtain grand jury information, while House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff says he's made a formal request to obtain the counterintelligence information from Mueller's investigation to learn whether the President is ""compromised"" in any way. ""I think that's a betrayal to what he promised during his confirmation,"" Schiff told CNN, referring to Barr's refusal so far to not provide Congress with the full report and underlying evidence. ""But it's what he was hired to do, which is to protect the President. The President wanted his own Roy Cohn and apparently he got one. But it is deeply concerning."" The multi-pronged approach is the clearest sign yet that Barr's release of a redacted report will not stop the brewing showdown between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the 22-month special counsel investigation. The fight is almost assuredly going to wind up in court as Democrats seek to pry material from the Mueller investigation out of the Justice Department beyond what Barr says he will provide. Barr laid down his marker at a Tuesday budget hearing, his first appearance before Congress since Mueller's investigation wrapped last month. Barr said he was working to make as much information public as possible and that he would work with Nadler if he sought additional material. Read More But he drew the line at providing the full report or grand jury material. ""I don't intend at this stage to send the full, unredacted report to the committee,"" Barr told a House Appropriations subcommittee. ""Until someone shows me a provision"" permitting the release of grand jury material, Barr added, ""Congress doesn't get"" that material. In response, Nadler said he expected to issue the subpoena, which the committee authorized last week for the report and underlying materials, once Barr releases the report. ""I assume we will get the redacted report within a week. When we do so, if we don't get everything, we will issue the subpoena and go to court,"" the New York Democrat said, adding that the subpoena was likely to come ""very quickly."" 4 key takeaways from William Barr's testimony on the Mueller report But that's not the only effort underway in Congress to obtain the information from the Mueller report. Schiff said Tuesday that he had made a formal request for his committee to obtain the counterintelligence materials from Mueller's investigation. ""We have made a formal request for all of the information and findings in the counterintelligence investigation, as they're required to provide us under the National Security Act of 1947,"" the California Democrat said. ""Our priority at the moment has been to make sure this report is made public, and make as much of the report public as possible, but we will be following through to make sure we get the counterintelligence information that they're obligated to provide."" A committee aide said the request was made in the last few weeks. The request to the Justice Department, Schiff said, would fall under a grand jury exemption for material related to counterintelligence matters, and Schiff didn't rule out using a subpoena if necessary. ""We have an independent basis to want the counterintelligence information, after all of this began as a counterintelligence investigation, to determine, to find out whether the President or people in his campaign had been compromised in any way by a foreign power,"" Schiff said. ""That means giving us classified information, that means giving us grand jury information."" Schiff's comments suggesting that President or his team could be compromised have been criticized by Republicans in the wake of Mueller's investigation wrapping. The Republicans on the Intelligence Committee cited Barr's summary stating that Mueller's probe did not establish a criminal conspiracy to jointly call for Schiff's resignation as chairman last month. Republican fury aimed at Schiff, face of the Russia investigation Still, at Tuesday's hearing Barr appeared more open to the notion of providing classified material to Congress. ""I could envision a situation where under appropriate safeguards, that information would be shared,"" Barr said. Barr had a very different reaction about grand jury material, arguing there was nothing in the special counsel regulations that states it should be provided to Congress. And in a dig at Nadler, Barr also noted in his testimony that the current special counsel regulations, which make the report confidential, were written after the Ken Starr investigating into President Bill Clinton. ""Many of the people who are right now calling for the release of this report were basically castigating Ken Starr and others for releasing the Starr report,"" Barr said, echoing President Donald Trump's criticism of Nadler. Democrats had their own criticisms of Barr's comments in Tuesday's hearing, particularly his decision not to respond to questions on whether the White House had been briefed on the Mueller report. ""It was clear to me that the attorney general felt that he was an appointee of the President of the United States of America, and it's very hard for me to believe that he didn't make any changes or additions based on any suggestions that might have come from the White House,"" said House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat. Asked why he was waiting for Barr to release his report before issuing a subpoena -- given the attorney general's comments about the unredacted report -- Nadler said his committee wanted to show the courts ""we're making every effort to accommodate"" the Justice Department. Republicans have criticized Democrats' efforts to obtain additional materials from the Mueller report, accusing them of an unwillingness to accept the results of Mueller's investigation and arguing there's no precedent for Nadler to seek grand jury material unless he launches impeachment proceedings. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday that Congress shouldn't be given the unredacted Mueller report because it would leak. ""Do you think they would keep a secret? No. We would harm people,"" the California Republican said Tuesday. ""I'm sure they'll keep a secret -- the problem is the people they tell wouldn't be able to keep a secret."" Nadler has argued that Congress is entitled to grand jury information, citing previous cases that include the Clinton and Watergate investigations. Asked whether those were different because they were part of formal impeachment proceedings, Nadler said the court has also allowed material to be provided in cases that are ""preparatory to a judicial proceeding."" ""An impeachment inquiry is a judicial proceeding, or has been considered in the past,"" Nadler said. ""And certainly an inquiry which may help you determine whether or not to initiate an impeachment is preparatory to that."" This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday."
Bonnie Haim: Trial begins for man accused of killing his wife in 1993 cold case - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/bonnie-michael-haim-trial/index.html,"(CNN) When Aaron Fraser began excavating behind his childhood home in Jacksonville, Florida, as part of a renovation in 2014, he made a gruesome discovery: human remains.
They were the skull and bones of his mother, Bonnie Haim, who had gone missing in January 1993 and whose body had not been found. Prosecutors say that discovery led officials to arrest her then-husband, Michael Haim, and charge him with second-degree murder. ""The truth was always out there, buried in their backyard,"" Assistant State Attorney Alan Mizrahi said in opening statements in the murder trial on Tuesday. Michael and Bonnie Haim had been having marital problems, and he has long been a prime suspect in the case, his defense attorney Janis Warren said in her opening remarks. Read More But he has maintained his innocence since her disappearance. In an interview with CNN affiliate WJXT shortly after Bonnie Haim disappeared in 1993, Michael Haim said she left their home on the night of January 6 after a relationship issue. ""Basically she just wasn't happy and she wanted to leave, and I couldn't stop her from leaving,"" he told WJXT . Michael Haim is accused of killing his wife, Bonnie Haim, in 1993. Warren said prosecutors did not have enough evidence to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ""We agree she's dead. We agree that's her body in the backyard. But they have to prove to you that he did it,"" she said. ""When you listen to the evidence, ladies and gentlemen, and when you're finished, you're gonna see the lack of evidence in this case far outweighs any evidence they brought you."" The childhood memories of Fraser, who was 3 when his mother disappeared, are expected to be a major part of the case against Michael Haim, CNN affiliate WJXT reported . After his mother disappeared, he told a child welfare worker at the time, ""Daddy hurt Mommy,"" WJXT reported. ""Aaron also stated that 'Daddy shot Mommy' and 'My daddy could not wake her up,'"" a 2015 arrest affidavit said, according to WJXT . Opening statements in the trial Bonnie Haim's remains were found under a shower pallet in the home's backyard, Mizrahi said. A .22-caliber shell was also found near the body, he said, and Michael Haim owned a .22-caliber rifle. Although a medical examiner could not affirmatively determine how she was killed, Mizrahi argued that Michael Haim shot her and then buried her there in 1993. ""The defendant's actions before the killing and after the killing demonstrate his depraved indifference to Bonnie Haim's life,"" he said. Investigators had searched the property several times in the years after her disappearance, but did not find her remains until Fraser's discovery two decades later. ""That was the piece of the puzzle that we really felt we were missing,"" Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Director Mike Bruno told WJXT in 2015. ""There are so many unsolved or cold cases that are in this same situation of we just need that one clue, that one tip, that one piece. Here, we were able to get it, and to start that piece of closure."" Warren, Haim's attorney, said on Tuesday that prosecutors would not be able to prove that he killed her and placed her body there on the night she disappeared. ""The only thing that's important is: Can they prove he killed her? And can they prove he put the body in the yard? There's no evidence of either one of those,"" she added."
Why do so many Native American women go missing? Congress now aiming to find out - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Scott McLean,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/native-american-murdered-missing-women/index.html,"(CNN) Moments after Alyssa McLemore called 911 and asked for help on April 9, 2009, the line went dead.
Authorities were unable to trace the exact call location and never reached her. Police in the Seattle suburb of Kent showed up at the 21-year-old's door to see if she was there. She wasn't. Days later McLemore missed her own mother's funeral, and she's missed every family gathering since. McLemore, who would be 31 today, is one of the thousands of Native American women who go missing or are victims of violence every year, both on reservations and in cities. It is a problem so pervasive that, in some places, Native American women are more than 10 times more likely than the rest of the population to be murdered, according to a Department of Justice-funded study by researchers at the University of Delaware and the University of North Carolina Wilmington. That stunning statistic is more than a decade old, but the issue of missing and murdered women is much older than that. One estimate from the National Crime Information Center shows 5,712 reports of missing Native American women in 2016 alone -- yet reliable, comprehensive data on the problem is still almost impossible to come by. Read More Alaskan Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski is a member of a bipartisan group of lawmakers pushing two bills in the senate that aim to first understand the scope of the problem, and then figure out how to fix it. 'They wrote her off' Alyssa McLemore had her share of challenges in life. At 21, she was already raising a 3-year-old child and caring for her dying mother. A year before she went missing she was picked up on prostitution charges. ""I just kind of feel like they wrote her off as a prostitute and they probably [thought] that, you know, she didn't have family,"" said Tina Russell, McLemore's aunt. Alyssa McLemore disappeared in April 2009. Kent Police deny that McLemore's case was initially dismissed. It is still an open investigation, but there is precious little information to go on. Some 20 formal interviews were conducted after McLemore went missing. One witness told police she was seen getting into a 1990s model green truck, but police aren't even certain the sighting was the same day she went missing. Police have the 911 call -- but it's only about 10 seconds long. In it, you can hear distress in McLemore's voice, according to Detective Brendan Wales, who has had the case on his desk since 2011. He has a recording of the call in his car, and he plays it back sometimes in case one day he might notice something different, or significant. ""You never know what you could get from hearing something again and again and again,"" he said. Wales said the 911 call was only able to be traced to the cell tower it pinged off -- meaning McLemore could have been anywhere within a 2-mile radius of the tower. He has resubmitted the audio to the FBI to be reanalyzed and is also sending it to two outside analysts to see if any other voices can be heard. McLemore's family has not heard the tape, and Wales said they won't be able to while the case is open. Nonetheless, Russell is doing everything she can to keep warm a trail that has long gone cold -- organizing volunteers in the summer to search and hand out ""missing"" flyers. They even once found bones at the bottom of a steep ravine based on an unsolicited tip from a local psychic. Police testing showed they belonged to a deer. ""We're just stuck with those two tips. That's all we found out in 10 years,"" said Russell. On Sunday, about 50 people -- mostly friends and family -- gathered in a park in Kent to mark 10 years since McLemore went missing. It's been a long time, but Russell is optimistic that more public attention can lead to a break in the case. 'What are we missing here?' Russell beamed with excitement as she told the crowd about a secret announcement she's been waiting to tell them. McLemore's photo will soon be plastered on the side of large truck -- in hopes that it will jog someone's memory. A recent article in The Seattle Times undoubtedly helped, too. It's only the second time her name has appeared in the newspaper. A brief article appeared eight days after she disappeared in 2009. Until last year, Russell was naive to the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women. Offered support by an advocacy group dedicated to the cause, she was initially uncomfortable with the idea of helping only women of one particular race. But, when she heard how acute the problem was, specifically among Native Americans, she accepted. ""When you look at most of the people coming up missing that are white, most of the time there's so much immediate response and news coverage,"" Russell said. ""What are we missing here? What is happening with our native women that they are being victimized to the extent and the level that they are?"" Those are the questions Murkowski says she is trying to sort out. Some reservations have no police The ""Not Invisible Act,"" introduced last week, aims to get victims, tribal leaders, federal agencies and law enforcement to bring forward recommendations on what might work. That bill follows ""Savanna's Act,"" which was reintroduced in January. It is named for Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind, a pregnant woman killed in Fargo, North Dakota, in 2017. It aims to improve the collection of data on missing and murdered Native American women. Murkowski said many women disappear from remote reservations -- some that lack even a single police officer. Other times, cases get lost in a confusing web of jurisdictional conflicts between tribal, local and state police. She also worries that some victims are simply discounted because of their race or involvement in prostitution. ""Which makes no sense whatsoever and it doesn't mean that we should give up or that the system should not work to investigate, to find out where that woman has gone,"" she said. ""The resources are spread so thin, it allows people to fall through the cracks,"" said Billy J. Stratton, an expert in Native American studies at the University of Denver. Stratton thinks there ought to be more police resources on reservations, but said the broader problem goes much deeper than that. ""When you're talking about a group of people who is among the lowest socioeconomic class in the US, they're more susceptible to violence than others,"" he said. ""Poverty is the main driver; dispossession, lack of empowerment, isolation, and those other social problems I think flow from that."" 'It hardly gets talked about' Roxanne White is a Native American activist and a victim of sex-trafficking herself. Years ago, she had never even heard the term ""missing and murdered indigenous women."" ""But, did I know that violence against myself and other native women has been an issue? Yes. All my life,"" she said. In Canada, the problem is so acute that it sparked a national inquiry due to wrap up this month, but in the United States, ""It hardly gets talked about,"" said White. Washington state is one of the few exceptions. Lawmakers there have passed a new law requiring the state police to gather data on the number of missing and murdered Native women. The FBI has joined the investigation into the disappearance of Rosenda Strong. White's own cousin is among those who will be counted. Rosenda Strong went missing from the Yakama Reservation in October. Strong was last seen leaving the Legends Casino in Toppenish, Washington, on October 2 last year. Strong's sister Cissy Strong-Reyes said tribal police were initially dismissive of the disappearance because her sister used drugs. ""When I told the cops, they said, 'well, she's just probably partying, getting, you know, doing drugs,'"" she recalled. She's optimistic about the FBI's involvement after an agent first approached her in mid-October to tell her they were looking into her sister's case. The FBI said it's investigating at the request of the Yakama Tribal Police. Strong-Reyes is highly critical of the system of law enforcement on the reserve. She said tribal police are understaffed and largely unaccountable. State police, or the local non-native police typically have no jurisdiction to investigate on Yakama Nation land, unless the investigation involves a non-native person. ""People are getting killed, and it's swept under the rug,"" she said. ""To me out there, it's like the wild wild west."" The Yakama Nation Tribal Police declined to comment, referring calls to the Tribal Council and the FBI. The Tribal Council has so far not commented to CNN."
Five teens were arrested after a smoke bomb injured a cop and a bystander - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Theresa Waldrop and Melissa Alonso, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/colorado-smoke-bombs-teens-arrested/index.html,"(CNN) It was after midnight when police officer T. Grahn responded to a call about a makeshift barricade on a street in Arvada, Colorado, a community just northwest of Denver.
Street signs had been pulled out of the ground, and plastic wrap was strung across the road. Grahn noticed a small plastic bottle that looked like trash. Just then someone yelled, ""Hey, asshole,"" and ran away. Dominic Battista, one of the people who called the police about the roadblock, was helping Grahn clear the road when someone threw a plastic bottle about 15 yards away from them. The bottle ""started shrinking and releasing 'a ton' of white colored smoke,"" according to the Jefferson County arrest affidavit. Grahn walked toward the smoke bomb, began feeling nauseated, ""and the next thing he remembered was waking up to APD officers removing his uniform and attempting to provide him medical assistance."" Battista felt ""tightness and strain in his chest,"" and was treated, the affidavit said. Read More Officers responding to the attack found four more ""incendiary devices"" and a crumpled Walmart receipt for the chemicals in the bottles. Walmart surveillance led to the arrest of five teenagers on multiple charges: Maxwell McCann, Braiden Ulmer, Isaac Koch and Gavin Dawson were charged with assault, possession and use of explosives, among other things. A fifth teenager, who wasn't named because he is a juvenile, was also arrested and will be advised of charges later this week, the Jefferson County District Attorney's Office said. CNN is attempting to contact the public defenders assigned to represent the men. Police said Dawson eventually admitted the five teens made the bombs, saying ""they were just 'dickin' around with them,' and he would set the smoke bombs off in 'random places.'"" Police said McCann threw the bomb but told investigators that ""from his reading on the internet he felt the gas from the bombs was not very toxic or harmful."" The four are due back in court Friday, when formal charges will be filed, the district attorney's office said."
House Democrats divided over budget caps - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Lauren Fox,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/democrats-fight-budget-caps/index.html,"(CNN) Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives will postpone a vote on a budget caps bill that was potentially on tap for Wednesday, as progressive lawmakers continue to demand higher spending levels than leaders had proposed in the bill.
The intraparty debate exposes the Democrats' first big policy rift in their new majority. House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth said the House is no longer set to vote on the bill Wednesday, and he argued the party is just experiencing growing pains, with so many members who have never been in the majority before and have never had to govern. ""I don't think we'd have the votes if we went to the floor right now,"" the Kentucky Democrat said. ""It's not going to come up this week."" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, also confirmed to CNN that the vote would not be held Wednesday. Read More Rep. Mark Pocan, a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, has largely praised the way Democratic leaders, like Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, have managed the caucus. But Pocan said this issue was different: ""Oddly, we weren't really heard in a way that we felt we needed to be."" ""I think the lesson learned is be as inclusive as possible, especially with large caucuses,"" the Wisconsin Democrat said. The negotiation is intended to be an opening offer for Democrats in the House as they begin the long budget fight with the Republican-controlled Senate and White House. Disagreements within the Democratic ranks would be a bad start and signal a lack of unity as party leaders are forced to negotiate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday afternoon that he and Pelosi had agreed to start talks at the staff level for a two-year deal to raise the spending caps. ""So I am hoping this will be the beginning of a bipartisan agreement, which would be necessary to have an orderly appropriations process not only this year but next year as well,"" the Kentucky Republican told reporters. The future of the House bill became increasingly unclear Tuesday morning after Democrats debated it in a closed-door meeting. ""With no Republican votes, we can only lose 17 votes on anything,"" Yarmuth said Tuesday morning. ""So, obviously, any caucus can bring down anything on any bill. We have to figure out if we are going to be able to govern or not. This is our first test of it."" Yarmuth said that if Democrats can't agree among themselves, it ""minimizes our leverage"" in negotiations with the Senate and the White House. Hoyer rejected the idea later that Democratic infighting on spending gives Republicans more leverage. ""No, I don't think it gives them any more or less leverage. They have leverage,"" he said. ""We have to come to an agreement."" The division over the budget caps among Democrats resembles years' worth of fights that Republicans had with members of the tea party and the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Yarmuth joked that ""it's like looking in the mirror."" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the other co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and a leading voice in the fight to increase domestic spending in the caps deal, circulated a letter urging her colleagues to support the progressive effort. In it, the Washington state Democrat called for support of an amendment to increase non-defense discretionary spending caps by an additional $33 billion for the next fiscal year to ""ensure that base levels of defense and non-defense discretionary (NDD) spending are equivalent."" ""Because Congress has not adequately funded NDD priorities, many programs that families rely on are under-resourced,"" wrote Jayapal, along with a handful of other progressive members including Pocan and Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Adam Smith of Washington state. They added later in the letter, ""National security requires critical investments at home too."" Hoyer stressed to reporters earlier Tuesday that Democratic priorities will be laid out in their appropriations bills this summer."
New osteoporosis drug gets FDA approval,us.cnn.com,Jacqueline Howard,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/osteoporosis-drug-evenity-fda-bn/index.html,"(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration has approved a new treatment for osteoporosis in postmenopausal women who are at high risk of bone fractures.
The FDA announced Tuesday that the drug, called romosozumab, which has the brand name Evenity, works mainly by boosting bone formation and is approved to treat osteoporosis in women with a history of osteoporotic fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture, or those who have not benefited from other types of osteoporosis therapies. ""Today's approval provides women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who are at high risk of fracture with a new treatment that will reduce this risk,"" Dr. Hylton V. Joffe, director of the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's Division of Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Products, said in the announcement. ""But Evenity may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death so it's important to carefully select patients for this therapy, which includes avoiding use in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the previous year,"" he said. Experts streamline guidelines for treating osteoporosis The drug was developed by the pharmaceutical companies Amgen and UCB, which worked together on development since 2004. Read More It is expected to be available from select wholesalers in the United States for physicians to order in about a week, at which time the price will be made publicly available, Amgen spokeswoman Kristen Davis wrote in an email Tuesday. The FDA noted that one dose of Evenity is administered as two back-to-back injections given once a month by a health care professional. No more than 12 doses should be used, so if treatment is still needed after 12 months, other types are encouraged. ""The FDA approval of Evenity represents an important therapeutic development for patients who need a medicine that can rapidly increase bone mineral density and help reduce the risk of future fractures within 12 months,"" Dr. David M. Reese, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen, said in a news release Tuesday. ""Postmenopausal osteoporosis is a significant women's health issue that far too often gets overlooked. As a leader in bone health with more than 20 years of osteoporosis research experience, Amgen is as committed as ever to combatting this disease to help women at high risk for fracture reduce their risk of a first and subsequent fracture,"" he said.
The safety and efficacy of Evenity were tested in two clinical trials involving more than 11,000 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, according to the FDA. Although the trials found the drug to be effective in lowering the risk of a new fracture, the agency noted that there were some side effects, including an increased risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke. The drug packaging comes with a ""boxed warning"" stating those risks and that the treatment should not be used in patients who have had a heart attack or stroke within the previous year. Other side effects of Evenity include joint pain and headache, and possible reactions or discomfort at the injection sites. Osteoporosis is a disease that involves low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, leading to an increased risk of bone fractures, such as those of the hip, spine and wrist. Of the estimated 10 million people in the United States with osteoporosis, more than 80% are thought to be women ."
Try not to sneeze. These photos show a 'pollenpocalypse' in North Carolina,us.cnn.com,Ryan Prior,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/north-carolina-pollen-photograph-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) #ThePollening. It sounds like an M. Night Shyamalan horror film.
If you suffer from pollen allergies, just looking at the above photo may make you want to choke. It was taken Monday by photographer Jeremy Gilchrist, who used a drone to snap aerial pictures of the yellowish green haze blanketing Durham, North Carolina. The pollen wasn't just coating cars and patio chairs -- it was hanging thick in the air. He called it #pollenpocalypse. Gilchrist told CNN he was driving around when he noticed a green cloud in the air. Read More ""It was surprising to see it up that high,"" he said. He's seen pollen shrouds like this before in North Carolina, but from the ground it's difficult to capture their sheer magnitude. So he sent up his drone to a get a better vantage point. The photos look almost like they've been filtered on Instagram. But Gilchrist says he only lightly edited them before posting them to social media. Seen from the drone's perspective they looked ""pretty dull,"" he said, so he added contrast to bump the photos back to the levels usually apparent to the naked eye and resembling how the pollen cloud looked from the ground. Gilchrist, who has also worked as a meteorologist and storm chaser, said pollen can collect in high concentrations in the air like this depending on the amount of recent rain. Yesterday, which was ""breezy and dry,"" helped create the ideal conditions for pollen granules to congregate. He said thunderstorms hit two hours after the original photos were taken. The strong winds swept away the pollen in the air, and the downpour washed away much of the pollen that had settled on the ground. After Gilchrist took the photos, a thunderstorm set in, blowing the pollen cloud away. It's the highest pollen count in the area so far this year The official pollen count in Raleigh, North Carolina, about 20 miles away, was 1778.8 grains per cubic meter of air yesterday, according to North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality. That count is considered ""very high"" and tops the charts for the city so far this year. The pollen spike over the last week comes primarily from the area's trees, which include pine, oak, mulberry, birch and sweet gum. In the latest Weather Channel numbers Tuesday, Raleigh ranks fifth in the nation in pollen severity. Tulsa, Oklahoma, tops that list, followed by Waco, Texas; Springfield, New Jersey; and Georgetown, Texas. The Weather Channel classified the breathing-comfort level in Raleigh Tuesday as ""fair"" but said it would go down to ""poor"" on Wednesday. The haze this week isn't the worst ever recorded by scientists in Raleigh. In 2010, they recorded a count of 3,524 grains per cubic meter, nearly double the count this week, CNN affiliate WRAL reported . But the Raleigh-Durham area isn't typically known for being especially nightmarish for allergy sufferers. In its 2018 ""Allergy Capitals"" report, the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America ranked Durham 67th and Raleigh 92nd nationwide in allergy severity. Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the first name of photographer Jeremy Gilchrist."
Buttigieg is a symbol for a rising Christian left (opinion) - CNN,www.cnn.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/09/opinions/pete-buttigieg-mike-pence-erick-erickson-christian-progressives-graves-fitzsimmons/index.html,"Buttigieg is a symbol for a rising Christian left By Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons Updated 4:15 PM EDT, Tue April 09, 2019 Editor's Note: (Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons is a progressive Christian writer and activist. He is the founder of The Resistance Prays , a daily devotional aimed at spiritually and politically defeating Trumpism. Follow him on Twitter @GuthrieGF . The views expressed here are the author's. View more opinion on CNN.)
(CNN) I don't think my closeted teen self would've believed the last few weeks of Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign could have happened. But I've watched in awe as it has unfolded.
My gratitude and amazement gave way to a different set of emotions this week when conservative provocateur Erick Erickson started attacking Buttigieg , implying that because Buttigieg is Episcopalian -- a denomination known for its more progressive positions on social issues -- ""he might not actually understand Christianity more than superficially."" Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons
This is a common trope among some evangelical Christians on the right, impugning other more liberal Christians as somehow less ""real"" or authentic in their faith.
Full-on rage set in when Erickson followed up his tweet with a blog post arguing that while Trump is morally problematic, Buttigieg is ""no better a Christian than Donald Trump"" because he's gay. ""This is why progressive Christianity is so corrupt and flawed. As much as Buttigieg makes a valid critique on the President's behavior and evangelicals excusing that behavior, Buttigieg wants to reject the inconvenient parts of faith he does not like,"" said Erickson, referring to Buttigieg's positions on homosexuality and abortion. ""He wants to have it both ways and in reality is showing he is no better a Christian than Donald Trump. ""
Progressives all over the country are challenging the fundamentalists' strangehold on what it means to be Christian. And in Buttigieg, we have an amazing role model whose mere existence as a gay Christian running for president inspires me. Buttigieg has leaned into his faith, giving interviews about his religious beliefs and appearing to incorporating it into his stump speech. Pete Buttigieg on faith, his marriage and Mike Pence
""My marriage to Chasten has made me a better man. And yes, Mr. Vice President, it has moved me closer to God,"" Buttigieg said on Sunday of the former Indiana governor while speaking at the LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington. ""That's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand: That if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me. Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.""
Those words hit especially close to home as I prepare to get married myself this June. My fiancé, one of the first gay people to be ordained in the Presbyterian Church (USA), and I will gather with family and friends at Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary for a wedding ceremony presided over by a United Church of Christ minister currently serving on staff at Highland Baptist Church.
The ceremony will take place just months after an openly gay Episcopalian man announces his run for president. What an amazing moment to witness God's love and justice expanding before our very eyes across the many branches of the Jesus movement and across the entire United States.
""When I think about where most of Scripture points me, it is toward defending the poor, and the immigrant, and the stranger, and the prisoner, and the outcast, and those who are left behind by the way society works,"" Buttigieg told CNN and USA Today commentator Kirsten Powers.
He's also highlighted how he ""wanted to be married in the church"" and was glad the Episcopal Church had embraced same-sex marriage so he could get married in his own church. Karen and Mike Pence's astonishing moral hypocrisy
""It's unusual for Democratic presidential candidates to talk about faith as often as Buttigieg does,"" one report noted . ""It's groundbreaking that he uses his marriage to another man to illustrate his personal relationship with God.""
Let's address Erickson's wrong-headed comparison of Buttigieg and Trump head-on. The president is a racist, misogynist, thrice-married, anti-immigrant, wealth-obsessed braggart who is credibly accused of (though has denied) sexually harassing and groping women and claims he's never sought forgiveness in his entire life. How can all of that be outweighed by Buttigieg being gay?
Even if you disagree with the idea that LGBTQ people are born equal in rights and dignity, putting Buttigieg in the same moral time zone as Trump would get you flunked out of any second-grade Sunday School class.
I'm happy to report that when the rage subsided, I could see the attack on Buttigieg revealed something encouraging at the same time: Conservatives and fundamentalists are noticing progressive Christians. That's a sign of our growing influence and visibility. Christianity's future looks more like Lady Gaga than Mike Pence
There's a growing push toward LGBTQ inclusion across the many strands of American Christendom. Fundamentalists are worried, and worried people make outlandish attacks like Erickson's. Even the Mormon Church is taking steps toward greater LGBTQ inclusion.
And progressive Christians are becoming more vocal in other ways , including the revival of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Poor People's Campaign by the Rev. Dr. William Barber II to the Nuns on the Bus and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's writing about how her faith informs the need for criminal justice reform.
""Nearly 40 years after some prominent evangelical Christians organized a Moral Majority movement to promote a conservative political agenda,"" NPR reported, ""a comparable effort by liberal religious leaders is coalescing in support of immigrant rights, universal health care, LGBTQ rights and racial justice.""
I served communion on Sunday at Highland Baptist Church in Louisville, which is one of my routine duties as a deacon. But this Sunday in particular, the significance of being able to serve in this role as a gay man really hit me in the moments before the service began. A deep sense of gratitude, joy and peace overcame me : for my faith community embracing same-sex marriage in 2014, for all the LGBTQ people who came before me and helped bend the moral arc of the universe, and for the many people of faith who remain in discriminatory communities but are pushing them toward equality from within.
I believe my marriage, like Pete Buttigieg's and his husband's, will move me closer to God and I believe the rise of progressive Christians is pushing the entire church closer to God as well. "
