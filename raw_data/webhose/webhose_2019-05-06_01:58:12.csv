Rather saw the Zapruder film and then blatantly lied to the American people about what he saw. Keep in mind, back then, they had 3 channels. Now, you know how a hick beat reporter becomes the face of a network.

Abril 6,2019.- El Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja (CICR) anunció una visita a Venezuela de su presidente, Peter Maurer, del 6 al 10 de abril.
Maurer “conversará con personas necesitadas y con personas afectadas por la violencia armada”, dijo el Comité en un comunicado, en el que expresó su preocupación por “el grave impacto que la situación actual tiene en los venezolanos, sobre todo en quienes carecen de acceso a los servicios básicos”.
Durante la visita, Maurer reafirmará el compromiso del CICR con el pueblo de Venezuela, tras el alto nivel de operaciones de la organización en el país. Arriving into Caracas today to start my visit to #Venezuela . @ICRC remains extremely concerned about the welfare of Venezuelans, with too many going without basic services. https://t.co/D3oYg98lk6

Al CICR le preocupa el grave impacto que la situación actual tiene en los venezolanos, en particular los que carecen de acceso a los servicios básicos, así como a los migrantes y sus familiares.

Abril 6,2019.- Dos diputados opositores que habían sido detenidos este sábado por militares durante una protesta en Maracaibo fueron liberados, anunció el presidente encargado Juan Guaidó.
“Acaban de liberar a los diputados que habían detenido, Nora Bracho y Renzo Prieto”, dijo Guaidó en un discurso ante miles de simpatizantes en el este de Caracas, unas dos horas después de que la diputada Adriana Pichardo informara de la detención.
Pichardo denunció también que las fuerzas de seguridad estatales actuaron “violando la inmunidad parlamentaria” de ambos dirigentes.
“Fui arrastrada por un funcionario y fui amedrentada (por) quien conducía esa tanqueta, adonde me montaron a empujones, (…) me insultaron y amenazaron con que me iban a golpear”, relató tras el incidente Bracho.
Las retenciones se produjeron en medio de protestas por los extensos apagones y la severa escasez de agua en el petrolero estado Zulia, fronterizo con Colombia.
Según Pichardo, “hay personas heridas de perdigón”.
“La represión fue brutal, desde el helicóptero lanzaron bombas lacrimógenas, mandaron tanquetas de la Guardia y luego que los militares reprimieron llegaron los colectivos (civiles armados)”, dijo a AFP la diputada Elimar Díaz, quien marchaba en Maracaibo.
Según Díaz, en la zona donde militares “estaban reprimiendo no había electricidad”.
“Los racionamientos son de 18 y 20 horas, son racionamientos inhumanos, pasamos incluso días sin energía”, remarcó la parlamentaria. “Lo que está viviendo el Zulia es un calvario y la respuesta de un régimen es la represión a un pueblo que tiene derecho a protestar”."
