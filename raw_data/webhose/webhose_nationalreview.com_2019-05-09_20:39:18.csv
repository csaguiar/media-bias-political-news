Shaun King’s False Accusations | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Michelle Malkin,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/shaun-king-activist-accusations/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM Shaun King (via Twitter) The activist accuses the innocent to stoke racial fears and shrugs off the results
T his week, “journalist, activist and humanitarian” Shaun King will give a keynote speech at the annual Innocence Network conference in Atlanta, Ga. The theme of the event, whose attendees work to prevent and undo wrongful convictions, is “The Presumption of Innocence.”
I’ve covered many flabbergasting things over the course of 25 years as a columnist, author, blogger and documentary host, but this one takes the cake. Advertisement Advertisement
It was just three months ago that King recklessly exploited the shooting death of 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes in Houston, Texas, to stoke racial fear and hatred. The little girl and her family, who are black, got caught in crossfire at a Walmart parking lot. The Black Lives Matter activist and columnist for the Intercept immediately pounced — using his huge Twitter platform, followed by 1.1 million people, to cast the incident as a racial hate crime. King splashed a photo of Robert Cantrell, a white man who had been arrested for robbery the same day as the Barnes shooting, all over social media.
“We’ve had 20 people call or email us and say he is a racist, violent a****le and always has been. Just tell me everything you know,” social-justice detective King incited on Twitter. Cantrell’s family members faced vitriol and death threats online as a result of the irresponsible gossip-mongering. After two black men were arrested for the murder, King sputtered to save his reputation — first by claiming credit for passing on a tip that led to the arrests (which he kept quiet about while stoking anti-white hatred), and then by doubling down with a fake-but-accurate defense.
“We live in a time where somebody could do something like this based purely on hate or race,” he smugly argued. “And that it turned out to not be the case I don’t think changes the devastating conclusion that people had thought something like that was possible.” Advertisement Advertisement
There’s nothing “humanitarian” or exemplary about such an attitude. This is race-hustling cynicism at its worst. It’s par for the twisted course for King, who is a serial apologist for treating people as guilty until proven innocent and for threatening those who call him out (including critics within the progressive Left who have alleged he has ripped off the movement).
In May 2018, the Lying King led the witch hunt against innocent white Texas state trooper Daniel Hubbard by spreading the false claims of a black woman who lied about Hubbard raping her during a traffic stop. That admitted liar, Sherita Dixon-Cole, escaped prosecution based on a technicality. King’s reward? Moving up from the New York Daily News to a coveted position at the Harvard-affiliated Fair Punishment Project, which in part conducts research to prevent more wrongful convictions.
In 2014, King promoted the anti-cop “hands up, don’t shoot” lie debunked by none other than the Obama Justice Department, yet he still doesn’t care about the truth. “I’m not going to parse evidence or make some complex technical argument that Michael Brown did or didn’t have his hands up,” he defiantly retorted. “To me, it doesn’t matter if he did or he didn’t. It never has.” Advertisement
As former New York City police detective Sergeant John Paolucci, who is on the board of Uncuff the Innocent, which advocates for wrongfully convicted police officers, told me: “When the agenda is to instill in people a fear of the police, one creates an environment conducive to more deadly confrontations. . . . Having worked the most high-profile police involved cases in the media, I’m well aware that the whole truth is never reported in these investigations and the probative value of evidence that favors the police is diminished or omitted entirely when it hits the news.” Advertisement
In 2015, King gloried in the wrongful rape convictions of former Oklahoma City police officer Daniel Holtzclaw, whose flawed case and forensic errors led six internationally renowned scientists to call for a retrial. He has failed to follow up because, of course, the truth doesn’t fit his narrative. Advertisement
The “journalist” also maintained the same obstinate stance after his disgraceful sliming of football star Peyton Manning in 2016, when he attempted to ride the #MeToo publicity wave by recycling — and woefully misinterpreting — a 13-year-old court filing regarding a settlement with a female trainer who had claimed she was sexually harassed, and then changed her story seven years later. Instead of admitting error, he played victim.
It’s disturbing enough that King is being honored at the Innocence Conference, where many lawyers, activists, scientists and exonerees I admire will attend. Even worse, King heads up a publication called The North Star , which purports to “speak truth to power” and is aimed at young people of color.
Wrongfully convicted Marine Tim Wright and his wife, Danielle, wonder: “How can an individual with a reputation of making countless false accusations against white men, racially profiling whites and stirring up racial discourse in America be trusted with the hearts and minds of future generations of minority children?” Advertisement"
Facebook Advocates Governments Regulate Online Speech | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Brendan Carr,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/facebook-advocates-government-regulation-online-speech/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies on Capitol Hill in April 2018. (Leah Millis/Reuters) Its founder wants the government to regulate and police online speech.
F acebook is under mounting scrutiny for its approach to moderating online speech. Lawmakers and the public alike have serious questions about the decisions Facebook chooses to make about the things you can say and the posts you can see on its platform. Some of those questions will likely be asked this week by the Senate Judiciary Committee when it holds a hearing on technology companies and free speech. Advertisement Advertisement
So with this increased focus on Facebook’s decisions, the social-media giant is taking a new approach. Last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called for the government to police your speech instead of having Facebook do it. He wants governments around the world to adopt rules that would determine what types of speech are and are not allowed online. Unfortunately for his plan, government censorship isn’t just a bad idea; in America, at least, it would violate the First Amendment.
Now, Facebook may see this as a convenient way of passing the buck. Or perhaps it wants to divert attention from calls to break up Big Tech. But none of that justifies Facebook’s decision to surrender our First Amendment rights as tribute.
In my experience as a commissioner at the Federal Communications Commission, large corporations do not call for greater government control as an act of charity. They do it to solidify their positions in the market and insulate themselves from competition. Facebook already employs 30,000 people to perform “content and security review,” and they have an army of lawyers and lobbyists ready to navigate costly new regulations. Startups and would-be competitors do not have those resources. So the rules Facebook wants would operate as an economic moat, insulating it from upstart players. It’s no surprise, then, that Facebook waited until after it established a leading position and a market capitalization of half a trillion dollars before finding religion in regulation. Advertisement
This marriage of Big Tech and Big Brother would represent a sweeping new intrusion on our First Amendment rights. The online speech czar that Facebook proposes wouldn’t just target illegal content. Instead, Facebook would have the government police what it calls “harmful content”—a broad category of speech that is fully protected by the First Amendment. What is harmful content? Would a robust defense of Second Amendment rights cross the line? Facebook wants politicians to decide. And there’s certainly no shortage of regimes around the world that would welcome the chance to shut down political speech or free expression on the grounds that it represents “harmful content.” Quite simply, Facebook’s plan is an invitation for governments worldwide to silence unpopular ideas. Advertisement
After the op-ed ran, one Facebook official tried to walk back the proposal, saying that Zuckerberg only meant for foreign governments to regulate online speech. In the U.S., the official said, Facebook would set up an internal oversight board that would have binding authority to make decisions about speech that is and is not allowed. This is cold comfort when it comes to online freedom. It shows that Facebook is perfectly willing to join arm and arm with foreign governments to censor online speech, since that pesky First Amendment applies only in the U.S. But we should not geo-fence our commitment to free expression, and we should not bargain it away as a cost of doing business overseas. Advertisement
In any event, Zuckerberg largely rejected the walk-back in an interview later in the week with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos. In it, Zuckerberg issued a new and expanded call for the U.S. government itself to police online speech. It is time for our government to step in, Zuckerberg said, and regulate speech on “divisive political issues.” He cited as an example such hot-button issues as immigration. But that’s not the government’s role. In fact, there’s little more deeply rooted in the fabric of our country than the robust and free exchange of views on controversial issues. We should all want it to remain free from government regulation."
Attorney General Barr Says Mueller Report to Be Released within Week | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Andrew C. Mccarthy,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/attorney-general-barr-mueller-report-release/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM Attorney General William Barr testifies on Capitol Hill, April 9, 2019. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters) Don’t expect any major revelations, but do expect redactions.
I t is a credit to Attorney General Bill Barr that his testimony yesterday morning before a House Appropriations subcommittee seemed, for the most part, like a nonevent.
Ostensibly, the subject of the hearing was the Justice Department’s $29.2 billion budget request for fiscal year 2020. But because the hearing was the AG’s first appearance on Capitol Hill since his March 24 letter outlining the conclusions of the Mueller report, that topic — specifically, the frenzied anticipation of Barr’s release of a redacted version of the special counsel’s report (said to be 300 to 400 pages in length) — took center stage. Advertisement Advertisement
Democrats were loaded for bear, but Barr warded off their jabs, explaining the process by which the report is being reviewed and making some news along the way.
Here are the major takeaways.
The attorney general will release the Mueller report to Congress and the public within the next week. (Note that Congress is scheduled to take its two-week spring break starting Friday). Advertisement
The internal Justice Department review and redaction of the report continues to be a collaboration between the attorney general and the special counsel, and that process has gone smoothly.
When the report is released, the redactions will be color-coded so that readers will know the rationale for each excision: grand-jury material, classified information, ongoing investigation, or Justice Department privacy policy (apparently to be invoked on behalf of peripheral figures, not the main players). These categories of redaction were addressed in the attorney general’s March 29 letter . Advertisement
Barr will engage with congressional leaders on the redactions to determine whether there may and should be additional disclosure.
Once again, the attorney general explained that his March 24 letter was merely a synopsis of the special counsel’s bottom-line conclusions (along with an explanation of his own conclusion on the obstruction issue, on which Mueller opted not to make a prosecutorial judgment). Barr did not undertake to “summarize” the Mueller report, and assertions that he provided a misleading summary are unfounded. There will not be a summary of the report; there will be the report — excised as described above.
Special Counsel Mueller was given an opportunity to review the attorney general’s letter outlining the report’s conclusions but declined to do that. (I suspect that is because the report made those conclusions quite clear — and, on the matter of obstruction, made it clear that the special counsel presented evidence on both sides of the question but did not draw a conclusion. Mueller, who has known Barr for decades, had no reason to doubt that the conclusions would be accurately rendered.) Advertisement Advertisement
The Justice Department does not intend to seek a court order permitting disclosure of grand-jury material. As I pointed out in a column last Friday, in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Justice Department took the position that judges have no authority to disclose outside of the exceptions to grand-jury secrecy laid out in Rule 6(e) (Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure). Last Friday, in McKeever v. Barr , the court agreed with the Justice Department. The Rule 6(e) exceptions do not provide for disclosure to Congress. It would thus make no sense to seek a disclosure order.
The attorney general added that if House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) wants to argue that there is a legal basis for disclosure outside of Rule 6(e), he will hear the chairman out. (As I’ve pointed out, Congress enacted Rule 6(e) and could enact legislation amending it to permit disclosure of grand-jury material to Congress in special-counsel investigations.) Advertisement
Barr said that Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz’s inquiry into aspects of the Trump-Russia investigation (including alleged FISA abuse) will be released by June, and perhaps as early as May.
Importantly, the attorney general also stated that he is looking into the conduct of the Justice Department and the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation, including what triggered the probe’s initiation."
Women’s Suffrage: Women’s National Republican Club Tells the Story | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Marlo Safi,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/womens-suffrage-movement-republican-history-exhibit/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM Women’s National Republican Club founder Henrietta Wells Livermore (Bain News Service/Library of Congress) An exhibit at the Women’s National Republican Club in New York tells the story. A century ago next year, after several decades of resilient activism, women finally earned the right to vote. And in New York State, the final push for suffrage was launched in 1910 by one-woman juggernaut Henrietta Wells Livermore, who also founded the Women’s National Republican Club in 1921. This year, to commemorate the historic achievement, the club is featuring an exhibit titled “Women’s Suffrage and the Founding of The Women’s National Republican Club” in its Manhattan headquarters. The exhibit highlights the suffrage movement, the club’s role in educating women about politics and their newly gained right, and relics from the era, including a letter from President Calvin Coolidge. On February 14, 1910, twelve women met at Livermore’s home to revitalize the suffrage movement in New York State, and suffrage for New York’s women was passed in a statewide referendum in November 1917. To inform women of their newly gained right and the subjects they’d be voting on, she founded the Women’s National Republican Club in New York City in 1921. Today, it’s the oldest national club for Republican women in the country. The clubhouse itself is the third home of the club, built to accommodate its growing membership, and is located in the heart of Manhattan at the site of Andrew Carnegie’s former home at 3 West 51st Street. The building’s interior is distinguished and regal, and it hosts gala dinners, awards ceremonies, and other events for its members. One of its committees is the Henrietta Wells Livermore School of Politics, which continues to organize volunteers for political campaigns and sponsors political-education seminars and lectures. “Livermore decided that women needed to be educated so they could vote,” Judy McGrath, the exhibit curator, tells me as she guides me through it. “She was disappointed that there was very low female turnout in the first election that women could vote in, so she wanted to create a place where women could meet other women and become educated on the matters they’d be voting on.” The exhibit details the club’s history and the lives of its founders, who also include Pauline Sabin and Ruth Baker Pratt. Ruth Baker Pratt was the first female representative to be elected from New York (in 1928), and she said on Election Night that she “did not run as a woman but as a citizen.” Pauline Sabin was the first woman representative to the Republican National Committee and served as a delegate to two Republican National Conventions. She also played a significant role in the repeal of Prohibition. The exhibit also includes many relics, including a letter from GOP president Calvin Coolidge to the club commemorating its opening in 1924 and a 1902 letter from Susan B. Anthony. Coolidge was an ardent supporter of suffrage at a time when it was unpopular. Usually a walker of the party line, he went against his party’s orthodoxy, noting that women uniquely look to the future and “think of conditions not only for themselves but for their posterity.” Eventually, the Republican party became the first major party to advocate equal rights for women, and it wasn’t until the Republicans gained control of Congress in 1919 — after Democrats had defeated the 19th amendment four times — that the amendment passed. Twenty-six of the 36 states that ratified it had Republican legislatures. Maritza Bolano, a chairwoman on the Suffragette Committee and the editor of a forthcoming book detailing the suffrage movement and the founding of the club, emphasizes the importance of the Republican party’s role in suffrage. “The Republican party was the leader in women’s rights, as it had been the leader in abolition from Lincoln. The party leaders welcomed women and wanted women to participate.” The exhibit is open to club members and their guests, and Bolano tells me groups are encouraged to contact the club and arrange to view it. “It’s important that young people, especially, learn from this exhibit.”"
Does Beto O'Rourke Have the Right to Be Called 'Beto'? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jay Nordlinger,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/names-politics-beto-orourke/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM Beto O’Rourke speaks with supporters in Dubuque, Iowa, March 16, 2019. (Ben Brewer/Reuters) On ‘Beto,’ ‘Jimmy,’ ‘Pete,’ ‘Mitt,’ etc.
Editor’s Note : This piece is an expansion of an essay published in the current issue of National Review .
B eto O’Rourke, the ex-congressman from El Paso, has decided to run for president. He is being teased for jumping on counters, to talk to voters in diners. He is also being teased about his name: “Beto.” What’s he trying to get away with? He’s no Hispanic. He’s Robert Francis O’Rourke. Advertisement Advertisement
He is indeed. But from infancy, he has been called “Beto.” This is a Spanish nickname for “Roberto” (and for “Alberto” and for other names that end in “berto”). El Paso, home of the O’Rourkes (!), is a strongly Hispanic community.
Incidentally, El Paso is where Susana Martinez grew up. I’m talking about the Republican who was governor from 2011 to 2019 in neighboring New Mexico.
Moreover, Baby Beto had a grandfather named “Robert,” and the baby’s parents wanted to distinguish their new addition from him. So … Advertisement
Flash forward to college. Beto O’Rourke enrolled at Columbia in New York, and he tried going by “Robert” for a while. “I didn’t want to explain what ‘Beto’ is and how to pronounce it,” he told an interviewer last year. “I wanted to fit in, and ‘Beto’ doesn’t fit in. … There’s also a disconnect, right? There’s this tall white guy, and he’s ‘Beto.’”
Even so, the young man thought of himself as “Beto,” not “Robert,” and “Robert” soon went. Advertisement
Flash forward to last month, on St. Patrick’s Day. The Republican National Committee issued a tweet, showing O’Rourke’s mug shot. (He was arrested for drunk driving in 1998.) They put a leprechaun-style hat on his head and said, “On this St. Paddy’s Day, a special message from noted Irishman Robert Francis O’Rourke.” That message was “PLEASE DRINK RESPONSIBLY.”
P ersonally, I think people have a right to the name of their choice, pronounced the way they prefer. We could think of exceptions to this rule, as to most rules. But I think it is a rule. Advertisement
By the way, Beto O’Rourke pronounces his name “Bet-o” rather than “Bait-o.” It rhymes with “falsetto” rather than “Plato.”
Got time for a quick George Bush story? Good. I’m talking Bush 41. A speechwriter placed a quotation by Demosthenes — it might have been Thucydides — in some speech. Not wanting to stumble over pronunciation, the president said, simply, “Plato.” Probably no one was the wiser.
Back to the pronunciation of “Beto.” From the mouths of most Spanish-speakers, the name is pronounced somewhere between “Bet-o” and “Bait-o,” but closer to the former. This is hard for us Anglos to pull off. I have a memory, from long ago: Rita Moreno, the Broadway star, was trying to get Americans to say her name correctly. They said “Moraino,” to rhyme with “Drano” (the de-clogging product). She wanted her name to rhyme with “steno,” as in “pool.” Advertisement
Let’s move on …
In his language column, back in 1983, William Safire took up the question of names and their pronunciations. He wrote, “Your house may not be your castle, but your moniker is your property to pronounce the way you like and to correct others about.” He mentioned the case of Tony Dorsett, the football star.
When Dorsett was in college, we all said “DOR-sit.” When he got to the pros, he announced that he wanted his name pronounced “Dor-SETT.” I can tell you that I found it hard to adjust — but that’s what the guy wanted. (In truth, a lot of people called him “TD,” plain and simple. Those were his initials, and, more important, they stood for “touchdown.”)
Leonard Bernstein, the musician, said “Bernstine,” not “Bernsteen.” “You don’t say ‘Gertrude Steen,’” he explained. “And you don’t say ‘Albert Einsteen.’” There are Bernsteens in the world — plenty of them — but the musician preferred “Bernstine.” Advertisement
Okay — but I once worked with a man who insisted on calling him “Bernsteen.” It was a point of pride with him, somehow. He was stubborn about it. I think he thought Bernstein was trying to get away with something, or put on airs. And he wasn’t gonna let him …
R eturn, now, to Texas. Last year, Beto O’Rourke ran for the U.S. Senate, losing to the incumbent, Ted Cruz. Ted’s full name is “Rafael Edward Cruz.” (His father came from Cuba as a refugee.) Ted grew up as “Felito” — but in junior high, he wanted out of that name. How come? He explained in his autobiography, published in 2015.
(Perhaps I should pause to explain why I am calling him “Ted,” rather than “Cruz” or “the senator” — he and I are old friends. It feels natural.) Advertisement
The problem with “Felito,” Ted writes, “was that it seemed to rhyme with every major corn chip on the market — Fritos, Cheetos, Doritos, Tostitos — a fact that other young children were quite happy to point out.” He continues, “I was tired of being teased. One day I had a conversation with my mother about it and she said, ‘You know, you could change your name. There are a number of other possibilities.’” Advertisement
This hit the young man like a thunderbolt. “It was a shocking concept,” Ted writes. “It had never occurred to me that I had any input on my name.” He decided on “Ted,” derived from his middle name, Edward.
Self-reinvention is as American as apple pie. Think of Jay Gatsby, a.k.a. the Great Gatsby, who started out in North Dakota as “Jimmy Gatz.” “Gatz,” huh? Possibly Jewish? This has been a theory, or suggestion, among literary critics.
There was a time when many American Jews felt they had to Anglicize, or de-Judaize, their names. I think merely of opera singers — a slew of them. Rubin Ticker became Richard Tucker. Jacob Pincus Perelmuth — Tucker’s brother-in-law, as it happened — became Jan Peerce. Before he was that , he sang as “Jack Pearl” and “Pinky Pearl.” Moishe Miller became Robert Merrill. Previously, he was Morris Miller, and then Merrill Miller. (Finally, Robert Merrill.) Advertisement
Can you guess Belle Silverman? She became Beverly Sills. And this one is easy: Roberta Peters, previously, was Roberta Peterman.
We could dwell on a few Italians too. Dean Martin, from Steubenville, Ohio, started out as Dino Crocetti. Before he became “Dean Martin,” he sang as “Dino Martini,” borrowing from Nino Martini, a tenor (like Tucker and Peerce).
Do you know the tenor Charles Anthony? He was born Charles Anthony Caruso, in 1929. That last name was kind of taken, tenor-wise. He dropped it, and kept the other two.
Back to Jews for a moment, please. I was once at an event with Mike Wallace, the TV journalist, who was originally “Myron,” not “Mike.” He recounted a story from his boyhood: “Mr. Maddy said to me, ‘Now, Myron …’ — because that’s my name, ‘Myron.’” He pointed to himself as he said this. I was rather touched by the tense — the present tense.
Jimmy Van Heusen, the songwriter, started out as Chester Babcock. He wanted what he regarded as a more stylish name — and wound up adopting “Van Heusen.” He noticed the name while looking through a magazine, which had an ad for men’s shirts.
Years later, the name “Chester Babcock” found its way into one of Bob Hope’s Road movies, The Road to Hong Kong (1962). That was the name of Hope’s character. All his life, Van Heusen’s nearest, dearest friends called him “Chet.”
Names are such a personal thing. So very personal.
I was talking about politics before. Let’s get back to it. In 1976, an ex-governor of Georgia ran for president as “Jimmy.” (One of the names that Chet Babcock ultimately chose!) Surely he couldn’t be president as Jimmy, a lot of people thought. “Jimmy” might have been all right for Georgia. But a Jimmy on the world stage, talking with Brezhnev and the rest?
In November, he won, beating President Ford. In the months before the inauguration, the question was, How will he be sworn in? As “James Earl Carter Jr.”? Or as “Jimmy”?
He stuck to “Jimmy,” simply because he wanted to, and because he could.
In 1984, Gary Hart ran for the Democratic nomination. Once upon a time, he had been “Hartpence.” Some Republicans liked to refer to him, hootingly, as “Hartpence.” What was he trying to get away with? Moreover, he had changed his signature, several times! Obviously, he was a flake trying to work out an identity.
I bet a lot of people have tried out more than one signature, before settling on one.
In 1988, William F. Buckley Jr. hosted the first debate of the Republican-primary season. One candidate, Pete du Pont, was jabbing another candidate, Vice President Bush, for a lack of specifics on arms control. “We’re waiting for details,” he said, “and we’re hearing generalities.” Bush replied — not very nicely — “Pierre, let me help you.”
Ooooh . True, du Pont is Pierre S. du Pont IV. But he has always been known as “Pete.” They alternate in their family, as the candidate explained after the debate. No. 3 was called “Pierre.” No. 4 is “Pete.” No. 5 is “Pierre.” That’s the way it goes. Advertisement
Regardless, Bush had succeeded in framing his opponent as a fancypants aristocrat, and French , to boot. David Broder, “the dean of the Washington press corps,” as he was known, wrote that “the night belonged to Bush — the man who dared to call a Pierre a Pierre.”
Bush himself was no plebe, of course: He was George Herbert Walker Bush. While we’re talking of names, I love something that Bush said after his eldest son was sworn in as president in 2001: “I used to be ‘George Bush.’ I used to be ‘the president.’ I don’t know who the hell I am anymore.”
The Bushes’ second-oldest son is Jeb — whose name comes from his initials, his formal name being John Ellis Bush.
During the Obama years, some Republicans liked to knock the president as “Barry.” One day, I saw a headline with the name “Barry” in it. I thought it referred to the notorious D.C. politician, Marion S. Barry (with the “S” standing for “Shepilov,” an interesting story in itself). Nope, the headline referred to Obama — who, for a time in his early life, which was a complicated life, went by the first name “Barry.”
Some people have complicated lives. Including presidents. Gerald R. Ford was born Leslie Lynch King Jr. Bill Clinton grew up as Billy Blythe. Very complicated, very messy.
In 2008, Mitt Romney ran for the GOP presidential nomination, unsuccessfully, and he tried for it again in ’12, this time succeeding. A lot of people didn’t like Romney — lefties and righties alike. A few of my colleagues insisted on calling him “Willard”: “because that’s his name,” one of them said: “ Willard .” Occasionally, they threw in “Mittens,” just for extra mockery, I suppose.
Yes, the guy’s name is Willard Mitt Romney. The “Willard” comes from J. Willard Marriott, the hotel entrepreneur, who was a friend of Romney’s father. The “Mitt” comes from a relative, Milton Romney, a quarterback for the Chicago Bears in the 1920s — whose nickname was “Mitt.” Before kindergarten, the future politician was known as “Billy.” In kindergarten, he decided he wanted to be called “Mitt.”
You can knock him all you want, as far as I’m concerned — it’s a free country. But what does calling him “Willard” or “Mittens” accomplish?
A bram became Abraham; Jacob became Israel; Saul became Paul. All of this is terribly significant. Leaving the Bible, shall we go to sports?
Cassius Clay became Muhammad Ali — owing to a religious conversion. Before that, he was simply “Cassius X.” That letter stood for the name you could not possibly know, because it had come from Africa, in slave days, and had been erased.
Malcolm Little came to despise his name — a name he felt did not really belong to him but had been thrust on him and his family. He chose his own name, “Malcolm X.” I can understand this — anyone could. (Some people said “Malcolm the Tenth,” some of them innocently, some of them mischievously.)
Lew Alcindor became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Many Americans continued to say “Alcindor,” as they had “Clay” — out of habit, defiance, or contempt. A name change can be a disorienting experience, both for the individual concerned and for the world around him.
Stick with basketball? Lloyd B. Free became World B. Free. (Explanation: Back in the neighborhood — Brooklyn — he had been known as “All-World,” later shortened to “World.”) Ron Artest became Metta World Peace. (“World Peace” is the last name; “Metta” is the first name, borrowed from Buddhism.)
To say it again, names are a very personal, very sensitive thing. In Detroit, we had a pitcher on the Tigers, Willie Hernandez, who came from Puerto Rico. At some point, he rebelled against the Anglo-American moniker that had been put on him: “Willie.” He let everyone know that he wanted to be called “Guillermo,” his name. It was hard for a lot of us to adjust, but …
I went to school with a girl named Yolanda, who, having had enough of what many considered an outlandish name, switched to “Renée.” I might have preferred her to tough it out, but I understood. I have a friend who wanted to ditch his first name. At Starbucks, he left a variety of names, trying them out. How would they sound to him, when they were called? Did one of them feel right? Eventually, one of them did. Advertisement"
Opioid Crisis: Suing Pharmaceutical Companies Not the Answer | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Charles Fain Lehman,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/opioid-crisis-pharmaceutical-company-lawsuits/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM A pharmacist holds 40mg pills of OxyContin, made by Purdue Pharma. (George Frey/Reuters) It’s important to do justice to bad actors — but don’t expect a reduction in overdoses.
T here are good odds that Purdue Pharma, makers of the addictive prescription opioid OxyContin and perennial villain of the opioid crisis, will soon declare bankruptcy . The firm just reached a settlement with Oklahoma, paying out $270 million for what the state sees as the company’s role in the drug-overdose deaths of thousands of citizens. Several states are now going after Purdue’s owners, the ultra-wealthy Sackler family, as well. Blood, as one legal expert put it to the New York Times , is in the water. Advertisement Advertisement
With these lawsuits dominating the headlines, it is easy to assume that penalizing big pharmaceutical firms like Purdue will actually fix America’s overdose crisis, which killed more than 70,000 people in 2017 alone: Big Pharma is the bad guy, and taking it down should therefore solve our problems. If, as historian Cynthia Wachtel recently wrote in the Washington Post , “unfettered greed created an opioid epidemic,” then it is easy to conclude that punishing the greedy will allow us to, in Wachtel’s words, “conquer the epidemic.”
A great deal of ink is therefore spilled excoriating pharmaceutical firms. One recent Baltimore Sun op-ed called Purdue “the shame of the opioid crisis.” An article posted earlier this year at The Nation explicitly pinned the current crisis on pharmaceutical misdeeds, and argued that while “the current opioid crisis transcends Purdue,” this in large part because “there are numerous, widely prescribed opioid medications out there besides Oxy.” Advertisement
To be sure, firms and individuals are likely guilty of unethical , destructive business practices in the name of profit, leading directly to many deaths in the mid-to-late 2000s. Suing them (or even prosecuting them criminally) could deter similar conduct in future, ensure justice for those whose lives have been wrecked by irresponsibly issued opioids, and remunerate the states and communities that have had to clean up the pharmaceutical companies’ mess.
But popular reporting can give the impression that pharmaceutical firms are currently, rather than previously, the main source of the crisis. This is simply not the case. We are no longer in a prescription-opioid crisis, but rather in a polydrug crisis driven primarily by illegal fentanyl. The major killers of Americans today are not pharmaceutical firms, but foreign drug-trafficking organizations. Advertisement
Failing to pay sufficient attention to this reality can only hurt efforts to stop the crisis. Further, too much attention paid to prescription pills encourages undue regulatory and social pressure on pain patients, which may exacerbate, rather than alleviate, the overdose crisis and other major social ills. Advertisement
Although the latest wave of lawsuits against big pharma is only getting started, drug-enforcement and public-health officials have been responding to the rise in prescription-drug deaths for years. During his second term in office, President Barack Obama turned federal attention to reducing prescription-drug supply through a number of tactics, including rescheduling some opioids, enhanced enforcement , and expanding Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. The results: After rising to 81.3 opioid prescriptions per 100 Americans in 2012, the number fell to 58.3 per hundred in five years. It should drop another third by 2021.
This reduction has had measurable effects on the abuse of, and overdose deaths from, prescription painkillers. According to federal survey data, the number of Americans who self-reported current misuse of pain relievers has fallen from 4.9 million in 2012 to 3.2 million in 2017 — a nearly 40 percent reduction when adjusting for population. What is more, many of these users are taking pills prescribed to someone else . Advertisement
The total number of deaths involving prescription opioids did continue to creep up after 2012, but the most recent data suggest they’re finally receding. Further, many recent prescription deaths involve fentanyl as well — and when you subtract fentanyl-involved ODs, the overdose rate from prescription opioids has actually dropped slightly since 2012. Advertisement
All in all, we have gone through a three-phase crisis , with the overall number of opioid deaths rising through all three phases: Prescription-opioid deaths began rising in the 1990s but were eventually supplanted by heroin overdoses, which in turn have been supplanted by deaths involving fentanyl and its analogues. In 2017 , fentanyl was involved in 28,000 deaths, compared to just over 15,000 deaths involving heroin and just under 15,000 involving prescription pills (many deaths involve both or all three).
Unsurprisingly, illegal heroin and fentanyl are not being made by American pharmaceutical firms. They are produced primarily in China or Mexico , then smuggled across the porous southwestern border or sent in by mail . Deaths are also now rising in some non-opioid drug categories, including methamphetamine , cocaine, and benzodiazepines — most of which are similarly foreign imports . Advertisement
Failing to take all of these other problems into account constitutes a major oversight in any story about the drug crisis. What is more, overzealous focus on big pharma and prescription opioids can hurt those it is meant to help, by making life hard not only for pharmaceutical firms, but for chronic pain patients and the doctors who care for them. Advertisement
A recent survey of medical professionals who prescribe opioids, for example, found that 52 percent felt “villainized” by media coverage of the crisis. Forty percent of them said that coverage had caused them to prescribe opioids less frequently than before.
To be sure, reducing needlessly long prescriptions is a good way to reduce the supply of drugs that that can be diverted to illegal use. But 20 percent of Americans suffer from chronic pain, including 8 percent with “high-impact” chronic pain. For many of these patients, opioids still serve as the only available relief, the absence of which can even lead to suicide attempts .
“Conflating the misuse of opioids with their legitimate medical use, and treating all opioids — illegal or prescription — alike is stigmatizing patients for whom opioid painkillers are necessary and medically appropriate,” wrote two medical professionals and a chronic-pain advocate in a STAT news op-ed . Advertisement
And even in regards to opioid abuse there are trade-offs inherent in reducing supply. There is good evidence that the aforementioned efforts to stop prescription-pill abuse led many users to pick up heroin instead, thereby failing to mitigate harm. In a 2018 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, three economists show that the “tamper-proof” reformulation of OxyContin — making it harder to crush up and snort — triggered a mass switch to heroin use. “The reformulation did not generate a reduction in combined heroin and opioid mortality — each prevented opioid death was replaced with a heroin death,” the authors write."
Donald Trump’s Critics Are Incompetent | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/donald-trump-critics-incompetent/,"About Kevin D. Williamson April 10, 2019 6:30 AM President Trump arrives to speak at the National Republican Congressional Committee Annual Spring Dinner in Washington, D.C., April 2, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters) Democrats overlook the president’s obvious shortcomings in their determination to tell a more exotic story.
A strange thing about President Donald Trump’s critics: The ones who are best positioned to make a case against him and who have the strongest incentive to do so — the Democrats — have proved the least competent at doing so.
The legitimate criticisms of President Trump are mostly the ones that were obvious to critics such as myself in 2016: He does not really know how to do the job and so has trouble with basic things like staffing his administration and moving his legislative priorities through Congress; he is mercurial and inconstant; he lies, even when there isn’t any reason to, seemingly out of habit; he is vain and emotionally incontinent, which distorts his decision-making; he has surrounded himself with some very shady and untrustworthy people; he has some pretty loopy ideas about trade and about America’s role in the world. Trump says, not without reason, that he is a different kind of politician, but in reality he has been at his best when he has deferred to such pillars of the establishment as the Federalist Society and Senator Mitch McConnell. Advertisement
Maybe that’s not sexy enough for some tastes, but it is the truth.
The Democrats are determined to tell a more exotic story — or stories. Advertisement
Some of these are very silly — for example, the claim that Trump’s ownership of business interests abroad puts him in violation of the Constitution’s emoluments clause, which has nothing to do with the ownership of hotels or golf courses. The hotly anticipated Mueller report has so far been more fizzle than sizzle. The Trump–Russia conspiracy theories grow ever more baroque and unlikely. Louise Mensch, quondam Guardian contributor and chronicler of the behind-the-scenes doings of the “marshal of the Supreme Court,” reports (and let’s go ahead and make the asterisk there explicit) that “multiple sources with links to the intelligence communities of more than one five-eyes nation” have confirmed that there are indictments forthcoming for Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Jared Kushner, and Ivanka Trump. You will not want to hold your breath for that one. Advertisement
We have seen theories of Trump as Manchurian candidate, Trump as witting or unwitting Moscow intelligence asset, Trump as blackmail victim in hock to Russian oligarchs, etc. “Resistance fantasy Twitter,” Ruth Graham of Slate calls it.
One of the problems with having a man such as Donald Trump as president is that when you hear about, oh, possibly felonious hush-money payments to porn stars in order to cover up adultery, no sane and literate person says to himself: “My goodness! That doesn’t sound like the Donald Trump I know!” Of course it does. Who else would it sound like? Advertisement
But it is possible to lie about a scoundrel, to be dishonest about the dishonest. And, for some strange reason, the Democrats have latched onto the complaints about Trump that seem to be least rooted in fact, the narrative that is least connected to that which is documented and demonstrable. Advertisement
I would not have been shocked to learn that Trump or his minions broke a few statutes in the pursuit of dirt on Hillary Rodham Clinton that was held by Russian operatives. It certainly seems that that’s what that Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and those dodgy Russians was about: “to get information on an opponent,” as the president himself wrote on Twitter, “totally legal and done all the time in politics.” But a broad criminal conspiracy based on “collusion” with Moscow? Maybe there’s more forthcoming, but, based on the evidence that is actually available, there doesn’t seem to be much to that story.
“Oh, but wait for the tax returns!” they say. All right. I suspect that the president’s tax returns are going to be hilarious, but they are unlikely to tell us anything about Donald Trump that we did not know in 2016. Advertisement"
Pete Buttigieg’s Bad-Faith Attack on Mike Pence - National Review,www.nationalreview.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/pete-buttigieg-attacks-mike-pence-bad-faith/,"April 10, 2019 6:30 AM Pete Buttigieg speaks at the 2019 National Action Network convention in New York City, April 4, 2019. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters) The vice president makes a convenient villain for the Left, regardless of the facts.
B ack in 2015, South Bend, Ind.’s mayor, Pete Buttigieg, came out of the closet as a gay man. Asked about the news, Indiana governor, Mike Pence, simply responded, “I hold Mayor Buttigieg in the highest personal regard. I see him as a dedicated public servant and a patriot.”
A year earlier, Buttigieg had been deployed to Afghanistan as a member of the U.S. Naval Reserve. According to the Indianapolis Star , “a noticeably moved Pence called Buttigieg the day he was driving to the base.” Advertisement Advertisement
There is no evidence that Pence has ever said an unkind word about or done an unkind thing to Buttigieg.
So, naturally, Buttigieg is attacking Pence as a homophobic bigot nearly every day on the campaign trail. Appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert , Buttigieg sneered, “He’s nice. If he were here, you would think he’s a nice guy to your face. But he’s also fanatical.” Speaking at the LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington, Buttigieg tore into Pence’s supposed intolerance: “That’s the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me — your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.” This week, Buttigieg tweeted, clearly in reference to Pence, “People will often be polite to you in person, while advancing policies that harm you and your family. You will be polite to them in turn, but you need not stand for such harms. Instead, you push back, honestly and emphatically. So it goes, in the public square.”
This is a change for Buttigieg, whose best-selling memoir contains no negative references about Pence but complains of “the complications of being openly gay in Mike Pence’s Indiana.” That phraseology is more a critique of Pence’s policy preferences than his personality. Fair enough. Advertisement Advertisement
But Buttigieg is no longer operating in good faith. Now he’s attacking Christians who disagree with his policies and support Trump (“the hypocrisy is unbelievable”); he’s castigating Pence as a religious homophobe, characterizing him as an obstacle to tolerance. Why? Because it is far more convenient to cast Pence as a close-minded bigot than it is to respect him as a political opponent.
This has become a particularly popular tactic on the Left. When Pence swore in Senator Doug Jones (D., Ala.), the Leftist internet completely manufactured a narrative wherein Pence was deeply uncomfortable with Jones’s gay son ( Newsweek ’s headline: “Doug Jones’ Gay Son Gives Mike Pence Serious Side-Eye”). Gay Olympian Adam Rippon randomly decided to tear into Pence by stating that “for Mike Pence to say he’s a devout Christian man is completely contradictory.” When gay Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar and his husband attended breakfast with Pence, the media attempted to push a narrative about Pence’s supposed discomfort. When Pence’s wife began teaching at a Christian school, the media leapt to label her an anti-gay maniac.
There is no evidence for any of this. Pence has been dealing with gay men, including Buttigieg, his entire career. He differs from them on the definition of marriage. While I believe the government ought to exit the business of marriage altogether, there are plenty of public-policy reasons to stand for traditional marriage that aren’t rooted in animus. Advertisement Advertisement
More than that, it betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of religious people to suggest that their belief in the immorality of certain sexual behavior reflects animus for those who engage in that sexual behavior. Religious people generally believe that we all sin; that we all struggle with sin; and that participating in one particular type of sin doesn’t mean that the sinner is somehow inferior to those who engage in other types of sin."
William Barr: FBI Spied on Donald Trump Campaign | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/william-barr-fbi-spying-on-donald-trump-campaign-did-occur/,"April 10, 2019 11:15 AM Attorney General William Barr testifies before a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee hearing in Washington, D.C., April 10, 2019. (Erin Scott/Reuters)
Attorney General William Barr told a Senate panel Wednesday that he believes American “intelligence agencies” did spy on the Trump campaign but said he has not yet determined whether there was a proper justification for that surveillance.
“I think spying did occur,” Barr said during a hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee. “But the question is whether it was adequately predicated and I am not suggesting that it wasn’t adequately predicated. . . . I am not suggesting those rules were violated, but I think it is important to look at that. And I am not talking about the FBI necessarily, but intelligence agencies more broadly.”
“I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal — it’s a big deal,” he added.
Barr was addressing a question from Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.) about the origins of the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. Intelligence officials involved in the probe relied in part on the Steele dossier — an unsubstantiated opposition-research file compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele — to obtain a FISA warrant to surveil Carter Page, but did not tell the FISA court that the dossier was commissioned by a company contracted by the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.

Barr told lawmakers Wednesday that he will form a team to investigate whether those FBI and Department of Justice officials misled the FISA court to further a partisan attack on Trump’s campaign.
“I’m not suggesting that those rules were violated, but I think it’s important to look at that,” Barr said.
“I am going to be reviewing both the genesis and the conduct of the intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign during 2016,” he added."

(Lucas Jackson/Reuters)
The gun-maker Remington has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in a wrongful death lawsuit brought in Connecticut by the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims.
The appeal comes after a panel of the Connecticut supreme court overturned a lower court last month in ruling that Remington can be sued for the way in which it marketed the Bushmaster AR-15 that was used to kill 26 people at the Newtown school in December 2012.
Justice Richard Palmer, writing for the 4 – 3 majority, argued that the plaintiffs, which include nine victims’ families and one survivor, should be given the opportunity to demonstrate that Remington violated the law by marketing the AR-15 specifically to young people.
Remington’s attorneys informed the Connecticut high court on Friday that they would appeal to the Supreme Court to intervene in the suit on the grounds that the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act shields gun manufacturers from liability if their products are used in criminal activity.

The Connecticut supreme court “recognized that guidance from the Supreme Court is needed by acknowledging that congressional intent to protect firearm manufacturers from litigation is not clear, and it is ‘possible that Congress intended to broadly immunize firearm sellers from liability’ for the conduct that Plaintiffs have alleged,” Remington’s lawyers, Scott Harrington and James Vogts, wrote in a motion filed Friday .
“If proceedings are not stayed and Remington is required to undergo the costly and time-consuming burdens of litigation, including further discovery, motion practice and possibly trial, it will irreparably lose the intended benefit of threshold PLCAA immunity from suit,” they continued."

(Edgar Su/Reuters)
New Zealand’s parliament on Wednesday voted almost unanimously to ban “military-style” semi-automatic weapons less than a month after 50 people were killed in mass shootings at a pair of mosques in the city of Christchurch.
The ban, which applies to semi-automatic rifles and shotguns capable of holding more than five rounds, was made permanent Wednesday after being unilaterally implemented by prime minister Jacinda Ardern just six days after the mosque shootings to prevent stockpiling.
“We are ultimately here because 50 people died, and they do not have a voice,” Ardern told parliament Wednesday. “We in this house are their voice, and today, we have used that voice wisely.”
Citizens in possession of banned guns will be granted a six-month buyback period, after which they will be subject to five years in prison if they remain in possession of prohibited weapons. The law provides exemptions for pest control professionals and licensed antique gun collectors. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Congressional Republicans have for the past year called for a thorough accounting of the origins of the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, which many of them believe began as a result of anti-Trump bias on the part of senior DOJ and FBI officials.

President Trump on Wednesday continued his public campaign to impugn the credibility of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s findings, which are expected to be released in redacted form in the coming days.
“It was an illegal investigation. It was started illegally. Everything about it was crooked,” Trump told reporters outside the White House before departing to Texas. “This was an attempted coup. This was an attempted takedown of a president, and we beat them.”
Trump’s comments came just one day after Attorney General William Barr told a House panel that he would release a redacted version of Mueller’s 300-page report to Congress within the week and subsequently make a more heavily redacted version public.
Lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee questioned Barr on Tuesday about the summary of Mueller’s report that he made public last month. In the four-page summary, Barr wrote that Mueller did not find evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russian officials to disrupt the 2016 election. The summary further explained that Mueller did not make a determination as to whether Trump obstructed justice in firing FBI director James Comey, but that after reviewing the report, Barr had determined there wasn’t sufficient evidence to bring obstruction of justice charges."
Virginia Democratic & Ralph Northam Controversy: Rush to Judgement? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jim Geraghty,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/virginia-democratic-lawmakers-apologize-for-a-rush-to-judgment-on-ralph-northam/,"Follow Jim Geraghty on Twitter April 10, 2019 1:13 PM
Several Virginia Democratic lawmakers feel like they rushed to judgment against governor Ralph Northam and state attorney general Mark Herring.
“There were a lot of life lessons” learned from the wreckage in Richmond, said state Sen. Janet Howell (D-32nd). Chief among them? “Don’t rush to judgment.”
“I’m sorry we did,” said Howell, who also pilloried national Democratic leaders and presidential candidates for weighing in, early and sometimes loudly, on the Virginia situation. (“Ignore them,” Howell advised.)
State Sen. Barbara Favola (D-31st), who was among those to call for resignations only later to backtrack, acknowledged legislators were caught up in a media firestorm. “Statements were made before people even talked to the governor,” said Favola, who long has been an ally of Northam.
Because that’s what Virginia really needed as the cherry on top to this elaborate ice-cream sundae of embarrassment: an apology to Northam. Advertisement Advertisement
These Democratic lawmakers apparently believe they denounced Northam and Herring too hastily. To refresh, shortly after the yearbook photo of a person in blackface and another in Klan robes appeared, Northam initially offered and then quickly rescinded an apology for “the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo.” The following morning, Northam changed his story and claimed he was neither in blackface nor wearing the Klan hood, that he had no idea who was in the photo, that he had no idea how the photo ended up on his page in the yearbook, and that he had no idea how he got the nickname “Coon-man.” He then admitted wearing shoe polish on his face to imitative Michael Jackson in a dance contest — a strange tale that, intriguingly, no one has verified. During his infamous press conference, Northam said he only realized that darkening his face with shoe polish to resemble an African–American could be considered offensive during a conversation with a campaign aide during the 2017 campaign."

Last month, I did a quick breakdown of the federal courts of appeals by party of appointing president (which is at best a very crude metric of judicial philosophy). Here I am going to take a harder look at how the composition of each court might change by the end of 2020. Advertisement Advertisement
In particular, I am going to identify which sitting judges are, or will soon be (i.e., by July 2020), eligible to take senior status or retire. I emphasize that in doing so I express no opinion whether any particular judge should take senior status or retire. I also offer no prediction on who might. As a general rule, judges appointed by Democratic presidents are much less likely than judges appointed by Republican presidents to step down.
I set forth in “Potential new” what the new composition of the court would be if all senior-eligible judges stepped down and were replaced by appointees of President Trump. That, of course, is a farfetched scenario . But it nonetheless might shed some light on the future, especially if President Trump wins a second term.
To avoid repeating the phrases “appointee of Republican president” and “appointee of Democratic president,” I will use the shorthands R and D. In doing so, I do not mean to suggest that judges are political partisans. I will also use V for vacancy. Advertisement

The campaign received over 213,000 contributions from more than 135,000 donors whose average donation was $28, according to Warren’s campaign manager Roger Lau. In the final week of the quarter, it pulled in more than $1.4 million, and now has $11.2 million in its coffers.
Warren’s fundraising numbers lag significantly behind those of her competitors for the Democratic nomination. Senator Bernie Sanders topped the list, pulling in a colossal $18.2 million in the first quarter, while Senator Kamala Harris raised $12 million, former representative Beto O’Rourke took in $9.4 million, and South Bend, Ind. mayor Pete Buttigieg pulled in $7 million."

Julian Assange Arrested: Wikileaks Founder Apprehended Outside Ecudaorian Embassy | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-arrested/,"April 11, 2019 7:24 AM Julian Assange on the balcony of the Ecuadorean embassy in London, May 2017 (Peter Nicholls / Reuters)
Update 9:31 a.m. : Hours after he was arrested at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, U.S. authorities announced they have charged Julian Assange with one count of conspiracy to hack a government computer. The charge stems from Assange’s role in hacking a confidential computer in 2010 in an effort to release classified documents.
Julian Assange, the Wikileaks founder who has made enemies of governments around the world by releasing confidential, and often embarrassing, intelligence documents to the public, was arrested Thursday at the Ecuadorian embassy in London by the British police.
The British metropolitan police explained in a statement released Thursday that Assange was arrested partly in connection with an extradition warrant filed by the U.S., which suggests he may be sent to the U.S. to stand trial.
The Department of Justice has charged Assange in connection with his publication of thousands of classified government documents, a fact they accidentally revealed in an unrelated court filing in February.
Assange was expelled from the Ecuadorian embassy, where he has lived for seven years, after “his repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols” led Ecuadorian president Lenin Moreno to rescind his country’s protection.
Wikileaks announced last Friday that Ecuador “already has an agreement with the UK for his arrest.”
A video of Assange’s arrest shows him being carried down the steps of the embassy while shouting “the U.K. must resist.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

President Moreno, citing a recent Wikileaks expose on the Vatican, explained in a video statement that Assange was being expelled from the embassy for failing to uphold his pledge to stop meddling in the affairs of foreign nations. Assange first moved into the embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was facing sexual assault charges.
Wikileaks rose to prominence in 2010 by releasing a cache of classified U.S. intelligence documents and diplomatic cables pertaining to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Chelsea Manning, a transgender woman formerly known as Bradley, was arrested for leaking those documents and was sentenced to 35 years in prison but was released after serving just seven.
Assange, 47, is also suspected of aiding Russia in their efforts to disrupt the 2016 election by publishing confidential and damaging Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign documents. He has explicitly stated his desire to damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign but has long denied receiving the hacked documents from Russian agents, as American intelligence agencies allege."

2018 —“Progressive fury” (as CNN puts it) is unleashed on federal district nominee Wendy Vitter for declining to opine at her confirmation hearing whether she believes that Brown v. Board of Education was correctly decided. Malicious charges spread that Vitter supports racial segregation.
Never mind that, like many other nominees, Vitter took the position that it was improper for her to comment on the rightness or wrongness of any Supreme Court ruling. Never mind that she committed to apply all existing precedents. Never mind that she testified that racial segregation is immoral. Never mind that no one identified anything in her life or career to suggest that she is racially biased. Never mind that she has earned the support of Democrats like New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu (who, among other things, called for the removal of city monuments honoring leaders of the Confederacy).

What many on the Left really object to—or so it would seem from the questions posed at the hearing by Senate Democrats—is that Vitter is openly pro-life. Ed Whelan is the President of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. @EdWhelan123 "

Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the dictator of Sudan, has been removed from power.
His crimes, as the Washington Post put it, include “genocide against his own people.”
I have always been uncomfortable with that formulation–“against his own people” — for three reasons.
First, it is a cliché, and clichés should be avoided. (Like the plague, the copyeditors’ joke goes.) Advertisement Comments
Second, there’s that possessive pronoun. His people? The idea that the people belong to the potentate in the same ways that all the game in the forest used to be assumed to be royal property is an idea that, perhaps because of its formulation within a cliché, receives insufficient examination. Surely the people of Sudan belong to themselves, and not to the dictator.
Third, there’s the implicit moral argument that it is somehow worse to commit atrocities against one’s own subjects, as though it would be better to invade the country next door and commit genocide against “someone else’s people.” We heard a lot about how Saddam Hussein brutalized “his own people.” He brutalized a lot of other people, too. Did the Kurds of northern Iraq feel the Halabja massacre especially keenly, or did the Shia of Dujail, because they were the tyrant’s “own” people? Did the 50,000 to 100,000 Iranians killed by Iraqi chemical weapons say to themselves, as they died of asphyxiation in convulsions and terror, “Well, it least it wasn’t our own government!”"
"Michael Avenatti Indicted -- Grand Jury Points to Tax Dodging, Fraud, Stealing from Mentally Ill Client | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Jack Crowe,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/avenatti-indicted-for-tax-dodging-fraud-stealing-from-mentally-ill-client/,"Follow Jack Crowe on Twitter April 11, 2019 11:43 AM Michael Avenatti speaks outside the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles, Calif., September 24, 2018. (Andrew Cullen/Reuters)
Celebrity attorney Michael Avenatti was indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday on a host of financial and other crimes, including fraud, tax avoidance, and embezzling funds from clients, one of whom was a mentally ill paraplegic.
A Santa Ana grand jury charged that Avenatti created an extensive network of shell corporations to embezzle millions of dollars from five of his clients, the Los Angeles Times first reported . One of those clients, Geoffrey Ernest Johnson, a mentally ill paraplegic, won a $4 million settlement from Los Angeles County, which Avenatti hid from him for years, according to the indictment.
Johnson was awarded the settlement after paralyzing himself by jumping from an upper floor of the jail in which he was being held. Avenatti never informed Johnson of the $4 million settlement, and instead funneled it to GB Autosport, LLC — a company he established to manage his race-car team — and to his failed coffee company, Global Baristas LLC. He subsequently paid out small installments to Johnson and told him they were “advances” on the county settlement that he had not yet received.
The deception eventually led the Social Security Administration to revoke Johnson’s disability payments as he was unable to provide information about the settlement.
Avenatti, who was elevated to national fame by his near-nightly appearances on CNN and other cable outlets, also allegedly concealed another $2.75 million settlement from a client, which he used to purchase a private jet that has since been seized by federal authorities.
The embattled attorney was previously indicted in California on bank- and wire-fraud charges and in New York on extortion charges related to an alleged attempt to blackmail Nike, but the indictments handed down Thursday represent a dramatic escalation of his legal troubles: They could result in a maximum sentence of 335 years in prison."
Social Security Paid Leave: Program Actuaries Weigh In | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Robert Verbruggen,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/conservative-paid-leave-proposal-social-security-chief-actuary-weighs-in/,"April 11, 2019 2:27 PM (Marcos Brindicci/Reuters)
. . . via a letter sent, at their request, to Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ann Wagner. As you may know, the proposal of theirs at issue would allow parents to take paid leave through Social Security in exchange for delaying retirement. According to information put out by Rubio’s office , “ nearly all parents below the median household income of about $60,000 will be able to take significant leave at a rate of two-thirds of their prior wages, ” with richer parents receiving a lower replacement rate. Advertisement Advertisement
This is self-evidently a fantastic idea, in my humble opinion, but a key issue is how it would affect Social Security. It’s important to get the math right, so that the system breaks even when parents take X months off and then, years later, delay their retirement by Y months.
The ratio of Y to X will be determined by the Social Security commissioner, but the letter estimates it will be about 2:1, meaning each month of leave will be paid for with two months of delayed retirement. Alternatively, someone taking leave could opt to have their benefits reduced for the first five years of their retirement, though the precise calculations for that option are rather arcane.
The letter assumes that 40 percent of parents would take the benefit for 2.5 months per child, starting in 2022, and that the program would sunset in 2032. Obviously the program would most likely be extended, so this should be seen as an estimate of the cost for just its first ten years. Advertisement"

Over at Larry Sabato’s “Crystal Ball” site , Kyle Kondik observes that considering the size of the field and the Democratic party’s way of allocating delegates — no winner-take-all states, just a 15 percent threshold to win any delegates — the primary season could end with no candidate winning the necessary number of delegates and “the Democratic National Convention could hypothetically go to a second ballot.” Advertisement Advertisement
(Those who would like to see a party convention be newsworthy again will be cheering for this scenario.)
There’s a good chance that the 15 percent rule is going to cause Democrats headaches. Somebody at some point is going to win 13 or 14 percent of the vote a state primary and not get any delegates, and that candidate and their supporters are likely to be furious. You will probably hear a lot of cries of “rigged!” and claims that the process is unfair — or that it even represents “voter suppression” of some kind.

Does the leading candidate get 100 percent of the delegates? Unless there’s a clear frontrunner, a lot of candidates will scream that the process is unfair and rigged against them. Advertisement"

A reader who is very knowledgeable about the federal courts has asked me to list all federal appellate judges who are eligible to take senior status and who are 75 or older. His premise is that once judges get around that age, they are more likely to take senior status irrespective whether the sitting president is of the same party as the president who appointed them. I don’t know whether that premise is true, but I will nonetheless indulge his request. Advertisement Advertisement
I set forth below the senior-eligible federal appellate judges who will be 75 or older by the end of 2019 . I emphasize that some of the judges on the list have passed over plenty of opportunities to retire. Judge Tjoflat, for example, turns 90 in December. He became eligible to take senior status in 1994, so there is no particular reason to expect him to take it now.

Wikileaks' Julian Assange Provides a Window into America’s Polarized Soul | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/julian-assange-was-a-window-into-americas-polarized-soul/,"Follow David French on Twitter April 11, 2019 4:02 PM WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is seen in a police van after he was arrested by British police outside the Ecuadorian embassy in London, England, April 11, 2019. (Henry Nicholls/Reuters) The view he revealed is ugly, petty, and deeply dispiriting.
J ulian Assange’s arrest and indictment should provide us with a moment of reflection. He is an awful man. He dumped American military secrets into the public domain without any regard for human life. He conspired with an American soldier to crack American security systems in the effort to deliver more secrets to the world public. Advertisement Advertisement
His co-conspirator, Chelsea (then Bradley) Manning, wasn’t a “whistleblower” — and neither was Assange. Manning didn’t carefully extract evidence of alleged wrongdoing from classified files and go to the press (a defensible, though still illegal, act). He just dumped hundreds of thousands of pages of classified files into Assange’s hands, and Assange posted them, en masse , on the Internet.
Any jihadist or enemy with Internet access could read the documents and not just learn about the identities of American allies on the ground (placing them at immediate, mortal risk) but also gain extraordinary insight into American military tactics and plans — including learning exactly how effective (or ineffective) their own weapons and tactics were.
Manning committed treason. Assange helped him. And there were Americans who celebrated both men. Manning got a Vogue profile . Assange was the object of admiration. Remember when Atlantic contributor David Samuels wrote that Assange had performed a “ huge public service ”?
Not since President Richard Nixon directed his minions to go after Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg and New York Times reporter Neil Sheehan —“a vicious antiwar type,” an enraged Nixon called him on the Watergate tapes — has a working journalist and his source been subjected to the kind of official intimidation and threats that have been directed at Assange and Manning by high-ranking members of the Obama administration.
Some even called Assange a “ darling of the liberal left .” Republicans and mainstream liberals held a different view. The Obama administration condemned him, conservatives called him a traitor, and Donald Trump said WikiLeaks was “disgraceful,” adding that there should be the “death penalty or something” for its actions.
Fast-forward to 2016, and WikiLeaks enjoyed a reputational renaissance on the right. Why? Well, WikiLeaks was the same organization, but its target had changed. Rather than taking on alleged American imperialism, it was the conduit for an alleged Russian hack that was systematically embarrassing Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party in the middle of a hotly contested presidential election. Advertisement
“ I love WikiLeaks ,” Trump declared to rousing cheers at a rally. Sean Hannity defended him during the election and even referred to Assange to advance his absurd Seth Rich conspiracy theory . Advertisement
Even worse, the special counsel’s office has alleged that a “senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information [WikiLeaks] had regarding the Clinton Campaign.” Trump “loved” Wikileaks, and his campaign allegedly endeavored to get information from WikiLeaks — the same organization that had just a few years before conspired with a traitor to place American soldiers and American allies in mortal danger.
Julian Assange intentionally and deliberately works against American interests. Yet there are Americans who will intentionally and deliberately share WikiLeaks information, wield it as a weapon against their political opponents, and even attempt to make contact with Assange himself when it serves their domestic political interests. Advertisement
There is no virtue in Assange. Those who celebrated his “transparency” in the Manning document dumps forget that responsible reporters who gain access to classified material carefully vet that material to make sure that their disclosures do not needlessly endanger innocent Americans, and they carefully weigh the value of the disclosure against the gravity of the harm. Assange and Manning did not seem to care about the men and women they betrayed.
Those who celebrated Assange’s role in the DNC and Podesta hacks forget that he was playing a willing and even eager role in a foreign plan to disrupt an election and divide our nation — a plan that worked beautifully in large part because of the very celebration of the hacks themselves. In “Flight 93 elections,” I suppose, advancing Russian interests is a small price to pay for a news cycle or two that humiliates Hillary. Advertisement"
Lisa Neubauer & Brian Hagedorn -- How Wisconsin Conservatives Scored a Stunning Upset | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,John Mccormack,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/how-conservatives-scored-a-stunning-upset-in-wisconsin/,"April 11, 2019 4:15 PM (Carlos Jasso/Reuters)
On Wednesday, liberal-backed Wisconsin supreme court candidate Lisa Neubauer formally conceded to conservative-backed Brian Hagedorn after the official canvas of the vote only increased Hagedorn’s lead of roughly 6,000 votes out of 1.2 million ballots cast.
As we reported last week, Hagedorn’s victory was nothing short of stunning. His campaign had been left for dead by some business groups in the state after his opponents attacked him as an anti-LGBT bigot for founding a private Christian school that upholds traditional Christian beliefs about marriage and sex. The Wisconsin Realtors Association withdrew its endorsement, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce decided to stay out of the race. Advertisement Advertisement
But the business community’s squeamishness in Wisconsin was not shared by Republican leaders and conservative activists. Former governor Scott Walker, Senator Ron Johnson, and conservative talk radio stood by Hagedorn.
The libertarian Americans for Prosperity executed its ground game as planned, working hand-in-hand with a record number of volunteers, many of whom were social conservatives outraged by what they saw as an attack on Hagedorn’s faith.
And the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) provided critical air support to Hagedorn during the last week of the campaign. The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign reported that liberal groups backing Neubauer outspent conservative groups backing Hagedorn by as much as a 14-1 margin until the last week of the race, when the RSLC swooped in with a million-dollar ad campaign. It didn’t erase the disparity between conservative and liberal spending in the state, but did narrow the gap. Advertisement
As officials at the RSLC explain in a memo , the organization found Hagedorn down 8 points—42 percent to 34 percent—a little more than one week before the election. But the poll also showed that they had a path to victory by turning out the conservative base that had sat out a state supreme court race in 2018, when the liberal judicial candidate defeated the conservative by 12 percentage points. Advertisement
“Through the polling we identified that Judge Hagedorn’s biggest challenge was that he was not winning among Republicans (+50%) as much as his opponent was winning among Democrats (+71%). Equalizing the partisan intensity made this a two point race,” the memo states.
One message promoted by the RSLC was that liberal special interest groups were smearing Hagedorn “just like they did against Justice Kavanaugh.” Advertisement"

The indictment that the Justice Department filed against Julian Assange in the Eastern District of Virginia charges him with a conspiracy to commit computer fraud. The conspiracy statute is Section 371 of the penal code, and the computer fraud offenses that were the objectives of the conspiracy are parts of Section 1030 . Advertisement Advertisement
According to the indictment, Assange and Manning (then known as Bradley, now as Chelsea) conspired in 2010. Manning was prosecuted by the armed forces. The Justice Department’s indictment against Assange was not returned until 2018 — eight years later.
The five-year statute of limitations that applies to most federal crimes is prescribed for both conspiracy and computer fraud.
So how is the Justice Department able to prosecute Assange on an indictment filed three years after the prescribed limitations period?
It appears that the Justice Department is relying on an exception, in Section 2332b of the penal code, that extends the statute of limitations to eight years for “acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries.” Advertisement
Now, conspiracy to commit computer fraud is a very serious offense, and Assange’s is at the top of the seriousness range because it involved publication of defense secrets that endangered lives, including the lives of our troops. And there’s no doubt that the conspiracy transcended national boundaries — Assange was outside the U.S. when he collaborated with Manning. But is it really an act of terrorism ? Advertisement
It may be . . . at least as the operative term — federal crime of terrorism — is defined by Section 2332b.
Under subsection (g)(5) of that statute, an offense is considered a “federal crime of terrorism” if it satisfies two elements: (1) it “is calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct”; and (2) it is a violation of one of a long list of offenses, which includes “section . . . 1030(a)(1) (relating to protection of computers)[.]” Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
We should stress here — because this point is sure to be butchered (by some, intentionally) in the public debate — that the issue is not whether what Assange is accused of doing strikes you as an act of terrorism in the commonly understood sense of that term. The question is: Does it fit Congress’s definition of a federal crime of terrorism, as spelled out in Section 2332b, which controls the statute of limitations? If it does, the eight-year statute of limitations applies. Advertisement Advertisement
It seems to me that Assange and Manning were certainly retaliating against the U.S. government, and trying to coerce the government into changing policy. And the offense alleged does indeed involve computer fraud under Section 1030(a)(1).
Under the statute, that should be enough. But it will be a hotly contested issue."

(Mary F. Calvert/Reuters)
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday that the U.S. needs a “referendum on socialism” in the 2020 congressional elections and that the Republican Party will be on the front lines against it.
“We need to have a referendum on socialism,” the Kentucky Republican told reporters. “I’m going to be arguing, and I’m encouraging my colleagues to argue, that we are the firewall against socialism in this country.”
Republicans will have to defend 22 Senate seats in 2020, compared to the Democrats’ 12 seats.
“If you’re uncomfortable with things like the Green New Deal and Medicare for none, the best way to avoid that is to have a Republican Senate,” McConnell said.
Six senators who have thrown their hat in the ring for the Democratic presidential nomination have thrown their support behind the Green New Deal: Senators Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand.
Meanwhile, all of those presidential candidates except for Klobuchar have sponsored Sanders’ Medicare for All plan, although they have not all called for the effective end of the private health insurance market, as the Vermont independent and self-described democratic socialist has done.

Klobuchar, who tends right of her opponents for the Democratic nomination, has pushed instead for an optional buy-in to a government health care plan, saying she is “looking at something that will work now” rather than later.
“If we can’t make that case, we ought to go into another line of work,” McConnell said.
The GOP lost their House majority in 2018 but added two seats to their Senate majority.

‘Tax the Rich’ and 'Pay Their Fair Share' Demands Unreasonable | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jonah Goldberg,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/tax-rich-pay-fair-share-demands-unreasonable/,"April 12, 2019 6:30 AM A demonstrator protests the Republican tax plan as it works through the Senate, November 2017.

I f I told you there was a movement to create a navy or an air force, you might respond, “Don’t we already have those?” If I said we need a movement to persuade bears to relieve themselves in the woods, you might say, “Wait. Isn’t that happening already?”
But if I said we needed to tax the rich, a lot of people’s first reaction would be, “Yes! It’s about time!” Advertisement Advertisement
In fact, there’s an astroturf movement based on precisely this notion. There was just a big conference, fittingly named the “Tax the Rich!” conference, hosted by a group called Patriotic Millionaires.
“Tax the Rich. Save America. Yes, it really is that simple,” they explain in their mission statement.
This slogan is simply dishonest; rich people do, in fact, pay taxes. Just under half (48 percent) of federal revenue comes from income taxes. If you define the rich as the top 1 percent — which is probably too narrow, depending on the region of the country — the rich pay a big chunk of that. In 2016, according to the Tax Foundation, the top 1 percent accounted for 37.3 percent of all income-tax revenue, a share that was greater than the bottom 90 percent of all payers of income tax combined. The top half of taxpayers paid 97 percent of income taxes. Advertisement
The Tax Policy Center estimates that 44 percent of Americans won’t pay any federal income taxes for 2018. That doesn’t mean they don’t pay any taxes, of course. Payroll taxes eat up a big chunk of many Americans’ paychecks — a fact we all learn the first time we shout, “Who the hell is FICA!?” Advertisement
But the income tax is remarkably progressive. Once again citing the Tax Policy Center (a joint project of two left-of-center think tanks: the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute), Americans in the top 20 percent paid an estimated 87 percent of income taxes for 2018. This was up from 84 percent in 2017, which means that the “Trump tax cuts” actually made the tax code more progressive.
The folks shouting “Tax the rich!” know this, which is why, when they move beyond sloganeering, they say that what they really want is for the rich to “pay their fair share.” This is a more debatable claim because “fair” is in the eye of the beholder. It’s not preposterous to argue that the rich, however defined, should pay a few percentage points more in income tax in the name of fairness. But it’s also not preposterous to say that when 1 percent of the people provide more than a third of income-tax revenue, they’re already paying their fair share — and suggesting that people who don’t want to pay even more are “unpatriotic” is bullying nonsense. Advertisement
While we’re on the topic of fairness, there’s another common argument for hiking income taxes for the wealthy, or for even simply taxing wealth itself: The rich deserve it. Or, to be more generous, the super-rich don’t deserve their money, while the rest of the country does. Advertisement
The New York Times ’ Farhad Manjoo recently argued for “abolishing” billionaires outright. Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Beto O’Rourke say we should make the rich less rich because income inequality is bad. Candidate Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (and many others) think that everything from Medicare for All to the Green New Deal can be financed largely — or entirely — by pillaging the bank accounts of the rich.
This is populist insanity masquerading as public finance. According to the Manhattan Institute’s Brian Riedl, doubling the top tax brackets (from 35 and 37 percent to 70 and 74 percent) “would close just one-fifth of the long-term Social Security and Medicare shortfall. Even seizing all annual income earned over $500,000 would not come close.”
You could literally confiscate 100 percent of the wealth of the entire 1 percent and not come close to paying for Sanders’s version of Medicare for All (price tag: $32 trillion). Advertisement"
Federal Reserve Balance-Sheet Policy: A Credit Card for Uncle Sam | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David Beckworth,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/federal-reserve-balance-sheet-policy/,"April 12, 2019 6:30 AM Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) He can now tap the Fed to fund spending activities.
U ncle Sam has a new credit card. It’s flashy and different. It’s also potentially destabilizing — but like many people who get a new credit card, he’s thrilled to have it and is having a hard time seeing any downside to its use. This enthusiasm could prove to be shortsighted for the long-run health of U.S. finances. Advertisement
For most of his life, Uncle Sam has relied on an older, less flashy credit card. It is accepted everywhere and by everyone and comes with an incredibly low interest rate. It’s served him well and has allowed him, at times, to run up large balances without becoming viewed as a credit risk. This older credit card is better known as the U.S. Treasury, and its “balances,” now near $15.5 trillion, are the U.S. public debt.
The new credit card is not accepted everywhere. In fact, very few places take it, and typically it charges a higher interest rate than the older card. It is, in other words, inferior, but Uncle Sam seems happy to have it at his disposal. After several years of trying it out, he officially became a permanent card holder this year. The new credit card is the Federal Reserve, and its “balances,” now near $1.5 trillion, are excess bank reserves.
The new card arrived in January, when the Federal Reserve announced it was going to indefinitely stick with its post-financial crisis “floor” operating system. This system allows the size of our central bank’s balance sheet to be independent from its stance on monetary policy. Advertisement
What does this mean? Well, for example, the Fed can now expand its balance sheet by creating money to purchase new assets without causing its target interest rate to change. The Fed, in other words, can now make new money without adding stimulus to the economy. This money, however, can only be used by banks and is why Uncle Sam cannot use this new credit card everywhere. Advertisement
This money is called excess bank reserves and, unlike cash, earns a return from the Fed called interest on excess reserves (IOER). The IOER typically has been higher than the return on treasury bills. Banks have been eager, therefore, to hold all excess bank reserves sent their way. But this is also what makes Uncle Sam’s new credit card more expensive than the old one.
The Fed’s floor system, in short, has turned part of its balance sheet into a credit card for Uncle Sam. He can tap the excess-reserves option at any time to fund spending activities. Advertisement
So far, Uncle Sam has used the new card only to transfer balances from the older Treasury card. That is, the Fed took Treasury debt off the market and in its place put excess reserves. But as any financial planner can tell you, paying off one credit card with another, higher-interest card — and one accepted by fewer merchants — is poor debt management. Moreover, the balances on Uncle Sam’s older credit card are a much sought-after asset in the global financial system. Uncle Sam, consequently, strains global financial markets when he transfers balances onto the new one. Advertisement
Going forward, Uncle Sam is likely to see the balances grow on his new credit card for several reasons: First, whenever the next recession happens, the Fed is likely to rely on “quantitative easing” — buying up financial assets to spur the economy — because there will be little room to cut interest rates. Second, at some point, the temptation for politicians to use the new credit card to fund new activity such as the Green New Deal, and not just balance transfers, will inevitably become too hard to resist.
This not only will result in poor debt management and global financial strain but also might push inflation uncomfortably high. To avoid this outcome, Uncle Sam should transfer credit balances back onto the older, lower-interest card, and shut down the new one. Advertisement"
Supreme Court Case Weighs State Liquor Laws and 21st Amendment | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Caleb Whitmer,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/state-liquor-laws-21st-amendment-supreme-court-case/,"April 12, 2019 6:30 AM Liquor store in Louisville, Ky., in 2014. (John Sommers II/Reuters) Many states’ regulations seem more designed to suppress competition than to encourage safety.
T his year marks the 100th anniversary of the beginning of Prohibition. While that odd chapter in American history officially concluded with the 21st Amendment’s ratification in 1933, the restless ghosts of a 14-year national experiment in teetotallery still haunt the country’s bars, liquor stores, and breweries. The contradictions and ironies of Prohibition, which is now a shorthand cliché for well-intentioned government regulation gone awry, have only deepened with time. Today, the labyrinth-like legal apparatus constructed in Prohibition’s wake is just as likely to provide protection for entrenched alcohol interests as it is to encourage the responsible distribution and sale of beer, wine, and spirits. Advertisement
Consider Tennessee. To obtain a liquor license, applicants must have lived in the state for a minimum of two years, but reapplying for the one-year license requires applicants to have lived there for at least a decade. The state’s liquor-store lobbying organization has argued that the residency requirement ensures that merchants are locals who have a vested interest in keeping their communities safe , but one doesn’t need the cynicism of a Chicago mobster to understand the rule’s protectionist subtext. The Supreme Court is expected to release its decision on the constitutionality of Tennessee’s residency requirement by summer, and a ruling against the regulation could loosen some of the grip states have over alcohol under the 21st Amendment. For consumers, that would be a nice Prohibition-anniversary gift.
Whatever the original intent, in practice, many of today’s regulations on alcohol have very little to do with promoting a healthy relationship between the American people and alcoholic beverages. At the end of Prohibition, states assumed near-total control of the traffic of alcohol within their borders, a move later protected by the Supreme Court’s broad interpretation of the 21st Amendment . The swing from total to minimal federal control splashed the country, à la Jackson Pollock, with a dizzying miscellany of regulations diverging sometimes wildly between states, counties, and towns. Advertisement
Mississippi is a great example of this oddly charming mess. It’s notable as the only state in the country to allow alcohol consumption while driving, so long as the person’s blood-alcohol content doesn’t rise above the legal limit. The state’s permissiveness toward automobile operators, however, is a peculiar anomaly in an otherwise long history of exacting alcohol regulations.
In fact, Mississippi was the last state to end prohibition fully. It legalized beer in 1933, but liquor had to wait another 30 years. When the sale of liquor finally did become legal, Mississippi permitted it only through a state-run Alcoholic Beverage Control authority similar, though by no means identical, to agencies in states such as Virginia, North Carolina, and roughly a dozen others. Until 2012, Mississippi banned the sale of beer with an alcohol-by-volume content of more than 6.25 percent , and it didn’t allow breweries to sell beer on-site until 2017 . Advertisement
Undoubtedly, such restrictions made more sense when the state still outlawed liquor, and local breweries were more prominent suppliers of beer. More recently, though, these laws have produced ridiculous contradictions. Why should the state have capped the alcohol content of beer at 6.25 percent, for instance, when it permitted the sale of much stronger wines and liquors? Meanwhile, the brewery-sales restriction, among other regulations, was stifling to the state’s craft-brewery entrepreneurs: In 2012, the state had exactly one craft brewery. By comparison, neighbors Louisiana and Alabama each had about ten. Surely, if Budweiser is widely available, Mississippi beer — which creates local industry, jobs, and something for the state’s official tourism organization to brag about — should be, too. Advertisement
To their credit, state lawmakers eventually identified these contradictions (thanks, in part, to the lobbying efforts of a grassroots organization called Raise Your Pints ) and revised some of Mississippi’s beer rules accordingly. This wave of reform included ending the last statewide ban on homebrewing (though it remains illegal in the roughly one third of Mississippi’s counties that remain dry). Today Mississippi is home to at least a dozen craft breweries.
Some state legislators have attempted similar liberalizing efforts for rules on wine but have met less success. Mississippi is one of five states that still ban wine shipments directly to consumers, a consumer trend that has exploded across the country in recent years, including in Mississippi despite its illegality. Out-of-state wine sellers have reportedly sent thousands of bottles into the state, much to the chagrin of the state’s alcohol regulators, who are missing out on tax revenue. (Last August, a county judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by Mississippi’s attorney general against several of these companies, citing lack of personal jurisdiction to hear and decide the case.) For the past few years, Mississippi lawmakers have introduced bills to roll back the ban. Undoubtedly, the prudence of such a policy — whether it is, in fact, good for Mississippi to permit direct-to-consumer wine shipments from out of state — should be debated, weighing the benefits of such a policy to consumers while, say, questioning how easily minors in search of booze could exploit it. It’s doubtful, however, that such considerations are really driving the debate. Advertisement Advertisement
For the state’s liquor-store owners, mail-order wine is simply bad for business. “It wouldn’t be good to lose the revenue if [customers] could just order from home and get it directly from the manufacturer,” Shawn Guider, owner of Petit Bois Liquors in Biloxi, told a local TV station . “We would lose the sales here.” Lobbyists representing Guider and liquor-store owners around the state (who, it’s worth noting, are basically state contractors under Mississippi’s Alcoholic Beverage Control authority) opposed the legislation, and it died in committee in early February. Advertisement Advertisement
There is a reason mail-order wine has caught fire in recent years: People like it. More than providing consumers with an Amazon-like shopping center, online wine clubs often help consumers figure out what wines they like and connect them to new wines they’ve never tried. Getting wine in the mail is not exactly a crucial service, essential to living the good life in America, but it’s nice. Government taxation and entrenched business interests being what they are, however, it seems unlikely that Mississippians will have (legal) access to these services anytime soon.
The scenes and themes of Mississippi’s alcohol dramas are performed regularly around the country, just with different players. A Supreme Court battle over liquor-license residency requirements could have started in any number of states besides Tennessee. In fact, 33 others (including Mississippi) and the District of Columbia all signed on to the suit in support of Tennessee’s stringent rules. More than just a question about the constitutionality of a particular regulation, though, Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association v. Blair could end up having profound implications on the states’ authority over alcohol under the 21st Amendment. Advertisement
TWSRA v. Blair began when Tennessee’s alcohol regulators were poised to grant liquor licenses to two store owners who did not meet the two-year requirement (one license was for liquor-store megachain Total Wine, the other for a family operation in Memphis ). TWSRA, a trade association representing the state’s liquor stores, threatened to sue if the state did not follow the law and deny their applications. In other words, industry reps used restrictive licensing requirements to keep out competition in a move so ham-fisted that it could be a case study for an Economics 101 class on “rent-seeking” and the unintended consequences of regulation. Tennessee’s alcohol regulators complied, although, one gets the sense, somewhat reluctantly.
During Supreme Court arguments last month, Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed skepticism about the rather tortured reading of the 21st Amendment that justifies rules such as Tennessee’s. The amendment’s language prohibits the “transportation or importation” of alcohol into states that don’t want it, while saying nothing explicit about other powers the states have over alcohol regulation. The very existence of the 21st Amendment, however, implies that the Constitution views alcohol as different from other goods. The question is how different — and what does that difference mean to the states? The Court is considering TWSRA v. Blair in context of the Constitution’s protections for interstate commerce. It will likely decide whether Tennessee’s liquor-licensing rules are discriminatory against the residents of other states — and then whether the 21st Amendment actually allows such discrimination. Meanwhile, Justices Elena Kegan and Neil Gorsuch “fretted aloud” that a ruling against the two-year rule would undermine other state regulations on alcohol and welcome further legal challenges.
TWSRA’s view of state authority over alcohol is unsurprisingly broad. Representing the organization, attorney Shay Dvoretzky argued before the Court that the 21st Amendment does not have an “economic protectionism” exception. Even if Tennessee’s residency requirement is more concerned with protecting local businesses than with promoting safe alcohol consumption or supporting consumers, Tennessee is well within its rights to enforce it. Justice Stephen Breyer noted that past courts seemed to concur with that understanding of the 21st Amendment: “The history favors the other side,” Breyer told Total Wine’s attorney. A little later, while reflecting on the last century of alcohol laws, Breyer added : “Not all laws make that much sense.”"
FBI Trump Investigation: Legitimate Concern or Partisan Malice? | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Rich Lowry,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/mueller-probe-fbi-investigation-questions/,"April 12, 2019 6:30 AM Attorney General William Barr testifies on Capitol Hill, April 10, 2019. (Erin Scott/Reuters) The Mueller probe was a national trauma.
A ttorney General William Barr dared to use the “s-word.”
He said in congressional testimony that the Trump campaign had been spied on by the U.S. government. Pressed by incredulous Senate Democrats, he clarified: “I think spying did occur. The question is whether it was adequately predicated.”
“Spying” has a negative connotation, so perhaps “surveilling” would be the better way to put it. But a key question is indeed whether there was “improper surveillance” of the campaign, as Barr stated at another point in the hearing. Advertisement
Barr is committed to reviewing the conduct of the Russia investigation, which is getting denounced as an outrage by his critics. But why shouldn’t the attorney general seek to understand his department’s role in the high-stakes investigative melodrama of the past two years?
The Mueller probe was a national trauma. Its boosters didn’t experience it as such, of course. They enjoyed it and played it up and hoped for the very worst. But it cast a shadow over the White House, occupied an inordinate share of the nation’s political attention, and saddled innocent people with large legal bills. Advertisement
And for what? To establish that the far-fetched theory that the Russians coordinated with the Trump campaign indeed wasn’t true, and to take a pass on pronouncing one way or the other whether President Donald Trump allegedly obstructed justice?
You don’t have to be a deep-state conspiracy theorist to want to know how this got started and why. Advertisement
We should try to find out as reliably as possible how much FBI and other officials were legitimately freaked out by some of the Russia connections of Trump associates, and how much they were acting in an amateurish panic and out of partisan malice.
How was it that a garbage anti-Trump dossier gathered by an ex–foreign spy from shadowy Russian sources came to set so much of the media narrative about the Russia probe, and evidently have an outsize influence on the thinking and the actions of the FBI? Advertisement
It may be that without the dossier, there wouldn’t have been a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against Carter Page. Barr is surely at least thinking of Page when he talks of spying. It’s true that the FISA warrant on Page was approved after he had left the campaign, but the surveillance would have extended both forward and backward in time, to likely include campaign communications.
And the FBI obviously had the campaign in mind. It wrote in the FISA application, “The FBI believes that the Russian government’s efforts are being coordinated with Page & perhaps other individuals associated with [Trump’s] campaign.” Advertisement
How was it that the FBI opened an investigation against the president when he fired its director? And why did it apparently think it could make an obstruction-of-justice case against Trump for acting within his lawful powers?
In the aftermath of the firing of James Comey, why did Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appoint Robert Mueller, in part, to investigate the cashiering of Comey that he was party to, and without specifying the crime that the president was being investigated for, as required under the special-counsel regulation?
The appointment of Mueller was so momentous because once you have a special counsel, even a highly professional one, you have an investigative beast roaming the landscape that will inevitably command an enormous amount of attention and find crimes to prosecute even if they are removed from his original charge.
Of course, this is one of the reasons why Mueller had such fervent support among Trump’s detractors. But there is no reason that Barr should share their assumptions, or their horror at the idea of finding out more about the investigation that they portrayed as the single most important event in American public life.

Georgetown University student government passed a referendum Thursday night that, if approved by the administration, would create a reparations fund to compensate the descendants of slaves who were sold to keep the university open.
A campus group called the GU272 Advocacy Team (in a nod to the 272 slaves the school sold in 1838 to pay off its outstanding debts) created the referendum, which calls for the implementation of a $27.70 per-semester fee to create a reconciliation fund that would be overseen by a board comprised of students and slave descendants.
The group estimates the fund would raise more than $400,000 annually to “be allocated for charitable purposes directly benefiting the descendants of the GU272 and other persons once enslaved by the Maryland Jesuits,” according to the bill, which was obtained by CNN .
“The vestiges of slavery are still so evident, and so many of the African Americans whose ancestors were enslaved are still so disenfranchised,” GU272 member Eliza Dunni Phillips told CNN. “It’s not enough to say sorry. Georgetown has to put their money where their mouth is and invest into the descendant community.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

(Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah/Reuters) One of the world’s most brutal dictators has just fallen. What comes next is key.
S udan’s long-time president, Omar al Bashir — among the world’s most ruthless rulers — was arrested yesterday in a military coup that followed four months of popular protests in Khartoum, the country’s capital. Whatever other charges he will face for terror and corruption, he should be promptly tried for his worst offense: genocide.
In 70 years since the adoption of the U.N.’s Genocide Convention, only two genocides have been officially recognized by the U.S. government while they were still occurring. The first was the Bashir regime’s genocide in the western Darfur region. In mid 2004, a few months after the Darfur conflict began and a few months before the Bush administration recognized the genocide, the State Department dispatched a team to refugee camps across the border in Chad. The team interviewed survivors from the Muslim Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa tribes, which were targeted for extermination.
A preeminent expert in the field, Gregory Stanton, summarized the “shocking” survey results:
Over 60 percent of the people interviewed had witnessed the killing of a family member. Two-thirds had witnessed the killing of a non-family member. Over 80 percent had witnessed destruction of a village. Two-thirds had witnessed aerial bombing of villages by the Sudanese government. And perhaps most chillingly, one-third had heard racial epithets used while they or their relatives were being murdered or raped. Assailants often shouted, “Kill the slaves” and “We have orders to kill all the blacks.”
The survey’s findings convinced the administration to declare the Bashir regime’s campaign in Darfur a racially motivated genocide. All told, the State Department estimates that over 300,000 tribesmen have died in in the region, and hundreds of thousands remain displaced today.
Despite an arrest warrant for genocide issued against him by the International Criminal Court in 2010, Bashir remained president and protected from prosecution. He continued to receive crucial diplomatic and financial support from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Turkey, Russia, South Africa, China, and the Arab League, among others.
As I wrote 15 years ago in these pages, Darfur should be counted as Bashir’s second genocide. He waged the first from the early 1990s to 2002, against the Christians and animists of southern Sudan and the people of the Nuba Mountains. That bloody campaign was undertaken in response to a rebellion against the forcible imposition of sharia law, which violated guarantees of southern autonomy included in the 1972 Addis Ababa Agreement. Though the Nuba are mostly Muslim, they resisted Bashir’s call to jihad against the south and were consequently declared “apostates,” marked for death along with non-Muslims, in a 1993 government fatwa. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
Over 2 million eventually perished and 5 million were displaced as a result. Bashir used, as he would again in Darfur, a combination of military and militia tactics, inflicting deliberate mass starvation and sanctioning widespread rape, enslavement, and bombing and strafing of hospitals, schools, and other civilian structures. It ended in 2005 with the Sudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement (SCPA). Its traumatic legacy lives on in the unending conflict and political dysfunction of South Sudan, which became an independent country under the terms of the SCPA.
For 30 years, Bashir led a military dictatorship bent on forcibly Islamicizing and Arabizing Sudan’s disparate tribes and religious groups. His regime carried out amputations, stonings, and other harsh punishments for such offenses as women wearing pants instead of skirts, the consumption of alcohol, adultery, homosexuality, and apostasy and blasphemy against Islam.

A young man, a private citizen, whose only offense was traveling to Washington, D.C., to march for life, was transformed at light speed into a symbol of hate and systemic oppression. However, just as Nick Sandmann’s reputation as a villain was about to set in stone, additional videos revealed that the students’ encounter with a far-left American Indian activist and the Black Hebrew Israelites was far more complicated than initially reported. The Covington Catholic boys had been smeared. People who cast themselves as agents of professional knowledge, expertise, and moral authority had circulated and amplified a lie in the service of a political agenda. Not for the first nor last time.
We were told Jussie Smollett, a rising gay African-American actor and singer, had been the victim of a hate crime committed by MAGA-hat-wearing Trump supporters in the dead cold of a Chicago night. Journalists and bloggers who asked questions about Smollett’s story were decried as bigots, even as key details went missing and the shifting timeline became more and more curious. Then the city’s African-American police commissioner announced Smollett had been arrested for orchestrating a bizarre hoax. The state’s attorney filed charges — charges subsequently dropped after behind-the-scenes lobbying by Michelle Obama’s former chief of staff. Advertisement
We were told that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin were in cahoots to hack the emails of the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign; that Trump might have been a Russian agent since the late 1980s; that the key to the conspiracy might be a server in Trump Tower relaying information to a Russian bank; that the indictment of Donald Trump Jr. was imminent; that Trump Sr., according to the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, had committed “treason”; that Michael Cohen had met with Russian intelligence operatives in Prague; that Trump had directed Michael Flynn to speak to the Russians prior to Election Day 2016; that Trump had instructed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress; that Paul Manafort had met with Julian Assange in the Ecuadoran embassy in London during the campaign; that secret indictments in an Alexandria courthouse would be unsealed on the day Robert Mueller filed his report on possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. None of it happened. Advertisement
We were told that Michael Avenatti, a trial attorney who appeared seemingly out of nowhere to represent Stephanie Cliffords, a.k.a “Stormy Daniels,” in her (tossed-out) defamation suit against Donald Trump, was a defender of the rule of law and election integrity who posed, in the words of Stephen Colbert, an “existential threat” to the Trump presidency. Avenatti appeared incessantly on cable news, earning the equivalent of $175 million in media exposure between March and May 2018. Last September, an article in Politico Magazine carried the headline, “Michael Avenatti Is Winning the 2020 Democratic Primary.” When Avenatti said he represented a client who had been a victim of gang rapes and druggings at parties attended by Brett Kavanaugh during high school, NBC News interviewed the client despite being unable to verify her (ludicrous) accusation. By last November, when he was arrested for domestic assault in Los Angeles, Avenatti had appeared on television more than 200 times in the space of eight months. Advertisement
On the morning I wrote this column, a federal grand jury indicted Avenatti on 36 counts, including fraud. “Defendant AVENATTI would embezzle and misappropriate settlement proceeds to which he was not entitled,” reads just one sentence of the mind-boggling 61-page indictment. What media authorities had presented as true — that Avenatti was a serious attorney whose evidence would destroy the Trump presidency — has been revealed, once again, as utterly fallacious, a con. It’s up to the jury to decide if Michael Avenatti is a criminal. What’s beyond dispute, has been for a while, is that he is an unserious person, out for attention, celebrity, the notoriety and status fame brings. In the months of his ascendance, however, cable anchors and journalists did their best to avoid or downplay the truth of Avenatti’s character, lest it distract from their attack on the president’s.

National Gallery’s Tintoretto Show Falls Short | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Brian T. Allen,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/tintoretto-art-show-national-gallery/,"April 13, 2019 4:30 AM The Abduction of Helen , c. 1576/1577, by Jacopo Tintoretto. Oil on canvas. (Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid © Museo Nacional del Prado) There are a few great works on offer, but most of his masterpieces didn’t make the trip.
I thought very carefully about how to review the National Gallery’s messy new Tintoretto show. I respect everyone involved and wrote two pieces about the show’s majestic incarnation in Venice earlier this year, mounted in honor of his 500th birthday. The show in Washington is the first Tintoretto retrospective in America. It’s really not a retrospective, though, unless we’ve invented a new genre of show called “retrospective lite.” Now, the Venice version? That was a real retrospective. The problem with the Washington? It doesn’t do justice to Tintoretto. Advertisement
What is a retrospective? Traditionally, it’s a big, lumbering thing assembling an artist’s best work over his entire career. It captures the artist’s spirit, depth, and genius and has almost all the seminal things and his best work. It is usually accompanied by new scholarship, but it’s also historiographical. How has the artist’s reputation evolved, and why are we fascinated by him now?
In one of my pieces on the Venice show, I questioned whether a truly satisfying Tintoretto retrospective could occur outside Venice and speculated that this might not be possible, though the National Gallery was the one to try. It has borrowing power and tons of money. After seeing the show in Washington, the answer is not only “they couldn’t” but also to note that what they might have been able to do, they didn’t. Advertisement
There are some core questions before a retrospective is undertaken. Is the art available? There are some artists — Michelangelo and Pinturicchio immediately spring to mind — whose iconic, seminal works are stationary. They might be tombs, and some of Michelangelo’s best work is funerary. You don’t discommode the dead willy-nilly. And don’t think about the Sistine Ceiling. It’s fresco, as are Pinturicchio’s cinematic library paintings in the Duomo in Siena. Architects, too, get the short end of the stick. Buildings don’t travel. The great park designer Frederic Law Olmsted’s 200th birthday is next year. He’s a great artist, but how do you do a show when the work is land, views, water, and flowers?
You can do shows on aspects of these artists, like the Met’s splendid show on Michelangelo’s drawings. You call this show a “drawings retrospective.” That’s fine. It was a great retrospective, with close to 300 drawings and covering all bases. Most very fine artists don’t deserve any kind of retrospective. They’ve had good decades or even only a few good years and then run out of gas or become hacks doing only what the art market wants. Andy Warhol, as we saw in the recent Whitney retrospective, was truly transformative only in the 1960s. The curator spilled gallons of ink and exposed us to some dreadful art in an effort to establish that the junk he did from his Chairman Mao in 1972 until he died in 1987 wasn’t junk. Curators doing retrospectives often get that giddy, that blinkered. Advertisement Advertisement
Retrospectives don’t need to be huge, but they need to be comprehensive, which is different from representative. I did a Mark Tobey retrospective with 90 objects. That was enough. I was involved in an Alfred Maurer retrospective, to my regret. The show was too big, and it merely established what a very spotty artist he was.
What do you do under any of these circumstances? You don’t do the retrospective. Or you focus on a narrower topic. Or you work on another artist. Advertisement
I don’t think a retrospective on Tintoretto could be done without work from the Scuola San Rocco, the Doge’s Palace, and his parish church (the church of the Madonna dell’Orto) — all in Venice. For many reasons, this work doesn’t travel, not that it physically can’t, but it’s not practical. San Rocco was his anchor commission, his Sistine Chapel, with dozens of paintings and an encyclopedic array of his quirks, tricks, and talents at their finest. I assume the masters at San Rocco look at each of the great ones as part of an indivisible whole.
To its credit, the National Gallery got two minor pictures from this cycle only because they’d just been cleaned and had been in conservation, thus gone, for a while. Their brushy, billboard quality merely makes us want to see more, and want to see the highlights of what is one of the great monuments of Western art.
The Doge’s Palace reception rooms have his big, late work. It’s not his best, and there were often hands other than his involved. At that point, Tintoretto had, through his grit and vision, built Tintoretto, Inc., both a workshop and a reputation as Venice’s high-end artist. This would not have been predicted given his disputatious persona, lone-wolf mentality, Titian’s subversion of his career, and competition from Veronese. These late things are the final fruits of his labor. They’re noisy, even frantic, and important. They’re also huge. They’d need a cargo plane to move and giant spaces for display. Madonna dell’Orto contains Tintoretto’s three massive paintings of Moses, the Crucifixion, and the Presentation at the Temple. They cemented his fame. These, too, are enormous. Two are 50 feet tall.

The retrospective in Venice worked for reasons distinct to Venice and Italy. First, it was marketed as a Tintoretto extravaganza. It was assumed that serious people — and this is not merely a tiny fraction of people traveling to Venice — would also get to one, two, or all three of these outlying places. The staterooms of the Doge’s Palace with their in situ Tintorettos were just steps away from the show. Many of the visitors who saw the show were Italians and from Venice or the Veneto. Yes, there are still Italians who live in Venice, and Venice has suburbs on the mainland. The extravaganza was for them, too, and it’s easy for them to cover the spots over time.
Tintoretto’s birthday extravaganza, at least the traveling-loan part of it, was actually at two separate museums. The early work was displayed at the Accademia across town. It was a big, serious show that I thought was more coherent, satisfying, and beautifully displayed than the show of work from the 1550s onward at the Doge’s Palace. The Accademia show concluded with the big picture that made Tintoretto famous, The Miracle of the Slave , from 1548. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
The Miracle of the Slave is a showstopper and shows the young Tintoretto as a master designer and choreographer. If there was any way to get it to Washington, it would have, maybe, redeemed this iffy enterprise. The director of the Accademia just retired, but she is a worldly person and so might have allowed it. If it couldn’t get out of the Accademia building, and this is a possibility, then that is a serious reason not to do the show, unless you could have pried things from San Rocco, the Orto church, or the Doge’s Palace.
Second, the extravaganza worked in Venice because it’s Italy. I have seen few important museum shows in Italy that are installed with the same standards as in American or British museums. There’s always some incongruous, even bizarre feature. We expect that and edit it out. Sometimes it’s bad lightening, sometimes it’s weird spaces, sometimes surly or snoring guards, and often it’s haphazard interpretation. Advertisement
You expect, as in the case of Tintoretto, to see a retrospective in two separate museums. You expect to wander to three other places in Venice to see lots of major Tintorettos and a dozen other churches if you’re really committed to see individual altarpieces. The Venice retrospective succeeded because, in terms of marketing and how the curators arranged the shows there, visitors were almost commanded to go the extra mile, literally. Italians expect you to absorb things by osmosis, slowly, in bits and pieces. In Washington, you don’t, can’t, and shouldn’t. You have to do it in one place, with the best work, or don’t do it at all.
There is a self-inflicted, design problem, too. Elsewhere in the National Gallery, tucked away as if by stealth, is a version of the lovely Tintoretto drawings show that I saw at the Morgan Library last year. I found it totally by accident. This drawings show is not well publicized in the main Tintoretto galleries. Why was this show not simply integrated into the Tintoretto show? The only reason I can think for this is that the drawings show, done by another curator at another museum, undercuts one of the big Tintoretto show’s central themes. The big show makes much of Tintoretto’s spontaneity. The Morgan Library’s drawings show tells a story of an exacting, painstaking planner who thought long and hard about design and composition and didn’t simply paint whatever came into his head at a given moment.
Could the shows have been combined? Possibly. Should they have been separated, with one show in the proverbial “undisclosed location?” Of course not. If space was the big issue, my suggestion would have been either to find bigger space, do only the drawings show, or to do nothing but call FTD and send Tintoretto a birthday bouquet.
Some of the borrowed splendors in the Venice shows weren’t in Washington. Susanna and the Elders , surely one of the most gorgeous nudes ever painted, wasn’t there. We know it could travel because it made it to Venice from Vienna. The selection of portraits in the show — Tintoretto’s portraits are almost all owned by public collections — is good. Where was Christ Among the Doctors ? It’s big, early, splendid, from the Duomo’s museum in Milan, and was cleaned just before the Accademia show. It made it to Venice. It has the whiff of juvenilia, but it’s still brilliant, with the very young Tintoretto experimenting with ideas he would soon perfect. Why is St. Martial in Glory from 1549 displayed separately, in a room a football field’s distance from the show, in a separate space? It’s a fine, very big picture, and there are things in the Tintoretto show that are bigger, so it wasn’t a question of low ceilings.
There are great things in the Washington show, to be sure. The portraits are strong, but, for Tintoretto, portraiture was a sideline. The Abduction of Helen from the Prado is there, and it’s fabulous. The Origin of the Milky Way , The Nine Muses , and Tarquin and Lucretia are three great nudes, and while they’re luscious, they make points that have recently been made for American audiences in the MFA Boston’s 2009 show on Tintoretto, Veronese, and Titian.

(© RMN-Grand Palais / Art Resource, NY, Jean Gilles-Berizzi)
The Tintoretto show’s interpretation, graphics, lighting, and wall colors are perfect. The catalogue by Frederick Ilchman and Robert Echols is fine. It covers lots of old ground beautifully, with a new twist or two. It’s an important book. The separate catalogue for the Tintoretto show held at the Accademia was published only in Italian. The National Gallery could have done something meaningful and produced an English-language version of this very good book.
I think the justification of “well, there are some nice Tintorettos in the show” goes only so far. The Prado did a big Tintoretto show ten years ago, with a fine catalogue. I’m not sure the catalogue by Ilchman and Echols adds much to the Tintoretto scholarship there or in the fantastic Boston show on Tintoretto, Titian, and Veronese, which was, after all, an Ilchman and Echols show, too.

Studying Classical Literature in Our Age of Technology | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Howard Butcher,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/classical-literature-study-homer-the-iliad-modern-technology/,"April 13, 2019 4:30 AM Achilles Removing Patroclus’ Body From the Battle , c. 1547, by Léon Davent. (Metropolitan Museum of Art) Is technology killing students’ ability to read classical literature?
C aprock Academy, an academically accelerated charter school in Grand Junction, Colo., has the generous policy of giving every student in literature classes new copies of every text studied. (In neighboring public schools, the books are typically loaned to students and must be returned unmarked.) The intent is that Caprock students, many of whom could not otherwise afford to buy the books, begin to build their own personal libraries of great literature and become lifelong readers. The policy also enables students to annotate the texts. Advertisement Advertisement
Many students cherish the books and take good care of them, but some do not. In the spring, on the last day of school, one can walk down the hall and find discarded texts on the floor by the lockers and crammed in the big trash cans at the end of the hallways. The books are tossed amongst the flotsam and jetsam students have emptied out of their lockers in preparation for summer break. Some have broken spines and torn pages. Other copies are almost in pristine condition. The high-school English teachers call these books “orphans,” and we rescue them from the trash. What is interesting, however, is which books get thrown out.
Caprock Academy offers a classical education, and students are given approximately six books a year in core literature classes. For example, freshmen read The Epic of Gilgamesh , Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey , Sophocles’ Three Theban Plays , Hesiod’s Theogony and Works and Days , and Aeschylus’ Oresteia . They also study Virgil’s Aeneid in Latin I. Advertisement
Although the evidence is anecdotal and fluctuates a bit year to year, certain books appear in the trash with greater regularity than others. Emerson’s Essays and Poems , Hesiod’s Theogony and Works and Days, Virgil’s Aeneid, Milton’s Paradise Lost, and Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin seem to get orphaned more than most — four to seven copies of each out of roughly 40 students per grade level. To be sure, Homer’s epic poems are thrown out as well, but not in the numbers one might expect. Many students like and keep their copies of The Iliad . This begets the questions how — and why — does Homer’s 3,000-year-old epic poem speak to Generation Z?
Today’s teenagers live in a technology-driven world that consumes many of them. Virtually every student has a smartphone, and many of them have Facebook pages, Snapchat or Instagram accounts, and a selfie obsession. Some students spend incredible hours playing on their XBox or PlayStation 4. I’ve overheard students bragging about how much time they devote to video games — one 17-year-old proudly calculated that he’d spent two years of his life playing one single game. Unsurprisingly, this student barely graduated from high school, despite being a conspicuously bright young man. How his parents couldn’t see that he was addicted to video games and intervene, I’ll never know. Advertisement Advertisement
My students and my children tell me horror stories about sexting, catfishing, and predators in chat rooms. When teenagers want to take a break from social media or video games, they can binge-watch Neflix, Amazon Prime, or YouTube or stream free porn 24/7. This kind of extraordinary distraction and endless, irresistible entertainment presents problems that are new in the history of human development. Technology has delivered a true kind of soma and many kids seem to be drowning in it.
The unfettered use of technology and social media by young children is a direct threat to a student’s ability to read and study in a sustained and thoughtful way. They are incredibly distracted by the ceaseless buzz of their phones. Even if they read well, technology has harmed many of them: shortened attention spans, a compulsion to overshare every trivial detail of their lives, an expectation that they be entertained at all times, and an exaggerated focus on themselves. All these problems become evident in the classroom and become obstacles teachers must overcome. Advertisement
The problem is best addressed and solved by responsible parents who are willing to take a hard line and limit or deny access to all the aforementioned starting at birth — until, at the very least, children have become proficient readers and enjoy books and physical activity. However, responsible parents are in short supply. One hears a lot about a crisis in education. An even bigger problem, based on my experience, is the crisis in parenting. Advertisement
In today’s environment, engaging students effectively often requires appealing to their self-interest. At the beginning of The Iliad , I ask the girls in the class: How would you feel if an army of men was fighting over you ? The girls’ responses differ quite a bit: Some like the idea, but most usually don’t want people to die fighting for them. Then, the next day, the boys are asked: Would you fight a war for a woman? The answers vary, but interestingly, there is often a bit more of a consensus: For the right woman, many would fight. The conversations usually initiate reasonably serious thought and students refine and amend their answers as the class discussion evolves. This approach allows them to imagine the conflict as if they were a character in the text and it becomes a little easier to draw them into the story. Advertisement Advertisement
There is no getting around the fact that to read and comprehend Homer, students must apply themselves for an extended period of time: The Iliad is 24 books long. They take quizzes and exams, do close readings of key passages, engage in Socratic discussions, and write a ten-page end-of-year paper on “The Role of the Hero in Society.” But there must be more than rigor in a teacher’s pedagogy if one wants to engage Generation Z and genuinely educate them.
Probably the most popular and in some ways effective way to engage students is to assign Iliad projects. The assignment generates enthusiasm for the text and deepens students’ understanding of the epic by allowing them to interpret it in a personal and hands-on way. They work as individuals or in groups and are free to choose the project — as long as it has legitimate academic merit. Some use their skill and talent with technology to make remarkably accurate movie adaptations of key scenes: to do this well, students must read and comprehend the text. Presentations have included dioramas of battle scenes, models of Greek ships, PowerPoint or Prezi presentations on the weapons of the Trojan War, the gods, diseases, and burial rites. One popular choice is making a replica of the famous shield Hephaestus, the god of fire, forges for Achilles.
One student, Brianne Pinson, made a stunning version of Achilles’ shield for my class and won first place in the local Altrusa Art Fair with her work. However, discussing Achilles’ shield and all it signifies usually takes a very sobering turn. When I recently asked my class: If you were to make the modern equivalent of Achilles’ shield, what images should be put on the front? It only took a few seconds before someone answered, “A smart phone right in the middle.” Then another student said, “Someone using a smart phone to film a person being beat up, not helping the victim, but making a video to post on YouTube.” The class grew uncharacteristically somber as students considered these remarks. Shield of Achilles by Brianne Pinson
What happens to Achilles while he’s withdrawn from the war is another moment that offers lessons that many students are open to learning. Away from the frenzy of battle, quietly in his tent, he has time for introspection. It is after this quiet time that he rejects the war and his culture, especially the pursuit of honor and glory (timê and kleos, in Greek). Achilles plans to sail home and live a longer but modest life of anonymity. For the students, this is an excellent moment for a Socratic discussion about the importance of unplugging from technology in order to be introspective, to follow the Greek admonition to know thyself, and also to discuss the value of questioning one’s culture — and rejecting it, if needed.
Every fall, Caprock Academy has a USO show to honor our armed forces. The names of every veteran or active-duty service member related to students, faculty, or the administration are projected onto the gym wall throughout the concert. Honoring the men and women who fight and protect the country enriches some students’ understanding of The Iliad. Many can recognize the poignancy of certain moments, like when Hector’s son bursts into tears when he sees his father, helmet on, about to return to war. The modern equivalent of this scene plays out locally at the Grand Junction regional airport when loved ones in uniform deploy and leave their families behind. Advertisement
This awareness makes it easier for students to appreciate the sacrifices military men and women make and also to understand what classical scholar Victor Davis Hanson calls “the tragic view of life.” It is a central premise in The Iliad . To wit , Zeus’s assessment of mankind in the Fagles translation: “There is nothing alive more agonized than man of all that breathe and crawl across the earth.” This leads to a discussion about whether Zeus is right about mankind and what is meant by the term “the human condition.” Students point to the cruelty of Internet trolls as evidence that Zeus is right. Advertisement
After Hector kills Patroclus, Achilles is so devastated by the loss that he does things that, as a Greek soldier, he would not normally do and that are outside the norms of the society: human sacrifices, defiling the corpse of Hector (which the gods preserve despite Achilles’ best efforts), and refusing to bury Patroclus until his ghost implores Achilles to do so. These events raise the question of whether extreme situations such as war have the ability to dehumanize and transform human beings — and then, if there is a need and a duty afterwards, for society to help heal and reassimilate warriors back into domestic life.
Next, we look to see if Homer addresses the idea of warriors rejoining civilian life and processing grief. King Priam risks his life and crosses enemy lines in the dead of night to beg Achilles for Hector’s body back. The vulnerable old man goes into the Greek camp and straight into the proverbial lion’s den — but is not eaten by the lion. I ask the class: Why not? What accounts for this moment of grace? Is there something about the old man that stirs Achilles’ heart? Perhaps King Priam’s courage and his overwhelming love for his son? Something about the bond between any father and his son? Or maybe it is the anguish and loss radiating off the great man.
Priam says, “I have endured what no man on earth has ever done before — I put to my lips the hands of the man who killed my son.” Achilles is shocked to see Priam and disarmed by his words. Homer describes his reaction: “Those words stirred within Achilles a deep desire to grieve for his own father. Taking the old man’s hand he gently moved him back. And overpowered by memory both men gave way to grief.” Achilles softens and weeps and breaks down. His enemy does the same. Both men have been devastated by what each side has done to the other.
After they share a meal, Achilles allows King Priam to leave with his son’s corpse so the proper burial rites can be observed. In the end, Achilles lets go of his rage. He shows decency and respect to the old king, and thus rejoins humanity.
By the end of the narrative, even Generation Z can sense some of the wisdom, terrible beauty, and sadness alive in Homer’s work, but I’d be lying if I didn’t write that many students find it anticlimactic. Where is the Trojan horse? When does Achilles get shot in the ankle? What about the sacking of Troy? Of course none of these events happen in The Iliad — just in Hollywood’s version. The true version ends beautifully and gracefully with Hector’s funeral and interment.
Very few high-school freshmen can grasp Homer’s depth or appreciate the scale and intricacy of his work. If the students are snorkelers looking at a beautiful reef in a tropical sea, their masks are fogged and the dazzling fish and ethereal world moves behind a curtain of mist. However, if one can bring them close enough to see a little bit of the reef clearly, then the hope is that one day they will return, older and wiser, with a clearer mask, and see the whole reef in its full majesty."

Bernie Sanders is newly vocal defender of making a lot of money , now that it has emerged that he himself is a millionaire:
“I didn’t know that it was a crime to write a good book which turns out to be a bestseller,” Sanders said at a community meeting in Gary, Indiana. Comments
Since Sanders described himself as a millionaire earlier this week, he and his campaign have stressed that his policy platform, which is fiercely critical of “billionaires” and wealthy corporate interests, like private insurers and pharmaceutical companies, is unchanged. His Medicare for All push has been colored by relentless attacks on those industries.
“My view has always been that we need a progressive tax system which demands that the wealthiest people in this country finally start paying their fair share of taxes. If I make a lot of money, you make a lot of money, that is what I believe,” Sanders added, defiant and plainly frustrated by the line of questioning. “So again, I don’t apologize for writing a book that was number three on the New York Times best seller, translated into five or six languages, and that’s that.”"

W hen customers visit an Enterprise Rent-a-Car establishment for the first time, they are often pleasantly surprised to be waited on by a staff of young managers, typically in their 20s, well dressed, polite, and efficient. The situation is much in contrast to many operations that employ middle-aged managers and hire young people to work their way up doing routine tasks. At Enterprise, the youngsters actually run the show, and they do it very well. And it is not an accident. Enterprise adopted a policy several years ago of hiring young college graduates to staff their local rental agencies. It is a policy that is paying off both for the company and for the young employees, who quickly learn the ins and outs of managing an office. Advertisement Advertisement
Enterprise offers more entry-level jobs for college graduates than almost any other employer in the United States. Last year they hired 8,500 for their management-training program, 40 percent more than the next highest employer. But according to a recent cover story in the Chronicle of Higher Education , Enterprise does not concern itself with questions such as where its trainees went to college, what they majored in, or even how well they did when they were there. “We recognize that great talent can come from all types of institutions, all types of majors and backgrounds,” Marie Artim, Enterprise’s vice president for talent acquisition, explained.
As the Chronicle notes, “to the company, a college degree matters mostly because it suggests that a candidate has acquired the right mix of skills to succeed in an entry-level job — and to move up the ladder from there.” Instead, the company simply takes a bachelor’s degree to signify that applicants can engage in some degree of critical thinking, problem solving, and juggling different responsibilities at the same time.

This is what economists such as Ohio University’s Richard Vedder and George Mason’s Bryan Caplan have been arguing for years: College degrees are simply a signifier — an easy way of telling an employer that you have a basic grasp of the English language, some rudimentary math skills, and the ability to show up on time in clean clothes. On those measures, is a graduate of the University of Michigan any different from a graduate of Michigan State or Northern Michigan University? Not really. Does a 3.8 GPA predict that you will do better or worse at managing a car-rental office than someone with a 2.8 GPA? Probably not. Does majoring in business predict that you will do a better job than an English major or a sociology major or a physics major? It’s unlikely.
The management at Enterprise are saying aloud what many employers know to be true. Bosses who require a college degree are taking advantage of a system that does the sorting for them. They understand that a bachelor’s degree is not really necessary for doing an entry-level job, and that whatever your educational background, you will require significant training to do well in that particular position. Advertisement Advertisement
Surely there are plenty of high-school graduates who are qualified to run the front desk at a car-rental office. But finding out who those people are is more time-consuming than just looking at a résumé and seeing a bachelor’s degree. Too bad it costs most kids tens of thousands of dollars — not to mention the opportunity cost of several years out of the workforce — to get that piece of paper.
There are easier and cheaper ways to sort people. High schools could do more to teach the basic responsibility and functioning skills that they used to. In an age of helicopter parenting, though, many employers would wonder whether it was really parents who were responsible for high-functioning high-school students.
But surely a one- or two-year apprenticeship in any number of fields after high school could show the same evidence of critical thinking and responsibility. Unfortunately, the federal government does not subsidize those paths the same way we subsidize college education through financial aid. Such apprenticeship programs generally require the employer to take on the risk. When a potential employee drops out of such a program, the cost is borne by the employer. When someone drops out of college, the cost is borne only by the student and the taxpayer. Advertisement"
‘Abortion Restrictions Don’t Work’: A Dubious Claim | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Blanchette,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/abortion-restrictions-dont-work-dubious-claim/,"April 15, 2019 6:30 AM Signs outside the Supreme Court during the March for Life rally, January 27, 2017. (Aaron O. Bernstein/Reuters) A comforting thought for moderate pro-choicers is not supported by the available data.
S ome pro-choice advocates argue that having an abortion is perfectly morally acceptable, either because a fetus has little to no moral significance, or because a woman’s right to bodily autonomy always prevails over whatever rights a fetus might have. Some even go so far as to celebrate the act of having an abortion as a manifestation of female empowerment — the ultimate middle finger to the patriarchy. They hold that any and all abortion restrictions would amount to a violation of female bodily autonomy. Advertisement Advertisement
But many pro-choice advocates, especially among the rank-and-file, have a more moderate view. They concede that abortion is (at least usually) morally wrong or bad, perhaps even seriously so — even if women are often not blameworthy for having them. And yet they still believe that abortion should be legal. I would venture to say that this is the most common pro-choice position.
Pro-lifers are often baffled by this combination of beliefs, but some moderate pro-choicers have an explanation at the ready: Abortion restrictions don’t work . Instead of lowering the rate of abortion, they simply replace safe abortions with roughly the same number of unsafe “back alley” abortions. If a law does not reduce the incidence of the problematic behavior that it targets, and it also has costs attached to it — such as creating unsafe conditions for women seeking the procedure, or imposing unfair burdens on women in a society that often treats them unjustly — then that law is unjustified, even if abortion is morally wrong or bad.
The logic of this argument is above reproach. But the factual assertion at its heart — that abortion restrictions don’t work — does not stand up to scrutiny. Advertisement
In order to shore up this causal claim, pro-choice advocates typically rely on large-scale studies, such as a widely reported 2016 piece of research published in the Lancet , that report no correlation — and sometimes even an inverse correlation — between abortion restrictions and the rate of abortion across regions with stricter and looser abortion laws. For a concrete example of such an argument, we need go no further than the Guttmacher Institute, whose research scientist was the lead author of the Lancet study. An oft-referenced infographic on their website summarizes the relevant findings of the study as follows: “Highly restrictive laws do not eliminate abortion. Rather, they make the abortions that do occur more likely to be unsafe.” The graphic shows that the average rate of abortion in countries with strict abortion laws is comparable to the average rate of abortion in countries in which abortion is broadly legal. Advertisement
The key problem with using these estimates as evidence that abortion restrictions don’t affect abortion rates is that they do not account for confounding factors — i.e., they ignore the fact that countries with stricter abortion laws are also different in other ways that may affect abortion rates, a problem that the published study explicitly notes. While the report indeed finds that “abortion rates are not substantially different across groups of countries classified according to the grounds under which abortion is legally allowed,” it goes on to state that “the level of unmet need for contraception is higher in countries with the most restrictive abortion laws than in countries with the most liberal laws, and this contributes to the incidence of abortion in countries with restrictive laws.” Moreover, the vast majority of countries with more restrictive abortion laws are in developing regions, and poverty likely also has an impact on the abortion rates in these countries. Advertisement
It is not at all implausible that the abortion restrictions in these countries do, in fact, prevent many abortions from occurring, and that these countervailing factors act to bring their abortion rates in line with those of wealthier countries that have more liberal abortion laws. Indeed, when studies use rigorous methods to limit the problem of confounding factors, the evidence points in the opposite direction. Advertisement"
Holy Week Transcends Selfie Culture | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kathryn Jean Lopez,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/holy-week-transcends-selfie-culture/,"Follow Kathryn Jean Lopez on Twitter April 15, 2019 6:30 AM Pope Francis holds palm branches as he leads the Palm Sunday Mass in Saint Peter’s Square, April 14, 2019. (Remo Casilli/Reuters) Martyrdom has its attractions.
Rome — On the way to Mass on the Friday before Good Friday, I passed the Roman Colosseum. It’s hard to have things put in better perspective. Christians were once fed to the lions there, and now it’s the background to many a tourist selfie. Mass that morning was at the Basilica of Santo Stefano Rotondo al Monte Celi. TripAdvisor’s top “review” on it that same morning offered this description: “Slightly off the beaten track, Santo Stefano is a lovely, quiet church full of horror.” The “horror” no doubt refers to the frescoes of Christian martyrdom that line the ancient circular basilica. Does it become less horrific when you see the serene smiles if not outright joy on some of the faces as these people approach their end? It depends on whether you believe that the martyr is in for a new beginning.
Santo Stefano is a Station Church for the Fifth Week of Lent, part of a tradition that dates back to the fourth century for the penitential season. Though, I confess, when you don’t walk the whole path as the Millennial seminarians at the Pontifical North American College do, but take a taxi, it’s also a tremendous way to visit some of the churches of Rome — and before the tourists are awake. It’s a way to drink in the breadth and depth of the martyrs, remembering the import of faith — what that faith may call for, if one truly believes and truly is tested. If we are really paying attention, it is a reminder that testing takes many forms.
I’m in the Eternal City for friendship, fellowship, prayer, and what research and reporting that can be had. While I’m over here, the pope emeritus, Benedict XVI, has had some thoughts published on the origins of and solutions for the sex scandals in the Church. It makes a whole lot of sense that he would, given his lifetime of service and deep wells of wisdom. His comments are subject to all kinds of controversy and spin. But the most important line is this: “Only obedience and love for our Lord Jesus Christ can point the way.” That seemed the most appropriate line to highlight as we are set to mark the holiest season on the Christian calendar yet again. He also writes:
There are values which must never be abandoned for a greater value and even surpass the preservation of physical life. There is martyrdom. God is (about) more than mere physical survival. A life that would be bought by the denial of God, a life that is based on a final lie, is a non-life.
He notes that “martyrdom is a basic category of Christian existence.” So it would follow that “the very essence of Christianity is at stake here” if martyrdom is not a part of our lives. Of course, martyrs exist in the world today. A priest killed while celebrating Mass in France comes to mind. As do Coptic Christians and Iraqi Christians slaughtered by the so-called Islamic State.
He explains the importance of “the authority of the Church in matters of morality”: “Those who deny the Church a final teaching competence in this area force her to remain silent precisely where the boundary between truth and lies is at stake.”"

House speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the progressive faction of her caucus led by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as “like five people.”
In a 60 Minutes interview that aired Sunday, Pelosi was asked whether she could unify the “self-described socialists” and the “moderates” among House Democrats.
“By and large, whatever orientation they came to Congress with, they know that we have to hold the center. That we have to go down the mainstream,” she responded.
“But it doesn’t look like that. It looks as if it’s fractured. You have these wings– AOC, and her group on one side,” interviewer Lesley Stahl continued.
“That’s like five people,” Pelosi replied.
“The progressive group is more than five,” Stahl said. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“I’m a progressive,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi, 79, and Ocasio-Cortez, 29, have not clashed openly but have occasionally thrown shade at each other since the latter’s ascension to Congress earlier this year. In February, the speaker dismissed Ocasio-Cortez’s signature proposal, the Green New Deal, as the “green dream, or whatever they call it.” She also referenced the freshman congresswoman’s huge social-media following earlier this month during a discussion about the importance of being unified and working with the other side of the aisle."

Making the click-through worthwhile: Rising star Pete Buttigieg formally announces his 2020 presidential campaign, Democrats spend the weekend insisting that criticism is the same thing as inciting violence, and another conservative speaker is assaulted on a college campus.
The Mayor Is Having More than a Moment
On Sunday afternoon in South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg formally announced his intention to run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Standing on a stage in front of thousands, packed inside a former Studebaker assembly plant, the mayor claimed that he’s the best alternative to what’s going on in the nation’s capital. Advertisement Advertisement
“The horror show in Washington is mesmerizing. It’s all-consuming,” Buttigieg said in remarks he wrote himself. “But starting today, we’re going to change the channel.”
The pundit class has been chattering for weeks about the 37-year-old South Bend mayor who is “having a moment.” But how long does a moment have to last before it becomes something more? The Buttigieg rise answers our question. Over the last few months, he’s been the subject of profiles in New York magazine , the Washington Post , and The Cut , among many others (along with some less favorable coverage such as this lengthy, scathing critique in Current Affairs , which arguably indicates he’s a real threat to those who would prefer to see the nomination go to Bernie Sanders). Advertisement
For now, he’s occupying the lane that supporters of Beto O’Rourke hoped the failed Senate candidate would have all to himself. The former Texas congressman outraised Buttigieg in the first quarter, but not by much: He’s raked in about $9.4 million, while the mayor boasted $7 million. Their average donation sizes were comparable, though Buttigieg’s was a bit lower at $36.35 compared to O’Rourke’s $43. Advertisement
The Buttigieg campaign’s choice of the former Studebaker plant for his announcement says a lot about their strategy. The plant has been closed for decades, and it stands as a symbol of the economic downturn from which South Bend has never recovered. But today the plant is also the site of new data and education initiatives that Buttigieg has pushed as mayor in an effort to revitalize the city.
Unfortunately for citizens of South Bend, his revitalization efforts haven’t really worked. But the mayor clearly intends to continue portraying himself as a young, competent technocrat who can appeal to many of the same working-class voters — devastated by the loss of Studebaker equivalents across the Midwest — who turned to Donald Trump for hope in 2016. Advertisement
Judging from his policy proposals, Buttigieg is just one more flavor of progressive among several already on offer from this election cycle’s Democratic party. But he seems to understand that Trump had real appeal to real people for reasons other than racism, and in this Democratic field, that makes him something of a stand-out. Advertisement
Ilhan Omar vs. Donald Trump Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
The freshman Democratic congresswoman from Minnesota is once again under the microscope, this time after remarks she delivered at a Council on American-Islamic Relations event last month. Omar said that after the terrorist attacks on 9/11, she had faced anti-Muslim attacks and “lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen.”
“Frankly, I’m tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it,” Omar said. “CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.” Leaving aside the fact that CAIR was in fact founded in 1994, not in response to the 9/11 attacks, some have criticized Omar for her use of the flippant phrase “some people did something” to refer to an act of terrorism that took the lives of thousands of Americans.
This wasn’t the first time Omar has faced conservative ire; she has repeatedly trafficked in anti-Semitic slurs for which she has refused to apologize, and for which the Democratic party has yet to hold her accountable. Clearly sensing an opportunity to renew his rivalry with the young progressive congresswoman, President Trump tweeted a video featuring Omar’s remarks interspersed with footage of the burning World Trade Center towers and other images from 9/11.
Now, Omar claims the president’s tweet has put her in danger. “Since the president’s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life—many directly referencing or replying to the president’s video,” she wrote in a statement late Sunday night. More from Omar:
Violent crimes and other acts of hate by right-wing extremists and white nationalists are on the rise in this country and around the world. We can no longer ignore that they are being encouraged by the occupant of the highest office in the land. Counties that hosted a 2016 Trump rally saw a 226 percent increase in hate crimes in the months following the rally. And assaults increase when cities host Trump rallies. . . . This is endangering lives. It has to stop.
Many on the left, including several Democratic politicians and 2020 candidates spent the weekend insisting that right-wing criticism of Omar was directly putting her life in danger and “inciting violence” against her. “Inciting violence” is a highly specific legal category, and hardly any speech qualifies under that definition, so invoking it as a means of silencing Omar’s critics is nothing more than a hackneyed talking point.
These same commentators and elected officials had no qualms about Omar repeatedly spreading false accusations against the boys from Covington Catholic high school, and they rightly refrained from blaming Bernie Sanders for the Alexandria shooting in 2017, conducted by a former Sanders-campaign volunteer who targeted members of the congressional GOP citing his political beliefs.
The reaction to Omar’s comment at CAIR may have been a bit over the top, but the Democratic reaction to the criticism has been downright histrionic. Advertisement Advertisement
Violence on Campus
Unlike Congresswoman Omar, one conservative speaker has actually been subjected to assault in the last few days. Michael Knowles, a columnist for the Daily Wire , was assaulted late last week on the campus of the University of Missouri-Kansas City. Knowles was scheduled to give a talk entitled “Men Are Not Women,” hosted by the campus chapter of Young Americans for Freedom.
Protestors attended the talk and attempted to shout over Knowles’s remarks, holding signs that read “Trans rights are human rights,” “Respect my existence,” and “Trans men are men.” Finally, one protestor used a water gun to spray a “glitter-filled liquid” on Knowles, who tweeted immediately afterward that he initially thought it was bleach. Tests revealed it was “lavender oil and some other non-toxic household liquids.”
In response to the controversy, UMKC chancellor C. Mauli Agrawal released a statement affirming the First Amendment right to free speech, but not before he described Knowles as “a speaker whose professed opinions do not align with our commitment to diversity and inclusion and our goal of providing a welcoming environment to all people, particularly to our LGBT community.” Advertisement
I’m sure Democrats who spent the weekend accusing the president of bringing down violence on Omar’s head will be offering Knowles their support any day now . . . "

Warning. SPOILERS are ahead. If you don’t want to know anything about episode one of the final season of Game of Thrones , stop reading. Now.
Still reading? Good. Let’s get started in an unlikely place — church. A few weeks ago my pastor said during his sermon, “No one can control the consequences of sin.” One of the great deceptions of the enemy is the idea that you can get away with evil deeds, that you can manage your own compromises. You cannot. Advertisement Advertisement
The opening flashback scenes of the show took us back to a moment last season that I thought mainly stood on its own as a symbol of the war within Daenerys Targaryen’s soul — is she the ruthless daughter of the Mad King or is she the noble liberator who is going to “ break the wheel ” of oppression in Westeros? That moment was the brutal execution by dragon fire of Randyll and Dickon Tarly when they refused to bend the knee after their defeat in battle. Rather than imprison them, she give in to her worst instincts and roasted them.
Well those moral chickens came home to roost when she met Samwell Tarly, Jon Snow’s faithful friend and the man who helped discover Jon’s true lineage. She met him to thank him for saving Jorah Mormont, and she ended up disclosing one of her worst crimes. Samwell’s father was cruel to him, but he loved his brother. John Bradley plays Samwell, and he did an outstanding job conveying the change in emotions, from acceptance at his father’s death to true grief and anger at his brother’s execution. Advertisement
That moment meant that the disclosure of Snow’s true identity — as a Targaryen and the true heir to the Iron Throne — happened when Samwell was distraught, when he could plant seeds of doubt in Jon about Dany’s true character. Samwell put the question to Jon plainly. “You gave up the crown to save your people. Would she do the same?” Advertisement
And thus we saw the questions in Jon’s heart. He is the show’s honorable man — honorable sometimes to the point of foolishness. Daenerys is the show’s conflicted hero, torn between her quest for vengeance and her desire for justice. It was a masterful moment, and it illustrated that one moment in time — Daenerys’s impulsive decision to burn her honorable opponents rather than imprison them — could have consequences that turn the course of history. She did a terrible thing, and she can’t control what happens next.
The other key conflict in the first episode was between Sansa and Daenerys. Sansa’s character arc is one of the more fascinating of the series. She’s journeyed from starry-eyed young princess to perhaps one of the coldest and most shrewd characters on the show. She is every bit Daenerys’s intellectual and strategic equal, and despite Dany’s dragons, she is not intimidated in Dany’s presence. Advertisement
Finally, the first episode demonstrated the qualities that have made Game of Thrones a cultural sensation. It gets the big and the small things right. The opening scene capture the awesome might of Dany’s army, but it also captured the significant changes in her expression when her dragons shocked and awed the people of the north. Her slight smile when the people screamed in terror showed that Dany is perhaps just a bit too much in love with her own power. At the same time, the brief second between Sansa’s shock at the sight of the dragon and her obvious grim determination showed that she is and will be a match for Daenerys in the episodes to come.

Tax Cuts & Democrats -- Public Skepticism of Tax Cuts Is Normal | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Ramesh Ponnuru,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/public-skepticism-of-tax-cuts-is-normal/,"Follow Ramesh Ponnuru 12:44 PM
The Times article that Robert VerBruggen highlights below suggests that Democrats have been successful in misinforming the public about how many Americans have gotten a tax cut from the Republicans. But it’s probably not just political spin, or the design of that tax law, that caused people to underestimate the extent of the tax cut. Previous tax cuts have landed the same way. President George W. Bush, in his first term, passed two tax cuts that cut tax bills for everyone who paid income tax and raised taxes on nobody. In 2004, a New York Times /CBS News poll found that fewer than one in five Americans thought they had gotten a tax cut. Polls from the 1980s found that Americans were much more likely to think that the bipartisan tax reform of 1986, which in general reduced income taxes and raised corporate taxes, had raised their tax bills than lowered them.

Editor’s Note : This piece was first published in 2017 .
S ometimes my job sends me on flights. Sometimes the need to call on far-off family sends me on them. And often now they are smaller planes, from a regional airport. Some travelers don’t do as well with small planes. They react to the slightest bump or dip of turbulence with little yelps and moans. Some people giggle at them. And they giggle at themselves. But when those yelps and moans happen, I sometimes bring it to mind that the little dips and and jitters of a plane, the ones you want to discount with a giggle, would also be the first sign of real peril. So when the yelping comes from some passenger, I try to recall when I gave my last confession and say a prayer. Advertisement Advertisement
I do this because I’m haunted by the story of the crash of Air France Flight 447 in 2009. The plane disappeared into the Atlantic. At first most people thought it was a bomb, an act of terrorism. But years later, when the bodies and the black box were retrieved, the real story came out. I remember reading five or six accounts about how it happened. The plane hit a column of ice crystals in the sky. The autopilot mode shut off and the alarms started going crazy. The air-speed sensors were malfunctioning. All the pilots had to do was hold the plane steady. In one minute or so, the problems caused by the ice column would have cleared themselves up and the alarms would have ceased.
But the pilots responded by pulling the nose up. Already at a high altitude, the plane, predictably, went into a stall. Pulling the nose up meant losing lift, and the plane began to fall like a rock. A rock pointed upward. The pilots needed to push the nose of the plane down, and dive, to achieve lift again. They kept pulling up and the harder they did, the faster they fell. Advertisement
Years later, when the tapes of the pilots were released, and the true cause of the crash became known, all the great world tabloids — the Daily Mail , the New York Post — ran headlines of the final words of the pilot, blanked out: “F***, We’re dead!” Advertisement
Back to that in a minute.
One hundred and thirteen years ago, Marcel Proust wrote an essay in Le Figaro titled “La Mort des cathédrals.” A couple of years ago, near the beginning of a year of terror attacks in France, a popular Catholic blo g translated it into English. Proust was responding to a piece of anti-clerical legislation. He asked readers to imagine a future, centuries hence, in which the Christian religion had vanished from France, but the Gothic cathedrals — monuments to French genius — were still standing and admired. He wrote:
Then suppose that one day scholars manage, on the basis of documentary evidence, to reconstitute the ceremonies that used to be celebrated in them, for which men had built them, which were their proper meaning and life, and without which they were now no more than a dead letter; and suppose that for one hour artists, beguiled by the dream of briefly giving back life to those great and now silent vessels, wished to restore the mysterious drama that once took place there amid chants and scents — in a word, that they were undertaking to do what the Félibres have done for ancient tragedies in the theatre of Orange.
He asked: “Is there any government with the slightest concern for France’s artistic past that would not liberally subsidize so magnificent an undertaking? “
Well, in 2017, the rites of the Catholic religion aren’t yet entirely unknown in France. But I recently discovered that, contrary to Proust, there are limits to state subsidy. The French state does own the Cathedral of Notre Dame, and knows it is a major draw for tourists to Paris. The government kicks in about 2 million euros a year for basic maintenance. But pieces of the cathedral have been falling off it for years. Major repairs haven’t been tried since Marcel Proust was a teenager. The archbishop of Paris is now seeking about 100 million euros to do the work that needs to be done. And this fund-raising campaign is aimed partly at American s . Advertisement
I giggled at the solicitation for funds. Maybe the archbishop read one of those misleading Pew surveys that tout how “religious” America is compared with Europe. Maybe Americans are suckers for this kind of pitch: By contributing to the campaign to save Notre Dame, they’ve put an imaginary down payment on that long-dreamed-of trip to Paris. Advertisement Advertisement
There is a lot of gloom about Europe lately. A large Islamist terror cell tried to blow up the cathedral in Barcelona a few weeks ago, an as yet uncompleted modern masterpiece. Douglas Murray’s haunting and elegiac book The Strange Death of Europe dwells on how Europe lost its faith in Christ, and then lost faith in all the substitutes for Christianity: Fascism, Communism, human rights next, probably. Murray is not quite a believer, but he writes, “I cannot help feeling that much of the future of Europe will be decided on what our attitude is towards the church buildings and other great cultural buildings of our heritage standing in our midst.”
So what is the attitude to Notre Dame? Though the French state is its owner, it will not spend the money for necessary repairs. The local archbishop does not believe that he can raise the funds to keep this astounding testament to French history and genius locally, from the descendants of those who built it. Advertisement"

Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld announced Monday that he will mount a Republican primary challenge against incumbent Donald Trump.
Weld, who served as governor of the Bay State from 1991 to 1997, announced earlier this year that he’d formed an exploratory committee for a possible presidential run but waited until Monday to make his candidacy official in a statement.
“Ours is a nation built on courage, resilience, and independence. In these times of great political strife, when both major parties are entrenched in their ‘win at all cost’ battles, the voices of the American people are being ignored and our nation is suffering,” Weld said in the statement. “It is time for patriotic men and women across our great nation to stand and plant a flag. It is time to return to the principles of Lincoln – equality, dignity, and opportunity for all. There is no greater cause on earth than to preserve what truly makes America great. I am ready to lead that fight.”

In the days and weeks that follows, people will share their stories about Notre Dame. Here’s mine. On March 9, 1996, I walked into the great cathedral on the morning of my wedding day. The gravity of the moment was starting to sink in, and I wanted a place to pray. We Protestants are accustomed to thinking of the great cathedrals of Europe mainly as tourist attractions — as beautiful historical buildings and not as actual, living churches. That morning changed my heart.
It was too early for most tourists to arrive, so I walked past other worshipers, men and women on their knees before the Lord. I knelt also. I asked God’s blessing on my wedding, on my marriage, and on the children we hoped to have. In that moment, I felt the presence of God, but I also felt something else — for a moment I was staggered at the thought of the sheer number of people who’d knelt in this same spot and asked God for these same good things. I felt more connected to the larger body of Christ than I’d ever felt before. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
The Notre Dame I visited wasn’t just a beautiful building. It wasn’t just a marvel of medieval architecture. And it wasn’t just the center of the French nation — the place where kings and emperors were crowned. It was a symbol of an enduring church and God’s enduring presence. France will feel its loss more than it now understands. We all will. Advertisement"
Ilhan Omar: Criticism an Attack on Muslims | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D. Williamson,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/ilhan-omar-comments-criticism/,"About Kevin D. Williamson April 16, 2019 6:30 AM Rep. Ilhan Omar speaks about Trump administration policies towards Muslim immigrants outside the Capitol building in Washington, D.C., April 10, 2019. (Jim Bourg/Reuters) When the ‘victim’ is the victimizer
‘I t has to stop,” says Representative Ilhan Omar.
No, it does not.
Representative Omar, the Jew-hating Minnesota Democrat, is engaged in one of her usual games of misdirection, a pattern of hers that by now is familiar enough to be predicted: She says something outrageously stupid, offensive, anti-Semitic — or all three at once — and then attempts to parry the thrust of inevitable criticism by characterizing it as an attack on Muslims, women, women of color, Muslim women of color, etc. Advertisement Advertisement
In this case, Representative Omar characterized the events of September 11, 2001, this way: “Some people did something.” Someone assembled a video intercutting her blasé account of mass murder with images of that day’s events, and Donald Trump, who serves simultaneously as president of the United States and the nation’s social-media intern, tweeted the video, along with some vintage all-caps emoting: “WE WILL NEVER FORGET!”
The New York Times stepped on Representative Omar’s cue and uttered her lines itself, insisting that the criticism of Representative Omar is necessarily part of an attack on Muslims categorically. Trump of course has on more than one occasion treated Muslims categorically, for instance in calling for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” which, like so many of President Trump’s blustery promises, never came to pass and never even was given serious consideration. (The actual policy consists of restrictions on travel from six predominantly Muslim countries, along with North Koreans and officials of the Venezuelan government.) Representative Omar is not all Muslims, and she is not Muslims categorically: She’s a loopy left-wing identity-politics entrepreneur whom the Democratic party has carried to the U.S. House of Representatives. Criticism of elected officials is not only permissible but necessary. Advertisement
But Representative Omar believes she is above such criticism: “It has to stop,” she said, citing death threats she has received since the presidential tweet. That argument is pure horsepucky. It is an unfortunate fact of life in Anno Domini 2019 that practically everyone in public life receives death threats, often on social media or in online forums. Elected officials do. Journalists and commentators do. Entertainment figures do. I do, and my colleagues do. That’s our dumb world. And, currently, it’s part of the price for certain kinds of careers. There isn’t anything special about Representative Omar in this regard. She’d get death threats if she were a Fox News host, too. Advertisement
But such threats are a useful pretext for politicians who want to shut down criticism for their own narrow political ends. Senator Bernie Sanders, the socialist rape-fantasy entrepreneur from Brooklyn who represents Vermont in the Senate, insisted that criticism (he wrote “attacks”) simply “must end.” Senator Elizabeth Warren, the fake Indian from Oklahoma who represents Massachusetts in the Senate, accused the president of attempting to “incite violence.”
The Democrats are in a political pickle. They would very much prefer that the Jew-hating caucus shut up, and they are not crazy about the fact that the public face of the Democratic party is, at the moment, risible and demented amateurs such as Representative Omar and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, i.e., the people who are even crazier than Senator Sanders. But intersectionality is a jealous god, and they cannot simply tell Representative Omar et al. to sit down and clam up. All they can really do is to try to raise the price of criticizing the nut cutlets on the Democrats’ menu by insisting that criticism of Representative Omar is an attack on Muslims as such, that criticism of Representative Ocasio-Cortez is an attack on Latinas who don’t know how a bill becomes a law, that criticism of Robert Francis O’Rourke is an attack on . . . whatever it is that “Beto” is pretending to be this week. The New York Times et al. are reliable allies on that front. Advertisement Advertisement
This is, incidentally, what all those fake hate crimes are really about: Redefining criticism of Democratic politicians and constituencies as violence . When there isn’t enough violence to make that case in a sufficiently dramatic fashion, then violence can simply be invented — and, if the case of Jussie Smollett is anything to go by, the cost of doing so is pretty low. When’s the last time you heard of a prosecutor dropping a 16-felony indictment in exchange for a firm handshake? Advertisement
That’s a neat trick, really: to be the hostage and the hostage-taker at the same time. Advertisement"
Notre Dame Cathedral Fire: Good Friday Comes Early for the Cathedral This Year | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Nicholas Frankovich,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-good-friday-hope/,"April 16, 2019 6:30 AM Smoke billows as fire engulfs the spire of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, April 15, 2019. (Benoit Tessier/Reuters) The loss is incalculable. So is the reason for hope that it will always point to.
April 15, 2019, the evening of Monday in Holy Week
N otre-Dame de Paris is burning. The cathedral’s spire has fallen. The roof has collapsed. Firefighters have been on the scene for hours. The fire won the fight. “There will be nothing left,” a spokesman for Notre Dame told the BBC. It’s almost that bad: The towers and façade will be spared, but much of the interior, including the famous carved woodwork that was the labor of generations, has gone up in the flames, like Elijah in his chariot, en route to heaven. Advertisement Advertisement
“The eldest daughter of the Church,” France’s title of endearment among Europe’s Catholics, has worn Notre Dame, the Cathedral of Our Lady, as its crown since the High Middle Ages. Over the centuries, its vaults, flying buttresses, gargoyles, and rose windows came to assume the status of ancient icons, symbols of Western Christian civilization. We sometimes forget what a breath of wild fresh air Gothic architecture must have been when it began to spring up here and there in northern Europe in the 12th century. The angular verticality pulled the eyes upward and the mind toward things of heaven, like a grove of towering oaks.
Ground for Notre Dame was broken in 1163. Twenty-six years later, the high altar was dedicated. The choir, the nave, and the main, western façade were completed by the middle of the following century. Chapels and various additions were gradually added, one by one. A great cathedral is never completed. After its first hundred, two hundred years, give or take a few, its frame has been established and its general demeanor has been settled, and succeeding generations of artists are afforded the luxury of homing in on delicate, carefully thought-out embellishments, icing on the wedding cake. Advertisement
Notre Dame has been the site of royal weddings and coronations, of papal Masses and of funeral Masses for heads of state. For the tourist, its beauty overshadows its function, which is to provide for the celebration of the Eucharist a house as worthy as mere mortals are capable of building. Immersed in its purpose, the pilgrim feels its magnificence all the more keenly. Theology and sacred history explained themselves through statues of saints and biblical figures: scripture for all who had eyes to see, including the unlettered. Much of that treasure was destroyed in the violence of Christian iconoclasm during the Protestant Reformation and then in the violence of the French Revolution, not to mention the intervening misguided renovations that included the removal of some medieval stained-glass windows. After a few subsequent restoration projects, one of which left the façade cleansed of longstanding grime so that the white stone underneath shone as it did in the cathedral’s youth, Notre Dame began to be itself again by the second half of the 20th century. Advertisement
No one knows what any one craftsman thought and felt as he chiseled, sculpted, laid stones, or otherwise contributed to this monument to God, by way of Mary, the mother of His Son, but from the result of their collective work we glimpse the size of the love that the people of Paris as a whole have had for their faith. They’ve poured a lot of human soul into that structure. Notre Dame echoes emotions etched deep into the marble of Saint Mary Major, that ancient jewel of a Roman basilica likewise dedicated to Our Lady — the same poem, sung in a different architectural language. Advertisement
Authorities say they haven’t determined the cause of the fire that broke out on the Île de la Cité at 6:30 this evening of Monday in Holy Week. Plots to destroy the cathedral have been foiled by law enforcement the past couple of years. Catholic churches across France have been hit by a spate of vandalism in recent months. In March, fire damaged the Church of Saint-Sulpice in the sixth arrondissement. Firefighters said it was arson; police are still investigating. We don’t know enough to say whether the fire at Notre Dame is the latest, most spectacular incident in some ongoing sinister plot against the Church in France, so we look for guidance to Our Lady of Prudence, charting a course between conspiracy-mindedness and naïveté. Advertisement Advertisement
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre — or of the Resurrection, as it’s known to the Eastern Orthodox — is by some accounts the holiest site for Christians of all persuasions and denominations. Erected on the site in Jerusalem where Jesus is reputed to have been crucified and buried and to have risen from the dead, Holy Sepulchre, almost twice as old as Notre Dame, has been destroyed by fire, rebuilt, destroyed by a caliph, and rebuilt again. Let French Catholics take courage from the precedent. The rest of us can figure out how to contribute to reconstruction efforts if we want to."
Elizabeth Warren's Corporate and Wealth Tax Proposals Misguided | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Jon Hartley,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/elizabeth-warren-corporate-wealth-tax-proposals-misguided/,"April 16, 2019 6:30 AM Sen. Elizabeth Warren speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in 2017. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters) The Massachusetts senator proposes to use some of the most economically damaging forms of taxation in a misguided attempt to help the poor.
T his week, Senator Elizabeth Warren’s 2020 presidential campaign unveiled a radical proposal to levy a minimum 7 percent corporate tax on U.S. companies making more than $100 million annually, with the goal of raising around $1 trillion in new revenue. This comes on the heels of Warren’s proposal to institute a new 2 percent wealth tax on all individual fortunes above $50 million and an additional 1 percent tax on all fortunes above $1 billion with the objective of reducing wealth inequality. Advertisement
Unfortunately, the higher corporate taxes and wealth taxes Senator Warren advocates are among the most inefficient ways of raising tax revenue without harming the economy.
Corporate taxes have been shown to be significantly less efficient in raising tax revenue than individual income taxes or sales taxes. The ease with which corporations can establish offshore subsidiaries to avoid taxes or engage in tax inversions significantly contributed to the corporate-tax-revenue and capital-investment shortfalls seen in America in recent years. Indeed, many European countries had already recognized the inefficiency of corporate taxation and reduced their corporate-tax rates well before the U.S. did so as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
The significantly positive macroeconomic data reported for 2018, the first year that tax-reform package went into effect, includes 7 percent growth in non-residential fixed investment, 2 percent real-wage growth and 3 percent GDP growth. Academic research shows that this is no coincidence. Several studies of prior corporate-tax reforms have found that lower corporate-tax rates are associated with higher wage growth and higher rates of capital spending on buildings, property, and equipment. Advertisement
Senator Warren’s 7 percent minimum tax on corporate income would likely reverse these recent positive economic trends and lead to slower growth in investment and wages, in part because it would also disincentivize the automatic expensing of capital equipment. Lower wages, hiring, and investment means less government tax revenue. Advertisement
As for the new wealth taxes Warren proposes, the example of Europe is instructive there, too. Only three European countries (Norway, Spain, and Switzerland) still impose annual wealth taxes today, down from twelve in 1990. The change was fueled by a growing recognition that wealth taxes very often lead to capital flight as wealthy individuals re-domicile to lower-tax jurisdictions, taking their income-tax dollars with them. France’s now-abandoned wealth tax, for example, is estimated to have contributed to the departure of some 42,000 millionaires from the country between 2000 and 2012."
Notre Dame Cathedral Fire: An Omen for Europe | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Dennis Prager,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/notre-dame-cathedral-fire-omen-europe/,"Follow Dennis Prager on Twitter April 16, 2019 6:30 AM Sparks fill the air as Paris Fire brigade members spray water to extinguish flames as the Notre Dame Cathedral burns in Paris, France, April 15, 2019. (Philippe Wojazer/Reuters) Europe is burning, just as Notre Dame was.
T he symbolism of the burning of Notre-Dame Cathedral, the most renowned building in Western civilization, the iconic symbol of Western Christendom, is hard to miss.
It is as if God Himself wanted to warn us in the most unmistakable way that Western Christianity is burning — and with it, Western civilization. Advertisement Advertisement
Every major Western (and one major non-Western) social and intellectual force has conspired to rid Europe of Christianity and the civilization it produced.
Within the Western world, the French Enlightenment — the intellectual basis of the French Revolution and the modern West — sought to replace Christianity, and religion in general, with secularism rooted in reason. No God, Bible, or Ten Commandments are necessary for morality or meaning: Reason (and science) will replace them.
The two final deathblows to Christianity in Europe were the world wars. World War I ended most Westerners’ belief in the nation-state and the West. Christianity, already weakened by the Enlightenment, was further weakened by World War I. German Christians were killing millions of French and English Christians, and French and English Christians were killing millions of German Christians. So the argument and sentiment against Christianity went. Then World War II saw even more death on the Christian continent as well as the failure of Catholic and Protestant churches in Nazi Germany to offer even minimal noncompliance with the Nazis’ Jew-hatred. Advertisement
With the end of World War II, every internal Western intellectual doctrine was secular. God, the Bible, and religion were regarded at best as innocuous nonsense and at worst as noxious nonsense. Advertisement
Meanwhile, Europeans brought a non-European ideology into Europe, an ideology that, for more than a thousand years, sought to replace Christianity as the world’s dominant religion. The Europeans, believing in nothing distinctly Christian or Western, and believing in the moral and intellectual nonsense known as “multiculturalism”— a doctrine that asserts that all cultures are morally equivalent — saw nothing problematic in bringing millions of Muslims into Europe. In their ignorance and arrogance, they assumed that because they were secular multiculturalists, everybody else was, too — or would be, once they lived in Europe.
VIEW GALLERY: Fire at Notre Dame Cathedral Advertisement
They were wrong, of course. And as a result, the two dominant forces in Europe — secular leftism and Islamism — sought the end of Christianity and the West. (The Left believes that protecting Western civilization is equivalent to protecting white supremacy.)
This is not producing a pretty picture. Generally speaking, Islam has not been nearly as kind, tolerant, open, medically or scientifically innovative, or intellectually curious as Western civilization (and yes, Nazism and Communism were born in the West, but they were anti-Western).
Even without tens of millions of Muslims, post-Christian Europe has not produced a pretty picture. This was predicted in 1834, a hundred years before Hitler’s rise, by the great German poet Heinrich Heine, a secular Jew (who later converted to Protestantism, “the ticket of admission into European culture”):
Christianity — and that is its greatest merit — has somewhat mitigated that brutal German love of war, but it could not destroy it. Should that subduing talisman, the cross, be shattered, the frenzied madness of the ancient warriors, that insane Berserk rage of which Nordic bards have spoken and sung so often, will once more burst into flame. This talisman (the cross) is fragile, and the day will come when it will collapse miserably. Then . . . a play will be performed in Germany that will make the French Revolution look like an innocent idyll.
European Christians persecuted European Jews, often brutally. But it took a post-Christian ideology, secular Nazism, to produce Auschwitz — just as it took post-Christian Communism to produce the Gulag, the Chinese Cultural Revolution, and the Ukrainian and Cambodian genocides.
Moreover, Nazism and Communism aside, the Left’s belief that secular reason can replace God and the Bible turns out to be completely wrong. The alleged citadels of secular reason — the universities — are the most irrational and morally confused institutions in the West."
The Progressive Revolution: From Democratic to Liberal to Progressive to Socialist - National Review,www.nationalreview.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/progressive-revolution-ends-in-socialism/,"April 16, 2019 6:30 AM President Barack Obama in 2016 (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) Obama kick-started a cycle that moves ever farther left — even he now seems passé.
A mericans voted for Barack Obama in 2008 despite, not because of, his most partisan voting record in the Senate. They were once willing to look past his earlier dubious associations with abject anti-Semites such as the Reverend Jeremiah Wright, former terrorists like Bill Ayers, and unhinged characters such as Father Pfleger. They also averted their eyes from Obama’s often quite offensive commentary, in his autobiography and during the 2008 campaign (e.g., “typical white person” and “ they cling to…” speech). Advertisement Advertisement
Instead, voters were tired of the Iraq War (which was over for all practical purposes by the time of the November 2008 election).
They were, of course, terrified by the September 2008 financial meltdown (which had been mostly stabilized four months later by the time of the inauguration) and irate at the kid-gloves treatment accorded often conniving banks and investors.
They were convinced that Obama might be healing and transformative as the first African-American president, supposedly only slightly to the left of a far steadier and more qualified Condoleezza Rice or Colin Powell. And half the Democrats were already becoming sick of Hillary Clinton once they became reacquainted with her on the 2008 primary-campaign trail.
As is typical of American politics, voters in 2008 also wanted to change the party in power after it had been in the lead for eight years, and the lame-duck president fell out of favor. Voters certainly were underwhelmed by an uninspiring, herky-jerky, mostly incompetent John McCain campaign, notable for his “that’s not who we are” comments and his willingness to “lose nobly.” Advertisement Advertisement
Such was the naïve dream.
The reality by 2013 was that voters got an increasing hard-core liberal-progressive revolution that, after Obama’s 2012 reelection, increasingly polarized America over the reach of the federal government, immigration, and race. Scandals at the DOJ and IRS were often political in nature. By summer 2016, the Obama administration had weaponized the intelligence agencies and his own justice department to such a degree that unleashed bureaucrats and appointees actively sought to intervene in a presidential campaign to undermine the opposition candidate and to lay the foundation for sabotaging the incoming president’s transition and administration.
An overregulated economy stagnated, requiring ever more federal intervention and borrowing. Students on campuses lost constitutional protections, especially under the First and Fifth Amendments, as universities finalized their long transformation into indoctrination centers. Obama recalibrated American foreign policy in neutralist fashion, and in a way that made Egypt, Israel, and Saudi Arabia more suspect than Iran, Turkey, or Cuba. Advertisement
Culturally, diversity replaced affirmative action, on the principle that formerly documented grievances or class status no longer mattered, at least compared with skin color. The real divide was now between a non-white, far greater collective that harbored purported grievances against a reconstituted and much smaller white majority and its “privilege and “supremacy.” When feminists and gays were included in the diverse intersectional bloc of Asians, Latinos, blacks, and immigrants, a supposed new majority of “woke” Americans now would have electoral control over a culpable and soon to become irrelevant minority. The “content of our character” and all that became “inoperative.” Advertisement
All this was largely the legacy of an otherwise mostly unsuccessful Obama administration whose record was one of massive debt, an ossified economy, decreased sovereignty, increased ethnic and racial tensions, and a confused foreign policy perceived abroad as apologetic and contrite, and therefore useful to rivals and enemies. Advertisement
The Socialist-Progressive Takeover
Yet Obama had hit on something in his move to the hard left. After he left office, unapologetic leftists were less coy (the old smear of “socialist” was now a term of endearment) and began to extinguish what little was left of Bill Clinton’s old, occasionally moderate Democratic party.
The reelection of Obama had convinced progressives that he had discovered electoral magic: record voter registration, turnout, and block voting of “minorities” that could overcome the old Perot, Reagan Democrat, silent majority, and tea-party dinosaurs in the critical swing states. This chemistry, they thought, would be inherently transferrable even to multimillionaire white establishmentarians like Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden ( but only if they were reeducated and thus made the necessary confessionals about their own white privilege and shared disdain for “deplorables” and “the dregs of society”).
Suddenly, everything seemed possible as woke activists, à la French Revolution, accelerated the possible into the already passé. Advertisement Advertisement
In just a few years, mere acceptance (rather than endorsement) of gay marriage was veritable homophobia. Assimilation and integration were seen as tantamount to cultural appropriation and imperialism. Conservation and market-based encouragement of alternative energy were the appeasement of “climate deniers” and showed a cowardly reluctance to go the full green mile and eventually ban the internal combustion engine. The Kavanaugh hearing, the Covington-kids fiasco, and the Jussie Smollett farce made clear that the Left was no longer liberal but hard-left and fact-free.
Secure borders and deportation of illegal aliens who had committed crimes were themselves humanitarian “crimes.” Building the wall went to stopping the wall to promoting the tearing down of the wall. The notions of affirmation action and disparate impact became Sixties’ relics, when “reparation” was the real goal. Prior street-theater groups such as Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter seemed timid anachronisms compared with Antifa and its masked hoodlums who torched and beat up anything in their path.
“Legal but rare” abortion became a sellout position, given that any woman had a right to partial-birth abortion and even infanticide if she so chose. A dream of a 50 percent income-tax rate on top incomes went to talk of 70 percent then to 90 percent and then to a wealth tax as just deserts. To enlarge the electorate, illegal aliens should vote first in local elections, but then why not everywhere? Sixteen-years olds could too, and so why not ex-felons as well? About a $1.5 trillion in student debt should be forgiven — but then tuition should be free for all (as should Medicare). Advertisement
The appearance and success of the polarizing Donald Trump supercharged the ongoing progressive revolution. The rallying cries of “collusion,” “treason,” and the new “Manchurian candidate” won over any holdout Democrat and seduced the emasculated Never Trump right into becoming useful colluding idiots. The 2018 Democratic midterm victory in the House was not seen in historical context: Trump in fact had fared much better in both the House and Senate in his first midterm than had either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama at that point in their presidencies, both of whom were easily reelected, while mostly centrist candidates had given the Democrats the new House majority.
By spring 2019, we were light years beyond the revolution’s beginning in summer 2008 — and heading into hard-socialist territory and beyond.
Indeed, the once edgy community-organizing Obama himself had become a tragicomical figure. He spent a bit of his post-presidency warning against a “circular firing squad” of Democratic cannibalism but otherwise was hell-bent on becoming worth $100 million in “I built that fashion”—and was never again heard uttering another “I do think at a certain point you’ve made enough money” sermon.
Socialism and Beyond
Conventional wisdom would warn Democrats that their surrender to pied pipers such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, Al Sharpton, Linda Sasour, and other assorted fakers, con artists, anti-Semites, and street actors would lead them all over the proverbial George McGovern and Walter Mondale cliff into the abyss. But such caution is unlikely for a variety of reasons.
One, Democratic candidates now sound a lot more like Bernie Sanders than he ever sounded like them. The new socialists believe that they have altered the nature of the electorate and the manner in which elections are conducted, and that they will continue to do so at an accelerating pace.
Preemptory charges of “voter suppression” have made required prior registration and voter IDs veritable racist crimes, as voter harvesting and fluid same-day registration and voting are the hallmarks of the future, even as open borders change the demography of the nation. Youth, not experience or tenure, is the requisite for progressive revolution, as brontosauruses like Diane Feinstein and Chuck Schumer struggle to sputter a few shrill socialist platitudes to maintain minimal relevance. Anti-Semitism is not called out by Democrats, because party leaders fear that Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, and Tlaib are not aberrations but now represent 51 percent of the new Democratic party on both Israel and American Jewry.
Two, few leftist revolutionary cycles ever halt in mid course, whether in 1789 France, 1917 Russia, 1946 China, or 1960 Cuba. The philosophy is always that today’s radical is yesterday’s sell-out to be replaced by tomorrow’s genuine far harder leftist — until the limits of reality are reached and the movement either implodes or leads to an authoritarian Napoleon, Lenin, Mao, or Fidel.
The current socialist trajectory is divorced from reality, whether reality mean the critical role of fossil fuels in maintaining civilization, or the historical record of tribalism destroying nations from Rwanda to the Balkans, or the usual story of soft socialism inevitably turning hard and ending in the mass poverty of a North Korea, Venezuela, or Cuba. Advertisement
The End Game
Socialists and hard progressives believe that they already have won about three-fifths of America, defined not by population, polls, or political office, but by cultural clout. They assume that such control will inevitably end in final victory in the Congress and presidency, the same way that that there’s no longer a Republican party to speak of in California and not a single statewide officeholder who is not a Democrat. Seven of 53 House seats are Republican in the California of Ronald Reagan and Pete Wilson.
Entertainment and Hollywood are mostly all left-wing and missionary in their progressive zeal. The network news, PBS, NPR, CNN, and MSNBC outnumber talk radio and Fox News.
Most of the major newspapers are progressive. Silicon Valley is harder left still and more audacious in baking ideology into its products from Twitter and Facebook, which censor conservatives, to Google, with its progressive bias in formatting and searches.
The biggest foundations that most fund activists and academics are mostly left-wing. No one believes that the campuses are balanced or even disinterested. Most academics believe that they can be legitimately biased leftward to balance the supposed prejudices of the family, community, and church — noisome cargo that too many of their naïve students bring with them on arrival, which is why they need “cleansing” and “awakening.”
Sports events and reporting are liberal and increasingly avenues to peddle political messages. Corporate America tries to emulate popular culture and thus must adopt left-wing tropes, so it’s trigger-happy in its readiness to shoot down conservatives who are deemed hostile to our shared fated progressive future.
What we are seeing in the Democratic party’s movement to the hard left is not the beginning but the end of a long march. Socialists and progressives believe that control of the Congress, the presidency, and courts is the final missing tessera from their already expansive socialist mosaic."

I’ve seen a gripe or two about social-media feeds filling up with people’s old vacation pictures of the Cathedral of Notre Dame.

German High Court to Rule on Right to Suicide | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Wesley J. Smith,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/german-high-court-to-rule-on-right-to-suicide/,"Follow Wesley J. Smith on Twitter April 16, 2019 10:31 AM
It is an unfortunate feature of the contemporary age that many look at suicide as a human right to be enabled (in some cases, for now) rather than a tragedy to be prevented whenever possible. Now, in Germany, that question is about to be decided by the country’s highest court. From the DW story:
Actively aiding someone to knowingly commit suicide, however, is explicitly outlawed in Germany: The Bundestag passed legislation in 2015 banning the sale or prescription of drugs meant to end a patient’s life. Any physician, organization or private individual found to have distributed such drugs faces up to five years in prison under the law. "

(Carlos Barria/REUTERS)
Nation of Islam founder and notorious anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan defended Representative Ilhan Omar’s glib description of the September 11 attacks Monday by dismissing the attacks as nothing more than a false-flag operation designed to draw the U.S. into Middle Eastern conflicts.
In a video posted to YouTube last year and tweeted out Monday by the Nation of Islam account, Farrakhan accuses the Bush administration of orchestrating the 9/11 attacks in order “to get the country into war at the expense of young patriotic men and women.”
“3,133 Scientists Back Ilhan Omar on 9/11 Deep skepticism exists about the gov’t version of 9/11. Many experts—architects & engineers—say the World Trade Center Towers were destroyed in a controlled demolition. Listen to @LouisFarrakhan # IStandWithIlhan,” reads the tweet, which includes a link to the video.
The tweet expresses Farrakhan’s support for Omar, who has received an onslaught of criticism from Republican lawmakers and conservative pundits for using the phrase “some people did something” to describe the World Trade Center attacks, which killed more than 3,000 Americans.
Farrakhan has previously blamed a cabal of highly placed Jewish government officials for helping to execute the attacks.
“There were many Israelis and Zionist Jews in key roles in the 9/11 attacks,” he said in 2015. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Omar referred to the attack as “something” during a speech before the the Council on American-Islamic Relations last week, in which she also falsely claimed that the group was founded to fight the anti-Muslim discrimination that followed the 9/11 attacks. The organization, which has ties to the Hamas terror, was actually founded in 1994.
The backlash against Omar escalated after the New York Post printed her words on the front cover along with an image of the twin towers at the moment of impact. President Trump then joined fray, tweeting out a video montage of the attacks accompanied by Omar’s words.
In a video that surfaced last week, Omar can be seen dismissing the threat posed by al-Qaeda and other Islamic terror groups as a laughing matter and mocking Americans who display discomfort when discussing the groups, who she implies are no different than the American or British governments."
Conservative and Labour Parties Are Both Unfit to Govern Britain | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Douglas Murray,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/british-conservative-and-labour-parties-are-both-unfit-to-govern/,"About Douglas Murray April 16, 2019 1:47 PM A street vendor selling Union Jack flags passes a pro-Brexit supporter outside the Houses of Parliament in London, England, March 28, 2019. (Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters)
A great question looms over British politics. Should we smash the major parties? By “major parties” I obviously mean the Conservative and Labour parties. And when I say “we” I mean, of course, the British voting public. Since the government delayed Brexit once again this month, it seems that Britons will soon be asked to vote in this year’s European Parliament election. That will be three years after we voted to leave the European Union. With the Conservative government showing a monumental incompetence in matters great and small it looks as though we might also face a general election before this parliament comes to its purported end in 2022. Suddenly it looks as though the two-party system which was meant to be uncrackable could finally crack. Advertisement Advertisement
A YouGov poll carried out last week showed Labour coming top of the forthcoming EU elections (24 percent) and the Conservatives down 8 percent to only 16 percent. Only just behind them are Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party (15 percent) and Nigel Farage’s old Brexit party, UKIP (14 percent). So in the EU Parliament elections the Conservatives could well be beaten by a party that didn’t exist until last week. Some Conservatives appear to think, “Well that’s just the European elections: the public were always badly behaved during those.” Except that the British public’s ill-discipline no longer appears to be limiting itself to European elections. A YouGov poll on voting intentions in a general (domestic) election shows the Conservatives four points behind Labour at just 28 percent. For such an election the Brexit party and UKIP poll 8 percent and 6 percent respectively. And so we see the possibility here not just of a Labour government but of the Conservative party being destroyed.
Like a lot of Conservative voters, I no longer abhor the prospect. Not because we relish a Corbyn government — very far from it. A Corbyn government would put Britain on a road to national decline that would make the 1970s look like our heydays. But the Corbyn Labour party has its own problems. It is fighting against its own parliamentary party and in the country as a whole there is now a clear divide between the pro-EU Labour party that dominates in metropolitan areas like Islington (Corbyn’s own constituency) and the vast swathes of the north of England who voted to leave the European Union and are the Labour party’s only remaining base. Advertisement
The obvious thing for Labour is also to split. Something that began to happen in February when half a dozen Labour MPs (lead by Chuka Ummuna, once a Blairite hopeful for the party) walked out to form the “Independent Group,” which has now also been joined by a gaggle of “Remain” Conservative-elected MPs. This group also plans to run at forthcoming elections. And so when the British people next go to the ballot we might at least have a party to vote for that really wants to leave the EU and a party that really wants to stay in, rather than two parties that pretend that they want to leave.

If Britain’s relationship with the EU is going to continue to dominate our politics then this all has its advantages. But there are two meaningful problems. The first comes if Britain actually manages to leave the EU. In such a situation both new parties would surely slump — the main order of the day having been at least temporarily addressed. Each may continue to campaign to take us in their favored direction some years down the line, but a broad majority of the public would most likely believe the question to have been addressed at that point, and wish other questions — education, health, the economy, the rest of the world — to be addressed at some stage.

Pete Buttigieg: Capitalism Has 'Let a Lot of People Down' | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mairead Mcardle,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/buttigieg-capitalism-has-let-a-lot-of-people-down/,"Follow Mairead McArdle on Twitter April 16, 2019 3:04 PM Democratic 2020 presidential candidate and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg campaigns at Gibson’s Bookstore in Concord, N.H., April 6, 2019. (Mary Schwalm/Reuters)
Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg offered an explanation Tuesday for why socialism has caught on lately among some lawmakers and voters.
“I think the reason we’re having this argument over socialism and capitalism is that capitalism has let a lot of people down,” the South Bend, Ind. mayor said on CNN, before stressing that democratic norms must underpin the capitalist system. “At the end of the day, we prioritize democracy. And having that framework of a rule of law, of fairness, is actually what it takes for markets to work.”
Buttigieg told CNBC last week that the U.S. is at a moment where “concentrated wealth has begun to turn into concentrated power.”
“American capitalism is one of the most productive forces ever known to man, and there’s so much that this country has been able to unlock, especially in the last century, in terms of technology, in terms of prosperity,” he said . “Now where it goes wrong is when it’s only being experienced in certain parts of the country or by certain kinds of people, and I think it goes to show just how important it is for capitalism to work that it be backed by all of the other pieces that business alone can’t solve.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

(John Gress/Reuters) He has zero appeal to religious conservatives because he holds to the Democratic party line on the right to kill viable, living unborn babies.
W ith every passing day, it seems we see yet another piece about South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg’s progressive Christianity. His faith is going to shake the race. He’s going to challenge the GOP monopoly on “God talk.” Here, for example, is the opening paragraph of an NBC News analysis posted yesterday afternoon:
Religious conservatives who have long been a reliable voting bloc for Republicans are grappling with a new challenge in Pete Buttigieg: how to respond to a Democratic presidential candidate who is leaning into the discussion about faith and its role in political life.
I’ll agree that there are religious conservatives who are “grappling” with a challenge from Buttigieg, but that challenge is theological and cultural, not political. Buttigieg’s religious arguments have triggered important online debates about the differences between mainline and Evangelical Christianity, about when religious teachings should influence public policy, and about how to interpret the history of the gay-marriage debate.
But religious conservatives are not grappling with the key political question — whether any meaningful number of Evangelicals or conservative Catholics would cross the aisle to cast a ballot for Mayor Pete. The reason is simple. Buttigieg is a pro-choice extremist, and no pro-choice extremist will ever meaningfully compete for the conservative Christian vote.
In fact, in at least one key way, Buttigieg’s record on abortion is even worse than that of his Democratic peers. He is of course in lockstep agreement with them on support for late-term abortion, and he made that clear last month on Morning Joe : Advertisement . @PeteButtigieg explains his support for late-term abortion bills in New York and Virginia:
”When we’re talking about some of those situations covered by that law … the involvement of a male government official like me is not helpful.” pic.twitter.com/6lQrLLhwhW

But he’s done what many of them have not — he’s actually blocked a crisis-pregnancy center from opening at its chosen location. He not only supports abortion rights, he’s taken action against law-abiding Americans who merely wanted to make the case for life. Advertisement Advertisement
Last April, Buttigieg vetoed a rezoning plan that would have permitted a crisis-pregnancy center to open next door to a proposed abortion clinic. In his statement justifying the veto, Buttigieg said, “I don’t think it would be responsible to situate two groups, literally right next to each other, in a neighborhood, that have diametrically opposed views on the most divisive social issue of our time.”
And so, given the conflict, he chose to privilege the abortion clinic’s location over the pregnancy center. Thankfully, the center found a new location across the street from the proposed clinic — a location that didn’t require a rezoning vote. But that does not excuse or justify Buttigieg’s veto. He favored abortion rights over pro-life speech, and he likely violated the Constitution in doing so.
While Buttigieg, to his credit, did not demonize his opponents in the South Bend dispute ( “Many people that I respect and admire and appreciate have very passionate and very opposite views on what is the right thing to do,” he said of the dispute), actions speak louder than words. And this action echoes a dangerous Democratic trend in pro-choice governance: the attack against pro-life pregnancy clinics. Advertisement
Across the United States, progressive legislatures have passed laws aimed at crisis-pregnancy centers, including a California law the Supreme Court struck down just last summer. Buttigieg hasn’t gone as far as California, which actually required pro-life pregnancy centers to promote state-funded free and low-cost abortions. But he had an opportunity to fully respect the constitutional rights of his pro-life opponents, and he chose not to do so. Advertisement
Many young Evangelicals, including young Evangelical activists, are divided over matters such as same-sex marriage. Some believe Obergefell v. Hodges was wrongly decided, others support legal recognition of same-sex marriage so long as the state doesn’t interfere with the church’s ability to define marriage according to the historic doctrines of the Christian faith. Others support same-sex marriage constitutionally and theologically.
These same young Christians are often appalled that their older brothers and sisters in the faith have so easily overlooked Donald Trump’s multitude of sins. But they will not support politicians who support legal protections for late-term abortions. They won’t. The will not support politicians who don’t go beyond “respecting” pro-life Americans to also protecting their rights to free speech with the same vigor that they protect the First Amendment rights of pro-choice Americans.

Father Jean-Marc Fournier, the chaplain of the Paris Fire Brigade, risked life and limb to retrieve the invaluable Crown of Thorns — a religious relic believed to have been worn by Christ during His passion which was first brought to Paris by King Louis IX in 1238 — as well as the Blessed Sacrament (the consecrated bread which Catholics believe to be the body of Christ.)

Stacey Abrams Equates Abortion Restrictions to ‘Forced Pregnancy' ~ Full Magazine,www.nationalreview.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/stacey-abrams-abortion-restrictions-forced-pregnancy/,"April 16, 2019 6:36 PM Stacey Abrams speaks at the Women In The World Summit in New York City, April 11, 2019. (Brendan McDermid/Reuters)
Failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams suggested in an interview on Monday that recent bills placing various restrictions on access to abortion should collectively be referred to as “forced-pregnancy bills.”
“There are a number of bills around the country that are limiting women’s rights and access to abortion, and I wanted to ask you how can Democrats push back against these bills,” asked Root host Terrell Starr in an interview published on Monday.
“I think Democrats have to first call these bills what they are, which are forced-pregnancy bills. But we also have to acknowledge that access to abortion is part of reproductive health and therefore it’s part of reproductive justice,” she continued. “Particularly for African-American women, our lack of access to a full range of reproductive choices limits our ability to not only determine our families but it also harms our ability to engage in the economy.”
In the U.S., black women are more than five times more likely than white women to have an abortion, according to the pro-abortion Guttmacher Institute, and though they comprise just 32.2 percent of Georgia’s population, black women obtain 62.4 percent of the abortions performed in the state.

NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
Starr presumably was referring to a collection of recently passed “heartbeat bills,” which prohibit abortion after a fetal heartbeat can be detected (typically around six weeks into pregnancy).
Ohio governor Mike DeWine recently signed a version of such legislation into law and similar bills have been passed by Republican-held state legislatures in Kentucky, Mississippi, and Georgia this year. The bills are not expected to survive the legal challenges immediately filed against them by groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood.
Abrams, who was bested by Republican Brian Kemp last year, has refused to concede the gubernatorial race and has alternated between blaming racism, voter suppression and, most recently, the political media’s “immaturity” and “incompetence” for her loss.
“I would attribute it less to racism and more to a very narrow and immature ability to navigate the story of my campaign,” Abrams told Starr when asked whether race played a role in her defeat."

Equality Act & Gender Identity -- The Equality Act Hurts Women | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Madeleine Kearns,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-equality-act-hurts-women/,"About Madeleine Kearns April 16, 2019 4:57 PM Former tennis player Martina Navratilova waves to spectators on Centre Court as she is introduced at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, England, July 4, 2015.

As National Review has editorialized, the Equality Act is about coercion . It would force all federally funded entities to consider a man as a woman if he identifies as such. The scope of the Equality Act (H.R.5) is overreaching and would harm women and children most.
Gender identity laws and policies are already in place across the U.S. And one badly impacted area is women’s sports. In the state of Connecticut, two male students finished first and second in the girls’ high-school track championship. The Boston Athletic Association allows runners to compete according to their gender identity, regardless of whether they’ve undergone physical changes. Advertisement Advertisement
What’s the problem? Well, as the lesbian tennis star Martina Navratilova wrote in The Sunday Times of London, allowing male athletes to compete with women is “cheating” and has already allowed hundreds of athletes to achieve “honours as women that were beyond their capabilities as men.” Paula Radcliffe, Britain’s most celebrated female distance runner, who holds the world record for the fastest women’s marathon, has raised similar concerns . As has Sharron Davies, Olympic swimmer, who said we “have to classify it [sports] by sex.”"
Democrats Worry Bernie Sanders Can’t Win in 2020 | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kevin D.

Bernie Sanders at the “We the People Summit” in Washington, D.C., April 1, 2019. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) Clever Democrats worry that the gentleman from Vermont won’t be able to defeat Trump in 2020.
‘W here is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?” T. S. Eliot asked. “Where is the knowledge we have lost in information?”
And where is the intelligence we have lost in cleverness ?
Cleverness is the plague of our political classes, an influenza of the intellect. The consultants are always trying to outsmart their rivals in the pettiest of ways and generally end up outsmarting themselves. The Affordable Care Act was and is a legislative and administrative train wreck, but it sure sounded clever (to someone ) to be able to say it was a “Republican plan,” a “conservative proposal,” a creature of Mitt Romney or the American Enterprise Institute, etc. Never mind that that isn’t exactly true — it sure sounded clever! Advertisement Advertisement
(To someone .)
The clever people in the Democratic party have turned their attention to Senator Bernie Sanders, the creepy Brooklyn red who for some reason represents Vermont in the Senate, functionally as a member of the Democratic party, an equally creepy political organization to which he does not belong but whose presidential nomination he nonetheless is seeking a second time. Advertisement
Stop Sanders! is the cry of the moment from Cambridge, Mass., to Tiburon, Calif., and everywhere that clever Democrats gather. The worry is that Senator Sanders’s grumpy-Muppet shtick will not discreetly charm the bourgeoisie, that his disheveled populism and his unmade bed of a mind will not be a smash hit with well-heeled swing voters in the moneyed suburbs of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Florida — which, the clever people inform us, is where the real action is going to be in 2020. They aren’t out there screaming “A vote for Sanders is a vote for Trump!” just yet, but they are scheming behind the scenes, and the moneymen of the party already are so alarmed that they are making approximately the same sound that Donald Sutherland makes at the end of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
Senator Sanders is a misunderstood figure, in part because he himself started listening to the clever people once he began to look like a genuine threat to Herself in 2016. In the earliest part of that primary campaign, Senator Sanders was a slightly different kind of political animal, and a more authentic one: He was one part apocalyptic Berkeley sandwich-board screamer and one part . . . Donald Trump, as a matter of curious fact, and not just because of the honking outer-borough accent. Advertisement
If you think “populist” means Donald Trump, then you might be forgiven for thinking that the enemy of populism is the Democratic party, its agenda, and its associates. If you think “populism” means Bernie Sanders, then you probably think that the enemy of populism is the Republican party, its agenda, and its associates. But “populism” encompasses both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, and its enemy is neither the Democratic party nor the Republican party but liberalism , here understood not in the illiterate contemporary political sense (nice NPR-listening people in sweaters with darling gay friends, also in sweaters) but in its proper sense, as the political order based on liberty in the form of individual rights to life, liberty, and property, secured against the state through the rule of law and procedural democracy. Advertisement
Liberalism is associated with limited government, international accords based on certain necessarily universalist principles, and free enterprise, including free trade. Its principal rivals on the world stage are nationalism and socialism, which in the democratic theater present themselves as populism, a dynamic of opposition between the people as masses and loci of incumbent power, which are variously known, depending on the particular flavor of populism at play, as “elites,” “globalists,” “international bankers,” “Big Business,” “capitalism,” “the Jews,” “rootless cosmopolitans,” etc. Populism seeks to overrule liberalism, either categorically or in a piecemeal fashion as the whims of the people dictate. Advertisement
Hence the substantial overlap between Sanders and Trump in 2016, on trade, on immigration, on military spending, on foreign policy, on Wall Street’s taxes, and much else. Sanders has evolved , as they say, most prominently in how he talks about immigration, a subject that occasionally put him on the wrong side of the intersectionality police. He remains much more of an immigration skeptic than is the median Democratic aspirant to the 2020 nomination, as his recent denunciation of “open borders” makes obvious enough. But gone is the strident and indeed nationalist tone of those 2016 union-hall meetings.
The Democrats are worried that even this kinder, gentler Bernie would not be able to defeat Trump in 2020. But they may have it backward: The 2016 union-hall Bernie’s frank embrace of both nationalism and socialism is probably a better representation of the actual ideals and aspirations of the majority of voters sympathetic to the Democratic party than is his new well-scrubbed and considerably more circumspect incarnation, which is more Ann Arbor than Flint, more UWS than UAW. Advertisement
But if you’re good at chess you tend to see the world as a chessboard, and the clever people do not seek a grand strategy in which Senator Sanders leads the Democrats to victory — and, more dear to them, to a national repudiation of Donald Trump — in 2020. As they build imaginary coalitions, collating battleground states and cross-referencing interest groups, they see in the loopy gentleman from Vermont an instrument too unwieldy for the subtlety of their purposes.

"Remembering Andy Marshall: Great Geo-Strategist, Great Man | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Jerry Hendrix,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/remembering-andrew-marshall/,"April 17, 2019 6:30 AM Andrew Marshall at a retirement farewell ceremony at the Pentagon, January 5, 2015. (Master Sergeant Adrian Cadiz/US Army) Andrew Marshall, first director of the Office of Net Assessment, was a great man.
A ndrew W. Marshall, the eminent defense strategist, spoke sharply to me only once in the ten years I knew him. A remarkably kind and humble man, Andy Marshall was successful for over four decades in the Pentagon and, more broadly, in Washington, D.C. This success, and the legend that came to be attached to him in the final decades of his 97-year-long life, grew from Marshall’s qualities as an individual, the methodology of “net assessment” that he developed, and the way he ran the Office of Net Assessment. Advertisement
Andy Marshall died March 26.
Marshall was a standout as a young student. After a heart murmur medically disqualified him for military service during World War II, he attended both the University of Detroit and Wayne State College while working in factories. He took an interest in history, literature, math, and the sciences, but his formal education came to focus on economics and system modeling. After the war and without actually graduating from Wayne State, he applied to and was accepted by the University of Chicago to pursue a master’s in economics. While there, he became interested in understanding how the world actually worked as a macro-political-economic-security system. In his spare time, he worked in the university’s Institute for Nuclear Studies, where he leveraged his experience as a tool-maker in Detroit’s factories to upgrade the university’s cyclotron.
Marshall completed his degree requirements in 1949 and accepted a job offer from the relatively new RAND Corporation, a federally funded research and development center in Santa Monica, Calif. Years later, while working for him, I often fielded questions from senior officials, both foreign and domestic, as to how they should address him: “Do we call him Director Marshall or Dr. Marshall?” “No,” was my instructed reply, “it’s just Andy Marshall.” Advertisement
At RAND, Marshall worked with such luminaries as Herbert Goldhamer, Charles Hitch, Herman Kahn, and Albert Wohlstetter. Marshall spent 20 years with RAND and enjoyed its multi-disciplinary approach and collegial work environment. “Rank” had no place in those early RAND studies, as young minds were expected to contribute just as much as the more experienced researchers, although almost everyone at RAND was young then. During this era of his life, Marshall examined a wide array of issues but also quietly began to develop a broad multi-disciplinary practice of analysis that he called “net assessment.” Advertisement
Combining aspects of economics, history, organizational behavior, business management theory, and grand strategy with his strong respect for the sciences, Marshall sought a better way to measure the relative power of opposing nations. For instance, while examining how the Soviet Union was preparing to defend itself against outside bomber attacks, he discovered that the United States’ bomber force imposed a significant cost upon the Soviet Union by forcing it to deploy anti-air guns and missiles along its long borders. Marshall understood that money spent on defensive weapons could not be spent on offensive systems that would be arrayed against the United States. This idea of asymmetric cost imposition—of finding ways to exploit an enemy’s inherent weaknesses with your strength—began to define his research. In 1969 Henry Kissinger brought Marshall to Washington, D.C., to assess the intelligence products being provided to the White House. Marshall and his wife, Mary, moved into a temporary apartment with rented furniture, always intending to return to their home in Santa Monica. Advertisement
Andy Marshall ended up spending several years performing net assessments for Kissinger within the White House, but in 1973, when his former colleague at RAND, Dr. James Schlesinger, was named secretary of defense, Marshall was transferred to the Pentagon to establish an Office of Net Assessment (ONA) within the Department of Defense. Marshall was appointed ONA’s first director by Richard Nixon and was subsequently reappointed by each successive president through Barack Obama, a 42-year epoch that overlapped with 13 secretaries of defense. Beyond Marshall’s long life and intellectual vitality, the reasons for his longevity lay in the type of people he picked to work with him, the quality of ONA’s products, and Marshall’s nearly unique professional humility.

I was picked to work in ONA as part of a team of professionals who all shared a predilection to challenge established norms. We were intellectually curious and uniform in our belief that working in ONA was the best job we ever had. Those I’ve met who came before my time in the office, and those who came after me, nearly all share this opinion. Most of Marshall’s military assistants were not “hot runners” in our respective military services, and in my time with him he consistently rejected the “superstar” candidates who were sent to him by various service leaders in favor of more iconoclastic intellects.

Not all of Marshall’s military assistants found success within their services. Some, such as General Lance Lord and General Paul Selva, the current vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, went all the way to four-star rank, but most left military service and found their greatest influence elsewhere, such as James Roche, who worked for Marshall as a Navy commander but went on to become secretary of the Air Force, or Andrew Krepinevich, who served as a lieutenant colonel under Marshall but went on to head an influential think tank. All of Marshall’s military assistants worked well together. He had a good instinct for group dynamics and led them by posing the big questions facing the Department of Defense. Marshall was in every sense the director of the office’s efforts, but he was also comfortable both asking and taking questions, and he continued to mentor and guide many of us after we left his office. He became our friend, and we became his family. Advertisement Advertisement
Marshall set no deadlines, but he expected his assistants to produce useful and original work. A person would join the office, spend a few days or weeks reading up on its history and ongoing projects, and only then sit down with Marshall to set out on a new project in collaboration with him or others. In meetings one often got the idea that he was asking a question that he had raised several times before but wanted to see if anyone would offer a new, surprising approach. Marshall was a voracious reader with an eclectic range of tastes. He would often drop books or articles on the desks of his military assistants and then stop by a few days later to see if they had read the materials. Always, always, he would ask, “what did that make you think of?” Marshall was never simply interested in what the written word said but rather was curious as to where it took the reader’s mind. To work with him (one never got the sense of working for Andy Marshall so much as working with him) was to be on a constant path of collaborative intellectual growth. The “work” never ended, and that was acceptable because the “work” was never the normal drudgery that one often endured in traditional military service. Advertisement
Of course, it was the power of ONA’s products that propelled it and its director to great influence. The initial set of net assessments of U.S. competition with the Soviet Union were delivered in the opening days of the Carter administration, and the power of their diagnoses was such that then–Secretary of Defense Harold Brown made the decision to keep ONA open and to retain the service of Andrew Marshall. Marshall’s net assessments identified offsetting technologies such as stealth, precision strike weapons, and space-based surveillance, positioning, and timing systems as key enablers of potential U.S. dominance. He also correctly ascertained that the Soviet economy was much smaller than suspected and that the United States would prevail in the long-term competition with the communist state.
Later he identified the importance of continuous innovation, strongly supporting what he termed “revolutions in military affairs.” He also identified China as a rising threat in the early 1990s, long before any other voice in the national-security establishment. He missed some developments as well, but his overall predictive abilities were better than any grand strategist of his generation, and the power of his trend analysis will continue to influence decision-makers for years to come.
Marshall also greatly influenced the broader strategic community. Many have written about the cadre of strategists that he trained and mentored, and this certainly was a big part of his growing influence. Those who had worked for him gained reputations for being able to identify the right strategic questions and mastered their national-security portfolios in government, academia, think tanks, and industry. Marshall also used his small studies budget to fund ongoing research on important topics through the think tanks, academic institutions, and private consultants who were willing to gore more than a few sacred cows. He created and sustained a vital intellectual “churn” of ideas in an era that was increasingly characterized by strategic calcification and hubris. A system of interlocking net assessments, sponsored studies, and exercises was the real source of Marshall’s influence.
It was this influence that created Marshall’s “aura” as the “Yoda” of the Pentagon, the wise seer and adviser to the powerful. It would be a lie to say that those of us who worked for him were unaware of his reputation. It was, in fact, hard at times to differentiate the humble man who became our mentor and friend from the legend that grew around him over decades of national service. Marshall himself remained largely oblivious to his reputation and comported himself with humility. He was naturally quiet. When he developed a new analytical product, he presented it to the secretary of defense instead of sharing his insights widely, even if such sharing would have brought him more fame and influence within the labyrinth of the Pentagon. He was a counselor with one client — the defense secretary — and he kept his focus on that relationship. His willingness to be the unseen adviser to the senior minister to the president on national security was his core strength, and he employed it well. Advertisement
Marshall conversed as easily with my father, a dignified and respected dairy and crop farmer from Indiana, at my last promotion ceremony as he did with secretaries of defense. Dad told me later, “I know he’s a great man. You told me, but he seems like a normal guy from Michigan to me.” He was never impressed with himself. He never bought into the “Yoda” appellation, and it was that humility that provoked the only sharp words he ever spoke to me."

Editor’s Note: The following article is adapted from James L. Buckley’s speech at the National Review Institute Ideas Summit. Before the speech, Buckley announced that it would be his final public appearance.
I thank you for this opportunity to submit my own thoughts on safeguarding the American experiment. What I will propose is a simple reform that would restore a healthy federalism while saving state governments and the feds a pot of money. Advertisement Advertisement
But first, my credentials, such as they are: As I have served in each branch of our federal government, I have been engaged in writing, administering, and interpreting federal laws for much of my working life. Accordingly, I think it is fair to say that I have had more than the average citizen’s opportunity to observe their impact on our lives and the radical changes that have been brought about in how we are governed.
To illustrate the speed with which those changes have taken place, shortly after my election in 1970, I was handed a recent study of Congress that had concluded that the work of the average congressional office had doubled every five years since 1936. Given the fact that, in simpler times, Congress worked at a leisurely pace and was in session for only five or six months a year, its members could take the initial increases in stride simply by devoting more hours per day and more months per year to their work. Over time, however, the available hours and months had been exhausted, and the doubling could only be accommodated by squeezing deliberation out of the legislative process.
This pressure-cooker existence has been the consequence of Congress’s compulsion, beginning in the 1930s, to scratch every itch on the body politic whether it was its constitutional business or not. The result has been an explosion of federal laws and regulations. In 1934, the United States Code consisted of a single volume of federal statutes, the work product of our Congress’s first 137 years. But just 36 years later, when I was elected to the Senate, it had grown to eleven volumes. The current edition now contains thirty-four. But those are just the tip of the governmental iceberg because they are supplemented by an ever-expanding number of small-print regulations that have the force of law and now fill an additional 242 volumes. Those federal laws and regulations now reach into every corner of our lives, and those affected by them must turn to their representatives in Washington for help with matters that were once handled at the state or municipal levels. Advertisement Advertisement
All of these legislative and constitutional pressures have converted Congress from an institution that could once think problems through to responsible conclusions into one that largely substitutes political reflex for reflection. And to compound the injury, a harried Congress now finds it so hard to focus on the messy details of new legislation that it increasingly abdicates its constitutional responsibilities by delegating essentially legislative authority to executive agencies, thereby spawning a largely unaccountable administrative state; an administrative state that issues letters instructing schools on who may use which bathroom without bothering with the pesky procedures that require the scrutiny of new rules before they take effect.
In my view, the serious problems we face these days are in major part the result of our abandonment of the Constitution’s limits on federal authority. American independence was won and the Republic created by a remarkable generation of men who turned a rebellion against the British crown into a transforming moment in human history, one based on the revolutionary proposition that all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with fundamental rights that no government has the moral authority to set aside. But with the gaining of independence, the Founders faced the formidable task of creating a government that could operate effectively while respecting and protecting the liberties for which the Revolution had been fought.
The architects of the American Republic had no illusions about human nature, which is the one constant in human affairs. From their study of the history of free societies reaching back to ancient Greece, they understood that the drive to accumulate power, whether by an individual despot or a parliamentary majority, was the historic enemy of individual freedom. They therefore incorporated two safeguards into the Constitution: its system of separation of powers with its checks and balances and the principle of federalism. In describing the latter, James Madison explained:
The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. … The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.
During the debates over the Constitution’s ratification, many expressed a concern that this allocation of responsibilities was not clear enough in the document itself. As a consequence, the first Congress made it explicit in the Tenth Amendment of the Bill of Rights, which provides that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States by this Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”
The Tenth Amendment’s allocation of powers mirrors those of the venerable Rule of Subsidiarity, which assigns responsibilities to the lowest levels capable of handling them. Its effect is to decentralize political power and ensure, wherever feasible, that the decisions that most directly affect people will be made by those who are the closest to them and most familiar with both their priorities and the relevant facts. Advertisement
This explicit division of governmental labors proved so effective that in a lecture on the American Constitution, with which he had some problems, the great British historian, Lord Acton, nevertheless concluded that “by the development of the principle of federalism, [the American Constitution] has produced a community more powerful, more prosperous, more intelligent, and more free than any other the world has seen.” Advertisement Advertisement
During our first 140 years, Washington largely observed those limits. With the advent of the New Deal, however, it began chipping away at the states’ authority largely through some rather imaginative constructions of the federal government’s power to regulate interstate commerce. But with the advent of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society, Congress began a wholesale assumption of the states’ responsibilities. This was done through a proliferation of programs that offer states and their subdivisions regulation-ridden grants of money for purposes that are acknowledged to be the sole responsibility of the states.
Congress found its authority to create such programs in an unfortunate Supreme Court construction of the Constitution’s Spending Clause, which empowers it to spend money “to pay the debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.” The mischief lies in the words “general Welfare.” During much of our history, the prevailing view was that that phrase did no more than place a limit on Congress’s authority to spend by requiring that federal expenditures serve national as opposed to state or local purposes. Beginning with the 1937 case of Steward Machine Co. v. Davis , however, the Supreme Court has held that in its pursuit of the general welfare, Congress is authorized to provide states with funds with which to implement programs that Congress itself has no power to write into law. The Court recently summarized that holding as enabling Congress to use federal tax revenues to “induce the States to adopt policies that the Federal Government itself could not impose.” But because grants programs deal with matters that are acknowledged to be beyond Congress’s constitutional authority, the Court has ruled that the states may not be coerced into accepting the grants and their attendant regulations. Experience, however, has demonstrated that the states find it enormously difficult to decline them whatever their conditions. Thus the practical effect of the Court’s decision has been to empower Congress to, yes, coerce the states into adopting Washington’s approach to matters that remain the states’ exclusive responsibility. Advertisement
These programs, which are laden with the most detailed instructions, now provide federal subsidies for virtually every activity in which states and their subdivisions are engaged and have made a major contribution to the federal government’s vast expansion. In the process, they distort state priorities, impose ponderous regulations on myriad state and local activities, and deprive their citizens of effective control over how their own taxes are to be used. In sum, they have converted the states in too many ways into mere administrators of programs created in Washington and overseen by bureaucrats who are the furthest removed from where the money is to be spent. As one former Democratic governor put it, “I honestly wondered if I was actually elected governor or just branch manager of Nebraska for the federal government.” Advertisement
Members of Congress have become addicted to grants programs (there are now well over a thousand of them) because they deal with matters that have the most immediate impacts on their constituents’ lives, such as housing, schooling, job training, potholes, you name it. Therefore, their creation and the securing of grants offer them the easiest way to rub elbows with voters and generate the favorable local headlines that will assure their reelection. As a consequence, whereas those programs distributed just $24 billion when I was elected, by 2015 that figure had reached almost $641 billion, or one-sixth of total federal spending, all for purposes that are none of Washington’s business. To that figure should be added another $60-odd billion representing the estimated cost to the federal government of administering the programs. And my understanding is that in the last fiscal year, they have now reached the mid-$700 billions. To compound the injury, instead of concentrating on the critical problems that only Congress can address, its members now devote major portions of their time on matters that are none of their constitutional business.
In short, these programs have effectively nullified the Tenth Amendment, and, in the process, helped undermine Congress’s ability to function effectively. But what can be done about it? Four years ago, I had the temerity to write a book with the title Saving Congress from Itself , in which I detailed the extraordinary systemic and financial costs of those programs on both state and federal levels and proposed a simple reform that would restore federalism; namely, their conversion into block grants free of federal directives telling the states how the money was to be spent. It is a reform that, at one stroke, would reduce federal spending by major amounts in administrative costs alone, rid Congress of a significant distraction from its essential national responsibilities, and restore the people’s ability to control their own state and local affairs. Needless to say, Congress has yet to act on my advice. Advertisement Advertisement
I recognize, however, that we now live in novel times. The power to move political mountains is passing from printed books to the social media, or so I’m told. So there may be another way to force congressional attention. What I dream of is a tweet in which the president advises Congress that he will veto any bill that tells the states how to run their own affairs. Such a tweet would stir up a vigorous debate of the merits of my proposal and encourage its adoption. It might even remind our countrymen that our Constitution indeed places limits on what the federal government may engage in and that the enforcement of those limits might well be in their interest.
If such a debate were to arise, I believe my reform would have a good chance of being adopted. Confidence in the federal government is at an all-time low, and our people still understand the virtues of the Constitution’s allocation of governmental responsibilities even if they are no longer aware of its existence. According to 2013 polling data, today’s Americans believe that state and local governments are best able to handle the following responsibilities by the indicated percentages: housing (by 82 percent of those polled), transportation (78 percent), education (75 percent), and welfare (69 percent). Those are precisely the kinds of responsibilities that the Constitution has reserved to the states, the kinds that federal agencies have taken over.
There is, of course, another way to restore a vigorous federalism, and that is to persuade the Supreme Court to abandon its 1937 interpretation of the Spending Clause. As I noted earlier, the Court has placed a single limit on Congress’s ability to transfer money to the states for purposes that are their exclusive business: namely, the states may not be coerced into accepting the funds and their accompanying baggage.
Eighty years of experience has demonstrated that what is perceived as free money from Washington is virtually impossible to resist whatever the conditions attached to it, and for politically significant reasons. If a state does not participate in a program, its share of the money — money derived in whole or in part from its own taxpayers — will go elsewhere. I say this despite the fact that 23 states declined to participate in Obamacare’s expansion of Medicaid coverage. Their refusal to do so, however, was an exception that proved the rule. Having experienced the huge collateral costs of their existing Medicaid programs, those states merely declined to compound the injury.
In light of this experience, I believe there is a chance that the Supreme Court might reverse its 1937 ruling on the basis that those grants have proven to be inherently coercive. I base this on the Supreme Court’s decision in Brown v. Board of Education , which declared that racial segregation is unconstitutional. In doing so, it overturned its own 57-year-old precedent, in Plessy v. Ferguson , that held that racially segregated facilities are permissible so long as they are equal. The Court reversed Plessy on the ground that experience had proven that segregated facilities are inherently unequal. Accordingly, I can envision the Court reversing Steward Machine Co. on a showing that the grants are indeed coercive. All that is needed to test this thesis is for a group of frustrated governors to challenge the constitutionality of a particularly aggravating category of grants, such as Medicaid. And if any of you have the intimate ear of governors around the country, please urge them to pay attention to what I’ve just said.
But whether or not the Court or Congress obliges me in this regard, we can never relax in our work to protect the Constitution, and its Framers understood this. They understood that preserving the liberties for which the Revolution had been fought would require more than what James Madison referred to as the Constitution’s parchment barriers. They recognized that, in the last analysis, the Constitution’s safeguards would be protected only as long as the public continued to understand and respect them. Advertisement
Unfortunately, over the past generation and more, our educators have abdicated their responsibility to ground their students in the fundamentals of the American experience. As a result, far too many people are suffering from a peculiar form of historical amnesia. They remember all our past sins, such as slavery and our treatment of the Indians. But too few have a sufficient awareness of the constitutional and economic principles that, on the historical record, had made ours the most productive, prosperous, innovative, generous, and free society the world had known; principles that are responsible for the freedoms and material well-being they take so much for granted. But note that I used the word “had” because thanks to the administrative state, we are no longer the world’s freest."
Eric Kaufmann’s ‘Whiteshift’: Immigration Debate and White Identity Politics | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Robert Verbruggen,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/immigration-debate-white-identity-politics-whiteshift-book/,"April 17, 2019 6:30 AM Naturalization ceremony in Los Angeles, Calif., in 2013. (Mario Anzuoni/Reuters) Are white identity politics a solution to our racial woes?
E ric Kaufmann’s Whiteshift is in part a very long, very academic exploration of how immigration is playing out across the West — in particular, of how white majorities are responding to demographic change, including through political resistance, “white flight,” intermarriage, and broadening the definition of whiteness to include those of mixed heritage (a category that includes Kaufmann himself). Advertisement Advertisement
But it’s also, in part, a normative argument about how society should change in response to these trends if it wants to avoid a backlash and potentially even violence, and Kaufmann’s core suggestion is an eye-catcher. He says we need to be more open to anti-immigration arguments rooted in white “ethno-traditional nationalism” — i.e., in the desire of whites to maintain a given ethnic balance in their home countries. This would resolve the double standard in which minority groups are allowed to engage in identity politics but whites are not, a double standard that will become harder to maintain as whites themselves become a minority group. And it would let populists talk out loud about what’s really bothering them, demographic change, so that it can be addressed through policy.
Kaufmann may have a point in regards to Europe — that’s not my area, literally or figuratively — but his narrative doesn’t quite hold up here in the States. Mass immigration poses real difficulties, but at least here, there’s little sign that these problems are reaching any sort of white-backlash crisis point. We don’t need to give in to identity politics and jettison the ideal of colorblindness. To the contrary, maintaining and strengthening this ideal may be the key to winning over the country’s center when its Left is falling off the deep end — and meanwhile, there are concrete changes to the immigration system that can aggressively address the concerns of populists without alienating the middle. Advertisement
The U.S. Is Not Courting an Unmanageable Anti-Immigration Backlash
Let’s start with a Gallup chart that has profoundly influenced my own thinking on immigration and that is discussed for a few pages in Whiteshift as well. (Pew has a very similar chart, for a question specifically about legal immigration, here .) There’s a simple and straightforward way of interpreting it, as well as a far more convoluted way.
The straightforward interpretation is this: The worst of the backlash to the immigration changes passed in the late 1960s, and the illegal-immigration wave that crested in the late 1990s, is already behind us. The desire to reduce immigration is at all-time lows; the desire to increase it is at all-time highs; and the rock-solid median answer is to just leave immigration at its current level. (The shifts are also far too big to be just the result of immigrants themselves answering the poll.) Increasing immigration does not seem smart given that two-thirds of Americans oppose such a move, but cutting immigration looks no better, if we’re talking purely about public opinion.
A Pew question on whether immigrants strengthen or burden the country is also helpful, because the results are broken out by generation since 1994. It shows that generations of Americans have generally become more supportive of immigration as they’ve aged, and also that each generation starts off more pro-immigration than the last. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement
Kaufmann’s discussion of the chart included above is sensible. (His version ends earlier, presumably reflecting the most recent data available as he went to press.) He writes that increased immigration “took place against a backdrop of large-scale liberal attitude change,” with “egalitarian and humanitarian” attitudes on the upswing and an ethos of “universalist individualism” taking root while older, more closed-minded cohorts died off.
But it’s also worth checking his broader narrative of immigration, presented elsewhere in the book, against these data. Part of his case is that populists and extremists can cause problems even if they can’t win elections, which of course is true. But he also argues — in part using lab experiments in which researchers try to trick people into saying what they really think about touchy issues — that (A) political-correctness norms are so strong that whites may be underreporting their opposition to immigration (by as much as half in one study) and (B) populist movements succeed by shattering these norms, opening up space for whites who privately oppose immigration to oppose it publicly as well.
How much you buy this narrative will depend on your trust in Kaufmann’s psychology studies ( replication crisis anyone?) and how plausible you find it a priori . I don’t buy it much at all; in surveys such as the ones above, there may be some misreporting from Americans cowed by the PC haranguings they suffered in college, but “we should have less immigration” is not some beyond-the-pale sentiment that no one will admit to. In addition, open restrictionism has declined since Trump entered the scene, suggesting that if “woke” norms, rather than changing opinions, really are a big part of the story, even a successful presidential candidate who went on about Mexican rapists and Muslim bans did nothing to break them. Indeed, one theory for the recent uptick in support for immigration, which NRO’s Teddy Kupfer explored here , is that the public actually reacts against politicians who turn up the populist heat on issues the way Trump did (and is continuing to do). Advertisement Advertisement
Another consequence of immigration that Kaufmann explores is segregation — the tendency of people to live around others like them. This is, of course, a very real thing: Immigrants set up shop near other immigrants; whites often leave changing neighborhoods or avoid heavily minority ones. If you think human beings lost their natural instinct toward homophily the instant MLK said that thing about the content of your character, Kaufmann’s data will come as an enormous shock. But I was more surprised to see him spend rather little time on a question that might be more important: Are these tendencies getting better or worse ? Advertisement
In fact, one important study found that whites are avoiding diverse areas less than they used to. Another found that “white segregation from others declined significantly from 1980 to 2010, regardless of the measure of segregation or the [definition of the] white population used.” Looking at more specific forms of segregation, whites and blacks are becoming less separated , albeit more slowly than we should want to be the case. White/Hispanic segregation is harder to measure in an informative way — it’s a complicated mix of white flight and avoidance, new immigrants flowing into ethnic enclaves, and immigrants’ descendants integrating into the wider society (sometimes ceasing to identify as Hispanic at all) — but it generally appears to be steady or declining, and at any rate Hispanics have always been less separated from whites than blacks are.
Roughly a third of Americans say they want to reduce immigration — including a quarter who even want to reduce legal immigration — and these folks tend to place the most importance on the issue, so anti-immigration voters can certainly play a huge role in politics, especially with a little push from the math of the Electoral College. But most Americans seem just fine with the level of immigration we have currently, immigration is getting more popular with time, and while segregation will be with us for as long as we are a multiethnic society, it is generally headed in the right direction. Intermarriage is up as well, as Kaufmann documents. Advertisement
Are there changes we should make that the populists would like? Hell yes, as I’ll explain in a bit. Our current immigration system is a farce that does not serve the national interest. But I’m just not sold that these problems are reaching such a crisis point that American society needs to make a deliberate effort to welcome arguments based on “white identity,” voiding the implicit contract whites signed when they got on board with the civil-rights movement, rather than just fixing that system.
Wait, Then How Did Trump Win?
One might reasonably reply: Isn’t the 2016 election unambiguous evidence that immigration opposition is higher than polls would suggest? I don’t think so. Trump’s road to the White House was a fairly odd one, and he had numerous advantages besides his views on immigration, starting with high name recognition and an enviable knack for attracting media attention. The share of Americans who are enthusiastic Trump supporters is fairly small, easily reconcilable with the share who want less immigration.
In the earliest primaries , Trump won only about a third of the Republican vote. The number rose as other candidates dropped out and he gained momentum, but even if we count all of the primary votes — including in states where he faced no opposition at all — only 45 percent of Republicans voted for Trump. He won the nomination not by representing the party’s consensus, but by carving out a niche and benefiting from the fact that the rest of the party was severely fragmented. Then, in the general election, he won only 46 percent of the popular vote, not even a plurality (Clinton won 48 percent). He won the Electoral College thanks to a series of narrow victories in Rust Belt swing states where his message particularly resonated, and as Kaufmann notes, a lot of his voters were simply Republicans who’d have backed whomever the GOP nominated.
It’s also worth asking how much of the Trump phenomenon was even about race and immigration, as opposed to the famed standard explanation of “economic anxiety” (or more nuanced theories such as Tim Carney’s belief that Trump’s appeal was largely to whites in areas with low social capital). Trump made immigration a major part of his campaign, and to top it off he said such outrageous things about the topic that, in order to vote for him, one almost needed to have “ a certain indifference to minority concerns ,” as Ross Douthat has put it. Kaufmann goes much further, though, saying that Trump’s core of support (and that for Brexit as well) really just boils down to white anxiety about demographic change. This despite the fact that, in one of Kaufmann’s own surveys, only a quarter of people who rated Trump a perfect 10/10 saw immigration as their top issue. Advertisement
There are strong signs that economics mattered. An especially interesting and rigorous study — from the economist David Autor and several coauthors, employing a complicated statistical technique called “instrumental variables” — found that places with growing exposure to Chinese imports shifted to Trump, and in fact that Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania would have voted for Clinton had import growth been slowed by half.
How is this study addressed in Whiteshift , which for 500+ pages suffocates its poor readers under a constant avalanche of academic citations? It’s not , perhaps because Kaufmann categorically refuses to look at research that analyzes the geography of the Trump vote as opposed to the attitudes of individual Trump voters, writing, basically, that only idiot journalists draw conclusions based on looking at maps.
Certainly, there are limits to what we can learn from geography, and certainly some geographical patterns (such as the urban/rural split) are far less dramatic when you take individual-level factors (such as education) into account. But there are also limits to how much we can learn from analyzing survey data — i.e., building statistical models, based on questions people may not even have answered honestly, in the hopes of sussing out what truly motivates them deep down . There are even bigger limits to the numerous small-scale social-psychology experiments Kaufmann cites, as well as the opt-in surveys he runs himself. (Again: replication crisis!) You really do need to look at all the evidence available, and the Autor et al. study is strong evidence that economic factors played at least some role.
Trump won fair and square: He got the most delegates in the primary by far, and he won the Electoral College by an enormous margin as well. He might well repeat this performance next year. But his route to victory was quirky, to say the least, and does not force the conclusion that he tapped into a hidden wealth of white-identity-based anti-immigration sentiment lurking in American voters. Most general-election voters, and most Republican-primary voters as well, in fact marked their ballots for someone else — and even his core supporters were not solely motivated by worries about demographic change.
Open White-Identity Politics Are More Plausible Than You May Think . . . but Probably Not the Solution to Much of Anything
Until recently, the split in American politics on racial issues, as played out in the public square, has been between conservatives who insist on colorblindness and liberals who support race-based forms of atonement for this country’s numerous and severe sins against African Americans. But a lot has changed. It has become abundantly clear that growing minority groups, in particular Hispanics and Asians, will be included on both sides of the racial spoils system that liberals have established over the years, most notably including affirmative action — which is of course nonsensical if the purpose of such remedies is to make up for the horrors of slavery and Jim Crow. Also, as Kaufmann deftly explains, liberals, especially white liberals, have shifted drastically to the left on racial matters since about 2015.
The Right faces a decision: Do we double down on colorblindness, or do we insist that white people should get to have identity politics too? When Kaufmann says whites must be allowed to voice fears of demographic change — and that the anti-immigration arguments they’re using now are merely a cover for those fears — he doesn’t say it’s the Right that should shift its rhetoric. But given where the parties are today on race, it’s really not an open question which side this movement would begin on.
Let’s unpack some of the issues involved and the political consequences of going this route. And since everyone agrees that “racism” is bad, that word is a good place to start. Advertisement
As Kaufmann explains, the Left has taken the lead in warping the definition of the term in recent years. I have pushed back against many of these efforts myself; for instance, I think it is absurd to label good-faith empirical claims about racial differences as racist , or to insist that race-based antipathy for whites is somehow not racist . Like Kaufmann, I tend to think that “racism” has to involve, at minimum, some type of ill will against a racial group or a creepy desire for racial purity.
But I blanched at Kaufmann’s defense of “ethno-traditional nationalism,” the desire to preserve the ethnic mix of one’s country, which he insists is not racist. I don’t think it’s a problem at all to resist cultural change, to seek to preserve a way of life in the country or neighborhood around you. Indeed this type of argument is openly debated in public, at least on the right. (Just within the National Review family, see Ramesh Ponnuru and Dennis Prager ; liberals make basically the same case when they oppose gentrification.) I also don’t see how it would be racist to point out that, as a simple matter of fact, people of different ethnicities often don’t get along — and to assert that it’s a legitimate aim of immigration policy to control those tensions. (This played a role in my own thinking back in my more restrictionist days.)
But opposing immigration because you yourself don’t want more people of other races around? That . . . pretty much sounds racist to me.
Yet most of the public disagrees, at least if you phrase the question gingerly. Kaufmann details a survey that asked the following:
A White American who identifies with her group and its history supports a proposal to reduce immigration. Her motivation is to maintain her group’s share of America’s population. Is this person: 1) just acting in her racial self-interest, which is not racist; 2) being racist; 3) don’t know.
Only 11 percent of white Trump voters, 39 percent of the general public, and 73 percent of white Clinton voters thought this was racist. And Kaufmann further shows that even liberals don’t think race-based immigration preferences are racist if you mess with the question a little, to make it about a minority who wants to increase the size of his own group.
These are fascinating results. On a purely political level, the calculation here is more complicated than I might have thought: An argument that I would consider racist is perhaps not that big of a turn-off to the public, a realization many of us also had when Trump consolidated the support of nearly half the country. And Kaufmann has other data as well suggesting that plenty of whites (and even many conservative minorities) aren’t thrilled about the demographic changes that are taking root.
But wait a minute.
If about 60 percent of the country, including a not-insignificant fraction of Clinton voters, is already willing to say in a survey that this isn’t racist, why do only about half that number say they want lower levels of immigration without having to specify a reason at all? It’s important that the question is whether such an appeal is racist, and thus outside the bounds of legitimate debate, not whether such an appeal is, well, appealing — especially when compared with all the other arguments one might make against immigration, including ones involving general cultural change, which tap into somewhat related concerns; and especially when other surveys suggest that whites really like thinking of themselves as colorblind , a phenomenon that is mostly good for race relations even if it can be tone-deaf to minority-specific concerns. (“Not Black Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, dammit!”)
In addition, opposition to these appeals rises with education, which could cause issues when it comes to winning the suburbs, and explicitly racial arguments also pose obvious problems for minority outreach (though only 58 percent of minority Clinton voters agree the white person described above is racist). Further, the severe Trump-voter/Clinton-voter gap in Kaufmann’s poll shows that, at a bare minimum, this is a polarizing message rather than a unifying one for a politician to take up, and that it will alienate many voters in the center, too. The leftward drift of white liberals really ought to present an opportunity to seize that center instead.
Meanwhile, at the end of the day, this is a concern that we’re not actually going to address, no matter the norms we build up around those who raise it, as Kaufmann himself notes. Cutting immigration in half , and simultaneously allocating visas based on skills rather than family connections, would merely delay the onset of a nonwhite majority by a few years . Advertisement
I went into this book thinking Kaufmann’s idea was insane; he convinced me that it’s merely a dubious and unnecessary strategy — even setting aside whether the arguments he wants to see more of are, in fact, racist, and thus something we shouldn’t entertain even if it would work.
Addressing Populist Concerns without Alienating the Middle
One of the more striking patterns apparent throughout Whiteshift is the variation in white opinion across the U.K., America, and Canada — three countries whose whites have an obvious shared history. More than half of whites in the U.K. want to reduce immigration; in the U.S., as we have seen, opposition is far lower; in Canada, despite an immigrant inflow more than twice as big as the U.S.’s in per capita terms, opposition is lower still.
These three countries do have different cultures and different media environments, which Kaufmann emphasizes. But they also have different immigrants: Disproportionately low-skill and Muslim in the U.K., disproportionately low-skill and Hispanic in the U.S., and disproportionately high -skill in Canada. Might it be the case that different kinds of immigrants raise different types of concerns and — rightly or wrongly, but as a matter of fact — end up being welcomed more or less warmly as a result? And what if, instead of seeking lower overall immigration levels or deliberately injecting race into the discussion, America unapologetically took control of its immigration system and focused on getting the immigrants who would fit in the best and contribute the most?
Kaufmann dismisses the idea that white reactions are rooted in much besides race and to some extent culture. (For example, he writes that whites support immigration more after being told that immigrants intermarry frequently, so he suggests basing immigration decisions in part on whether applicants are in inter-ethnic marriages.) But there’s evidence that other characteristics, economic and social, matter a lot more than he lets on.
One recent study found that when an area is exposed to lots of low-skill immigration, it drifts toward the Republicans, the more restrictionist party. The opposite pattern appears with high-skill immigration. These effects stem mainly from the “votes of U.S. citizens,” not from the immigrants themselves, and they “seem independent” of immigrants’ country of origin. Obviously I don’t think driving voters to the Democrats is an end in itself, but this shows an outright positive reaction to the immigrants with the most ability to contribute to a local economy — and what if Republicans were the party of merit-based immigration instead of the party of less immigration?
There’s even a clever psychology experiment with consonant results, if you’re into that sort of thing, as Reihan Salam noted in 2016 :
Levy and Wright conducted an online poll of non-Hispanic whites in California in June 2015. All respondents were read a short vignette about a hypothetical program that would grant legal status to illegal immigrants, and then they were asked whether a hypothetical immigrant ought to be included in the program. One-third were asked about a Mexican immigrant (“Juan”), another third were asked about a Chinese immigrant (“Yuan”), and the final third were asked about a German immigrant (“Johan”). In every case, respondents were told that the immigrant in question had lived in the U.S. for two years. But in only half of them, they were also told that he spoke English and had held a steady job for the duration of his time in the U.S.
Levy and Wright posit that if anti-Hispanic bias were at work, respondents would discount the positive information in the case of Juan while taking account of it in the case of Yuan or Johan. The results were revealing. In the absence of information about English-language fluency or work history, respondents were seven to eight percentage points less likely to believe that Juan should be granted legal status. This clearly suggests some degree of bias. When the positive information was included, however, this gap disappeared. Essentially, Levy and Wright’s respondents were operating under the assumption that Mexican immigrants to the U.S. tend to be less educated than German and Chinese immigrants to the U.S., and so, lacking additional evidence, they assumed that Juan would be needier than Yuan or Johan. Once they knew that Juan spoke English and had been working steadily, they were as inclined to help him as to help his fictional counterparts.
In a more controversial piece of work using data from the U.K., Noah Carl pointed out that popular sentiment toward immigrant groups is correlated with the groups’ own arrest rates . This ties in to some other research suggesting that “stereotypes” are more accurate than we’d like to admit, though one rejoinder is that irrational prejudice could cause police to arrest some groups more than others even if they in fact have the same crime rates.
So there is plenty of reason to think that populist sentiment would be responsive to changes in immigration policy that don’t involve reducing numbers (which most Americans don’t want) or deliberately changing the racial composition of the immigrant inflow (with all the issues that entails). Instead we can aggressively tie the privilege of coming here to the skills and behavior of the potential immigrant in question. Advertisement
As I’ve spelled out before in numerous venues, the current immigration system is a complete disaster. We hand out a million green cards per year, primarily on the basis of family connections rather than skills. We have a “diversity visa lottery” that hands out green cards literally at random to people from certain areas who have at least a high-school degree — and the degree requirement makes it arguably an improvement over the rest of the system. The process for giving out temporary H-1B work visas also runs on a lottery rather than privileging the most skilled or most highly paid applicants. We have failed to police our borders and to find and deport individuals who overstay visas, and while illegal immigration has generally declined in recent years, Congress seems unwilling to fix the fresh crisis brewing as migrant caravans push upward through Mexico. We make a lot of welfare benefits available to immigrants rather than insist that everyone who comes here must support themselves or leave.
It would be possible to overhaul this system in a way that both addresses a lot of populist concerns and avoids alienating the middle. Award green cards through a point system that prioritizes factors like earning potential and English proficiency, limits family preferences to spouses and minor children, and keeps low-skill immigration to a minimum so that native-born low-skill workers experience as tight of a labor market as is possible. Auction H-1Bs. Tighten up border security and require employers to use E-Verify. Ban welfare use for future immigrants. In other words, make it so that immigrants pay lots in taxes and compete with the richest American workers rather than the poorest, and see if attitudes toward immigration don’t improve.
And if Kaufmann proves right and they don’t, some other measures could address cultural and assimilation concerns more directly without having a public debate involving explicitly racial appeals. I’m not averse to giving bonus points for intermarriage, or to requiring immigrants to settle in spread-out locations rather than concentrating in ethnic ghettos, as Lyman Stone has suggested. Other ideas include letting states and localities have some control over how many people can settle there. Adam Ozimek has proposed visas for high-skill workers that would be conditional on their settling in, and hopefully reviving, declining communities in the heartland (which themselves would voluntarily opt in to the program).
I would do all of this long before embarking on a project to normalize openly racial arguments for limiting immigration.
***
To end on a more personal note: Since we’re talking about cultural concerns, what about all of the white Americans who internalized the ideal of colorblindness, have tried to live up to it, and see it as a core aspect of the post–Jim Crow American creed — and a logical implication of the highest ideals this country has stood for from the start — even as we realize that ideals are not the same thing as reality? What about all the black Americans who share the goal of colorblindness even if they know it’s still far away? What about all the immigrants who were attracted to the idea of America as somewhere everyone is free to succeed, regardless of race?"
Incremental Health-Care Reforms Smarter than Obamacare Repeal | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Alex Muresianu,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/health-care-reform-incremental-obamacare-repeal/,"April 17, 2019 6:30 AM (Pixabay) In the long run, Republicans will need to develop a health-care vision. In the meantime, baby-step efforts to fix flaws in the existing system are what’s needed.
W hen congressional Republicans rebuffed President Trump’s renewed push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) on April 2, Trump suggested a plan to pursue another repeal vote after his reelection in 2020. Then, on April 9, the Department of Justice moved to accelerate the appeals process in a court case that it hopes will invalidate the whole ACA as unconstitutional. Advertisement Advertisement
This continued focus on repealing Obamacare is a huge mistake for the GOP.
Obamacare repeal was deeply unpopular among voters and hurt Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections. Making it a top reelection priority would only bring the losing issue back into the spotlight. Instead, the GOP would be wise to counter the progressive push for Medicare for All with small, incremental reforms.
To begin with, Medicare for All is only superficially popular. According to a Kaiser poll , 56 percent of the public supports and 42 percent are opposed. But when respondents learn about its downsides, support wanes rapidly: Only 37 percent support Medicare for All when told it would eliminate private insurance or raise their taxes, and only 26 percent support it when told it would lead to delays in medical treatment. (It would do all of these things and more.)
Americans deserve a better alternative. Advertisement Advertisement
Recent elections show that the party of the health-care status quo tends to have the political edge. Largely thanks to public opposition to the then-new ACA, Republicans trounced Democrats in the 2010 midterms. On the flip side, opposition to ACA repeal helped the Democrats win 40 House seats in the 2018 midterms. For the GOP, making 2020 about “undoing Obamacare,” instead of about Medicare for All’s radical overhaul of the health-care system, would be foolish. By the same token, Republicans can’t afford to defend the status quo, given that a vast majority of Americans view the existing system as seriously flawed.
Pursuing incremental reforms that improve care and make it affordable without throwing the health-care system into uncertainty and chaos is in the GOP’s best interest and the country’s. Luckily, Republicans have already taken some steps to do just that.
A lack of transparency in health-care pricing is one driver of high health-care costs in the U.S.: Patients rarely know the real price of even routine, non-emergency procedures, which allows hospitals to grossly overcharge them. Studies covering different procedures and geographical areas show that prices vary up to 1,000 percent for the same medical procedure in the same metropolitan area. A recent paper in the American Economic Journal found that easy access to price information would significantly reduce costs by helping patients find more affordable options.
Republicans have wisely started focusing on a push for price transparency. In January, the Trump administration imposed a rule requiring hospitals to post procedure prices online for patients to see. That’s a good start, but it isn’t enough. They should follow through on another administration proposal that would require insurers to disclose the prices they negotiate with providers. These secret contracts hide the real cost of care from consumers, as hospitals collude with insurers to push patients away from lower-cost providers. Making them public would give patients a more comprehensive view of real procedure costs, forcing providers to lower their prices by allowing patients to find less expensive care. Advertisement Advertisement
Another way hospitals help suppress competition in health care is through market consolidation. The number of hospitals has shrunk dramatically in recent years thanks to hospital mergers and acquisitions. When a health-care market includes only one provider, prices will rise. A New York Times analysis found that the price of hospital stays increased as much as 54 percent in areas that went from having multiple hospitals to having only one, as opposed to increases of roughly 10 percent in comparable areas with multiple hospitals.
One approach to this issue is to improve anti-trust enforcement. Anti-trust laws have seen a resurgence in support of late among both progressives and conservatives who see them as a way to rein in the power of Big Tech, but monopolies in the health-care industry are much more harmful to consumer welfare. Republicans can back a bill proposed by Representative Jim Banks (R., Ind.) that would strengthen the Federal Trade Commission’s enforcement of anti-consolidation law against hospital mergers and end the ban on the construction of new, physician-owned hospitals, among other pro-competition measures. Advertisement
Republicans could also roll back certificate-of-need (CON) laws, which restrict the entry of new providers into the market unless they can prove to state and local governments that the area they aim to serve “needs” a new provider. Existing hospitals lobby such governments to bar new, lower-cost providers from forming, and the ensuing lack of competition only increases prices for patients. The federal government incentivized states to adopt CON laws in the 1970s — now, it should incentivize states to repeal them. Advertisement"

The Washington Post's Ben Shapiro Smear | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Kyle Smith,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/progressivism-as-failure-insurance/,"Follow Kyle Smith on Twitter April 17, 2019 9:50 AM Ben Shapiro speaking at the 2018 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Md., February 22, 2018. (Gage Skidmore)
After New Yorker staffer Talia Lavin executed one of the most spectacular face-plants in social-media hacktivist history — she essentially accused a Marine veteran of the Afghanistan war of being a Nazi because she confused a tattooed symbol of his platoon with the Third Reich’s Iron Cross — she quickly found herself no longer employed by The New Yorker . But, hey, here she is teaching at NYU and writing for the Washington Post ’s op-ed page! Where she just wrote what has to be one of the worst paragraphs ever to appear in that paper, issuing a nonsensical smear of Ben Shapiro for writing a few kind and thoughtful words about the inferno at Notre-Dame de Paris. Advertisement Advertisement
Thought-experiment time. What if Lavin had been a right-wing writer who had smeared, say, a disabled gay person of color as a Nazi? Would the Washington Post or any other respected news outlet be eager to publish her thoughts? Lavin would have had to seek another line of work. Being stridently of the Left seems to act as a magical shield against harm. Progressivism is a kind of failure-inoculation. No matter how badly you mess up, you’ll be fine. After waiting a bit, editors will bend over backwards to forgive you and even promote you to the next level. (Writing opinion for the Washington Post beats fact-checking at The New Yorker .)
Lavin’s behavior after smearing wheelchair-using Marine veteran Justin Gaertner (which came in the context of the Left’s broader war against ICE, Gaertner’s subsequent employer) was obnoxious. She issued the following exceptionally thin and unsatisfying apology: “To Justin Gaertner, I apologize, sincerely: all I saw in you was the photo ICE tweeted, and not the human being depicted inside it. It was uncharitable, and the hasty deletion doesn’t change that. I’m sorry and I have voluntarily resigned after three years at the New Yorker .” Advertisement
Uncharitable! Lavin’s post wasn’t “uncharitable,” it was completely wrong, in addition to being hateful and calculated to ruin a veteran’s career, if not his life, simply because he worked for a government agency Lavin doesn’t like. Calling someone a Nazi goes a good long way past “uncharitable.” Lavin then assumed the classic I’m-the-real-victim pose that has become a highly successful tactic on the left: She claimed she had been targeted by ICE: “I do not think it is acceptable for a federal agency to target a private citizen for a good faith, hastily rectified error.”
The word “targeted,” as used by the Left, today means, “I can say mean things about you, but you’re not allowed to say mean things about me. That would be harassment. If everyone on my side unloads on you, that’s your just deserts, you horrible person. If everyone on your side does the same to me, that’s a flagrant foul.” Advertisement Advertisement
Anyway, ICE didn’t target Lavin in the first place. It simply and properly pointed out that Lavin had issued a smear and demanded an appropriate apology. ICE’s statement read, in pertinent part, “Anyone attempting to advance their personal political opinions by baselessly slandering an American hero should be issuing public apologies to Mr. Gaertner and retractions. This includes Levin [sic] and the New Yorker .” Moreover, Lavin’s claim of an error made in “good faith” is risible. “Hey, bud, I only called you a Nazi, no hard feelings, mate!” Lavin worked at The New Yorker long enough to know that you should probably call someone for comment first before publicly accusing him of being a Hitlerite. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
No surprise that Lavin was soon hired by Media Matters for America, which is pretty much built on the kinds of attacks she had already proved capable of. But in her Washington Post column the paper didn’t mention that she is affiliated with MMFA. That would have been useful information since the group appears nakedly partisan, at least to anyone with eyes — and if there was any doubt on this matter, the group responded to Shapiro yesterday with the following tweet from its official account: “F**k you and the burro you rode in on.” The WaPo simply identified Lavin as “a writer and researcher based in Brooklyn.” Advertisement
As I write, the WaPo has still not corrected or apologized for Lavin’s outrageous smear of Shapiro: She said he was a “far-right pundit” who had “evoked the specter of a war between Islam and the West that is already part of numerous far-right narratives” when he called Notre-Dame “a monument to Western civilization” and “Judeo-Christian heritage.” The same Lavin paragraph went on to insinuate a connection between Shapiro’s thinking and that of Richard Spencer and the mass killer in Christchurch, New Zealand. Lavin’s column was at some point updated to included the following extremely uncharitable sentence: “(On Tuesday, Shapiro called this article ‘simply gross’ and said he called Notre Dame a monument to Western civilization ‘because it is,’ not because of ‘malicious intent.’)” Lavin completely ignored Shapiro’s main point, which is that he hadn’t blamed Muslims for the fire and objected to her insinuating otherwise. The kind of unfair undergraduate-level snark in the added sentence is par for the course at MMFA, but the Washington Post opinion page shouldn’t stoop to this. Advertisement"
Campus Free-Speech Crisis: University of Arizona Border Patrol Meltdown | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Stanley Kurtz,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/campus-free-speech-turning-point-university-of-arizona/,"April 17, 2019 10:32 AM The University of Arizona (Wikimedia)
Amid the weekly cavalcade of campus horrors , it’s easy to miss a story that will mark a major turning point in the campus free-speech crisis, whether for good or ill. The growing confrontation at the University of Arizona over students who disrupted a Career Day presentation by Border Patrol agents is not your run-of-the-mill campus outrage. Instead it’s that rare case where student disruptors are facing real consequences for their actions. This is in significant part because of a new Arizona law strengthening discipline for such disruptions. If the university holds fast and the disruptors pay a price for silencing others, the move will carry national implications. Yet if the growing rebellion by anti-free-speech students and faculty at UA gets its way, the university will back down, the border patrol will be permanently barred from campus, and the university president could lose his job. That would be a disaster for free speech, and would mark a new and dangerous turn in America’s campus crisis. Advertisement Advertisement
Before taking the measure of the stakes in this battle, we’ve got to review the precipitating incident. Advertisement
On March 19, a UA student named Denisse Moreno Melchor noticed a pair of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at the school. “I was like, ‘Get out,’ and started chanting and disrupting that space until they left,” she told the school paper the next day. The March 19 event that Melchor had — in her own words — disrupted, was a Career Day presentation being given by two border-patrol agents to the school’s Criminal Justice Association. You can see from videos originally taken by Melchor and reposted here that a she is hurling insults at the officers through a door, continuously calling them “murderers,” the “murder patrol,” and an “extension of the KKK.” As the officers are distracted by the chanting, some of the students in attendance move toward the door to help secure the scene.
At that point, a woman later identified as Luisa Pinto, a major in criminal-justice studies and president of the Criminal Justice Association, invites Melchor to sit inside [1:35]. Melchor replies, “Great, I can sit in, the entire time I’ll just be saying that they’re murderers, the entire f***ing time.” In other words, Melchor promises to continue disrupting, even if she’s allowed to sit inside. Advertisement
At some point Melchor was joined by other students, and apparently by a UA employee as well. The latter part of the video records several protesters as they follow the agents to their cars while chanting “murder patrol.” At one point the students shout: “We won’t stop until you get off our campus.” So it’s evident from the words of the protesters themselves that right from the classroom disruption through the pursuit of the officers through the hallways, the intention of the chanting was to cut short any dialogue and drive the officers from campus. Advertisement
An early assessment of this incident characterized it as a free speech close call . But while appropriate discipline for these offenders is up for debate, I don’t think there’s any doubt that this was a punishable disruption. The chanting was continuous, and was plainly intended to interfere with normal verbal exchange. This is not a case of a few spontaneous boos thrown at a speaker who has said something the audience disagrees with. Melchor wasn’t even listening to the presentation. She was just chanting “murder patrol,” as were the students who later joined her. Advertisement
We also now have comments from Luisa Pinto, president of the Criminal Justice Association, who clearly believes that Melchor interfered with the agents’ presentation. According to Pinto: “She [Melchor] has every right to scream and yell all she wants outside the building, but the moment she’s inside a building and interfering with our education…our rights were violated.” Pinto also says that after the incident she contacted club members and was told that, given the disruption, they had not been able to learn anything from the presentation. In other words, this was a shout-down.
Certainly it’s important to attend to any evidence that might emerge at future hearings with an open mind. As of now, however, it seems clear that this was a punishable disruption. Advertisement Advertisement
The story up to this point is all-too-familiar. Yet events now take a new turn. Instead of rolling over, UA campus police filed criminal misdemeanor charges of “interference with the peaceful conduct of an educational institution” against Melchor and two other students, while Melchor was also charged with “threats and intimidation.” UA President Robert Robbins then backed up the campus police. “Student protest is protected by our support for free speech,” said Robbins, “but disruption is not.” Some claim the university’s concern with the incident only followed public outrage at the viral video of the disruption. The university denies this, but what does it matter? If it took legitimate public outrage to push administrators to act, that’s fine. What’s important is that discipline is warranted.
There’s another factor here as well. About a year ago, Arizona passed a campus free speech law that includes robust protections against shout-downs. That law is based on a nationally influential model published by Arizona’s Goldwater Institute. (Along with Jim Manley and Jonathan Butcher, I am a co-author of that model.) Many states have passed more limited laws abolishing restrictive campus-speech codes and so-called free-speech zones. But in addition to abolishing codes, zones, barring speaker disinvitations, and other matters, Goldwater-based laws include provisions for the discipline of shout-downs. Goldwater-based laws also establish an oversight system to ensure that administrators actually enforce the law’s provisions. President Robbins surely had the new state law in mind when he refused to withdraw the charges filed by campus police. Advertisement Advertisement
That said, it is by no means the case that Arizona’s new campus free-speech law requires the filing of criminal misdemeanor charges in response to a shout-down. On the contrary, the law actually focuses on the need for administrative hearings within the university, hearings at which accused disruptors are granted robust due-process rights. And the main punishments contemplated by the law are levied by the university itself — more like suspension from school than jail time. While misdemeanor charges certainly aren’t forbidden by the new law and are within the range of appropriate punishment in this case, I must admit to a slight preference for handling this case within the university, with perhaps 30-day suspensions in play for the offenders.
Still, I doubt the judge will give the students the maximum six-month sentence. They’re more likely to draw a slap on the wrist instead. And as we’ll see, the complete lack of remorse on the part of Melchor should also be taken into account. Fortunately, the university has also initiated an administrative investigation of this incident. That means the accused might ultimately be charged with violations of the student code of conduct in addition to, or even in place of, charges in court. The important point is that the disruptors must face significant consequences for their actions, whether that comes through the courts or via internal university procedures. In either case, the new campus free-speech law is a big part of why real consequences are still in play in this case.
Don’t think for a minute that the matter rests here, however. Administrators regularly cave to shout-downs for a reason. They’re afraid that what’s happening now at UA will happen to them. Students have come out in force to protest discipline for the disruptors. They’ve also been joined by hundreds of faculty members, largely from UA’s highly politicized minority studies programs. Student and faculty demonstrators poured into a recent meeting of the University of Arizona’s Board of Regents, the body responsible for overseeing the administrative handling of the new campus free-speech law.
The protesters claimed that the accused disruptors are being silenced, yet it’s actually quite the opposite . It’s the disruptors who silenced the border patrol and played havoc with their fellow students’ right to listen and learn. And if you attend carefully to the protesting faculty’s letter , the implicit message seems to be “Ignore the disruption, whether it happened or not.”
The student and faculty defenders of the accused disruptors style themselves “The Coalition for the Arizona 3.” The group has three demands: 1) drop any charges against the accused disruptors, whether criminal or within the university; 2) agents of ICE and the Border Patrol must be permanently banned from campus; and 3) if the first two demands are not met, President Robbins must resign.
If you think this last demand is far-fetched, recall the 2015 conflict at the University of Missouri. That debacle helped kick off the latest phase of the campus free-speech crisis. No more than a few dozen protesters blocked President Tim Wolfe’s car during a homecoming parade, made some highly debatable accusations against the campus atmosphere, and managed to force Wolfe’s resignation. This sent Mizzou into a tail-spin from which it has yet to recover. The forces arrayed against President Robbins at the University of Arizona are already far more formidable than was the pressure on President Wolfe at Mizzou in 2015. Stay Updated with NR Daily
NR's afternoon roundup of the day's best commentary & must-read analysis.
And what of the other demands? Drop the misdemeanor charges and halt the investigation of student conduct code violations? Why? Is The Coalition for the Arizona 3 afraid of the facts in this case? The coalition does not marshal evidence to show that this was no disruption, yet they claim that the speech of the accused is being suppressed. That’s not what the video or the available testimony show. Why not let the rest of the facts come out in hearings at court or in school?
As for the demand that ICE and the Border Patrol be barred from campus, the Coalition for the Arizona 3 gives itself away here. This demand is entirely antithetical to freedom of speech and the rule of law. For one thing, the new Arizona campus free-speech law bars disinvitations by explicitly declaring the university, “open to any speaker whom a student, student group, or faculty member has invited.” Yet hundreds of students and faculty at UA want to permanently achieve precisely what the disruptors were aiming for on March 19. They want to kick the Border Patrol off campus forever, whether other students wish to invite them or not. That would be a gross violation of free speech, and of the new state law. More broadly, barring the Border Patrol would be an insult to the rule of law itself. Law enforcement cannot and must not be banned from the campus of a public university. Advertisement
Melchor reportedly delivered the coalition’s demands when she spoke at the recent Board of Regents meeting. She insisted that the charges against her be dropped, that the agents she shouted-down be barred from campus forever, and that President Robbins must resign should he refuses to obey. That doesn’t sound like remorse to me.
In a recent interview , Melchor also said she doesn’t believe that Border Patrol agents should be allowed to present their perspective on campus. Clearly, this is a person who does not believe in free speech. It seems reasonable to conclude that this viewpoint guided her actions on March 19.
The Mizzou fiasco of 2015 sparked a major escalation of the campus free-speech crisis. We are now at a moment that could easily be as consequential — although perhaps in the direction of improvement. President Robbins must not be fired or made to resign because he refuses to withdraw the charges. And whether by trial for a misdemeanor, or by administrative discipline for violation of the student-conduct code, or both, the accused disruptors must face significant consequences should hearings bear out what currently available evidence indicates.
I can’t think of a single case since 2015 in which a shout-down has been disciplined in a way likely to deter future incidents. In the few cases where discipline has been applied, other administrative actions have nullified the deterrent effect. But if the University of Arizona follows through and the disruptors face real consequences, we might someday reach the point where shout-downs will stop and discipline will seldom, if ever, be required. The point is not to punish but to prevent speech-suppression from happening in the first place. A few well-handled instances of discipline in the near term could be enough to establish deterrence and render punishments at UA unnecessary down the road. That would send out a signal nationally.
On the other hand, should the Coalition for the Arizona 3 carry the day, it would effectively green-light further shout-downs. And it would show for now that even in the face of a law to the contrary, campus administrators have been completely cowed by the anti-free speech left. I say “for now,” because Arizona’s new law provides for recourse in the event of such a drastic capitulation. The new law instructs the Arizona Board of Regents to create a committee to write an annual oversight report on the administrative handling of free speech. That report must comment on discipline for shout-downs, in particular. If President Robbins surrenders, and the disruptors face no consequences either in court or within the university, then it is the obligation of the oversight report to condemn this. It is also the obligation of the legislature to respond by cutting back funding for the university."
William Barr: Attorney General Blocks Some Asylum Seekers From Release on Bond | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Mairead Mcardle,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/barr-blocks-some-asylum-seekers-from-release-on-bond/,"Follow Mairead McArdle on Twitter April 17, 2019 9:53 AM Central American migrants being held by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in El Paso, Texas, March 27, 2019 (Jose Luis Gonzalez/Reuters)
Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday reversed a ruling that allowed migrants to be released on bond who had crossed the southern border illegally and then established they had “credible fear” of returning to their home countries.
“I conclude that such aliens remain ineligible for bond, whether they are arriving at the border or are apprehended in the United States,” Barr wrote in his opinion.
Barr’s move leaves the decision up to the Department of Homeland Security of whether individual immigrants who crossed the border illegally and later claimed asylum should be temporarily released. The change scraps a 2005 immigration court ruling allowing bond hearings for such migrants.
Immigration lawyers and immigrant rights advocates had pushed for the release on bond of immigrants who demonstrated credible fear, arguing that it is not in the interest of the U.S. to detain migrants who have shown they have a legitimate case for asylum. Stay Updated with NR Daily

The new policy does not apply to migrant children, either alone or with their families, or those applying to enter the country at a port of entry, and will take effect in 90 days.
“This is the Trump administration’s latest assault on people fleeing persecution and seeking refuge in the United States,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project in a statement. “Our Constitution does not allow the government to lock up asylum seekers without basic due process.

Southbend, Ind. mayor and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg suggested in a recent interview that the strain of populism harnessed by President Donald Trump represents a “white-guy identity politics.” Comments
“By far the political movement that is most based on identity politics is Trumpism. It’s based on white-guy identity politics. It uses race to divide the working and middle class,” Buttigieg told the Associated Press when asked whether Trump relied on racial animus to win the White House. “There are a lot of strategies to blame problems on people who look different or are of a different faith or even of a different sexuality or gender identity. . . . It’s a cynical political strategy that works in the short term but winds up weakening the whole country in the long term.”
Since rising over the past few months from relative obscurity to third in national polls of the race, Buttigieg has turned criticisms traditionally leveled by Republicans at Democrats around on the party of Trump. “First comes freedom, something that our conservative friends have come to think of as their own. . . . Let me tell you: Freedom doesn’t belong to one political party. Freedom has been a Democratic bedrock ever since the New Deal. Freedom from want, freedom from fear,” Buttigieg said when announcing his campaign Sunday. “Our conservative friends care about freedom, but only make it part of the journey. They only see ‘freedom from.’ But that’s not true,” he continued. “Your neighbor can make you unfree. Your cable company can make you unfree. There’s a lot more to your freedom than the size of your government.”
Buttigieg drew a crowd of 1,600 to a rally in Des Moines, Iowa Tuesday night and, according to a recent Emerson poll , he now trails only Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination."

A Florida woman said to be obsessed with the 1999 massacre at Colorado’s Columbine High School has reportedly died after a massive FBI manhunt.
Authorities said Sol Pais, 18, made disturbing remarks about Columbine as Saturday’s 20th anniversary of the shooting approached and was apparently “infatuated with the perpetrators.” She flew to Colorado on Monday, purchasing a pump-action shotgun after landing, and was considered armed and dangerous before she was found dead, Denver’s local CBS affiliate reported , citing a law enforcement source in Clear Creek County. The FBI’s Denver office later wrote on Twitter that the manhunt had ended.
Authorities had stressed that while Pais had made no specific threats on area schools, they considered her a threat to the community. Accordingly, many Colorado school districts canceled classes Wednesday, telling staff and students to stay home. Stay Updated with NR Daily

Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) questions Michael Cohen on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., February 27, 2019. (Joshua Roberts/Reuters)
Representative Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) hosted an extremist anti-Israel activist who has openly and explicitly endorsed terrorism at her congressional office in mid-April to celebrate the American Muslims for Palestine Advocacy Day.
The organization American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), which organized the meeting, posted a photo on its Facebook page of Tlaib standing next to Joe Catron, a veteran anti-Israel activist who has openly praised various Palestinian organizations for committing acts of terrorism.
“A tip of my hat to Rashida Tlaib, who really goes above and beyond the call of duty in welcoming every supporter of Palestine to her office, listening to what we have to say, answering our questions, and posing for endless pictures,” Catron wrote on Facebook in a post first noted by the Daily Caller .
Catron serves as U.S. coordinator of the Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network, an arm of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which the U.S., Australia, Japan, Canada, and the E.U. have all designated a terrorist organization.
In 2017, Catron used his personal Twitter account to praise a PFLP-organized terror attack in which an Israeli police officer was stabbed to death. Catron shared the PFLP’s official statement praising the members who perpetrated the murder and personally referred to the attack as “heroic.” Statement by the PFLP on the heroic “Promise of al-Buraq” operation https://t.co/JIwp38BZg6 pic.twitter.com/CEAF6t8rqb

Tlaib has faced significant criticism since her election over her ties to anti-Semitic Palestinian activists and her support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, which seeks to put financial pressure on Israel. In January, she attended a dinner with Palestinian activist Abbas Hamideh, who has referred to Israel as a “terrorist identity” and likened the state’s underlying ideology to that of ISIS.
Additionally, one of Tlaib’s top fundraisers, Maher Abdel-qader, has repeatedly espoused anti-Semitic tropes online. Abdel-qader created the Facebook group “Palestinian American Congress,” which often hosts anti-Semitic discussions and which Tlaib is a member of. And, in 2006, Tlaib wrote a column for Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan’s anti-Semitic publication Final Call."
Judi Dench & 'Red Joan' Review -- Movie Joins a Rogues’ Gallery of Resisters | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Armond White,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/red-joan-joins-a-rogues-gallery-of-resisters/,"April 17, 2019 2:42 PM Judi Dench stars in Red Joan . (Lionsgate Films) Judi Dench in a guess-the-genre political sob story
R ed Joan is a love story, a political thriller, a woman’s coming-of-age sexual memoir, and a history of British espionage just before and after World War II. It is also a crock. Based on real-life KGB spy Melita Norwood, Red Joan ’s sentimental exoneration of one woman’s treason and sedition fits with how today’s media pay tribute to the kaffeeklatsch of political resisters. Advertisement Advertisement
Judi Dench plays title character Joan Stanley as a kindly widow suddenly exposed by the British government for her activities, 60 years earlier, relaying wartime bomb secrets to Russia. Crone Joan’s mummified on-trial look (Dench’s facial wattles, a padded, thick rump, and flabby legs with an ankle monitor) dissolves into flashbacks played by pouty Sophie Cookson, who beams a girlish complexion and period hairdos as a student at Cambridge University. Cookson never locates her character’s sexual-political tension, which was the key to every characterization in the film version of Mary McCarthy’s The Group , because that complexity isn’t part of this film’s reverential concept.
Young Joan is seduced by a pair of sexy Jewish radicals, Sonya (Tereza Srbova), who teaches her espionage tricks, and firebrand Leo (Tom Hughes), who talks of religion when he has politics in mind. Their exoticism, flaunting past political persecution, is meant to excuse WASP Joan’s uncritical fascination. Advertisement
Asked, “Who politicized you then?” Old Joan’s response, “That’s a strange way to put it,” epitomizes the disingenuousness of red-diaper-baby filmmaking that dodges political intent and refuses to admit its Communist sympathies. This is where Red Joan stops being entertainment and becomes romanticized indoctrination. Leftist attitudes are dramatized as the norm.
Joan defends her romantic intrigues and professional deceptions that include blackmailing her Cambridge colleagues. She prevaricates: “I have also been accused of deceiving my country. I am not a spy. I’m not a traitor. I wanted everyone to share the same knowledge. Because only that way could the horror of another world war be averted and I think if you look back at history, you’ll see I was right.” Advertisement
Such self-justification characterizes today’s progressive self-righteousness. Joan’s specious concern for issues (she’s a prototype for Britain’s Ban the Bomb movement) derails her sense of nationalism and, in the long run, derails morality itself. Red Joan ’s plot resembles the 2010 Helen Mirren–Jessica Chastain film The Debt , which used sexy flashbacks to bolster modern-day historical revisionism about Cold War conflict. Advertisement
For readers who think a film review overpoliticizes entertainment, this is how overly melodramatic political filmmaking turns rancid. In a perfect parallel to contemporary deep-state crises of espionage and subterfuge, Joan’s arrogance corresponds to the Barack Obama–Bernie Sanders promise to “fundamentally transform” a nation by any means necessary."

I can’t be the only person who sighed upon learning this morning that Representative Seth Moulton (D., Mass.) was spotted recording a presidential announcement video . Another day, and another Democrat is preparing to run for president. What makes Moulton, a Marine elected to Congress in 2014, believe he can defeat Biden, Bernie, Beto, and Buttigieg? His first problem is he doesn’t have the letter “ B ” as an initial. That alone puts him in the second tier. Advertisement Advertisement
The Democratic field, which could boast more than 20 candidates by end of summer, is reaching absurd proportions. A tragedy of the commons looms. Too many Democrats grazing on the same limited resource — the non-Sanders primary vote — will help Bernie win the nomination. Why are Democrats willing to take such a risk?
Sanders provides a clue. His tax returns confirm that 2016 made America’s most famous democratic socialist a wealthy man. He might be a cause-oriented-politician — Moulton too — but for many officeholders a presidential campaign is above all an excellent business opportunity. Cable appearances build notoriety. Fundraising enhances professional networks. Losing candidate often emerge with television contracts or book deals. No one had heard of Andrew Yang before he launched his (long shot) bid. Now he’s been on The Daily Show and Tucker Carlson Tonight ."

Yemen's War & President Trump -- U.S War in Yemen Is Unconstitutional | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,David French,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/americas-war-in-yemen-is-plainly-unconstitutional/,"Follow David French on Twitter April 17, 2019 2:56 PM President Donald Trump listens as he meets with Danny Burch, a former hostage in Yemen, Washington, D.C., March 6, 2019. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) The president’s veto of a bipartisan resolution demanding the end of American involvement in the conflict further degrades our constitutional architecture.
Y esterday, Donald Trump vetoed a bipartisan congressional resolution demanding an end to U.S. involvement in Yemen’s civil war. It’s now official: The president who ran for office pledging to reduce military entanglements abroad is involving American forces in a foreign war in direct defiance of the plain language of the Constitution. Advertisement Advertisement
First, some background. Beginning in 2015, the Obama administration recklessly inserted itself into Saudi Arabia’s proxy war with Iran, backing Saudi military action against Yemen’s Houthi rebels. America has long been an important source of arms for Saudi Arabia, but Obama’s support went well beyond merely providing planes and bombs. His administration also authorized other active, indispensable support, including aerial refueling and targeting assistance.
This direct involvement represented an act of war by any reasonable measure, and there is no meaningful argument that it was enabled by any existing congressional war authorization. The Authorization for the Use of Military Force enacted after the 9/11 attacks plainly doesn’t apply to Iran-backed Shiite rebels fighting in Yemen (though it does apply to al-Qaeda cells active in the country), nor does the subsequent Iraq War authorization.
Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution grants Congress the exclusive authority to declare war. Yes, Article II declares that the president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, but reading the two clauses together, their meaning is plain: The president commands American forces when Congress declares war. Yes, the president has inherent authority to order immediate military actions in times of crisis, but he should also promptly seek congressional approval for such actions. Advertisement
No one should pretend that there aren’t constitutional gray areas in this structure, of course: How long can a president respond to an emergency before Congress must ratify or reject the conflict? Once Congress has authorized any given action, how far can a president extend or expand a conflict? Does the authorization of force against al-Qaeda extend to, say, al-Qaeda progeny such as ISIS? Does the authorization of war in Iraq extend to actions deemed militarily necessary to stabilize the country, like the use of force in Syria? Advertisement
These are all good constitutional questions, but they’re beside the point because none of them apply to the conflict in Yemen. President Obama wasn’t responding to a true national emergency in backing the Saudis against the Houthis, and President Trump isn’t responding to a true national emergency in continuing to back the Saudis. They were (and are) waging a new conflict against a new enemy. Advertisement
Late last year, in the resolution Trump just vetoed, Congress rejected military action in Yemen under the provisions of the War Powers Act, a controversial 1973 statue passed over Richard Nixon’s veto. The Act attempted to answer the thorny constitutional issues outlined above by requiring a president to consult with Congress within 48 hours of the introduction of American forces into foreign hostilities. Congress can then, by resolution, terminate American involvement. 50 U.S.C. Section 1544(c) states that “at any time that United States Armed Forces are engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the United States, its possessions and territories without a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the President if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.” (Emphasis added.)
Presidents have opposed the War Powers Act ever since its passage, even as they’ve frequently complied with its terms. They have historically taken such a broad view of their commander-in-chief powers as to functionally write Congress’s war-making power out of the Constitution. If a president can fight when he wants, where he wants, and for as long as he wants, then Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 is meaningless. Advertisement Advertisement
Moreover, even Trump’s veto is an unconstitutional act. A declaration of war requires an affirmative act of Congress. A bipartisan majority’s rejection of American participation in the Yemeni conflict is anything but an affirmation. And when the Constitution requires congressional affirmation, then congressional rejection can’t be vetoed by the president."

South Bend, Ind. mayor and Democratic 2020 presidential contender Pete Buttigieg expressed support Wednesday for a federal ban on what he called “weapons of war.”
“As somebody who is very familiar from my military training with weapons of war, somebody who carried a rifle and a pistol around a foreign land on order of the president, [I think] there are some weapons that just don’t belong in our neighborhoods in peace time in America,” he said during a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa. “We’ve already decided that this is within the Second Amendment because we’ve decided that somewhere in between a slingshot and a nuclear weapon, we can draw a line. And that’s not unconstitutional, it’s common sense.”
“And that’s why I think assault rifles need to be on the table too,” he concluded, referring to a potential assault-weapon ban.

Buttigieg’s framing of the gun-control issue, which conflates the semi-automatic rifles available to civilians with the fully automatic rifles distributed to service-members, echoes Representative Eric Swalwell’s call for a federal ban on so-called “weapons of war,” which he believes is necessary to reduce mass shootings."
Nigel Farage's 'Brexit Party' Is Gaining Steam | National Review,www.nationalreview.com,Madeleine Kearns,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/nigel-farages-brexit-party-is-gaining-steam/,"April 17, 2019 4:24 PM Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage attends a March to Leave demonstration in London, England, March 29, 2019.

That Britain, whose voters chose to leave the EU in 2016, will partake in the European Parliament elections next month is frankly absurd. Britain was supposed to have left the bloc already (Brexit day was scheduled for March 31, was extended to mid-April, and was extended again to October 31). And elected British MEPs — presuming that Brexit still happens — would have to vacate their seats almost immediately. Advertisement Advertisement
This is yet another source of voter frustration. And Nigel Farage, the former UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader, has seized it as an opportunity to gain support for his “Brexit party,” launched April 12. According to a YouGov poll, the Brexit party is leading with 27 percent of the vote. Labour is at 22 percent and the Conservatives are trailing behind at 15 percent.
This is bad news for the Conservative party who are — at least ostensibly — the Brexit party. Around 70 percent of Conservative constituencies voted Leave in the 2017 election, and it has been the task of the Conservative government for the past two years to deliver this result. But they haven’t. Failure after failure, broken promise after broken promise; an entirely self-inflicted crisis of trust is upon them, and the gulf between Parliament and ordinary voters is ever widening. The worry now is that the Tories might bleed Euro-skeptics to Farage’s single-issue party.
This is also a concern for the Labour party since 60 percent of its constituencies also voted Leave. So far, the Labour party has gotten away with a deliberately ambiguous line on Brexit. But in future elections, they’ll need to step up. Advertisement
Might a compromise between the two parties be possible? Might that help ease Brexit along? Well, cross-party talks are ongoing. However, party leaders are struggling to put their differences aside. For instance, Corbyn has expressed outrage that the Tories want “to turn this country into a deregulated, low-tax society which will do a deal with Trump.” Theresa May’s deal has already failed three times, yet with her authority hollowed out, she shows no signs of stepping down this side of Brexit.

Sinema joined the Department of Homeland Security and the White House in calling attention to the failure of U.S. immigration law to address the record number of Central American asylum-seekers streaming across the border. Under current law, those migrants are legally entitled to remain in the U.S. while their cases are being adjudicated.
The problem is further exacerbated by the composition of the migrants; many of them are women and children who cannot be detained in facilities that were designed to house single men. The lack of adequate resources forced authorities to release 18,500 immigrants from federal detention into Arizona between December 21 and March 20. Stay Updated with NR Daily

“The sheer volume of family units crossing the border has overwhelmed ICE’s limited transportation resources; combined with a requirement to detain these individuals for no more than 20 days, the agency has no option but to expeditiously arrange for their release,” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement released last month.
President Trump, after ousting Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen earlier this month, has reportedly considered a number of legally risky executive actions to stem the flow of migrants in response to congressional inaction.
Attorney General William Barr on Wednesday announced one such measure, which will prohibit asylum seekers who have established a “credible fear” of returning to their home country from being released into the U.S. on bond. Under the new policy, which reverses a standing Department of Justice rule, asylum-seekers will be detained until their cases are adjudicated."

“The Department of the Treasury will implement further regulatory changes to restrict non-family travel to Cuba,” national-security adviser John Bolton said Wednesday in a speech to a group of Bay of Pigs veterans on the 58th anniversary of the failed, CIA-directed attempt to overthrow Cuban dictator Fidel Castro.
Bolton also announced that money sent to family members in Cuba would now be limited to $1,000 per person every three months, a change from the Obama administration policy that allowed unlimited remittances.
“In no uncertain terms, the Obama administration’s policies toward Cuba have enabled the Cuban colonization of Venezuela today,” Bolton said. “These new measures will help steer Americans dollars away from the Cuban regime.” Stay Updated with NR Daily

The rules changes comes just after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced earlier Wednesday that American citizens will now be allowed to sue foreign businesses trafficking in property confiscated by the Cuban government during Castro’s 1959 revolution.
“The Cuban regime has for years exported its oppression to Venezuela. Cuban military, intelligence, and security services keep [Venezuelan president Nicolás] Maduro in power. This behavior undermines the stability of countries in the Western Hemisphere, and poses a direct threat to U.S. national security,” Pompeo said."
"Campus Police Chief Put on Leave After Liking Trump, NRA Tweets | National Review",www.nationalreview.com,Katherine Timpf,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/campus-police-chief-trump-nra-tweets-mount-holyoke-college/,"April 17, 2019 6:24 PM (Kai Pfaffenbach/Reuters) What we need is more communication, less cancellation — because the latter makes the former impossible. M ount Holyoke College announced on Wednesday that its newly selected campus police chief would be placed on administrative leave after he received backlash for liking some of Donald Trump’s and the National Rifle Association’s tweets. The Daily Wire’s Kassy Dillon reports that Daniel Hect had been appointed to be the head of Mount Holyoke and Smith College’s shared campus police departments, news which he joyfully shared on Twitter. “I am excited to announce I have accepted the position of Chief of Police at Mount Holyoke and Smith colleges, two of the most prestigious all women’s institutions in the nation,” he tweeted. That’s when the trouble started. Students combed through Hect’s Twitter account and found that he had previously liked tweets from both Trump’s and the NRA’s accounts — such as a tweet from the NRA wishing followers a Merry Christmas and tweets from Trump discussing the government shutdown and the need for the border wall. Seems like that wouldn’t be a big deal, right? Wrong. A MHC student shared screenshots, along with the message that it was “unacceptable for someone in charge of keeping any community safe, let alone a campus as diverse as MHC’s, to be publicly displaying his support for hateful regimes and organizations.” All hell broke loose. According to Dillon, both Hect and the college’s administrations joined forces to try and quell the controversy, even hosting multiple events to try and calm down the students who were upset. One of these events, a forum at Mount Holyoke where community members could ask Hect questions, was full of “tension and tears,” according to the student newspaper . Hect tried to explain that he simply liked the tweets that he thought represented times “[when] Trump did something I thought he did well … in hopes to lead to more good behavior,” but that he was not a Trump supporter overall. He also said he regretted liking any tweets that supported building the wall, calling that “a huge mistake.” After the forum, Hect took it even further, sending an email to the MHC community outlining what else he was going to do in order to try and rectify the situation — including going to “an immersive training program” about “challenging biases.” Apparently, though, none of these efforts were enough. On Wednesday, MHC President Sonya Stephens announced that Hect would be placed on administrative leave. “Over the past few weeks, members of our community have expressed concerns about the ability of Chief Daniel Hect to develop the level of trust required to engage in community policing,” Stephens said in a campus-wide email. Sorry, but this is completely and totally insane. I personally am not someone who supports the wall (I have explained my reasoning for this many times in other columns ), but I still cannot look at these students’ or MHC’s reactions as anything other than absolutely ridiculous and unfair. Why? Because although I myself may not support it, there are several people whom I care about who do, and I know for a fact that these people are not racists. Supporting the wall does not automatically make you a xenophobe or a bigot, it simply makes you someone who has a different opinion from that of other people (including myself) on the question of how to achieve border security. Seeing things like this always makes me sad . . . not just for the person who is under fire, but also for our country as a whole. After all, this doesn’t help anyone, and it does a lot of harm by worsening the already extreme division we’re seeing among different groups of Americans. By placing Hect on administrative leave, MHC validated the students’ fallacious claims that his support of, for example, the Second Amendment somehow made him a bad, hateful person. It doesn’t — it simply makes him a supporter of the Second Amendment, which, by the way, is a part of our Constitution, meaning that it’s pretty damn egregious to punish someone for supporting it. Personally, I am lucky enough to have friends and family who have a whole slew of different beliefs. I am close with religious people and atheists, conservatives and liberals, people who support everything Trump does and people who support none of it — and I know that all of them are great people. Unfortunately, not everyone has this kind of social circle, and the people who don’t could really be missing out on knowing some wonderful souls. It’s a really sad situation, and decisions like MHC’s only perpetuate it. What we need is more communication, less cancellation — because the latter makes the former impossible."
