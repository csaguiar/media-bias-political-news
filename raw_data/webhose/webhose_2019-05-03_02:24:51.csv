New 'Joker' Origin Movie Is Oh So Serious,www.newsweek.com,Dory Jackson,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/joker-origin-movie-trailer-back-story-joaquin-phoenix-1384595,"On 4/3/19 at 11:18 AM EDT Share Culture
Joaquin Phoenix is tapping into dark territory in the first trailer for DC's Joker standalone film.
The Joker trailer debuted at CinemaCon during the Warner Bros. panel on Tuesday. Exclusive footage for upcoming Warner Bros. films like Shazam! , Detective Pikachu , Shaft , Godzilla: King of the Monster , Wonder Woman 1984 and It: Chapter Two was unveiled. Yet the main attraction appeared to be Joker as social media lit up with enthusiasm over the DC villain's origin story.
Directed by Todd Phillips ( The Hangover and Old School ), Joker follows failed stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) as he's driven to insanity and becomes the murderous Joker. Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Bill Camp and Marc Maron also star. The film is expected to bow on October 4.
""My mother always tells me to smile and put on a happy face,"" Phoenix's character Arthur says in film's debut trailer. ""She told me I had a purpose, to bring laughter and joy to the world.""
""Is it just me or is it just getting crazier out there? I used to think my life was a tragedy, but it's a comedy,"" Arthur adds. Put on a happy face. #JokerMovie - in theaters October 4. pic.twitter.com/TxF3Jqxjjr ‚Äî Joker Movie (@jokermovie) April 3, 2019
These lines echo the tagline featured on the film's teaser poster, which reads: ""Put on a happy face."" The poster shows Phoenix in full clown makeup as he looks upward. Phillips described Joker at CinemaCon on Tuesday as an ""origin story about a beloved character with no definitive origin"" and deemed the upcoming feature to be a ""tragedy,"" according to IndieWire .
Jared Leto, Heath Ledger, Jack Nicholson, Cameron Monaghan donned the clown makeup to play the Joker before Phoenix. Ledger, for his part, walked away with an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his efforts in 2009. After filming as the Joker in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Night , Ledger died of an accidental overdose.
Phoenix spoke with Collider in July 2018 about whether he was nervous to tackle the Joker.
""I take a lot of time and consideration when making decisions and what I'm gonna work on always,"" he said. ""So, in some ways, the process, which is obviously reading a script and meeting a filmmaker and then continuing to have meetings and discussions with Todd [Phillips]. I think he's very impressive and he seems to have a very interesting understanding of this world and what he‚Äôs trying to say.""
Joaquin Phoenix is pictured as the Joker in the upcoming origin story, ""Joker."" The film, directed by Todd Phillips, will debut on October 4, 2019. Warner Bros.
Added Phoenix, ""There is something very appealing about that and working with him on this particular project. It feels unique, it is its own world in some ways, and maybe, mostly, it scares the f***ing shit out of me or something. It might as well be the thing that scares you the most."""

The state House Education Committee on Tuesday approved the measure, which would require the State Board of Education to include curricula about the Holocaust and genocide during English and social studies in middle and high school, The Charlotte Observer reported . The bill, which has bipartisan support, will now be sent to the House Rules Committee, the newspaper said. ADVERTISEMENT The bill is named the Gizella Abramson Holocaust Education Act, honoring a Polish native who participated in the resistance movement against the Nazi regime before being sent to multiple concentration camps. She relocated to Raleigh after surviving the war and lived there until her death in 2011, according to the News & Observer. Richard Schwartz, vice chairman of the N.C. Council on the Holocaust, told the committee that some students never learn about the event in public school because it is not part of the required testing. Supporters of the measure say that learning about the mass murder of Jews, Roma and other minority groups at the hands of the Nazis is necessary. ‚ÄúThe survivors are leaving us and along with their departures, we need to make sure that we live up to the mantra of ‚ÄòNever again,‚Äô‚Äù Schwartz said. By teaching about the Holocaust and other atrocities, Schwartz said, students are ‚Äúnot repeating the most horrible times in our history.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doomed to repeat history if we don‚Äôt teach it,‚Äù he added. There are currently 10 states with similar mandates on Holocaust education: California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. A similar bill was proposed in Oregon in February, according to the Salem Statesman Journal . Several other states have regulations that encourage or recommend the teaching of the Holocaust but don't make it required teaching."
BOZELL: When Joe Biden Is Suddenly Creepy,westernfreepress.com,Brent Bozell,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://westernfreepress.com/bozell-when-joe-biden-is-suddenly-creepy/,"0 0
The Democrat-media complex has suddenly decided that Joe Biden has a creepiness problem. Why now? Why not when he was vice president for eight years? Does anyone remember the allegedly fierce White House press corps pelting the press secretary with questions, asking when then-President Obama would tell his understudy to stop putting his hands on women ‚Äî and little girls ‚Äî and putting his face uncomfortably close to theirs?
There have been scads of photos of Biden pawing women, putting his arms around girls, kissing their necks, etc. Conservatives have mocked them for a long time. But liberals always suggested it was just ‚ÄúBiden being Biden.‚Äù
Back in February 2015, the internet went viral with pictures and video footage of Biden at the swearing-in ceremony for Ash Carter as secretary of defense. He stood behind Carter‚Äôs wife, Stephanie Carter, and placed his hands on her shoulders and his nose in her ear, whispering ‚Ä¶ something. The optics were eerie, to say the least. But this was Uncle Joe, and it generated only a light gasp followed by giggles.
NBC noted that The Washington Post called him ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs most powerful close talker.‚Äù ABC actually quoted The Daily Caller for a giggle: The new secretary of defense ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Even Defend His Wife From Joe Biden,‚Äù the Caller headlined. They were also jokey at CNN, as John King mused, ‚ÄúI guess it all depends on your generation and your view of Joe Biden. But at one point, if you watch her eyes, she looks like she wishes she could say, ‚ÄòScotty, beam me up.'‚Äù
This changed last Friday, when Lucy Flores, a 2014 Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor of Nevada, recounted a tale of then-Vice President Biden grabbing her by the shoulders, and leaning in to smell her hair and kiss her on the head. Flores is a backer of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
She testified: ‚ÄúI felt two hands on my shoulders. I froze. ‚ÄòWhy is the vice-president of the United States touching me? ‚Ä¶ He leaned further in and inhaled my hair. I was mortified ‚Ä¶ He proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head. My brain couldn‚Äôt process what was happening. I was embarrassed. I was shocked. I was confused.‚Äù
Biden issued a statement in response: ‚ÄúI have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort. And not once ‚Äî never ‚Äî did I believe I acted inappropriately.‚Äù
So what happened to turn the tables on Uncle Joe, who‚Äôs now five years older, and presumably less menacing? The big change in the interim is the #MeToo movement, of course, where excesses have ruined what would otherwise be a noble demand for a return to chivalry. Biden‚Äôs behavior in no way compares to the rapacious assaults of a Harvey Weinstein. There‚Äôs no evidence of sexual harassment. It doesn‚Äôt matter. To the radicals, perception‚Äôs enough to justify a lynching.
But it‚Äôs not just the #MeToo overreach. Biden is leading in many polls, and that‚Äôs a problem for the radicals who perceive that he‚Äôs not leftist enough. He‚Äôs not perceived to be as leftist as Sanders. He‚Äôs not perceived to be as leftist as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It doesn‚Äôt matter that he favors abortion on demand, or that he declared in 2012 that transgender discrimination is ‚Äúthe civil rights issue of our time.‚Äù It doesn‚Äôt matter that he‚Äôs taken a far-left position on just about everything. He may rate a 99 percent on the left, but it is looking for 103 percent.
The No. 1 ‚Äújournalism‚Äù objective in 2020 is beating President Trump. They are clearly seeking to remove the biggest obstacle to an American socialist revolution. Democrats who don‚Äôt march in lockstep may be yesterday‚Äôs news.

As measles outbreaks spread across the U.S., our new look at how information about vaccine safety and reliability spreads online suggests that the tide may be turning against the anti-vaccination movement. Between Jan. 1 and March 28, 387 people contracted measles in 15 U.S. states. Mumps is also coming back, with 151 infections in just the first two months of 2019. Both of these dangerous and deadly diseases can be prevented by getting the MMR vaccine, which is so safe and effective, and so widely used, that measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000. ... Initially most of the information on Twitter was dominated by people who opposed vaccinations. But in 2017, the scenario appears to have reversed: Anti-vaccine content is now shared only by a minority of users.

Nancy Pelosi's Perv Problem,timesexaminer.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://timesexaminer.com/michelle-malkin/4830-nancy-pelosi-s-perv-problem,"By Michelle Malkin Published: 03 April 2019
If you're a sleazy male Democrat, you can always count on Nancy Pelosi to run interference for you and your pervy proclivities. While she has soaked up plaudits as a champion for women (most recently as the VH1 Trailblazer Honors recipient last month for International Women's Day), what she really deserves is Cheerleader of the Year Award from the Democratic Bad Boys Club.
The latest beneficiary of her soft-glove treatment is former Vice President and potential 2020 Democratic presidential aspirant Joe Biden -- a.k.a. the veep creep. She gently advised him to ""pretend you have a cold"" and joked during a Politico interview that he should emulate her ""straight-arm"" policy of keeping distance from others. Giggle, giggle, blink, blink. Reporters laughed along.
(And these are the same people who mock straight-arrow Vice President Mike Pence of taking extra precaution around women!)
For years, alert conservative women have so relentlessly documented freaky Uncle Joe's penchant for pawing members of the gentler sex that even mainstream media outlets were forced to pay attention. The cringe-tastic headlines and disturbing photo montages, which featured several young girls held hostage between Biden's claws, could no longer be ignored:
""9 Times Joe Biden Whispered in Women's Ears.""
""Joe Biden's Top 10 Creepiest Moments.""
""17 times Joe Biden acted like a total creep.""
""The Audacity of Grope.""
""Joe Biden's woman-touching habit.""
""VP Joe Biden goes #FiftyShadesofGrey during last night's awkward Top Ten List.""
But not until two Democratic women came forward this past week was Biden forced to respond. Nevada Democrat Lucy Flores accused the hair-sniffing 76-year-old Beltway barnacle of making her feel ""uneasy, gross, and confused"" at a campaign event in 2014. Former Connecticut Democratic aide Amy Lappos described how Biden ""rubbed noses with me"" at a private fundraiser in 2009 after grabbing her face with both hands. It was ""absolutely disrespectful of my personal boundaries.""
If these were women accusing Republican men of such behavior, Pelosi would be issuing scathing recriminations, not jokey etiquette tips. But Nan's nonchalance about her fellow Democrats' invasions of personal space is par for her cad-supporting course. I remind my readers of Pelosi's twisted track record:
In 2017, she defiantly stood by accused groper John Conyers calling him an ""icon"" who ""has done a great deal to protect women"" and downplaying his secret sexual harassment settlement with a former female staffer -- one of three former employees alleging sexual abuse.
In 2013, Pelosi refused to call on her old pal and former Democratic mayor Bob Filner of San Diego to resign after multiple women accused him of harassment and assault. One staffer claimed Filner had ordered her to ""work without her panties on."" Others alleged he forcibly kissed them. Another said she had contacted Democratic higher-ups in California about a half-dozen women. ""What goes on in San Diego is up to the people of San Diego. I'm not here to make any judgments,"" Pelosi declared.
In 2011, Pelosi refused to condemn disgraced Rep. Anthony Weiner until his interactions with an underage girl in Delaware were exposed by conservative bloggers and confirmed by police. Only then did Pelosi rush from behind to lead the demands for Weiner's resignation.
In 2010, then New York Democratic Rep. Eric Massa resigned amid a sordid sexual harassment scandal involving young low-paid male staffers he allegedly lured to his Capitol Hill playhouse for ""tickle fights."" Pelosi's office had been informed months before, by a staffer of former Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, of Massa's predatory and harassing behavior with multiple congressional employees. Massa's former deputy chief of staff and legislative director also contacted leading Democrats on the House Ethics Committee. Former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer also knew of Massa's misconduct. But Pelosi said and did nothing until allegations went public. A toothless House Ethics Committee investigation went nowhere.
Also in 2011, seven-term liberal congressman and former Democratic Rep. David Wu of Oregon was exposed by his own staffers, who revolted against their drunk-texting, tiger costume-wearing boss and pressured him to seek psychiatric help. House Democratic leaders, desperate to keep one of their own in office, ignored the pleas. Only after The Oregonian newspaper published allegations by a teenage girl who had complained for months to apathetic Capitol Hill offices of an ""unwanted sexual encounter"" with Wu did Pelosi make a show of calling for a House Ethics Committee investigation -- which went, you guessed it, nowhere.
Yet, just days ago in The New York Times, feminist Tina Brown heaped praise on creep-enabler Pelosi's unique leadership tied to her XX chromosomes -- a woman's ""rich ways of knowing"" that rejects ""traditional male paths of ejaculatory self-elevation."" Reality does not match the rhetoric. Hits: 153"
