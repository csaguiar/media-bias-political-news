Social issues are intrinsically divisive. Want to narrow your church's reach? Focus on social issues.
The Lord Jesus is intrinsically uniting. Want to expand your church's reach? Focus on our lord and savior Jesus Christ.
And, that is 100% of what is wrong with churches today - they in many cases made wrong choices, and as their membership shrinks, they double down on those choices. They don't understand the problem so they can't come up with a solution.
Being involved in politics and voting in elections is a civic duty, not a religious duty, and there are few if any political positions that we can be confident Jesus would support, because government is not important to Jesus. His relationship with government, in the Bible, is putting up with it but not really caring about it. Government is trivial in comparison with what Jesus is all about.
By the way, this applies to churches that generally support conservative causes also."

Important Medicaid Initiatives Would End If Court Overturns ACA,www.therussophile.org,Cherise,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/important-medicaid-initiatives-would-end-if-court-overturns-aca.html/,"Bayer and Monsanto Defend Themselves With Science They Funded
The Justice Department’s recent announcement that it now supports a district court decision that would strike down the entire Affordable Care Act (ACA) puts even more at stake for Medicaid than is commonly understood — in the unlikely event that higher courts uphold the decision. In addition to eliminating the ACA’s Medicaid expansion to low-income adults, the decision would put other Medicaid initiatives at risk and create massive disruption for state Medicaid programs, even in non-expansion states.
To be sure, the ACA’s most significant Medicaid change is its expansion to adults with incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty line, which let millions gain Medicaid coverage for the first time and produced significant benefits for them, their families, and their communities, research shows . If the ACA is struck down, almost 13 million low-income adults would lose their health insurance and, with it, access to treatment for chronic conditions, mental illness, and substance use disorders. It would also cause greater financial instability for safety net providers, such as hospitals, because they would incur greater uncompensated care costs due to the higher number of uninsured adults.
But that’s not all. If the Administration’s position prevails, it would also: Stay in the loop
Never miss the news and analysis you care about. Jeopardize states’ ability to administer their Medicaid programs. The ACA required states to transform how they determine Medicaid eligibility for most enrollees. In addition to changing how income is counted to align with eligibility rules for federal premium tax credits that help low- and moderate-income households afford coverage in the marketplaces, the ACA also required states to conduct eligibility determinations using streamlined processes. States would have to go back to the old — and more complicated — ways of processing and determining Medicaid eligibility. Not only would this harm beneficiaries, it could also be a significant challenge for states given the dramatic technology changes they have made to their eligibility systems to comply with the ACA. It’s unclear how states could determine Medicaid eligibility if they suddenly had to return to pre-ACA rules. Roll back children’s coverage, including for former foster children. The court decision would roll back mandatory Medicaid eligibility for children ages 6 to 18 from 133 percent to 100 percent of the federal poverty level, jeopardizing their access to important Medicaid benefits that help children thrive and succeed into adulthood. That could affect about 1.5 million children in 21 states. States could continue to cover these children in Medicaid as an optional eligibility group, or transition them to the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which provides somewhat narrower coverage and carries higher out-of-pocket costs. Also, if the decision stands, Medicaid eligibility for former foster care youth would revert to only those up to age 18, compared to up to 26 as the ACA now requires . Make it harder for seniors and people with disabilities to get care in their homes and communities. New state options to provide community-based, long-term care to seniors and people with disabilities would end, potentially causing beneficiaries to return to institutions for care. Raise federal and state costs for prescription drugs. The court decision would eliminate the increases in the Medicaid drug rebate percentage that the law authorized. Medicaid managed care costs would rise because Medicaid health plans would no longer be eligible for the rebates. Discourage states from promoting preventive services. States would no longer have incentives to offer preventive services and immunizations at no cost to beneficiaries, including tobacco cessation programs for pregnant women. Jeopardize delivery system reform and other health care quality improvement initiatives. The court decision would effectively shut down the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS) Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation , ending demonstration projects designed to improve the delivery of care to Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries while lowering costs for both states and the federal government. The court decision would also stop states from using health homes — a delivery system reform model that the ACA created for states to help improve health outcomes for beneficiaries with complex medical conditions. End important Medicaid program integrity improvements. The ACA made changes to support state and federal efforts to ensure Medicaid program integrity. If the court decision stands, states would no longer have to screen providers, provide enhanced oversight for new providers and suppliers, or establish compliance programs in accordance with the ACA’s program integrity improvements. Reduce transparency. States would no longer have to solicit public comment on applications for section 1115 Medicaid demonstration projects, or federal “waivers,” and CMS would no longer have to solicit public comment before approving them. In addition, nursing facilities would no longer have to disclose information regarding ownership, accountability requirements, and spending.
Fortunately, the ACA remains the law of the land for now. And the legal reasoning behind the district court decision is weak ; even some of the ACA’s most committed opponents predict it will be overturned. But if it were upheld, as the Administration is urging, the harm to tens of millions of Medicaid enrollees, not just those enrolled through the ACA expansion, would be severe.

Progressives Dismiss DCCC Threats on Primary Challengers,www.therussophile.org,Cherise,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/progressives-dismiss-dccc-threats-on-primary-challengers.html/,"Bayer and Monsanto Defend Themselves With Science They Funded
As tensions escalate in an internal battle between the centrist and left wings of the Democratic Party, a group of progressives is making a move to begin a new left wing party apparatus.
A decision by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee late last month to blacklist vendors that support primary challengers over party incumbents drew a line in the sand against the potential progressive overthrow of the party’s established order.
In response to the new policy, 14 progressive groups Thursday announced the launch of the DCCC Blacklist — a collective of left wing vendors that are bucking the Democratic campaign arm’s directive. Uncompromised, uncompromising news
Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.
“If we want to fight for a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, free college, getting corporate money out of politics, and an end to mass incarceration and deportation then we need to help build a network of alternative campaign infrastructure to support progressive primary challengers from this DCCC sabotage,” said Waleed Shahid, communications director for the progressive group Justice Democrats, one of the groups behind the new vendor list.
As Common Dreams reported Thursday, reconciliation attempts over the vendor policy stalled out this week. Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), the chair of the DCCC, told Politico Wednesday that she had no intention of backing down in her decision.
“We’ve got a policy that the caucus supports, the leadership supports, and it plays the long game,” said Bustos.
That prompted a response from Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
“It is not playing games for the Democratic Party to be inclusive of all its members perspectives,” said Jayapal.
The divisions over the policy appear to have deepened to the point that there’s not likely a way out for both sides. In a statement about the creation of the new vendor list, Indivisible’s María Urbina said that intentional or not, the policy on vendors would serve to keep the party less diverse.
“We reject the DCCC’s attempt to hoard power, which will only serve to keep that talent pool — and Congress itself — disproportionately white and male,” said Urbina.
Thursday’s announcement of a shadow vendor group would seem to imply that the split in the party is reaching beyond rhetoric and into the realm of material reality — a secondary, progressive party apparatus, if created, will pose a credible threat to the party establishment as it is currently constituted.
“As a loyal Democrat and proud progressive, I believe that we don’t just need more Democrats in Congress — we also need better Democrats in Congress,” said Rebecca Katz, founder of New Deal Strategies. “I won’t hesitate to work with progressive candidates challenging incumbent Democrats who are out of touch with their constituents.”“
“If that means getting blacklisted by the DCCC,” Katz added, “then so be it.”
Sean McElwee, a Democratic activist whose company Data for Progress is a founding member of the project, said in a statement that he relished the opportunity to fight against the entrenched interests of the party in the 2019-2020 cycle.
“This cycle, progressives made our intentions clear: we would work to unseat anti-choice, anti-LGBT bigots like Dan Lipinski and Henry Cuellar,” said McElwee. “The DCCC made a choice: to stand with bigots instead of the progressive future of the party. They will fail.”
Marisa Franco, the founder of Latinx advocacy group Mijente, said in a statement that the new list was part of a movement to reshape the party and, hopefully, the country.
“The Democratic Party is at a crossroads and establishment party politics are not going to successfully lead us into the future,” said Franco. “We need new voices and bold ideas from people who represent the diversity of the country and are willing to lead the new American majority that is built by movements for social justice.” This piece was reprinted by Truthout with permission or license.

"Fueled by Union Cash, Tim Ryan Enters 2020 Democratic Primary",www.therussophile.org,Cherise,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/fueled-by-union-cash-tim-ryan-enters-2020-democratic-primary.html/,"Bayer and Monsanto Defend Themselves With Science They Funded
With a rally looming on Saturday in Youngstown, Ohio, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) announced he’s joining the crowded Democratic presidential field. Ryan’s campaign website and corresponding announcement video, released after his appearance on The View on Thursday, hit upon his blue-collar background representing “America’s heartland.” Long an outspoken advocate of union workers, he cited the closing of the Lordstown, Ohio GM factory as a motivating factor for joining the race.
Ryan first gained national attention for his 2016 attempt to replace Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as Democratic House leader. That year Ryan challenged Pelosi for the position of House Minority Leader, a vote he lost 134 to 63. He also tried to block Pelosi from her successful return as Speaker of the House.
A Rust Belt progressive in the vein of Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Ryan supports programs like “Medicare for all,” yet spoke in favor of the simplifying the tax code before voting against the 2017 Republican tax cuts he deemed a “ tax scam .” He has been one of the leading critics of NAFTA and other trade deals which affected his working-class Ohio district. Uncompromised, uncompromising news
Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.
As he enters the presidential race, Ryan will look to tap a crucial fundraising base, one that, lacking the entrance of Brown, may pick him as their favorite — unions.
As a member of the House, organized labor has been one of Ryan’s biggest financial supporters. Labor contributed more than $1.8 million in PAC money over the course of his career, good for almost 38 percent of Ryan’s all-time PAC money.
Of his top 10 all-time donors , unions take up seven spots. The Machinists/Aerospace Workers Union ($90,500) and the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Union ($90,000) are Ryan’s largest all-time labor contributors. His overall biggest all-time contributor is First Energy Corp , an electric utility company based in Ohio, which between its PAC and employees contributed $93,038.
While labor is a crucial base for Ryan, the largest sole industry that supports him is lawyers/law firms . These white-collar workers have contributed $555,671 to Ryan’s campaign, making them his top all-time industry . The next four industries are all various union categories.
Overall, Ryan’s fundraising lags behind some of the powerhouses already in the primary race. Since he represents a fairly safe Democratic district, Ryan’s fundraising has trailed the average House member’s totals in every election cycle back to 2002. In the 2018 cycle, the average House member pulled in around $2.2 million, while Ryan collected just under $1.6 million.
Ryan also collects little from small donors, an increasingly important Democratic fundraising metric and one that is the focus of much attention in the early months of the 2020 race. In the 2018 cycle, just 8.3 percent ($132,970) of Ryan’s funding came from contributions under $200. He relied heavily on large individual contributions and PAC money which is typical for members from safe districts.
Ryan appears to have a wide donor base already set up, something that would benefit a presidential run. A majority of the money he raised came from out-of-state in 2018. In fact, he received contributions from every state but North and South Dakota, a strong national showing for a lower-profile member.
Like many members of Congress looking to make an impact, Ryan operates a leadership PAC, Penguin PAC . Though it has been around since 2006, the 2018 cycle was by far the best for its fundraising. It raised around $260,000 and doled out $60,950 to a variety of House members and federal candidates. The PAC’s biggest recipient for a House seat was Pete D’Alessandro, a former Sanders advisor who lost his bid in Iowa, who got $5,000. Former Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) was the only Senate member who received funds, with $6,500.
The biggest contributor to the PAC with $20,000 were affiliates of Simon Property Group , a real estate company which owns numerous shopping malls. Unions were also big donors to the leadership PAC.
While contributions were the PAC’s biggest expenditure, it also spent heavily on fundraising, strategy and research, which is typical for a candidate with plans to seek higher office.
Additionally, Ryan launched the Tim Ryan Victory Fund joint fundraising committee. In the recent midterms, its first campaign cycle, the fund raised $21,350. Joint fundraising committees (JFC) are often created to raise for more than one candidate or party committees, however Ryan’s JFC appeared to only raise money for him. Most of the committee’s funds were transferred to Ryan’s campaign committee ($13,456) and his leadership PAC ($7,000). This piece was reprinted by Truthout with permission or license.

A wrongful death case was filed against Boeing on the same day that a preliminary investigation into last month’s Ethiopian Airlines crash revealed damning details about the aircraft manufacturer and raised new questions about whether it gave pilots proper instructions for navigating new software. The findings were released Thursday in Ethiopia, based on the analysis of a team of 18 investigators, less than a month after the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash killed all 157 people on board. The report found similarities in the technical issues experienced by pilots on both the Ethiopian Airlines flight and October’s Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610, which also crashed just minutes after takeoff, killing all 189 people on board. Both flights were on a Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft. On Thursday, the first American lawsuit related to the devastating crash was filed against Boeing on behalf of the family of 24-year-old Samya Stumo, who died on the flight. Samya was the grandniece of Ralph Nader, the longtime consumer advocate, corporate critic and former presidential candidate.

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, as we look at the wrongful death case against Boeing, after a preliminary investigation into last month’s Ethiopian Airlines crash has revealed damning details about the aircraft manufacturer and raised new questions about whether it gave pilots proper instructions for navigating new software. These findings were released Thursday in Ethiopia based on the analysis of a team of 18 investigators. They come less than a month after the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash, which killed all 157 people on board. The report found similarities in the technical issues experienced by pilots on both the Ethiopian Airlines flight and October’s Indonesian Lion Air Flight 610, which also crashed just minutes after takeoff, killing all 189 people on board. Both flights were on a Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft. Under enormous public pressure, the FAA grounded 737 MAX aircraft while Boeing works on fixes to the plane’s software
On Thursday, the first American wrongful death lawsuit was filed relating to the Ethiopian Airlines crash. It was filed against Boeing on behalf of the family of 24-year-old Samya Stumo, who died on the flight. Samya was the grandniece of Ralph Nader.
Well, Ralph Nader joins us now on the telephone, longtime consumer advocate, corporate critic, former presidential candidate, author of many books, including Collision Course: The Truth About Airline Safety . Ralph Nader wrote an open letter to Boeing titled “Passengers First, Ground the 737 MAX 8 Now!”
Ralph, again, our condolences to you and your whole family, a number of members of which we just heard — Samya’s mother and father and brother Adnaan. Can you talk about the significance of this first American wrongful death lawsuit and what is being alleged?
RALPH NADER : Well, out of Samya’s death, and all the other people on that plane, have got to come big changes. People watching this program or listening to you, Amy, they think that this is going to happen to someone else. If we don’t stop this 737 MAX from ever flying again — there’s no fix for engineered instability and the prone-to-stall problem of the 737 MAX — 5,000 of these planes will be sold all over the country and all over the world. So, there will be millions of passengers in these planes, with a plane that should not be allowed to fly.
And this lawsuit, filed yesterday under the law of torts, is designed to pursue the truth, to get all the information out of Boeing, out of the FAA . There will be a lawsuit probably filed against the FAA under the Federal Tort Claims Act, so that the whole process is reformed, so that the FAA is not a wholesale delegator, pushed by members of Congress and the White House year after year to delegate the inspection, to delegate the self-regulation to Boeing, instead of regulating it. And that has to be completely changed.
There’s a lot of culpability here. Boeing’s homicide, Boeing’s criminal negligence is now well documented. And there will be more whistleblowers and more information coming out from all quarters. But the Congress bears a very serious responsibility. It’s been stopping aviation safety reform. It’s been supporting White House cuts in the budget of the FAA . It’s been supporting the repression of engineering integrity in the FAA , not to mention Boeing. Three hundred and thirty members of Congress take campaign contributions from Boeing. And even worse, just about every member of Congress takes freebies from the airlines, all kinds of upgrades and fee waivers that are not accorded other ordinary mortals.
So, out of these tragedies in Indonesia and Ethiopia may come a restructuring of aviation safety. No aircraft manufacturer, not to mention Boeing, should ever be given two free disasters, that are preventable by established, long-known engineering safety practices. And that’s what we’re all pursuing to try to make something come out of these tragedies that will save the lives of people in the future.
AMY GOODMAN : Ralph Nader, I want you to respond to Boeing’s statement in response to the preliminary investigation report of the Ethiopian Airlines crash. And, you know, it also came after the first wrongful death lawsuit, your family’s lawsuit, against Boeing. This is the CEO Dennis Muilenburg, releasing this video yesterday along with the company’s statement.
DENNIS MUILENBURG : We at Boeing are sorry for the lives lost in the recent 737 MAX accidents. …
It’s apparent that, in both flights, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, known as MCAS , activated in response to erroneous angle-of-attack information. The history of our industry shows most accidents are caused by a chain of events. This again is the case here. And we know we can break one of those chain links in these two accidents. As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high-workload environment. It’s our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it, and we know how to do it.
From the days immediately following the Lion Air accident, we’ve had teams of our top engineers and technical experts working tirelessly, in collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration and our customers, to finalize and implement a software update that will ensure accidents like that of Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 never happen again.
AMY GOODMAN : So, that is Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg in a video released yesterday, after the lawsuit and after the preliminary findings. Ralph Nader, your response?
RALPH NADER : Well, it’s pretty close to admission of fault. I don’t see how they’re going to defend the civil lawsuits. They’re facing a criminal probe from the Justice Department and the FBI , with an active grand jury. And as Flyers Rights director Paul Hudson, who you’ll be hearing from, has pointed out again and again, deregulation means death. It means the repudiation of a structure of aviation safety that people expected to be able to trust. So this is an amazing early admission by the manufacturer, before even the first deposition is ordered.
AMY GOODMAN : And, Ralph, we are about to go to Paul Hudson, but before we go, your family has filed suit against Boeing and a complaint against the FAA . The significance of Boeing and the FAA ?
RALPH NADER : Well, they’re both at fault. And as Paul Hudson will point out, there has to be legislation in Congress. Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut is about to put a bill in to re-empower and bring back the delegation, to Boeing, back into the FAA and make it a strong regulator. He’s also going to propose criminal penalties. Believe it or not, the FAA statute doesn’t have criminal penalties for willful and knowing violation. And I think we’ll see a lot of change.
But don’t take anything for granted. Unless flyers organize, unless they join groups like FlyersRights.org , a lot of these probes, congressional investigations, Department of Transportation investigations, Justice Department investigations can be pulled back due to political pressure by Boeing and its allies in Washington. What cannot be pulled back are the civil lawsuits that will increasingly be filed against Boeing and other defendants.
AMY GOODMAN : We are bringing in Paul Hudson into this conversation, president of Flyers Rights, the largest nonprofit airline passenger rights organization in the U.S., operating a hotline for passengers at 877-FLYERS6, publishes a weekly newsletter, maintains a staff office in D.C. for advocacy for airline passengers’ rights, also served on the FAA’s Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee since 1993.
Paul, talk about the significance of what has taken place. And I’d like to have you start by responding, once again, to Dennis Muilenburg, but this is a different statement. It was a phone call news conference he had last year on the telephone — in 2017. In it, he was praising the FAA under the Trump administration for its efforts to deregulate and, quote, “streamline” the certification process. He even specifically mentions the MAX aircraft. He made the comments on a conference call with investors and the media.
DENNIS MUILENBURG : Yes. Just [to comment on that, one], the overall focus on deregulation and simplifying processes is one that we’ve been a strong proponent for. And the administration has been very engaged, across government agencies and with industry, to find ideas and ways and opportunities to simplify and streamline. Things like FAA certification processes is one place that we’re seeing some solid progress. That’s helping us more efficiently work through certification on some of our new model aircraft, such as the MAX , as it’s going through flight test and entering into service. So we’re already seeing some benefits there of some of the work that’s being done with the FAA .
AMY GOODMAN : “We’re already seeing benefits there,” this streamlining with the FAA . If you can talk, Paul Hudson, about what Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg is admitting as he praises the FAA under the Trump administration in 2017?
PAUL HUDSON : Well, you know, Amy, there’s an old expression in law: “Beware of what you ask for. You may get it.” Boeing asked for it. They got it. Essentially, full delegation and self-regulation.
We went from the FAA , basically, not just being the oversight, but being the certifier. We now have a situation — not only with the 737, but it was pretty similar to that previously with the 787 Dreamliner in 2013, that was grounded with battery fires. You have a situation where the manufacturer designs the systems; the manufacturer’s employees test the systems; the manufacturer’s employees, chosen by the manufacturer, in this case Boeing, certifies the system; and the FAA is basically a bystander.
So, while safety was never deregulated with economics in the Airline Deregulation Act of ’78, it’s become really a paper thing now, with the FAA not only relying on the manufacturer for pretty much everything, but not having its own people that are competent, and not consulting with outside experts that are needed to really vet these systems.
AMY GOODMAN : Ralph Nader, even when the FAA was announcing they were grounding the MAX planes, under enormous popular pressure, President Trump continued to praise Muilenburg and has talked about Boeing some 200 times in the last few years in public, praising them, and has not criticized them at all. Paul Hudson, what should Trump be doing right now?
PAUL HUDSON : Well, he should be meeting with the people that represent airline passengers and the victims of these air crashes, number one. My daughter died in Pan Am 103. And after that, President Bush met with families. And that put in motion things that eventually greatly improved the security for aviation. If the president can take phone calls from the Boeing CEO , if he can meet over and over again with airline executives, he can certainly do, after this disaster — which, by the way, not only affects Boeing and the families, it affects, really, the United States commercial aviation industry.
Unless trust is restored, and restored quickly, people are not going to want to fly on those planes. We have lots of people telling us, “How do I avoid that bad plane?” Even if they put it back on service, people are not going to trust the FAA . They’re not going to trust Boeing anymore. They need to have outside experts. And it may be that the planes need to be recalled, that are in service. It may be that the whole thing needs to be scrapped. But whatever is done, it has to be done quickly, and it has to be done transparently.
AMY GOODMAN : We’re going to end with Ralph Nader, Samya Stumo’s great-uncle. Ralph, you are famous, over the decades, for calling for recalls of cars. Are you demanding the same thing right now, but, in this case, planes?
RALPH NADER : Yes, they should recall the 300-plus planes that they’ve sold to these airlines, domestic and foreign. They should never allow that plane to fly again. They should simply sell the 737 with improved amenities, discount the planes to compete with Airbus. And people should know that the Airbus engineers in the 320neo were allowed to do their job. And in Boeing, they were not allowed to do their job. And that’s all going to come out.
But we’ve got to escalate corporate crime and violence to the level that we do, under our law, to individuals. You know, members of Congress returned contributions from Harvey Weinstein for his assault on women. And now they should return all their contributions from Boeing for the corporate homicide of Boeing in preventable deaths of 346 people from Indonesia to Ethiopia. We have to begin recognizing that deaths and injuries and disease and property damage are massively greater from preventable corporate crime, fraud and violence than the street crime version, bad as that is.
And I hope some of that will come out of this horrible tragedy that involved my wonderful grandniece Samya Stumo, leadership, compassion, intellectual rigor written all over her. She would have saved a lot of lives in her 50 years of work in Africa and South America. And Boeing snuffed it out, along with 345 other innocent people.
AMY GOODMAN : Ralph Nader, I want to thank you so much. And again, our condolences on the death of your niece. Ralph Nader, longtime consumer advocate, corporate critic, former presidential candidate. His grandniece Samya Stumo died in Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. And, Paul Hudson, thanks so much for joining us, president of Flyers Rights.

As President Donald Trump pushes for more defense spending from NATO countries, we speak with Joe Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, about how Trump’s foreign policy benefits weapons manufacturers. During an Oval Office meeting Tuesday with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, President Trump demanded Germany and other NATO countries increase their military spending from 2 to 4% of GDP . But Cirincione says NATO’s biggest problem is not insufficient funding. “The biggest problem NATO faces is the president of the United States, who keeps putting in doubt U.S. commitment to the alliance, who keeps putting in doubt whether the U.S. will come to the aid of NATO allies if they’re attacked,” he says. Cirincione also calls national security adviser John Bolton a “serial arms control killer.” Never miss another story

AMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, as we turn to look at how the Trump administration is pushing NATO countries to increase military spending, often to the benefit of weapons manufacturers like Boeing. During an Oval Office meeting Tuesday with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, President Trump falsely claimed his father was born in Germany — Trump, again, falsely claimed his own father was born in Germany — he was born in the Bronx — and once again demanded Germany and other NATO countries increase their military spending from 2 to 4% of GDP .
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : We have worked together on getting some of our allies to pay their fair share. It’s called burden sharing. And as you know, when I came, it wasn’t so good, and now it’s — they’re catching up. We have seven of the 28 countries are currently current, and the rest are trying to catch up, and they will catch up. And some of them have no problems, because they haven’t been paying and they’re very rich. But we’re looking at the 2% of GDP level. And at some point, I think it’s going to have to go higher than that. I think probably it should be higher.
AMY GOODMAN : The next day, NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg addressed a joint session of Congress in an event marking the 70th anniversary of NATO .
SECRETARY GENERAL JENS STOLTENBERG : NATO allies must spend more on defense. This has been the clear message from President Trump. And this message is having a real impact. Of the years of reducing defense budgets, all allies have stopped the cuts, and all allies have increased their defense spending.
AMY GOODMAN : The push for military spending comes as Acting Pentagon Chief Patrick Shanahan is under investigation for improperly advocating on behalf of Boeing, where he worked for 30 years. Meanwhile, the Pentagon blocked delivery of F-35 fighter jets to NATO member country Turkey, because it refused to back down on buying an anti-aircraft system from Russia. The U.S. Air Force has suspended deliveries of Boeing’s KC-46 Pegasus tanker over safety concerns.
For more, we’re joined in Washington, D.C., by Joe Cirincione. He is president of Ploughshares Fund, a global security foundation.
Welcome to Democracy Now! , Joe.
JOE CIRINCIONE : Thank you, Amy.
AMY GOODMAN : As you can see, we’ve spent the hour talking about Boeing — in one case, the first American wrongful death lawsuit against Boeing and the FAA . And now we’re looking at a larger picture around the U.S. relationship with NATO and what Trump is trying to do with NATO countries, under the guise of increasing national security, which is pushing them to buy not only more weapons, but more U.S. weapons. Can you comment on this? And do you think that’s the motivation for President Trump’s criticism of NATO ?
JOE CIRINCIONE : The debate on NATO is dominated by this obsession over the 2% solution, that somehow what we need to do is get all the European countries to spend 2% of their economic output on defense, as if this is going to — as if this is needed or is going to fix our problems. But this is out of touch with reality. The European countries, by themselves, spend about $240 billion every year on military weapons and forces. They outspend Russia four to one. Russia spends about $66 billion each year. So they are spending plenty on defense.
This idea that we have to get them to spend more weakens NATO , not strengthens it, because it diverts resources from things like, for example, settlement of migrations — of migrants, one of the issues that has been roiling Europe over the last few years, or the basic health and welfare and education of their population, another economic dislocation issue that does more to undermine NATO than any military threat.
And why is this happening, you ask? Well, I think it is a push from the defense contractors. Boeing is one of the top five defense contractors in the United Staes, in the world, and it benefits from increases in defense spending. So we should be questioning whether we need to spend more money at all on this, and what we’re spending. Do we have shortfalls in NATO ? Yes, we do. But we can fix those by spending more wisely, not by spending more.
AMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about this in terms of nuclear weapons?
JOE CIRINCIONE : Yes. The United States still keeps about 150 hydrogen bombs stationed in Europe. These are vestiges of the Cold War. We used to have thousands. The Republican administration under George W. Bush actually pulled out hundreds, but the Obama administration was afraid to pull out the remaining 150.
So, what are we doing with those weapons? Well, it turns out we’re spending $10 billion to modernize these weapons, to put new tail kits on them, make them more accurate for use. Who is benefiting from that contract? Boeing. Boeing makes the tail kits for these B-61s. So we’re giving Boeing billions of dollars to modernize an obsolete weapon that we will never use, that we do not need.
This is the kind of wasteful spending that’s going on in NATO , and that the focus is distorting what we really need to do to build up a NATO , to solidify the alliance. It’s not about money. The biggest problem NATO faces is the president of the United States, who keeps putting in doubt U.S. commitment to the alliance, who keeps putting in doubt whether the U.S. will come to the aid of NATO allies if they’re attacked. This is the biggest issue, not how much we spend.
AMY GOODMAN : Talk about President Trump continually talking about NATO members paying their fair share.
JOE CIRINCIONE : Yeah. Well, this is a bipartisan obsession, this 2% solution. I think the president is using this as a stick to hit the NATO allies. President Trump is the first president since World War II who does not see himself as a leader of the Western alliance, does not see himself as a leader of NATO . He looks at our European allies as economic rivals. So he wants to use this issue to hit them over the head, because, in essence, and this is his — if there’s such a thing as a Trump policy or Trump doctrine, it’s this. He doesn’t believe in alliances. He doesn’t want the European countries to be united. He would prefer the United States deal with each country individually, because he believes we have a greater advantage.
So, the fear in NATO — and this is what the secretary general was trying to assuage in his visit here this week — is not that the Europeans aren’t spending enough on defense. It’s that the U.S. is pulling back, that the U.S., who founded NATO , is reneging on its commitments. And President Trump, every day, every time he talks about NATO , does something to increase those fears.
AMY GOODMAN : The role of John Bolton, Joe Cirincione?
JOE CIRINCIONE : John Bolton is a serial arms control killer. He has never believed in arms control, negotiated solutions to weapons. So he’s the hidden hand behind President Trump’s decision to pull out of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, the treaty that Ronald Reagan negotiated to pull out, to get rid of nuclear weapons that we were stationing in Europe, what they called intermediate-range nuclear weapons. He never liked the treaty, when it was negotiated. He’s in favor of more weapons, not less. And because we’re killing the treaty, the U.S. — guess what — is now set to build a new ground-launched cruise missile that could be placed in Europe. The nuclear arms race is back in Europe, largely because of John Bolton.
AMY GOODMAN : Joe Cirincione, we’re going to ask you to stay with us. We’re going to do a web exclusive with you at democracynow.org.

"Economy Adds 196,000 Jobs in March Amid Signs of Slowing Wage Growth",www.therussophile.org,Cherise,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/economy-adds-196000-jobs-in-march-amid-signs-of-slowing-wage-growth.html/,"Bayer and Monsanto Defend Themselves With Science They Funded Employment-to-population ratio for men between 25 to 34 jumps 0.8 percentage points to a new high for recovery.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the economy added 196,000 jobs in March, a sharp bounce back from the 20,000 originally reported for February. This figure was revised up to 33,000, which brought the average over the last three months to 180,000. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.8 percent.
While the job growth figure for March is healthy, there is some evidence that wage growth might actually be slowing in spite of the relatively tight labor market. Wage growth over the last 12 months was just 3.2 percent, down from 3.4 percent in February. The annualized growth rate for the last three months (January, February, March) compared with the prior three months (October, November, December) was just under 3.0 percent. This evidence of slowing is limited, but there certainly is no basis in this report for believing that a tight labor market is creating inflationary pressures in the economy.
There are other signs of weakening in the labor market. The percentage of unemployment due to voluntary quits fell to 12.5 percent. By comparison, in 2000, when the unemployment rate averaged 4.0 percent, the percentage due to voluntary quits averaged 13.7 percent. There was also a modest uptick in the duration measures of unemployment with both the average and median durations rising, as well as the share of long-term unemployed. This continues rises seen in February. The stories you care about, right at your fingertips
Get Truthout’s daily edition delivered to your inbox.
By demographic group, there was a drop in the employment-to-population ratio (EPOP) for black workers by 0.3 percentage points to 57.9 percent, the lowest since last April. Both the overall and prime-age (ages 25 to 54) EPOPs edged down by 0.1 percentage point. However, the EPOP for prime-age men rose by 0.2 percentage points to 86.7 percent, a new high for the recovery, 0.5 percentage points above its year-ago level. This increase was driven by a 0.8 percentage point jump in the EPOP for men between the ages of 25 to 34 to 86.5 percent, 1.0 percentage point above the year-ago level.
While the number of people working part-time for economic reasons rose slightly from the recovery low hit in February, it is down by almost 10 percent from its year-ago level. The number of people working part-time voluntarily is again down from year-ago levels, possibly indicating greater difficulty in getting health care insurance outside of employment.
On the establishment side, health care was the largest contributor to job growth, adding 49,100 jobs. Growth in the sector has accelerated sharply in recent months, averaging 42,500 since November, compared with an average of just 27,100 in the year from November 2017 to November 2018. Professional and technical services added 34,100 jobs, somewhat faster than its average 25,900 over the last year. Restaurants added 27,300 jobs, in line with its average 25,700 jobs over the last year.
Construction added 16,000 jobs, which did not fully offset the 25,000 drop reported in February. However, a sharp jump of 56,000 reported in January means the three-month average is still 15,700. Manufacturing lost 6,000 jobs after adding just 1,000 in February. This is the first decline since July of 2017. The index of aggregate hours in manufacturing is 0.3 percent below the December level, suggesting some real weakening in the sector.
Retail lost 11,700 jobs in March after losing 20,200 jobs in February. Employment is now 35,900 (0.2 percent) below year-ago levels. The declines were spread across categories with even nonstore retailers (largely Internet) losing jobs.
Trucking lost 1,200 jobs in March after adding just 100 in February. The temporary help sector lost 5,400 jobs. With a big decline also reported in January, it has lost an average of 9,500 jobs over the last three months. This sector is not as much an indicator of future job growth as in the past, but the weakness in this sector and trucking (fewer goods being shipped) is worth noting.
This should be seen as a mostly positive report with some significant warning signs. The strong job growth shows that the weak February figure was an anomaly. The increases in employment rates for prime-age men, and especially among younger men, indicate that we have not yet hit any limits on labor force expansion.
The warning signs include the slight slowing in wage growth, the drop in the share of unemployment due to quits, and the increasing duration of unemployment spells. However, none of these suggest that the recovery is likely to end any time soon. This piece was reprinted by Truthout with permission or license.

Iranian authorities have ordered mass evacuations in several cities amid fears of more flooding as a result of rising water levels in rivers and major dams.
People in at least six cities and over 100 villages in the southwestern province of Khuzestan were told on early Saturday to leave their houses and stay in safe areas as officials prepared to fully open the floodgates at the Karkheh Dam.
With a reservoir capacity of 5.9 billion cubic meters, the vast embankment dam has been taking in large amounts of floodwater over the past weeks and is currently operating near full capacity.
Other major dams in the province like Dez and Karun were also letting off increasing amounts of water to prepare for heavy torrents that officials said would soon submerge large parts of the province before heading to the main rivers and eventually reaching the dams.
Dozens of small towns and villages along rivers Karun, Dez and Karkheh had already been evacuated as a precaution.
Iran’s Meteorological Organization (IRMO) has predicted heavy rains for Khuzestan in the coming days.
Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said Friday that flood threatened nearly 400,000 people in the province, which has a population of about 5 million.
Fazli said he had ordered officials in five neighboring provinces to help with emergency relief operations in Khuzestan.
First Vice President Es’haaq Jahangiri said Friday that he had discussed the situation with Khuzestan’s governor and rescue efforts were underway.
Kiomars Hajizadeh, head of Khuzestan’s crisis response committee, said over 25,000 people had been resettled in more than 40 safety centers.
Evacuations also continued in the western province of Lorestan, which has experienced widespread damage due to severe flooding.
Abdolhashem Hassannia, head of Iran’s Road Maintenance and Transportation Organization (RMTO), told Mehr News that a large number of roads in Lorestan and Khuzestan had been reopened but too many roads, mostly in rural areas, remained flooded.
According to the official, the RTMO was working with the Army to erect military tactical bridges above overflowing rivers in Lorestan to facilitate access to flooded areas.
The mountainous terrain in the region has slowed down rescue operations to some degree.
Armed forces to continue relief efforts
Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Major General Mohammad Baqeri said that the country’s armed forces – the Army and the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) were continuing their rescue operations in flood-hit areas.
Speaking to reporters in Lorestan on Saturday, Baqeri said he had traveled to the region to oversee ongoing rescue efforts by the Army, the IRGC and the police and have a better understanding of the situation.
Heavy floods have affected at least 23 of the country’s 31 provinces since heavy downpours began on March 19.
Major floods have been reported in the provinces of Golestan, Mazandaran, Gilan, Kordestan, Ilam, Lorestan, Fars, Northern Khorasan, Kermanshah, Khuzestan, Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad as well as Sistan and Baluchestan.
According to the Iranian Red Crescent Society (IRCS), nearly 2,000 rescue workers – including military servicemen and voluntary groups – had carried out over 400 sorties in Lorestan, using at least 10 choppers, delivering over 200 tons of aid to flood-hit areas of Lorestan.
Around 58,000 people also received aid and emergency services in Mazandaran and Golestan provinces, which have been struggling with flooding since March 18.
In Ilam, another province hard hit by flood, the IRCS coordinated more than 40 sorties and helped delivered nearly 12 tons of humanitarian aid.
Estimates by government agencies suggest that the floods have taken the lives of at least 67 people and destroyed over 25,000 homes around the country.
Most damages have been reported in Lorestan, which is also said to have suffered the second highest number of casualties after the Fars Province.
Police have asked people to avoid traveling to flooded cities in western and southwestern parts of the country.

Iraqi PM in Iran to cement ties in blow to US sanctions,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/iraqi-pm-in-iran-to-cement-ties-in-blow-to-us-sanctions.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi is in Iran for his first official visit since he took office, in a further sign that Baghdad is serious about maintaining close ties with Tehran despite US pressures.
It comes right on the heels of President Hassan Rouhani’s trip to Baghdad last month and the two neighbors’ pledge to boost the already flowering trade to $20 billion in two years from $12 billion today.
Along with ministers of commerce, foreign affairs, planning, transportation, health and energy, a number of Iraqi parliamentarians as well as 30 representatives of the private sector are accompanying the Iraqi premier.
Abdul-Mahdi was accorded a warm welcome by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at Sa’dabad cultural and historical complex in Tehran on Saturday.
Rouhani’s landmark visit to Iraq marked the signing of several memorandums of understanding for expansion of cooperation in key sectors and meeting with top political and religious figures.
With a 1,400-kilometer-long joint border, Iraq has turned into a strategic ally and an important trade partner for Iran in recent years.
Iraq’s huge energy reserves and a large, diverse market bestow it a special place in the economic equations of the region.
Until two years ago, Iran was Iraq’s third biggest trade partner after Turkey and China, but it vaulted to the top place last year with a record $9 billion worth of exports.
Iraq relies on Iranian gas imports to generate as much as 45 percent of its 14,000 megawatts of electricity consumed daily in addition to another 1,000 megawatts imported directly from Iran.
For their run-of-the-mill sustenance, Iraqis also depend on Iran for everything from food to machinery, fruits and vegetables.
A remarkable feature of this close relationship is that much of the blossoming has occurred either in the run-up or after the reimposition of draconian US sanctions on Iran.
Iraq is pushing back on US pressures in what has become a major point of conflict between Washington and Baghdad, the New York Times reported in February.
Last month, the Trump administration said it was extending a 90-day waiver for the second time to let Iraq continue energy imports from Iran.
Observers say the increasingly powerful and mutually beneficial relations between Iran and Iraq will make it all but impossible for the White House to keep the two neighbors apart.

Iraq’s President Barham Salih has stressed that his country would not be part of a regime of unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran.
“There is no doubt that we will be affected by these sanctions, but it is certain that we will not be part of them,” he said last month.
Prime Minister Abdul-Mahdi’s visit to Iran also comes after a Saudi delegation traveled to Baghdad to reopen the kingdom’s consulate in Iraq.
Saudi Minister of Trade Majid bin Abdullah al-Qasabi led a business delegation to Iraq as part of efforts to enhance ties between the two nations.
Riyadh has viewed Iraq’s proximity to Iran with enmity. This is while Iraqi leaders have repeatedly praised Iran’s role in helping the Arab country confront the Takfiri menace.
Iraqi officials have frequently accused Saudi Arabia of aiding and abetting the Daesh terrorist group, which was largely defeated in Iraq and Syria in late 2017.

Iran will blacklist US army if Washington bans IRGC: MP,www.therussophile.org,Michael Sullivan,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/iran-will-blacklist-us-army-if-washington-bans-irgc-mp.html/,"This post was originally published on this site

A senior Iranian lawmaker says Tehran will blacklist the US military – like the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group – if Washington label Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) as a “terror organization”.
“If the IRGC is placed on the US’s list of terrorist groups, we will put the country’s military personnel on the terrorist blacklist alongside Daesh,” Chairman of the Iranian Parliament’s Committee on National Security and Foreign Policy Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh tweeted on Saturday.
The warning came after three American officials told Reuters that the US is expected to designate the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization.
The decision, the officials said, will be announced by the US State Department, perhaps as early as Monday.
The US has already blacklisted dozens of entities and individuals affiliated with the IRGC, but not the group as a whole.
The IRGC was formed following an order from Ayatollah Khomeini, the late founder of the Islamic Republic shortly after 1979 Revolution in a bid to protect the revolution and battle insecurity in the country.
The group, which is a branch of Iran’s Armed Forces, played a major role in defending the country during the 1980-1988 imposed war with Iraq.
Over the past four decades, it has successfully foiled the conspiracies hatched by the enemy against the Islamic Republic.
The IRGC, which has roughly 125,000 military personnel and enjoys growing public support, is active in construction, infrastructure and relief projects.

Romania Introduces a Bill to Repatriate its Gold Reserves,www.therussophile.org,The European Union Times,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/romania-introduces-a-bill-to-repatriate-its-gold-reserves.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
The European Union Times
Home » Economy , Europe » Romania Introduces a Bill to Repatriate its Gold Reserves
The trend is accelerating, just as I predicted it would.
Countries all over the globe are growing anxious, as the geopolitical atmosphere of the world continues to heat up, threatening to hit a boiling point.
Central bankers and government officials who see the world through an unfiltered, non-rose-tinted lens are well aware of this, and are beginning to take the necessary actions required to protect themselves and their homelands.
China, Russia, India, Poland and Turkey are just a few of the countries that have made no secret of their plans for long-term accumulation of precious metals, in a hope to diversify their national reserves out of the U.S. dollar and into hard money.
I, along with many others in the precious metals community, believe that the reason for this is that they can see the writing on the wall and are well aware of what is coming down the road.
They know that the U.S. dollar will not be the reserve currency of the world forever, and from their actions, I believe they know that precious metals will once again take center stage, playing a vital role in the next successor to the throne.
Joining the growing ranks of concerned countries is Romania, a holder of 103.7 tonnes of gold. Or rather, a country that believes they hold 103.7 tons of gold.
As I have stated numerous times, if you don’t hold it, you don’t truly own it.
Physical possession of a significant portion of your precious metals is vital in these times of growing unrest.
Waking up to this reality, Chamber of Deputies President Liviu Dragnea and Senator Serban Nicolae of Romania have proposed a bill to force the National Bank to repatriate 95 percent of Romania’s gold reserves, which are largely held abroad.
Before you dismiss this as a nothing-burger, take note that this bill is not being introduced by some “small fry” government official. Quite the opposite. Liviu Dragnea is a high-ranking member of the Romanian government.
As per Wikipedia ;
“The President of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania is the deputy elected to preside over the meetings in the lower chamber of the Parliament of Romania. The President is also the President of the Standing Bureau of the Chamber of Deputies , and the second in the presidential line of succession, after the President of the Senate.”
What this means is that this bill has legs. It will likely move forward, forcing the holders of the Romanian gold reserves to come up with the precious metals—or what is more likely, stonewall them with excuses for the next few years, as they attempt to pool together the metals they rehypothecated to infinity.
Currently, the Treasury of the National Bank of England holds 61 tons of Romanian gold, the Bank of International Settlements in Basel Switzerland holds 5 tons and the other 40 tons are held at the Bank of Romania in Bucharest.
Sadly for the Bank of Romania and the people of the country itself, they have an uphill battle if past results are any indication of what is to come next.
Germany and other countries that have attempted to repatriate their gold have only been successful through great effort and time, highlighting the fact that the gold that is supposed to be in safe holding simply isn’t.
The fact is, the majority of gold in trust is not there. It is gone, sold into the open market.
The active suppression of gold over the past decade-plus has required a tremendous amount of physical ammunition, and London has been one of the biggest contributors in this suppression.
The question is, who is next? Because trust me, Romania won’t be the last.
The flight towards honest money continues."
Greece: 200 migrants block Athens station for asylum,www.therussophile.org,fwmstaff,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/greece-200-migrants-block-athens-station-for-asylum.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Migrants have denounced the “very slow” asylum procedure and demand the opening of the Greek-Macedonian border. The riots were started by malicious rumours of a caravan heading for Northern Europe. Athens
Migrants in Greece are protesting for their “rights”. As reported by French daily Le Figaro , some 200 asylum seekers invaded the railway station in Athens on Friday, April 5, disrupting rail traffic between the Greek capital and the city of Thessaloniki.
More than 600 migrants massed at the station on Thursday night, trying to board trains to the north. They were encouraged by social media rumours from a group calling itself Glitter of Hope Caravan declaring that borders would open at noon on Friday.
The Larissis Street train station in Athens saw travelers being prevented from using rail services for trains departing on Friday evening.
In particular, migrants were asking for the opening of the border between Greece and neighbouring Macedonia, a crossing to northern Europe for the constant stream of illegal immigrants. Social media rumors spoke of a massive push to break through border patrols in the north.
Some have even set up tents on the platform of the station to denounce the “slowness” of the procedure of granting asylum in Greece as well as the poor living conditions that prevail in migrant camps across the country.
Currently, about 70 000 migrants are living in Greece, of which 15 000 are huddled in camps on Aegean islands. The demonstration comes in the aftermath of clashes between asylum seekers and law enforcement officials in the north of the country, in front of Diavata camp, a hundred kilometers further north.
Rioting migrants clashed with police in northern Greece for a second day on Friday in demonstrations that authorities said had been triggered by false reports on social media that restrictions on travel to northern Europe had been lifted.
“This is false information, the borders aren’t opening,” said Boris Cheshirkov, a spokesman for the UNHCR told the New York Times .
Greece restricts migrants from continuing further north under an agreement reached to stem a Europe-wide crisis in 2016. The United Nations and the Greek government meanwhile said they were false rumors that restrictions keeping them from traveling to Northern Europe would be lifted.
While visiting the station, the Secretary General at the Greek Ministry of Migration Policy, Miltiadis Klapas, said he saw in this event “a message for Europe that they must understand that the [migration] issue requires a European solution”.
“An effort is under way to make these people understand that the promises and reassurances they were given are not true. They stand to lose more than they hope to gain. We are constantly informing them and they are already starting to withdraw,” Klapas, told the Athens-Macedonian News Agency (ANA-MPA).
With nearly 5 500 arrivals in January and February, according to the European border agency Frontex, Greece leads Spain in the ranking of countries with the most illegal arrivals.

The teachers were told to kneel. Then ‘shot.’ An Indiana training exercise draws criticism
“The Indiana State Teachers Association is lobbying lawmakers to add language, prohibiting teachers from being shot with any sort of ammunition”
INDIANAPOLIS – An active-shooter training exercise at an Indiana elementary school in January left teachers with welts and bruises after they were shot with plastic pellets by the local sheriff’s office conducting the session.
The incident, acknowledged in testimony this week before state lawmakers, was confirmed by two elementary-school teachers in Monticello, Indiana, who described an exercise in which teachers were asked by local law enforcement to kneel against a classroom wall before being sprayed across their backs with plastic pellets without warning.
“They told us, ‘This is what happens if you just cower and do nothing,’” said one of the two teachers, both of whom asked not to be identified out of concern for their jobs. “They shot all of us across our backs. I was hit four times.
“It hurt so bad.” Now, these teachers and the state’s largest teachers union want to stop this from happening in other Indiana schools.

Addressing an overflow crowd of several hundred who attended the ceremony, LaRouche said that in these perilous times, there is no way the United States will come out of this crisis without the founding of a community of principle among the nations of the Americas and world. “Either we shall sail together, or we shall sink together,” he forecast.
LaRouche was invited to Brazil to receive this honor by Dr. Havanir Nimtz, the principal representative on the São Paulo City Council of Brazil’s Party for the Rebuilding of National Order (PRONA), founded by Dr. Eneas Carneiro, one of Brazil’s preeminent cardiologists and a former Presidential candidate. In his remarks at the awards ceremony, Dr. Eneas praised Mr. LaRouche’s revolutionary work in multiple fields of human knowledge, and thanked him as an American statesman who stands up for all humanity. Less than four months after hosting LaRouche’s historic visit to Brazil, Dr. Eneas was elected to Brazil’s congress with the largest vote total ever achieved by any candidate in the entire history of Brazil.

IDF General: Israel Behind Coup That Installed Al-Sisi Dictatorship in Egypt,www.therussophile.org,Whitney Webb,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/idf-general-israel-behind-coup-that-installed-al-sisi-dictatorship-in-egypt.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
Al-Sisi’s government, widely considered a military dictatorship despite a pale sheen of democracy, has forged increasingly close ties with Israel ever since he came to power in the 2013 coup.
( MPN ) — Brigadier General Aryeh Eldad of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has claimed that Israel was behind the 2013 military coup that ousted Mohammed Morsi, Egypt’s first democratically elected president. Eldad made the claim in an article published in the Israeli newspaper Maariv .
In the article, Eldad asserted:
“The outbreak of the January revolution coincided with the Israeli security assessment that President-elect Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood man, intended to cancel the peace agreement with Israel and send more Egyptian military forces to the Sinai Peninsula.”
Just a few months into Morsi’s presidency, in August 2012, Israel had publicly accused Morsi of violating the peace treaty with Israel after Egypt responded to terrorist attacks in the Sinai by sending an increased number of troops. Morsi’s government accused Israel’s Mossad of having been behind the attacks in order to destabilize his government amid efforts to improve Egypt’s relations with Gaza. Hamas, which has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, as well as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, also blamed Mossad for the attacks, a charge Israel denied.
Eldad then claimed that at this stage:
“Israel was quick and willing to activate its diplomatic tools, and perhaps even greater means, to bring Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi to power in Egypt, and convince the then-U.S. administration under President Barack Obama not to oppose this move.”
Events at the time support Eldad’s claim as, shortly after the coup, Israel quickly launched diplomatic missions in the U.S. and several European countries to push for support of Egypt’s new political reality and to prevent a diplomatic blockade on Cairo following the military coup. Many analysts have noted that under Al-Sisi, Egypt-Israel relations have grown to unprecedented levels through policies often driven by Al-Sisi himself. Why Israel Wanted Morsi Out
While Eldad cited concerns over a rupture of the Israel-Egypt peace agreement as having motivated Israel’s role in the 2013 coup, a more likely reason was related to Morsi’s relationship with Hamas and efforts to normalize relations with Gaza.
Notably, after Al-Sisi came to power, the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt and tunnels between Gaza and Egypt were abruptly closed . In addition, soon after the coup, “army-instigated anti-Palestinian propaganda” was “rampant” throughout Cairo and Palestinians that had flown into the Cairo airport were quickly deported back to the countries they had recently arrived from, according to The Guardian . In contrast, while Morsi did not end the blockade of Gaza — in force since 2007 — he had improved conditions for Palestinians living in the embattled enclave compared to those under his predecessor, Hosni Mubarak.
Eldad, in his article, hinted that the coup was related to a “religious war” that Israel was and still is fighting against Palestine and Arab majority nations, stating:
“Contrary to all Israeli expectations, the Camp David agreement, which was made 40 years ago, has lasted for many decades despite the lack of real peace between us and the Egyptians, and despite the failure to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, because this conflict is not just geopolitical. We are rather having a religious war with the Palestinians and Arabs.”
Though Eldad’s recent statements make the connection between Morsi’s relationship with Hamas and Israeli involvement in the 2013 coup more clear, it had long been suspected. An Egyptian army general told BBC soon after the coup that Morsi’s alleged “collaboration” and good relations with Hamas were a driving factor behind the coup.
In a telling incident, Morsi was later charged with terrorism for allegedly conspiring with Hamas, Hezbollah, and elements of the Iranian military to “destabilize” Egypt. Morsi has been imprisoned for years, many of them spent in solitary confinement, and a U.K. panel of legal experts asserted last year that harsh prison conditions will likely lead to his “premature death.” Prior to being charged for “collaborating” with Hamas, Morsi had publicly praised Palestinian “resistance” in Gaza. Another likely factor for Israel’s decision to place Al-Sisi in power was Morsi’s efforts to normalize relations with Iran.
The accusations against Morsi regarding alleged collaboration with Hezbollah and Iran, both adversaries of Israel, seemed unusual to some, given that Morsi had, during his time in office and during the alleged “conspiracy,” cut ties with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and supported Assad’s overthrow by opposition forces. Hezbollah and Iran, in contrast, supported Assad and fought alongside the Syrian Army. Notably, Israel served as one of the “masterminds” behind the Syrian conflict, which Morsi supported. Hamas, like Morsi’s government, had also backed efforts to oust Assad at the time, albeit less publicly.
Notably, Al-Sisi’s government, widely considered a military dictatorship despite a pale sheen of democracy, has forged increasingly close ties with Israel ever since he came to power in the 2013 coup. This is unsurprising given Eldad’s recent claim that Israel had orchestrated the coup in order to put Al-Sisi in power. During his time in control of the country, Israel and Egypt began “secretly” coordinating military actions in Egypt, a covert alliance that Al-Sisi had denied until this January, when he admitted far-reaching coordination between the IDF and the Egyptian military.
Al-Sisi’s efforts to bring Egypt closer to Israel lack popular support, as most trade unions and political parties oppose normalizing relations with Israel. However, Al-Sisi — known for his brutal repression of protests, journalism and any form of dissent — has continued to push forward in his efforts to forge closer ties with Israel, in apparent service to the country largely responsible for his rise to power.

US to Declare Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as Terrorist Group,www.therussophile.org,Middle East Eye,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.therussophile.org/us-to-declare-irans-revolutionary-guards-as-terrorist-group.html/,"This post was originally published on this site
( MEE ) — The United States will designate Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, an unprecedented move that will ramp up pressure on the elite force, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.
The newspaper, citing unidentified officials, said President Donald Trump’s administration will announce the decision as soon as Monday and that concerned defence officials were bracing for the impact.
The officials told the WSJ that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House National Security Adviser John Bolton, who have repeatedly railed against Iran, are strong proponents of the designation.
Still, senior military officials, including Marine General Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have expressed reservations about it on the grounds that it would have little impact on Iran’s economy while increasing security risks for US troops abroad, the sources said.
A former State Department official cautioned against the move.
“The designation of IRGC as a Foreign Terrorist Organization is precedent setting. Never before has the FTO sanctions tool been directed at a state-body. The future ramifications of this decision will be profound,” Jason Blazakis, the former Counterterrorism Finance and Designations Office director, told the WSJ.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps was formed after Iran’s 1979 revolution with a mission to defend the government, in contrast to more traditional military units that protect borders.
The Revolutionary Guards have amassed power within Iran, including holding significant economic interests.
The Guards’ prized unit is the Quds Force, named for the Arabic word for Jerusalem, which supports forces allied with Iran around the region, including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Lebanon’s Hezbollah.
The Trump administration has already imposed sweeping sanctions on Iran after withdrawing last year from an international agreement under which Tehran drastically scaled back its nuclear programme.
A foreign terrorist designation would make activities of the group more toxic in the view of the United States, with any transactions involving US institutions or individuals subject to restrictions and punishment.

US Imposes More Sanctions On Venezuela — This Time Targeting Cuba,www.newsy.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsy.com/stories/us-imposes-sanctions-on-venezuela-targeting-cuba/,"April 6, 2019 April 6, 2019 The U.S. is sanctioning ships owned by Venezuela's state-run oil company, as well as two international companies. SHOW TRANSCRIPT
The United States announced new sanctions on Venezuela. These sanctions are the latest in a monthslong effort to pressure President Nicolás Maduro into stepping down.
Vice President Mike Pence announced the new sanctions in a speech Friday. The sanctions are aimed at Venezuela's oil industry, which Pence called ""the lifeblood of that corrupt regime.""
The U.S. has already imposed numerous sanctions on Venezuela following a heated start of the year in the South American nation. In January, Juan Guaidó declared himself Venezuela's interim president, and he's received wide support from other countries, including the U.S. But Maduro refuses to relinquish power. He was sworn in for a second term earlier this year, despite accusations that the election was fraudulent.
After Pence's announcement about the new sanctions, the U.S. Treasury Department elaborated in a press release it's sanctioning ships owned by Venezuela's state-run oil company, as well as two international companies that own and operate a vessel that transports Venezuelan crude oil to Cuba.
Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Cuba is benefiting from Maduro's government through ""oil-for-repression schemes."" He also said the U.S. is committed to helping Venezuela restore democratic order and to ""holding the Cuban regime accountable"" for furthering Venezuela's crisis."
Trump Administration Puts Hold On Sale Of Jet Fighters To Taiwan,www.newsy.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsy.com/stories/trump-admin-puts-hold-on-sale-of-jet-fighters-to-taiwan/,"The sale was unofficially approved at the end of March. SHOW TRANSCRIPT
Taiwan is going to have to wait a little longer to purchase jet fighters from the U.S., Time reports .
The U.S. unofficially approved the sale of 60 Lockheed Martin F-16s at the end of March. It would have been the first such sale to Taiwan since 1992. The island has sought the jets for over a decade in hopes of helping its defense against China.
But the Trump administration wants to wait to sell the jets until after it has sealed the deal on trade negotiations with China. On Thursday, the president said the White House is ""getting very close to making a deal"" with the country.
While this may seem a bit like a setback for Taiwan, the sale was still in its beginning stages. Congress still needs to approve it, and the administration hadn't even officially submitted the request to lawmakers."
