Kevin’s been the tip of the spear on wall construction,” said Homan on "" America’s Newsroom "" Monday. Homan said he has worked with McAleenan for the past decade.
“We worked together during the 2014 (border) crisis and the 2015 (border) crisis under Jeh Johnson,” said Homan.
He added that he respects Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen for stepping up to the “most difficult job,” especially when Congress didn’t help.
President Trump revealed in a tweet Sunday that McAleenan will become the acting head of Homeland Security, a sprawling department of 240,000 people, following the resignation of Secretary Nielsen.
McAleenan is a longtime border officer, reflecting Trump’s priority for the department initially founded to combat terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks. Fox News is told Trump wanted the “toughest cop” around on border security, and McAleenan fit the bill.
When asked what McAleenan could do in the role that Nielsen could not, Homan said, “He spent many years fighting the fight so I think he knows the ground. He knows how it operates on the ground. Kirstjen Nielsen was very talented but she didn’t come up through the ranks. Kevin is within the ranks.”
He added, “I think Kevin can do operationally what he’s done in the lower ranks. I think he can certainly step up enforcement on the border.”
Homan added, “Kevin has great relationships with DOD (Department of Defense), I think he can get more DOD assets down there. He has a great relationship with the acting director of ICE.”
McAleenan is also getting support on Capitol Hill from some including Rep. John Joyce, who sits on the House Homeland Security Committee.
“Kevin McAleenan brings a lot to the table from his background in customs. He’s already stated that we’re at a breaking point. He realizes the serious issues that are occurring at the southern border,” said Joyce.
Administration sources tell Fox News that McAleenan needs to be able to handle the politics involved and change minds on Capitol Hill before he could be seen as potentially taking the job of DHS secretary permanently.

US declares Iran force a foreign terrorist organization,www.foxnews.com,MATTHEW LEE,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-declares-iran-force-a-foreign-terrorist-organization,"Email
FILE - In this Feb, 11, 2019 file photo, Iranian Revolutionary Guard members arrive for a ceremony celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, at the Azadi, or Freedom, Square, in Tehran, Iran. President Donald Trump's administration is preparing to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard as a ""foreign terrorist organization."" It's an unprecedented move that could have widespread implications for U.S. personnel and policy in the Mideast and elsewhere. U.S. officials say an announcement is expected Monday. (AP Photo/Vahid Salemi) WASHINGTON – The United States on Monday designated Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps a foreign terrorist organization, an unprecedented declaration against a foreign government that may prompt retaliation and make it harder for American diplomats and military officers to work with allies in the region. It is the first time that the U.S. has designated an entity of another government as a terrorist organization, placing a group with vast economic resources that answers only to Iran's supreme leader in the same category as al-Qaida and the Islamic State.
""This unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a state sponsor of terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft,"" President Donald Trump said in announcing the measure.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the designation is intended to increase pressure on Iran, isolating it further and diverting some of the financial resources it uses to fund terrorism and militant activity in the Middle East and beyond. But, in addition to the potential for Iranian retaliation, it complicates a delicate balance for U.S. personnel in at least two key countries.
No waivers or exceptions to the sanctions were announced, meaning U.S. troops and diplomats could be barred from contact with Iraqi or Lebanese authorities who interact with Guard officials or surrogates.
The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies had also raised concerns about the impact of the designation if the move did not allow contact with other foreign officials who may have met with or communicated with Guard personnel. Those concerns have in part dissuaded previous administrations from taking the step, which has been considered for more than a decade.
Critics of the hardline policy also see it as a prelude to conflict.
""This move closes yet another potential door for peacefully resolving tensions with Iran,"" said Trita Parsi, the founder of the National Iranian American Council. ""Once all doors are closed, and diplomacy is rendered impossible, war will essentially become inevitable.""
National Security Action, a group made up of mainly former Obama administration officials, said it would put U.S. troops at risk while jeopardizing the 2015 nuclear accord with which Iran is still complying.
""We need to call out today's move for what it is: another dangerous and self-defeating tactic that endangers our troops and serves nothing but the Trump administration's goal of destroying the Iran deal,"" it said.
The designation could also open hundreds of foreign companies and business executives to U.S. travel bans and possible prosecution for sanctions violations.
It blocks any assets that IRGC entities may have in U.S. jurisdictions and bars Americans from any transactions with it. When it takes effect next week, it will allow the U.S. to deny entry to people found to have provided the Guard with ""material support"" or prosecute them for sanctions violations. That could include European and Asian companies and businesspeople who deal with the Guard's many affiliates.
""It makes crystal clear the risks of conducting business with, or providing support to, the IRGC,"" Trump said. ""If you are doing business with the IRGC, you will be bankrolling terrorism.""
The IRGC is a paramilitary organization formed in the wake of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution to defend the government. The force answers only to Iran's supreme leader, operates independently of the regular military and has vast economic interests across the country. The U.S. estimates it may control or have a significant influence over up to 50% of the Iranian economy, including non-military sectors like banking and shipping.
Iran has long been designated a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" by the U.S. and the State Department currently designates more than 60 organizations as ""foreign terrorist organizations."" But none of them is a state-run military.
Iran immediately responded to the designation with its Supreme National Security Council designating the U.S. Central Command, also known as CENTCOM, and all its forces as terrorist, and labeling the U.S. a ""supporter of terrorism.""
The Council denounced the U.S. decision as ""illegal and dangerous"" and said the U.S. government would be responsible for all ""dangerous repercussions"" of its decision. It defended the IRGC, which has fought Islamic State fighters, as being a force against terrorism.
American military commanders were planning to warn U.S. troops remaining in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere in the region of the possibility of retaliation. Aside from Iraq, where some 5,200 American troops are stationed, and Syria, where some U.S. 2,000 troops remain, the U.S. 5th Fleet, which operates in the Persian Gulf from its base in Bahrain, and the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, are potentially at risk.
The U.S. special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Nathan Sales, said the decision was reached after consultation with agencies throughout the government but would not say in a news conference if the military or intelligence concerns had been addressed.
""Doing this will not impede our diplomacy,"" Hook said, without elaborating.
Reaction from those who favor tougher engagement with Iran was quick and welcoming.
""Thank you, my dear friend, US President Donald Trump,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a tweet, a day before what could be a close election. ""Thank you for answering another of my important requests that serves the interests of our countries and of countries in the region.""
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, called the action an ""overdue"" but essential step that should be followed by additional sanctions.
Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the designation ""ends the facade that the IRGC is part of a normal military.""
And, the Iranian opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, called it ""an imperative for Middle East security, peace, and stability, and an urgent and necessary step to end war and terrorism throughout the region and the world.""
Pompeo said the move is part of an effort to put ""maximum pressure"" on Iran to end its support for terrorist plots and militant activity that destabilizes the Middle East. Speaking to reporters, he rattled off a list of attacks dating to the 1980s for which the U.S. holds Iran and the IRGC responsible, beginning with the attacks on the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983.

RNC CHOOSES CHARLOTTE TO HOST 2020 CONVENTION
A first generation Korean-American, Kelly has worked on two presidential transition teams and three Republican National Conventions in Minneapolis, Tampa, and Cleveland. During the 2016 convention in Cleveland, Kelly served as the convention’s director of operations.
“Marcia’s extensive background in organizing events of this scale will ensure Charlotte is our most successful convention yet,” Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the Republican National Committee, said in statement. “I’m thrilled to have Marcia leading our team as we continue to celebrate President Trump’s America First momentum in the Queen City.”
The 2020 Republican National Convention will likely be the place where the GOP re-nominates President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. There have been rumblings, however, that another Republican might mount a challenge against Trump in the presidential primaries.

"A century after Lusitania was sunk by a U-boat, an unusual item from the doomed liner emerges",www.foxnews.com,James Rogers,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/science/a-century-after-lusitania-was-sunk-by-a-u-boat-an-unusual-item-from-the-doomed-liner-emerges,"Now, almost 104 years after the deadly torpedo attack, an extremely rare hardtack ship’s biscuit from one of the ship’s lifeboats is up for auction in the U.K. Made from flour, salt and water, cracker-like hardtack biscuits are designed to be long-lasting, and have historically been a feature of long sea voyages and military campaigns. The biscuit will be auctioned by Henry Aldridge and Son on April 27. Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge told Fox News that the biscuit comes with a letter written by a British soldier in the Royal Engineers explaining how he obtained the unusual item.
The soldier got the biscuit from one of Lusitania’s lifeboats when the liner’s survivors reached Queenstown (now called Cobh) in Ireland.
“I suppose these biscuits are put in the lifeboats to feed the people aboard her, in case they are a great distance from land or being adrift for many days,” the soldier wrote. “In these boats at Queenstown they found brooches, rings, watches & chains belonging to the survivors. There are also a great many life belts that the survivors wore. I have been in the boats and they hold something like fifty persons.”
The hardtack biscuit was recovered from one of Lusitania's lifeboats. (Henry Aldridge and Son)
“It is believed that there are only two such biscuits in existence,” Aldridge told Fox News, via email, adding that the other biscuit is on display at an Irish museum.
The biscuit has a pre-sale estimate of $3,920 to $6,533.
Lusitania was traveling from New York to Liverpool when she was sunk by U-boat U-20 off the coast of Ireland on May 7, 1915. Some 1,198 of the ship’s almost 2,000 passengers and crew died in the attack. More than 100 Americans lost their lives when Lusitania sank and the incident is cited as a contributory factor in America’s decision to abandon its position of neutrality and join World War I in 1917.

Germany said that it had warned ships not to enter the war zone around Britain and also cited the fact that Lusitania was carrying 173 tons of war munitions to Britain as justification for the attack, according to History.com .

Queenstown was also the last port of call for Titanic on its fateful maiden voyage. The ill-fated liner picked up passengers in the Irish port just two days before she sank after striking an iceberg on April 14, 1912.

New report sheds light on alleged UNHCR bribes for refugee resettlement to the West,www.foxnews.com,Hollie McKay,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/new-report-sheds-light-on-unhcr-bribes-for-refugee-resettlement-to-the-west,"A new investigative report collaboratively produced by NBC, Journalists for Transparency, and the nonprofit 100Reporters, sheds particular light on the testimony of one man, identified only as Mamadou, who fled an unidentified country for Uganda’s sprawling Nakivale refugee settlement after being gang-raped and tortured by prison officials. But at the resettlement, he and scores of others alleged that the pattern of profiteering continued – and this time, the authorities expected bribes to do everything from process medical and police referrals to gathering food rations. MALE RAPE EMERGING AS ONE OF THE MOST UNDER-REPORTED WEAPONS OF WAR
But the steepest cost? Being in the running to be resettled in a Western country, as facilitated by the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, which allegedly meant individuals could be slapped with secret payments up to $5000 for a family, which were allegedly then distributed among UNHCR staff and brokers, according to the report.

Fearing retaliation or being cut off from needed services, much of the corruption is said to have gone unreported.
Moreover, other survivors of sexual violence who raised red flags over the alleged corruption at Nakivale concurred that they “only suffered more” after having attempted to report the layers of corruption. They accused the UNHCR’s Inspector General’s office of “lacking the independence, local knowledge and desire to properly investigate” their claims.

UNHCR spokesperson Cecile Pouilly rejected the characterization, insisting that “every report or allegation of fraud, corruption, or retaliation against refugees by UNHCR personnel or those working for our partners is thoroughly assessed, and, if substantiated, results in disciplinary sanctions, including summary dismissal from the organization.”

Southern storms leave tornado damage in Alabama,www.foxnews.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/southern-storms-leave-tornado-damage-in-alabama,"Email GUNTERSVILLE, Ala. – Tornadoes knocked down power lines and caused scattered damage across farms and a retail district early Monday in northeast Alabama, and forecasters said more bad weather was likely. Photos shared on social media showed plants and other items thrown around the parking lot of a Walmart store in Guntersville, Alabama. Nearby stores had to close because of power outages.
High winds left trees tilted sideways and utility lines drooped toward the ground. Farm buildings and homes were damaged in rural Blount County, Alabama, where at least one person was reported injured.
The weather service said two twisters that spun out of the same storm system appeared responsible for the damage. An EF-1 tornado with winds of as much as 90 mph (145 kph) hit Blount County, and the EF-1 tornado that struck Guntersville was a little stronger with winds up to 100 mph.
The Storm Prediction Center says 26 million people were at a slight risk of being affected by severe storms in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas.
Schools in DeKalb County, Alabama, and Northeast Alabama Community College delayed the start of classes due to the threat of severe weather. The weather service said several rounds of severe weather could move through the region.
It was the third day in a row of heavy storms for parts of the South.
A storm that meteorologists identified as a tornado with winds of as high as 110 mph (177 kph) destroyed a mobile home in Centreville in the southwest corner of Mississippi. Wilkinson County Emergency Management Director Mattie Powell told WLBT-TV that four family members lost their possessions but were uninjured. Weather may also have contributed to a traffic fatality Saturday near Ruleville, Mississippi.
In Louisiana, the weather service will determine whether a twister was responsible for damage to at least five homes plus cars and boats in the St. Amant community southeast of Baton Rouge on Sunday night. In northeastern Louisiana, Grambling State University and Morehouse Parish schools were closed Monday because of flash flooding.
Louisiana State Police said they were investigating whether heavy rain contributed to the death of a man killed when his car ran off a road and struck an abandoned house during a downpour on Sunday night. Troopers identified the victim as Daniel Brown, 22, of Reserve. Trending in US"

A view shows a facility where nearly 100 whales, including orcas and beluga whales, are held in cages, during a visit of scientists representing explorer and founder of the Ocean Futures Society Jean-Michel Cousteau in a bay near the Sea of Japan port of Nakhodka in Primorsky Region, Russia April 7, 2019. Reuters. Bowing to global criticism, Russia on Monday agreed to free nearly 100 whales held captive in the country's Far East. Images of the whales - 10 orcas and 87 belugas - kept in cramped spaces in a bay near the Sea of Japan port city of Nakhodka surfaced last year.
TRUMP CALLS RUSSIA PROBE 'A BIG HOAX,' SAYS DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE A 'LOUSY JOB'
The animals had been captured by a company that planned to sell them to China.
However, Russian officials intervened and asked French ocean explorer Jean-Michel Cousteau for advice on how to safely release the illegally captured whales.
Cousteau, of the Ocean Futures Society, arrived Friday in Russia’s Far East on a mission to inspect the mammals and help create conditions for them to be released. Cousteau, son of famous oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, has voiced concern about the animals’ condition and offered his help to the Russian government.
The whales’ condition has drawn international concern, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered authorities to investigate the case and release the animals. Russian prosecutors have brought criminal charges against four companies keeping the whales.
Whales are worth a fortune on the black market, and local environmental activists suspected that they were captured for sale to amusements parks in China.

Russian law only allows for the capture of whales for “scientific” purposes.
Regional Gov. Oleg Kozhemyako met with Cousteau in Vladivostok, voicing hope that his experience will help “get a full picture on how to allow the animals to readapt to living in the wild.”
Before flying to the Far East, Cousteau met with Russian Natural Resources Minister Dmitry Kobylkin in Moscow on Thursday.
FOUR LEGGED WHALE THAT LIVED 40 MILLION YEARS AGO FOUND OFF COAST IN PERU
Kobylkin said summer offers the most favorable conditions for releasing the animals. “We couldn’t release the animals in the winter, it would have simply killed them,” Kobylkin said. “We can and must do this work in the coming summer.”
He emphasized that Russia would like to rely on international expertise to ensure the safe release of the mammals.
“We want to do it as openly as possible,” Kobylkin added.
Russian scientists estimate that the rehabilitation effort will cost about $4.6 million.

Activists first raised the alarm late last fall when 101 belugas and orcas were captured and placed in a marine containment facility that environmentalists have dubbed a “whale prison” near Nakhodka.
Local prosecutors have said that several of the mammals have escaped, but environmentalists said four animals likely died because of cramped conditions and low temperatures.

A state judge sentenced Matin Azizi-Yarand to 20 years in prison Monday for solicitation of capital murder and making a terroristic threat, state and federal prosecutors announced. The 18-year-old is eligible for parole after serving 10 years.
Azizi-Yarand was arrested last May for plotting to shoot civilians and police at a Frisco mall in a rampage authorities said he was timing to coincide with Ramadan. IS has called on its supporters to carry out attacks during the Muslim holy month.
The then-high school student had been recruiting others to participate in the shooting and planned to explain it with the release of a ""Message to America,"" according to prosecutors. He spent more than $1,400 buying weapons and tactical gear, and had been conducting surveillance of the mall.
Azizi-Yarand believes his plea agreement is a ""fair deal"" and is ready to begin his prison term, his lawyer, Mitch Nolte, told The Associated Press.
Azizi-Yarand was indicted in July , but his age presented a challenge for prosecutors.
Terrorism cases are typically brought in federal court. But because Azizi-Yarand was 17 at the time of the crime and a minor under federal law, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Texas was limited in the charges they could bring against him.
It's ""extremely rare"" for someone to be prosecuted for terrorism charges state court, U.S. Attorney Joseph Brown said Monday at a press conference. Trending in US"
"Antjuan Seawright: Thank you, Sen. Ernest 'Fritz' Hollings, for your service and leadership",www.foxnews.com,Antjuan Seawright,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/antjuan-seawright-thank-you-sen-ernest-fritz-hollings-for-your-service-and-leadership,"If that is true, and I believe it is, then we know for certain that Sen. Ernest “Fritz” Hollings lived a tremendous life. A true patriot, he answered his nation’s call with pride during World War II and served with honor and distinction as an artillery officer in North Africa and Europe. But, for him, service wasn’t something that ended with a treaty. So, only a few years after coming home, he ran for election to the South Carolina House of Representatives.
He was only 26 years old but he won... and he kept on winning.
In the midst of his three terms as state representative, he was twice chosen by his colleagues to serve as Speaker Pro Tempore. In 1954, he was elected South Carolina’s lieutenant governor and then, at only 36 years old, he was chosen to serve as our state’s 106th governor.
Looking back now, it’s easy to lose sight of the countless jobs he helped create or forget all the good he did in just four years.
But, I refuse to forget. I refuse to forget how he raised teacher salaries and improved our public schools. I refuse to forget that his leadership was instrumental in bringing Educational Television (ETV) to South Carolina. I refuse to forget that he was the driving force in establishing our network of state technical schools lighting the way for generations of my fellow South Carolinians to rise out of poverty and into the middle class.
I refuse to forget how, as a U.S. senator, he led the fight against the hunger and despair rampant in forgotten communities across our nation. I refuse to forget how he fought to bring immediate federal relief to families devastated by Hurricane Hugo. I refuse to forget how, time and again, his fearlessness and biting wit was turned against anyone seeking to exploit working families anywhere in America.
I refuse to forget how he used his final address as governor to call for a peaceful end to desegregation and Jim Crow saying, “this General Assembly must make clear South Carolina&apos;s choice, a government of laws rather than a government of men.”
“This should be done with dignity. It should be done with law and order.""
I refuse to forget because, in this era of divisiveness and demagoguery, we must remember what real leadership looks like. It is not perfection or philosophical purity but rather the relentless pursuit of grace. It matters not that you stumble and fall but that you get back up again and keep moving forward.
It is that pursuit which we see embodied in Sen. Hollings’ journey.
As I learned as a little fella’ in Swansea, South Carolina, life cannot be measured in the dates of birth and death but in the dash in between.
In that dash, Ernest “Fritz” Hollings found greatness and, in doing so, he found grace.
Thank you for your service. Thank you for your leadership. That you for your example. Thank you for your dash.
Job well done, kind sir. Job well done.
Take your rest now and sleep tight, Senator.

Playboy model Shanna Moakler says tummy tuck made her more ‘confident’ in bikini selfie,www.foxnews.com,Julius Young,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/playboy-model-shanna-moakler-says-tummy-tuck-made-her-more-confident-in-bikini-selfie,"The adult actress went on Instagram over the weekend to share an update with her followers about her reinvigorated self-confidence after going under the knife. Sporting nothing but a teal bikini, the 44-year-old explained that her procedure wasn’t for weight loss, but instead was done to improve her overall health by repairing her stomach muscles after having three children over the past 20 years.
“6 months post op from my #mommymakeover with @leifrogersmd I am so thankful and so happy with my results,” Moakler captioned the photo in a lengthy note. “This wasn’t for weight loss! It was to fix my tummy muscles! I finally feel confident in a bikini again.
“It was a long healing process but I’m really glad I did it! Thanks to all the other moms who sent me encouraging messages!”
The former model has two children, Alabama, 13, and Landon, 15, with ex-husband, Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, and one daughter, Atiana, 20, from a previous relationship with former boxer Oscar de la Hoya.
In January, the former Miss USA took part in the viral “10-Year Challenge” on Instagram where she revealed side-by-side photos of herself wearing the same tiny red bikini from the 1995 Miss USA contest.
“Ok ten year challenge, I’ll see your ten and raise you 14!” captioned the Playboy cover girl. “…. This is my actual swimsuit from #missusa I’m actually 35lbs heavier now and I think it’s all in my boobs! Don’t worry Im not trying to be 19 again I like where I’m at!”
Moakler also credited plastic surgeon Leif Rogers for helping her reconstruct her stomach as part of her “mommy makeover.”

“My stomach muscles are actually where they are suppose to be!” she wrote. “I got the ok to go back to the gym which I started doing and I know it will just get better with time!”
During her career, the blonde pinup has also dated Dennis Quaid and Billy Idol and has appeared on a myriad of reality television series, including “Meet the Barkers” in 2005, ""Dancing with the Stars"" in 2006, E! Network’s “Bridalplasty” in 2010 and the VH1 reality series, “Hollywood Exes” in 2014.

National Border Patrol Council VP: McAleenan has a 'tough job' ahead,www.foxnews.com,Talia Kaplan,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/national-border-patrol-council-vp-mcaleenan-has-a-tough-job-ahead,"“This is going to be a tough job. The Department of Homeland Security secretary has a lot of responsibility. He has to work with our members of Congress,” said Garza on “ America’s Newsroom ” Monday. “We know that he’s going to be our acting secretary for the meantime. We don’t know who the permanent secretary will be but we do have full confidence in President Trump that he will choose someone that will have the skills and determination to secure the border.” President Trump revealed in a tweet Sunday that McAleenan will become the acting head of Homeland Security, a sprawling department of 240,000 people, following the resignation of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
“Working with Commissioner McAleenan, I have met with him personally on one occasion, he has been leading the charge on the CBP side. We do know that he does advocate for border patrol agents and he has been trying to let the American public know of the crisis that’s happening on the border,” Garza said.
McAleenan is a longtime border officer, reflecting Trump’s priority for the department initially founded to combat terrorism after the Sept. 11 attacks. Fox News is told Trump wanted the “toughest cop” around on border security, and McAleenan fit the bill.
When asked if he thinks McAleenan fits the bill, Garza answered, “It’s a tough job and with the laws that we have in place, it makes it very difficult to do a good job in that position. I think what’s more important is that our members of Congress, they’re going to have to work with the secretary, be it acting or permanent, they’re going to have to work closely with our secretary to make sure that we can solve this mess and that includes providing the resources that our agents need to be able to solve this security crisis.”
When asked what he thought about Nielsen in the role of Homeland Security Secretary, Garza said, “She tried her best. She tried her best to do this job. It’s tough, again, with the laws we have in place. It’s not easy.”
Garza stressed the need for Congress to change U.S. immigration laws “so that we stop encouraging illegal immigration.”
He emphasized that if the laws don’t change “this mess will only get worse” and said, “we need to deal with this crisis right now.”

Oldest US reform school's license revoked over abuse claims,www.foxnews.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/oldest-us-reform-schools-license-revoked-over-abuse-claims,"Email
FILE - This March 7, 2019, file photo, shows the Glen Mills Schools in Glen Mills, Pa. A spokeswoman for the nation's oldest reform school says they'll appeal the state's decision to revoke licenses at the suburban Philadelphia campus amid an investigation into child abuse allegations. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) PHILADELPHIA – The nation's oldest reform school had its licenses revoked Monday amid an investigation into allegations of child abuse at the suburban Philadelphia campus, and a spokeswoman said the school will appeal. The decision follows an investigation published this year by The Philadelphia Inquirer that detailed decades of alleged abuse and cover-ups at the 193-year-old Glen Mills Schools.
The Department of Human Services announced that all 14 licenses issued to Glen Mills were revoked ""following documented instances of abuse against former students of the residential school."" The department also cited ""gross incompetence, negligence and misconduct in operating the facility.""
No students remained Monday after the state last month ordered their removal, Glen Mills spokeswoman Aimee Tysarczyk said in an emailed statement. Some business operations, including community programs and a golf course, remain running.
The school will appeal, she said.
""In the past 18 months alone, Glen Mills Schools has been formally visited, inspected and reviewed more than 150 times by different outside entities, including numerous states and counties,"" she wrote. ""The issues PA DHS inspectors discovered were trivial and they found no signs of long-standing physical abuse, per their own documentation. We are stunned that PA DHS is taking this action based on media reports as opposed to looking at the results of their own inspections.""
The school has 10 days to appeal the license revocation.
The Inquirer investigation published in February described a culture of physical abuse at the school and alleged that school leaders turned a blind eye to beatings and failed to vet or train counselors.
The allegations included severe beatings for students who made minor infractions, a staffer breaking a boy's jaw after the student made a joke about his sister, and other boys getting choked for running away. Broken bones, serious bruises and threats warning students not to talk were detailed.
In the past five years, at least 13 staffers at Glen Mills have been fired and dozens more have been retrained or reprimanded over assaults on 15 students at the school, the newspaper reported.
Glen Mills last week announced layoffs of about 250 staff members following the state's order that remaining students be removed from the Delaware County campus about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of Philadelphia.
Glen Mills, established in 1826 as the Philadelphia House of Refuge, has previously said it had ""zero-tolerance for violent behaviors against students."" The school noted that it is regulated and licensed each year, and that staff deal with extremely challenging young people and are trained in handling potentially violent behaviors.
Set amid the rolling hills of Delaware County, it looks more like a prestigious prep school than a facility for juvenile delinquents. Boys wind up in the facility in two ways: because they are in the criminal justice system in some capacity or are dependents like foster kids the state hasn't been able to place.
Students have come from Pennsylvania and many other states. Some came from as far as Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Bermuda. Its top-tier athletic program has yielded NFL recruits.
After the Inquirer investigation was published in February, agencies in Los Angeles, Houston, Pittsburgh and other jurisdictions started to pull their students from the school. Trending in US"
Klobuchar's 2020 haul: $5.2 million in seven weeks,www.foxnews.com,Paul Steinhauser,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/klobuchars-2020-haul-5-2-million-in-seven-weeks,"2020 presidential nominee Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN): What to know Sen. Amy Klobuchar says her presidential campaign brought in $5.2 million in the seven weeks from her mid-February announcement through the end of the first quarter of fundraising on March 31. While respectable, the Minnesota Democrat’s fundraising figure trailed significantly larger hauls by some of her rivals for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
O'ROURKE HAULS IN $9.4 MILLION IN JUST 18 DAYS
Klobuchar’s campaign announced Monday that the senator also transferred more than $3 million from her Senate 2018 re-election campaign, bringing her January-March total to more than $8 million. It added that Klobuchar had $7 million cash-on-hand as of the beginning of this month.
The campaign highlighted Klobuchar’s grassroots appeal, saying the senator’s “average online grassroots contribution was $40 and 85 percent of all donors gave less than $100.”
Fundraising, along with polling, is a much watched barometer of a candidate’s clout, strength, and popularity. The first quarter campaign cash figures, the first of the 2020 election cycle, will be heavily scrutinized and analyzed.
Klobuchar’s announcement came one day after Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey reported raising $5 million during the first quarter. Booker declared his candidacy for president 10 days before Klobuchar.
BERNIE'S BIG BUCKS-SANDERS BRINGS IN $18.2 MILLION
The big winner so far in the race for campaign cash is Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The independent senator, who’s making his second straight bid for the Democratic nomination, raised an eye-popping $18.2 million in the 71 days from his mid-February launch through the end of March. Sen. Kamala Harris of California brought in $12 million in the 70 days from her January announcement through the end of the quarter. And former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas, who announced his bid in mid-March, hauled in $9.4 million in the first 18 days of his campaign.
South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg was the first 2020 Democratic contender to announce first-quarter campaign cash numbers. His $7 million haul was further evidence that the one-time long shot for the nomination was rising in stature and strength.
New York-based entrepreneur Andrew Yang reported raising $1.7 million.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, known as strong fundraisers in the Senate, have yet to report their campaign cash numbers.
The campaigns have until April 15 to file their fundraising reports with the Federal Election Commission.
THE MAD DASH FOR CAMPAIGN CASH
Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson, a presidential campaign veteran, highlighted that the numbers are an important “data point to show us how campaigns are doing.”
“The numbers will surely be over-interpreted, but they will tell us who is building the base of support needed in order to stay in for the long haul,” explained Ferguson, who served as a senior spokesman on the 2016 Clinton presidential campaign. “The numbers will show us who is building the grassroots support needed to get on the debate stage.” Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in New Hampshire.

Storm to hit Rockies before forming new 'bomb cyclone',www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/storm-to-hit-rockies-before-forming-new-bomb-cyclone,"HELENA, Mont. – Flood, snow, avalanche and fire alerts popped up Monday from Idaho to Colorado, as parts of the U.S. interior that were paralyzed by blizzards and floods last month braced for round two of an unusual weather phenomenon. Welcome to springtime in the Rockies and parts of the Great Plains.
It's not unusual for floods, snow and fire to co-exist in the Rockies thanks to powerful storms blowing through the mountains, melting snow swelling waterways and high winds sweeping across dry grasslands and trees that haven't seen their first green shoots and leaves.
Those conditions are what drove a wildfire Sunday on southeastern Montana's Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, where a house fire sparked a blaze that quickly burned through 1,700 acres (688 hectares) of dry grass and trees. It forced evacuations Sunday in Lame Deer, a town of about 2,000 people that is the seat of the tribal government, before fire crews were able to contain it.
Also normal are the fire warnings issued for eastern Colorado on Monday, a day after a wildfire near Colorado Springs forced the temporary evacuation of about 20 homes. Forecasters frequently issue red flag warnings for March and April on the eastern and southeastern Colorado plains as the jet stream moves southward and brings stronger weather systems and higher wind, said Jennifer Stark, meteorologist in charge for the National Weather Service in Pueblo, Colorado.
""This is the time of year when we get a roller coaster of weather,"" Colorado state climatologist Russ Schumacher said Monday. ""Going from 80 degree temperatures one day to a snowstorm the next is not that out of the ordinary, especially in March and April, around here.""
But what is unusual is what's coming next. A storm system that is moving in from the Pacific Ocean is forecast to intensify and form into a new inland ""bomb cyclone.""
A bomb cyclone is a rapid drop in air pressure — at least 24 millibars in 24 hours — and often is over or near oceans or seas because it requires warm moist air smacking into cold dry air, along with volatile weather from the jet stream. The central and mountain part of the country may get one of these every few winters, said Greg Carbin, forecast branch chief for the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in Maryland.
But this would be the second such storm in less than a month. The March 13 storm caused massive flooding in the Midwest, a blizzard in Colorado and Wyoming, and produced winds of between 96 mph and 110 mph (155 and 177.02 kph).
This week's bomb cyclone one is expected to be similar in intensity and in snowfall, meteorologists said. Heavy, wet snow will fall from the Nebraska panhandle through south central and southeastern South Dakota into western Minnesota. Wind speeds can reach 50 mph to 60 mph (80 to 96 kph) across Kansas.
""This blizzard will further exacerbate flooding in Nebraska with the added insult of heavy snowfall to eventually melt,"" said Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at the private weathermodels.com. ""This is more bad news for suffering farmers who are unable to flip the calendar on winter.""
But first, the storm is expected to flooding in Idaho and western Montana, and dump up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) feet of snow in the mountains of Montana and Wyoming as it moves in from the Pacific Ocean. Parts of Colorado that were under a fire warning Monday are expected to see snow and temperatures drops of more than 40 degrees by Wednesday at the southern edge of the storm, meteorologists said.
The storm dumped rain on parts of Oregon Sunday and Monday as it moved inland, causing flooding that closed some schools in the central Willamette Valley and forced the release of water from dams.
While it's unusual to see two consecutive inland bomb cyclones, it's difficult to pin the cause on climate change, said Schumacher.
""I think it's an interesting question to ask whether there's some climate change fingerprint on this,"" he said. ""But it's a complicated puzzle to piece together.""
That includes what is happening as the storm forms over the Pacific Ocean, what happens once it's over land and what effect climate change may have on those variables.
""I'm not sure we have the answer,"" Schumacher said.

US labels elite Iran force a foreign terrorist organization,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/us-labels-elite-iran-force-a-foreign-terrorist-organization,"It is the first time that the U.S. has designated an entity of another government as a terrorist organization, placing a group with vast economic resources that answers only to Iran&apos;s supreme leader in the same category as al-Qaida and the Islamic State. ""This unprecedented step, led by the Department of State, recognizes the reality that Iran is not only a state sponsor of terrorism, but that the IRGC actively participates in, finances and promotes terrorism as a tool of statecraft,"" President Donald Trump said in announcing the measure.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the designation is intended to increase pressure on Iran, isolating it further and diverting some of the financial resources it uses to fund terrorism and militant activity in the Middle East and beyond. But, in addition to the potential for Iranian retaliation, it complicates a delicate balance for U.S. personnel in at least two key countries.
The administration went ahead with the designation despite expressions of ""serious"" concern by senior defense and intelligence officials about the possibility of retaliation, as well as the effectiveness against an organization already subject to sanctions, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the decision.
Pompeo said the move is part of an effort to put ""maximum pressure"" on Iran to end its support for terrorist plots and militant activity that destabilizes the Middle East. Speaking to reporters, he rattled off a list of attacks dating to the 1980s for which the U.S. holds Iran and the IRGC responsible, beginning with the attacks on the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, Lebanon in 1983.
No waivers or exceptions to the sanctions were announced, meaning U.S. troops and diplomats could be barred from speaking with Iraqi or Lebanese authorities who have dealings with Guard officials or surrogates. Such contact occurs now between U.S. officials in Iraq who deal with Iranian-affiliated Shiite militias and in Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah movement is in parliament and the government.
The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies had raised concerns about the impact of the designation if the move did not allow contact with other foreign officials who may have met with or communicated with Guard personnel. Those concerns have in part dissuaded previous administrations from taking the step, which has been considered for more than a decade.
The Justice Department said Monday it would prosecute violations but officials declined to say how broadly they would interpret the provision barring ""material support"" to the IRGC. A strict interpretation would leave hundreds of European companies and executives at risk for U.S. travel bans or criminal penalties in addition to limiting American officials&apos; ability to deal with foreign counterparts who have links to the guard.
The designation ""raises the question of whether a non-U.S. company or individual could be prosecuted for engaging in commercial transactions with an Iranian company controlled by the IRGC,"" said Anthony Rapa, an international trade and national security attorney with Kirkland and Ellis.
Critics of the hardline policy also see it as a prelude to conflict.
""This move closes yet another potential door for peacefully resolving tensions with Iran,"" said Trita Parsi, the founder of the National Iranian American Council. ""Once all doors are closed, and diplomacy is rendered impossible, war will essentially become inevitable.""
National Security Action, a group made up of mainly former Obama administration officials, said it would put U.S. troops at risk while jeopardizing the 2015 nuclear accord with which Iran is still complying.
""We need to call out today&apos;s move for what it is: another dangerous and self-defeating tactic that endangers our troops and serves nothing but the Trump administration&apos;s goal of destroying the Iran deal,"" it said.
The designation could also open hundreds of foreign companies and business executives to U.S. travel bans and possible prosecution for sanctions violations.
The IRGC is a paramilitary organization formed in the wake of Iran&apos;s 1979 Islamic Revolution to defend the government. The force answers only to Iran&apos;s supreme leader, operates independently of the regular military and has vast economic interests across the country. The U.S. estimates it may control or have a significant influence over up to 50% of the Iranian economy, including non-military sectors like banking and shipping.
Iran has long been designated a ""state sponsor of terrorism"" by the U.S. and the State Department currently designates more than 60 organizations as ""foreign terrorist organizations."" But none of them is a state-run military.
Iran immediately responded to the designation with its Supreme National Security Council designating the U.S. Central Command, also known as CENTCOM, and all its forces as terrorist, and labeling the U.S. a ""supporter of terrorism.""
The Council denounced the U.S. decision as ""illegal and dangerous"" and said the U.S. government would be responsible for all ""dangerous repercussions"" of its decision. It defended the IRGC, which has fought Islamic State fighters, as being a force against terrorism.
American military commanders were planning to warn U.S. troops remaining in Iraq, Syria and elsewhere in the region of the possibility of retaliation. Aside from Iraq, where some 5,200 American troops are stationed, and Syria, where some U.S. 2,000 troops remain, the U.S. 5th Fleet, which operates in the Persian Gulf from its base in Bahrain, and the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, are potentially at risk.
The U.S. special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, and the State Department&apos;s counterterrorism coordinator, Nathan Sales, said the decision was reached after consultation with agencies throughout the government but would not say in a news conference if the military or intelligence concerns had been addressed.
""Doing this will not impede our diplomacy,"" Hook said, without elaborating. He noted that the U.S. has at various times had contact or even formal negotiations with members of groups that are subject to sanctions.
Reaction from those who favor tougher engagement with Iran was quick and welcoming.
""Thank you, my dear friend, US President Donald Trump,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a tweet, a day before what could be a close election. ""Thank you for answering another of my important requests that serves the interests of our countries and of countries in the region.""
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, called the action an ""overdue"" but essential step that should be followed by additional sanctions.
Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the designation ""ends the facade that the IRGC is part of a normal military.""
And, the Iranian opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, called it ""an imperative for Middle East security, peace, and stability, and an urgent and necessary step to end war and terrorism throughout the region and the world.""

California judge blocks Trump's policy forcing asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico,www.foxnews.com,Gregg Re,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/9th-circuit-judge-blocks-trumps-policy-forcing-asylum-seekers-to-stay-in-mexico,"US to start sending asylum-seekers back to Mexico while cases play out Under the new Trump administration plan, the U.S. will start returning some asylum-seeking migrants to Mexico to wait for their immigration court hearings. A federal district court judge in the 9th Circuit on Monday issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration's new policy of returning asylum seekers to Mexico as they wait for an immigration court to hear their cases, but the order won't immediately go into effect. The so-called ""Remain in Mexico"" policy was one of the primary innovations of former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, whom President Trump announced on Sunday ""will be leaving her position"" after 16 months in the job.
Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco granted a request by civil liberties groups to halt the practice while their lawsuit moves forward. He put the decision on hold until Friday to give U.S. officials the chance to appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals -- which, thanks to Trump's aggressive judicial appointments, is now more friendly to conservatives than it has been in more than three decades.
The launch of the policy in January in San Diego at the nation's busiest border crossing marked an unprecedented change to the U.S. asylum system, government officials and asylum experts said. Families seeking asylum typically had been released in the U.S. with notices to appear in court -- and, conservatives have charged, they often can't be relied upon to show up.
The American Civil Liberties Union, Southern Poverty Law Center, and Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, which brought the lawsuit on behalf of 11 asylum applicants and several other organizations, praised the ruling in a statement Monday.
“The court strongly rejected the Trump administration’s unprecedented and illegal policy of forcing asylum seekers to return to Mexico without hearing their claims,"" Judy Rabinovitz, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement. ""Try as it may, the Trump administration cannot simply ignore our laws in order to accomplish its goal of preventing people from seeking asylum in the United States.”

The Trump administration says the policy responds to a crisis at the southern border that has overwhelmed the ability of immigration officials to detain migrants. Growing numbers of families are fleeing poverty and gang violence in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
Last year, the Justice Department eliminated gang violence and domestic abuse as a possible justification for seeking asylum.
TRUMP TRANSFORMS 9TH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS, WITH NEARLY HALF OF JUDGES NOW APPOINTED BY REPUBLICANS
Trump, earlier this week, flatly stated that the ""the asylum program is a scam,"" often abused by thousands of migrants with phony stories hoping to take advantage of U.S. law.
Asylum law, conservatives point out, is intended to shield individuals from near-certain death or persecution on account of limited factors like religious or political affiliation -- not poor living conditions and economic despair.
Most asylum applicants are ultimately rejected for having an insufficient or unfounded personalized fear of persecution, following a full hearing of their case before an asylum officer or immigration judge.
""Some of the roughest people you have ever seen,"" Trump said, referring to some fraudulent asylum applicants. ""People that look like they should be fighting for the UFC."" Trump compares asylum seekers to UFC fighters
Aishah Hasnie reports.
The lawsuit on behalf of 11 asylum seekers from Central America and legal advocacy groups says the Trump administration is violating U.S. law by failing to adequately evaluate the dangers that migrants face in Mexico.
It also accuses Homeland Security and immigration officials of depriving migrants of their right to apply for asylum by making it difficult or impossible for them to do so.
WEEKS AGO: 9TH CIRCUIT RULES THAT ASYLUM APPLICANT HAS RIGHT TO GO BEFORE JUDGE, BREAKING RANKS WITH ANOTHER COURT
Under the new policy, asylum seekers are not guaranteed interpreters or lawyers and don't get to argue to a judge that they face the potential of persecution or torture if they are sent back to Mexico, Judy Rabinovitz, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said at a March court hearing.
Seeborg appeared skeptical of the lawsuit's argument that the administration misapplied a U.S. law that allows the return of immigrants to Mexico. The ACLU and other groups that are suing say that law does not apply to asylum seekers who cross the border illegally or arrive at a border crossing without proper documents.
The judge also questioned the Justice Department's argument that asylum seekers sent back to Mexico are not eligible for certain protections, such as a hearing before an immigration judge.

The administration hopes that making asylum seekers wait in Mexico will discourage weak claims and help reduce an immigration court backlog of more than 800,000 cases.
Justice Department attorney Scott Stewart said there is a process to protect immigrants who could face harm in Mexico. All 11 plaintiffs in the lawsuit are represented by attorneys, and 10 already have appeared for court proceedings, he said.
Border Patrol arrests, the most widely used gauge of illegal crossings, have risen sharply over the last year but are relatively low in historical terms after hitting a 46-year low in 2017.
TRUMP: 'DISGRACEFUL' 9TH CIRCUIT WOULD OVERTURN MY THANKSGIVING TURKEY PARDON IF IT COULD
The launch of the policy followed months of delicate talks between the U.S. and Mexico. Mexicans and children traveling alone are exempt from it.
The long-liberal 9th Circuit, which has a sweeping purview over nine western states, has long been a thorn in the side of the Trump administration . Just weeks ago, the 9th Circuit broke ranks with another federal appellate court and ruled that a Sri Lankan man who failed his initial asylum screening had the constitutional right to go before a judge -- threatening to clog the immigration court system further with tens of thousands of similar claims per year and setting up an all-but-certain Supreme Court showdown.

Yeshiva schools must exclude unvaccinated amid measles surge,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/yeshiva-schools-must-exclude-unvaccinated-amid-measles-surge,"Last Update 56 mins ago Yeshiva schools must exclude unvaccinated amid measles surge Email NEW YORK – The New York City Health Department ordered all ultra-Orthodox Jewish schools in a neighborhood of Brooklyn on Monday to exclude unvaccinated students from classes during the current measles outbreak. In issuing the order, the health department said that any yeshiva in Williamsburg that does not comply will face fines and possible closure.
City health officials said the measles outbreak among Orthodox Jewish communities continues to increase ""at an alarming rate.""
Officials say 285 cases have been confirmed in New York City since the beginning of the outbreak in October. Most cases have been reported from Williamsburg and Borough Park — two Brooklyn neighborhoods with large Orthodox Jewish populations, in which vaccination rates tend to be lower.
New York City accounted for about two-thirds of all U.S. measles cases reported last week. But areas outside the city are also seeing a surge in cases.
Last week, a state judge issued a preliminary injunction against a Rockland County emergency order banning children from public places unless they've been vaccinated against measles. Civil rights lawyer Michael Sussman called the order ""arbitrary and capricious.""
The county had enacted the 30-day emergency order to fight a measles outbreak that has infected at least 166 people since October. Rockland's outbreak has most heavily affected Orthodox Jewish communities.
Health officials say the best way to stop the disease's spread is a vaccination rate in the community of 92 to 95 percent.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all children get two doses of measles vaccine. It says the vaccine is 97% effective. Trending in US"

Stars including director Spike Lee, actor Seth McFarlane, comedian Will Ferrell, actress Rosario Dawson, and composer Hans Zimmer “Felt the Bern” back in 2016, according to The Los Angeles Times . In September 2015, the Vermont senator even released a letter of endorsement signed by 128 celebrities, Variety reported at the time.
Despite losing the Democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton, Sanders has thrown his hat back into the 2020 campaign ring.
Sanders will join Fox News Channel for a Town Hall co-anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum on Monday, April 15, at 6:30 p.m. ET in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
The 77-year-old politician announced his presidential bid in February and already he’s been well-supported. Sanders has raised $18.2 million , surpassing his 2016 run and his 2020 competitors. He’s also been backed by a handful of celebrities, activists, and politicians.
Ahead of his appearance at Fox News’ Town Hall, here’s a look at some of Sanders’ most famous celebrity backers. Mark Ruffalo
On Feb. 19, “Avengers” actor Mark Ruffalo tweeted Sanders' campaign when he posted : “Welcome to the race @SenSanders! Glad to see you back.”
Ruffalo supported Sanders during the senator’s 2016 bid. After a Democratic presidential debate against HIllary Clinton in March 2016, Ruffalo appeared on MSNBC, saying he “felt a lot of heart from [Sanders],” The Hill reported at the time.
“He awoke something in me, and it was his ideas, and it’s his decency, and it’s his record, frankly,” Ruffalo said at the time. Danny DeVito
The day after Sanders announced his presidential bid, actor and comedian Danny DeVito made it clear where he stood with a brief “Bernie 2020” tweet .
The 74-year-old actor also supported Sanders in 2016 after contributing to Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley’s campaign before he stepped out in early 2016, Buzzfeed News reported . Sarah Silverman
In 2016, Sarah Silverman was an outspoken supporter of Sanders until he lost the primary to Clinton.
Now that Sanders is running again, Silverman appears to be back supporting the senator.
In March she tweeted a video clip of Sanders, reportedly from 1995, where he defended men and women in the military who are gay.
In her tweet, Silverman wrote: “25 years ago. This is why I believe in Bernie #lgbtq.” Danny Glover
“Lethal Weapon” actor Danny Glover is also a returning supporter of Sanders.
On Feb. 26, he tweeted : “I also am putting my full support for @SenSanders for President in 2020 and the people's agenda he supports!” David Cross
Comedian and actor David Cross, best known for his role as Tobias Fünke on “Arrested Development,” announced his support for Sanders on Twitter as well, saying : “I’m in!”
He was responding to a tweet from the Republican National Committee that said: “Bernie Sanders’s radical ideas are now the primary platform for the Democrats. As a self-avowed socialist, Bernie is a supporter of far-left policies such as a government takeover of healthcare, the Green New Deal, and College for All.” John Cusack
On Feb. 19, “Say Anything” actor John Cusack endorsed Sanders by tweeting : “Join @OurRevolution Bernie wants 1 mill people in every state committed to changing America.”
Our Revolution is an organization and a grassroots movement inspired by and in support of Sanders’ campaign. Jason Mraz
Last week, singer Jason Mraz went on Instagram to show Sanders his support. He posted artwork of Sanders smiling at a bird with the word “together” in the top left corner.
The “I’m Yours” singer captioned the picture: “Birds of a feather vote together. @berniesanders is my songbird.” James Cromwell
“The Green Mile” actor James Cromwell announced his support for Sanders on Twitter in February by tweeting a simple message: “#BernieSanders2020.”
Justin Long
After supporting Sanders in 2016, actor Justin Long has apparently decided to support the senator again in 2020. Long attended Sanders’ Brooklyn rally in early March and posted a picture of the rally on social media.
“Despite the cold, Brooklyn was really feelin the Bern today… #Bernie2020!!!” he tweeted .
Tim Robbins
“Shawshank Redemption” star Tim Robbins was also a Sanders supporter in 2016 who is continuing to back the senator in his 2020 bid.
He posted a picture of Sanders’ rally in Brooklyn with the tweet: “...and it was 34 degrees. Looks like a movement. #BernieinBrooklyn.” Trending in Politics "
Gutfeld on Chelsea Handler's brave admission about Trump,www.foxnews.com,Greg Gutfeld,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gutfeld-on-chelsea-handlers-brave-admission-about-trump,"Since the Mueller Report said “no collusion,” we&apos;re now seeing the most vehement anti-Trumpers reconsider their own extremism. Take Chelsea Handler .
For two years she viciously attacked the Trump family, their supporters - anyone connected was deemed “evil.”
It wasn’t normal. But she couldn&apos;t see it, until now …
On Bill Maher’s show, she said:
“I had a mid-life identity crisis once Trump won the election because I had never had my world feel so unhinged, I think. I had to pay a psychiatrist to listen to me b---h about Donald Trump for about the first three weeks.
And then once when we got past that and got to the real stuff, I realized the parallel – there was my world becoming unhinged when I was a little girl, my brother died when I was nine years old. I had never related the two, but for me, as I can imagine it must have been for so many people, it was an emotional trigger of everything being destabilized.
And I realized how spoiled and privileged I had been all my life, and realize to be this upset and this on-a-ten every day and the outrage and the anger, i just wanted to f---ing fight people, you know?”
This is good: to be able to step back and see that your reaction is less about the world, and more about the stuff inside you. Even better: these admissions are spreading.
If politics is personal, then life is like a game of Jenga - you pull out politics, and it can all come tumbling down.
Mollie Hemingway points out that even then-U.S. Attorney in New York Preet Bharara (who was fired by Trump) admits he wasn&apos;t ""thinking fully rationally."" His shock over 2016 made him consider secretly recording Trump in those early days.
These confessions aren&apos;t to be mocked, but applauded.
People are finally admitting their behavior was in part never about Trump. It was simply – trauma.
I went through similar stuff.
But stepping back allows one to see that taking politics too personally clouds your thinking. Suddenly everyone is racist! Everyone is sexist! Everyone is colluding!
But for you, this is not a problem. Because the personal isn’t political.
Meaning, politics is just one store in the strip mall of life, so when that store closes - you got other stores to go to.
Family. Hobbies. The outside world.
That&apos;s life.
But if politics is personal, then life is like a game of Jenga - you pull out politics, and it can all come tumbling down.
At least people like Chelsea are putting their lives back together again. Wish them well.

Mexican soap star appears in Miami court over alleged punching death; bail set at $50G,www.foxnews.com,Mariah Haas,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/mexican-soap-star-appears-in-miami-court-over-alleged-punching-death-bail-set-at-50g,"Email
Mexican soap opera star Pablo Lyle appearing in Miami-Dade, Fla., circuit court on Monday. (David Ovalle/Miami Herald via AP) Pablo Lyle , a Mexican soap opera star, appeared in a Florida court on Monday after he allegedly punched a man -- who later died -- during a road rage incident late last month. A judge set Lyle's bail at $50,000 and ordered that the 32-year-old actor be placed on house arrest in Miami. Assistant State Attorney Genevieve Valle had asked for bail to be set at $1 million as her team investigated.
Lyle, a star on the telenovela ""Mi Adorable Maldición,"" was arrested last Monday on a felony battery charge. At the time, he posted $5,000 bond and was allowed to travel back to Mexico. However, the judge set new conditions for Lyle's release after 63-year-old Juan Ricardo Hernandez, the man he allegedly punched, died days later.
MAN, 63, DIES AFTER ALLEGEDLY BEING PUNCHED BY MEXICAN SOAP OPERA STAR DURING ROAD RAGE INCIDENT
""We need to protect the community,"" Valle, who indicated she may charge Lyle with second-degree murder, told the judge. ""The defendant left the victim lying on the street.""
Defense attorneys said Lyle would post bail Monday, leave jail and stay at an undisclosed home in the Miami area wearing an ankle monitor.
As previously reported , Lyle was accused of punching Hernandez, who then fell and suffered a brain injury, according to the Miami Herald . Hernandez was said to be ""unresponsive, intubated"" at the time of Lyle’s arrest, the news outlet reported citing a police report. Hernandez died Thursday night.

The incident occurred on March 31 when Lyle was traveling in a car to the Miami International Airport with his family. The car carrying Lyle allegedly cut off another car on the Dolphin Expressway. The two automobiles stopped at a light and the driver of the car, who was identified as Hernandez, allegedly got out of his vehicle and banged on the window of the other car.
The actor’s brother-in-law, who was not identified, got out of the car to tell Hernandez not to bang on his window but saw the vehicle roll away and ran after it, the Herald reported citing the arrest report. The brother-in-law said that he did not see Lyle punch the victim but that the soap opera star ran into the car and told him to ""drive away.""
Surveillance video of the incident obtained by the Herald showed a man putting up his hands before he was punched. The man was seen falling to the ground after being hit.
In court on Monday, Lyle's attorney, Philip Reizenstein, said his client was the victim of a road rage incident and was trying to protect his family when he allegedly punched Hernandez. Lyle's wife, his two young children and another young child were in the vehicle when the confrontation happened, he said.
""This was about a peaceful man protecting his family. They were assaulted and attacked without warning or provocation,"" Reizenstein told news reporters after the hearing.
An arraignment has been set for May 1.

The watchdog says there were ""discrepancies"" between the total pounds of releases in the Toxics Release Inventory and internal data the EPA provided to the inspector general for the reporting years 2014-2017.

After the first two debates, I will drop out and endorse the most progressive candidate,” he continued.
The 88-year-old progressive launched his campaign with the release of an ad and a draft of his “2020 Platform,” which he posted on Twitter.
“We are proud to present to you Draft 3.2 of the Gravel 2020 Platform. This is the front end - revisions are still being made! Please share any comments or suggestions you have with us via tweet - anything you&apos;d like to see included in the platform,” Gravel’s tweet said, along with a link to a Google Doc .
The 28-page document — which is still being added to, according to a note at the top — covers issues including political reform, foreign policy, poverty, inequality and justice.
Gravel’s official campaign ad was captioned on YouTube : “Welcome to the Gravelanche. Sen. Mike Gravel is running for president - not to win, but to qualify for the debates to push the field to the left on foreign policy and political reform.”
In order to qualify for the first two Democratic debates, Gravel has to raise 65,000 individual donations from people in 20 different U.S. states, according to a statement. As of Monday, Gravel has reportedly had donations from 5,000 individuals, with an average donation of $3.
“All campaign funds that are not spent getting Gravel on stage will be donated to organizations that will help Flint, Michigan get clean water, and to other charities,” a statement from Gravel’s campaign said.
Last week, Gravel announced that he would launch a campaign , a month after college-age fans started boosting the candidate on social media. He has not run for president since 2008 and he hasn’t been a senator since 1981.

We&apos;re always doing everything we can to make sure we protect every American soldier everywhere,” Pompeo told Bret Baier on “Special Report.”
Video “But the fact is, the IRGC has already killed over 600 American soldiers, so you can&apos;t have peace, you can&apos;t have stability, you can&apos;t have security in the Middle East without weakening the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.”
The U.S. declaration may cause retaliation and could make it harder for troops and diplomats to work in the region -- but Pompeo believes the opposite.
“We&apos;re confident this increased pressure will save American lives and create more stability, more peace, more security throughout the Middle East,” Pompeo told Baier.
White House addresses decision to label Iran's Revolutionary Guard a foreign terrorist organization The secretary of state didn&apos;t mince words in his interview, calling Qassem Soleimani, the head of the IRGC&apos;s elite Quds Force, “a terrorist” and saying he and the IRGC would be targeted like any other terrorist organization.
“Qassem Soleimani has the blood of Americans on his hands, Bret, as does the force that he leads, and America is determined each time we find an organization, institution or an individual that has taken the lives of Americans, it is our responsibility. It&apos;s indeed President Trump&apos;s duty,” Pompeo said.
“And, we have made tremendous progress in this administration&apos;s first two years to reduce the risk that any American will be killed by Qassem Soleimani and his merry band of brothers ever again.”

Lori Loughlin’s name missing from list of guilty pleas in admissions scam: What it could mean for the actress,www.foxnews.com,Julius Young,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/lori-loughlins-name-missing-from-list-of-guilty-pleas-in-admissions-scam-what-it-could-mean-for-the-actress,"Will Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman face jail time in the college admission scandal? Criminal defense attorney Jonna Spilbor says you can’t punish a financial crime by having the guilty party pay a fine. Felicity Huffman has agreed to plead guilty in the college admissions cheating scandal that has entangled wealthy parents throughout the country. On Monday, the ""Desperate Housewives"" alum, 56, announced her decision, explaining that she accepts ""full responsibility"" for her actions of allegedly paying $15,000 disguised as a tax-deductible charitable donation so her daughter could take part in an apparently rigged college entrance exam.
However, one name that was noticeably absent from the list of 14 defendants who agreed to enter guilty pleas was fellow actress Lori Loughlin – a risk that may hurt the “Fuller House” star's chances of cutting a favorable deal down the line, according to a former prosecutor.

“Well, the deal for people who pled out today – they got the best deal possible. Again, even though there was the seven to nine [months of possible prison time], the deal is in that zero to six range – which is the lowest you’re going to get,” former New York State prosecutor Adam Citron told Fox News after the plea deals were announced on Monday.
HOT POCKETS HEIRESS AMONG THOSE EMBROILED IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL
“It obviously helps that they’re pleading quickly as not to drag out the case and it shows that they’re accountable for their actions and they’re showing remorse. I’m sure in the pre-trial interviews they present themselves as remorseful and they’re already making statements showing remorse. So these are not stupid people – they know how to act to get the best deal and also play to the court to try and get the most lenient sentence possible.” Video
Loughlin and designer husband Mossimo Giannulli, 55, are accused of agreeing to pay $500,000 in bribes to have their two daughters, 20-year-old Isabella and 19-year-old YouTube star Olivia Jade , designated as recruits for the USC crew team. Neither of their daughters are rowers.
Citron noted that there is a possibility the 54-year-old Loughlin hadn’t yet been offered a deal and indicated that she simply may not be a part of the first round of defendants who cut deals in their cases.

“With Lori Loughlin, it’s unclear and it’s possible that she may have not even been offered anything yet. They could be saying, ‘We’ll do these fifteen people this week and these people next week for interviews – or if they’re holding her to an offering not as beneficial with a higher jail sentence,” Citron explained.

He continued: “If I was her attorney and she was offered something not as advantageous, my recommendation would be to kind of let the dust settle, let these people plea out and have a couple more news cycles where people start to lose attention to the case. So that’s very possible, but it’s unclear whether they’ve offered her anything yet or if they’re just waiting to offer her something when they do the next round of people.” “If I was her attorney, I would not be happy with how she acted.” — Former New York state prosecutor Adam Citron
When the “Beverly Hills: 90210” alum initially appeared in federal court in Los Angeles, a court sketch artist described Loughlin's demeanor as ""a little arrogant."" Additionally, while entering a Massachusetts court to face charges last week, Loughlin signed autographs and posed for selfies with fans – behavior that Citron says doesn’t aid her interests in the eyes of the court.

“The optics look horrible for Lori Loughlin. The court wants to see that you’re taking this seriously, that you’re remorseful, that you’re accountable for your actions and not treating it like it’s a concert. It’s a very serious proceeding with serious charges with a lot of ramifications,” said Citron. “It’s very serious – she should not have been treating this like it was a red carpet affair. She feels unquenchable – she’s not taking this seriously.”
“If I was her attorney, I would not be happy with how she acted.”
Despite Loughlin’s behavior, Citron believes it’s possible the actress could be putting on an about-face as a means of deflecting any anguish she may be facing behind the scenes.

“It’s possible that this is some sort of a defense mechanism and that she’s going home at night and she is very shaken by this, which she should be – and she doesn’t know how to react in such a situation, so her natural defense mechanism is to kind of put on a smile and wave,” the lawyer explained.
“It’s hard to say, but again – it’s going to be a question that I’m sure any pre-sentence interviewer will be asking. [Loughlin] definitely put doubt in the mind of whoever is interviewing her for the pre-sentence report with respect to how truthful she’s being if she does show that she’s remorseful. A judge could very easily at a sentencing hearing ask her that question along the lines of, ‘It appears you’re remorseful today, but how can you account for your actions at the arraignment?’”

Swalwell declared, “None of that is going to change until we get a leader who is willing to go big on the issues we take on, be bold in the solutions we offer, and do good in the way that we govern. I’m ready to solve these problems. I’m running for the president of the United States.”
Swalwell isn’t the first Democrat to make an official announcement on “The Late Show.” New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand revealed to Colbert she was launching an exploratory committee back in January. She has since made her candidacy official.
Rep. Swalwell is the eighteenth candidate who has joined the crowded field of Democrats in the primary.

UCLA speaker compares Che Guevara to Jesus Christ,www.foxnews.com,Elizabeth Llorente,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/faith-values/ucla-speaker-compares-che-guevara-to-jesus-christ,"UCLA Professor Emeritus of Art History David Kunzle, who was invited by the university’s religion department, according to Campus Reform , told the audience at the lecture: “Che Guevara, once the epitome of armed struggle, has evolved to an avatar of justice, peace, and love, as Jesus always was but no longer is exclusively.” The presentation was called: “Chesucristo: The Fusion in Image and Word of Che Guevara and Jesus Christ.”
Kunzle depicted Guevara as “a quasi-divine cosmic force.”
Some of Kunzle’s written works have focused on anti-imperialism.
In his talk at UCLA, Kunzle compared the crucifixion of Jesus – as “leader of an armed guerilla struggle against Rome” – with Guevara’s execution in 1967 in Bolivia.

Kunzle displayed works of art of Guevara wearing a crown of thorns, another of him wearing a halo, and another with the Virgin Mary.
Kunzle has delivered similar talks before at various universities.
Most of the audience expressed admiration for Guevara, who has become a romantic figure for many around the world, to the anger of many others who say he delighted in bloodshed.
Comparisons of Guevara to Christ emerged after his corpse was put on display.
“They said he looked like Christ,” said Susana Osinaga told The Guardian in a 2017 interview. She had helped wash the blood off Guevara&apos;s corpse, the newspaper said. “People today still pray to Saint Ernesto. They say he grants miracles.”
One student at Kunzle&apos;s talk, David Johnson, a third-year student at UCLA, told Campus Reform: “I believe anyone has the right to discuss any opinion they have, that’s why universities exist. But this is offensive on a different level.”
Recently, an editorial in the Yucatan Times said of Guevara: “He personally murdered or gave the order to kill anyone who stood against the new regime, including several of his former comrades in arms, who were not in favor of the communist agenda that they wanted to impose. In a letter to his father Quote: : ‘I have to confess to you, dad, that at that moment I discovered that I really like to kill.’”
Nigel Jones wrote in The Telegraph : “It is a sad reflection of the warped moral mirror of our time that it is Guevara, the squalid killer and totalitarian tyrant, who remains, more than 40 years after his death, the iconic emblem of ignorant idealists the world over.”

No charges for sons of Arizona woman accused of child abuse,www.foxnews.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/no-charges-for-sons-of-arizona-woman-accused-of-child-abuse,"Email MARICOPA, Ariz. – Two brothers arrested in an extreme child abuse case in the Phoenix suburb of Maricopa won't be charged in the case that involved their biological mother, who had a popular YouTube channel featuring kids, authorities said Monday. Pinal County prosecutors declined to elaborate on the decision not to charge 27-year-old Logan Hackney and 25-year-old Ryan Hackney. The two were scheduled to appear in court Monday for a preliminary hearing.
They were arrested March 15 for allegedly failing to report their mother's abusive behavior toward five of her seven adopted children.
Machelle Hobson, 48, has pleaded not guilty to charges she abused some of the adopted children by pepper-spraying them, striking them with a clothes hanger and making them take ice baths.
She remains in custody on a $200,000 bond after entering her plea on 24 counts of child abuse, five counts of kidnapping and one count of aggravated assault. A pre-trial conference is scheduled for May 1.
Hobson is accused of using pepper spray on a child's genitals, applying a lighter or stun gun to a victim's genitals, arm or other body parts, and causing them to suffer malnourishment.
Authorities have previously said Hobson locked up the children in a closet for days without food, water or access to a bathroom.
Hobson's biological daughter, who is an adult, alerted police of the abuse, prompting officers to visit Hobson's home in the city of Maricopa, about 35 miles (56 kilometers) south of Phoenix.
The Arizona Department of Child Safety removed the seven children from Hobson's custody and they're now in foster or group homes.
YouTube has since terminated Hobson's channel, which featured skits about children stealing cookies or a boy with superpowers, after determining the channel violated its guidelines. Trending in US "
CNBC video on tipping slammed as unfair to waiters,www.foxnews.com,Joseph Wulfsohn,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cnbc-video-tipping-slammed-unfair-waiters,"Email
A video on tipping tweeted by CNBC over the weekend sparked controversy. CNBC is receiving plenty of blowback for a video offering advice on how to save money when dining out at restaurants -- by tipping waiters a little less. The network tweeted a video Sunday linked to a February 2018 story. In the video, Zack Guzman -- at the time a multimedia reporter for the network -- offered viewers a “simple tipping trick” that he said could save consumers over $400 a year.
Guzman explained that it’s customary to tip servers 15-20 percent according to the Emily Post Institute, a leading etiquette authority. Still, he posed the question of whether you should tip pre-tax or post-tax, showing a bill for a $100 meal had an additional tax of roughly $8. He referred to tipping pre-tax as a potential “game changer.”
He then suggested to viewers that instead of moving the decimal over from the total and doubling it, which is a common way for diners to calculate the tip, to simply double the tax. Guzman concluded that on his bill, he would save $4 and still tip roughly 18 percent tip, saying that if you dined out twice a week for a year, you could save $416.
The video sparked backlash on social media and was ratio’d on Twitter, meaning it had more responses than likes and retweets.
OCASIO-CORTEZ PROMOTES 'ANTI-CAPITALIST' STREAMING SERVICE
Guzman responded to critics, arguing that calling out hard-working people who tip less than 20 percent is “just as unfair” as under-tipping a server.
“At no point do I argue not tipping a server. At no point do I argue how to tip. At no point do I say tip less than 15 percent,” Guzman said. “Quite frankly, I was just interested in the fact that some people double the tax to arrive at a tip while others move the decimal to calculate 20 percent like me.”
Guzman also said he'd moved on from CNBC to Yahoo! Finance.
CNBC did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment. On Our Radar"

"Clinton, Trump investigations show Democrats' double standard, Grassley says",www.foxnews.com,Samuel Chamberlain,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/clinton-trump-investigations-show-democrats-double-standard-grassley-says,"Grassley: Dems asking for Trump's tax returns is a misuse of congressional oversight Sen. Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa, said Monday that Democrats pushing for the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's full report on the Russia investigation should also insist on making public all information related to the Justice Department's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state and other controversies dating back to the Obama administration. ""The Democrats want all the Mueller information, but seem to be turning a blind eye to other investigations where Congress and the public have yet to see every bit of information that's out there,"" Grassley said on the Senate floor. "" ... That leads me to believe their request for Mueller-related documents is a political ploy.""
Democratic lawmakers have called for the release of the full Mueller report since Attorney General William Barr submitted a four-page letter to Congress last month summarizing the special counsel's ""principal conclusions"" that there was no proof of a criminal conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign and that it was an open question whether Trump had tried to obstruct the Russia investigation. Barr's letter said that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein determined Mueller's evidence was insufficient to support an obstruction allegation.
GIULIANI SLAMS LEAKS FROM MUELLER TEAM ABOUT BARR'S HANDLING OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
Barr has promised to release the full Mueller report, with redactions, by mid-April. House Democrats last week approved subpoenas for Mueller's entire report and any exhibits and other underlying evidence that the Justice Department might withhold.
""The Justice Department Inspector General produced to Congress a highly classified document [in June 2018] relating to the Clinton [email] investigation,"" Grassley said. ""That document makes clear the Justice Department and the FBI still ought to produce information to Congress and answer more questions.""
The report referenced by Grassley concluded, among other points, that then-FBI official Peter Strzok and then-FBI lawyer Lisa Page had ""cast a cloud over the FBI’s handling of the [Clinton] investigation and the investigation’s credibility"" by exchanging messages detailing their dislike for then-candidate Donald Trump. The report also found that Comey and then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch had committed ""error[s] in judgment"" during the investigation, with Comey coming in for particular criticism due to ""insubordinate"" behavior. Video
Grassley also said lawmakers should ""see every piece of evidence, including evidence connected to how the Russia investigation started ... I've requested documents related to [Christopher] Steele, his dossier and campaign-related [Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant] applications ... If Congress is going to review the Mueller report and all underlying information, it should be able to review information relating to how the Russia investigation started. So, will the Democrats join me in that effort and support my request?""
Grassley, a former chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, previously had requested information from the FBI and Justice Department about a variety of topics, including the Clinton email investigation and the FBI raid of a whistleblower who claimed to have documents related to Clinton and the sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to a Russian subsidiary.

""If the Democrats want to be consistent,"" Grassley said, ""they'll have to treat Clinton, Uranium One and Russia-related investigations the same. Anything less than that reeks of political gamesmanship and sets a clear double standard. ...
""If you want to be taken seriously in this country, you have to be consistent,"" Grassley concluded. ""My attitude and approach is straightforward and nonpartisan. Let's see it all. Clinton, Uranium One, Russia. All of it. Let it hang out. Sunshine is the best disinfectant.""

In a letter sent to lawmakers last week, Cohen&apos;s legal team said he was still sorting through documents in his personal files that might be of interest to House Democrats investigating President Trump, including emails, voice recordings, images and other documents on a hard drive.
The letter was sent to a series of Trump opponents, including Schiff and Reps. Jerry Nadler of New York, Maxine Waters of California and Elijah Cummings of Maryland, all Democrats.
Video ""To date, Mr. Cohen has located several documents that we believe have significant value to the various congressional oversight and investigation committees,"" Cohen attorneys, Lanny Davis, Michael Monico and Carly Chocron wrote in the letter.
Despite the decision to remain uninvolved in his sentencing, Schiff told CNN on Monday that he was still open to hearing anything else that Cohen wanted to share.
""We continue to encourage Mr. Cohen to provide us any materials that he has that are relevant to our investigation,"" Schiff said. ""We will continue to do so and hope that he has additional information to offer.""

Israelis vote in election focused on longtime PM Netanyahu,www.foxnews.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israelis-vote-in-election-focused-on-longtime-pm-netanyahu,"Clouded by a series of looming corruption indictments, Netanyahu is seeking a fifth term in office. It would make him Israel&apos;s longest-ever serving leader, surpassing founding father David Ben-Gurion. He faces a stiff challenge from retired military chief Benny Gantz, whose Blue and White party has inched ahead of Netanyahu&apos;s Likud in polls. Netanyahu still appears to have the best chance of forming a coalition, though, with a smattering of small nationalist parties backing him.
Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. with exit polls expected at the end of the voting day at 10 p.m. Some 6.4 million eligible voters will be able to cast their ballots at more than 10,000 stations. Election day in Israel is a national holiday, with turnout expected to be high in good weather.
Official results will begin streaming in early Wednesday, but it may take far longer for a final verdict to be delivered, given the fragmented state of Israeli politics .
As many as a half-dozen parties are teetering along the threshold for entering the Knesset, or parliament. A failure by any of these parties to get the required 3.25 percent of total votes cast could have a dramatic impact on who ultimately forms the next coalition.
The Israeli government needs a parliamentary majority to rule, and since no party has ever earned more than half of the 120 seats in the Knesset, a coalition is required.
Netanyahu and Gantz have ruled out sitting together in government, so the next prime minister&apos;s identity will likely come down to how many supporters each candidate can recruit.
Israel&apos;s president, Reuven Rivlin, could play an important role. Though largely a ceremonial post, the president is responsible for choosing the candidate with the best chance of building a stable coalition government as prime minister.

"Brazil's Bolsonaro has a few wins, some missteps in 100 days",www.foxnews.com,MARCELO SILVA DE SOUSA and MAURICIO SAVARESE,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/brazils-bolsonaro-has-a-few-wins-some-missteps-in-100-days,"So far, the anti-corruption and pro-gun outsider who is frequently compared to U.S. President Donald Trump has scored only a few major victories to keep his far-right base excited. Bolsonaro&apos;s electoral triumph in October sent Brazil&apos;s left to its biggest defeat in almost two decades. But for many, so far Bolsonaro&apos;s administration is heavy on discourse and light on concrete accomplishments.
Bolsonaro has achieved some of his campaign promises: He signed a decree easing restrictions on gun ownership as an anti-crime move, privatized some state-run companies, installed a Cabinet with eight members of the military — more than at any time since the restoration of democracy — and has built strong ties with Trump and Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu while distancing Brazil from Venezuela&apos;s socialist leader, Nicolas Maduro.
He has also begun moves to weaken environmental restrictions on development, as promised.
Still, as he marks off his 100th day in the presidency Wednesday, he has also given critics a lot of material to work with, and corruption suspicions against the president&apos;s family have emerged.
The former army captain has been widely criticized for celebrating the March 31, 1964, coup that launched Brazil&apos;s military regime and for labeling Nazism as a leftist ideology while in Jerusalem. He managed to offend even allies with a pornographic tweet of a Carnival party in response to revelers who had mocked him.
What is widely seen as his most crucial challenge— fixing the country&apos;s costly pension system — remains trapped in Congress with other proposals, including a highly touted revamp of the anti-crime and anti-corruption systems.
During 27 years in Congress, Bolsonaro was noted for inflammatory speeches but presented only two bills that became law.
""This administration is characterized by strong rhetoric that is not necessarily supported by actions in the same direction,"" said Renato Flores, an analyst with the Rio-based Fundacao Getulio Vargas think-tank.
Some once-staunch supporters of the president now worry about the role he gives to his sons Carlos, Eduardo and Flavio. Criticism by Carlos helped prompt the resignation of Bolsonaro&apos;s aide and attorney Gustavo Bebianno. Eduardo alarmed some by tweeting that the president would need only ""one soldier and one corporal"" to deal with the Supreme Court.
Bolsonaro&apos;s Cabinet appears to be divided into four, sometimes fractious factions: the military, with eight out of 22 ministers; evangelical conservatives who control the government&apos;s human rights agenda; a moderate wing overseeing economic and justice ministries, and a cluster of anti-globalist fans of Olavo de Carvalho, a far-right Brazilian writer who lives in the United States, now dominate foreign relations and education.
Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo, said the divisions put Bolsonaro&apos;s administration ""in paralysis from the start.""
""There are too many conflicts. We can&apos;t see a proper plan to grow the economy and Bolsonaro is losing the momentum presidents have in the first six months. Even his pension reform, which led many moderates to believe him, seems at risk of failing or being massively dehydrated by the very Congress he doesn&apos;t talk to,"" Melo said. ""It can all change; he has time. But the signs are not here yet.""
Even lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia, who initially had good relations with Bolsonaro, has complained that the far-right leader is ""playing at being Brazil&apos;s president.""
""Now it is time for us to stop joking around and it is time that he sits on his chair that Congress sits here and we solve Brazil&apos;s problems together,"" Maia said last month.
The public also seems restless. The Datafolha polling institute reported Sunday that Bolsonaro&apos;s approval rating has slipped to 32%, the lowest for any elected first-term Brazilian president, though still far above the single-digit approval rating his predecessor, Michel Temer, had at the end.
Datafolha interviewed 2,086 people April 2-3 and reported a two- percentage point margin of error.
Business leaders and stockbrokers initially welcomed Bolsonaro&apos;s victory, but so far there has been little sign of economic improvement. Unemployment officially is still at 12%, a record 4.9 million Brazilians stopped searching for jobs in March and an initial stock market rally was erased following some of the president&apos;s Twitter-made rifts with allies. The government research institute recently reduced its 2019 economic growth expectations from 2.7% to 2%.
Bolsonaro, who likes to say he is pushing ideology out of Brazil&apos;s foreign affairs, has shifted the country&apos;s alliances toward other leaders who share his conservative tendencies, joining in regional efforts to isolate Venezuela&apos;s Maduro.
He has been hosted in Trump&apos;s White House and in Netanyahu&apos;s Jerusalem, but China, Brazil&apos;s biggest trading partner, has been shunned. Agribusiness leaders fear that approach could harm Brazilian exports to Asia.
Vice President Hamilton Mourao has tried to soften that stance, calling China a partner and meeting with Chinese diplomats.
The man once hailed as an anti-corruption hero by supporters is facing suspicions of familial wrongdoing.
Regulatory authorities said his son Flavio, who is also a senator, received 48 suspicious payments totaling about $25,000 in a single month from his former driver Fabricio Queiroz, who also made a payment to first lady Michelle Bolsonaro of about $5,500. All involved deny any wrongdoing. An investigation is ongoing.
None of those difficulties have alienated Bolsonaro&apos;s hardcore supporters, like 60-year-old hairdresser Roberta Duarte.
""Bolsonaro is doing what he promised. No other president did this in more than 50 years. He is putting the house in order, fighting crime and violence,"" said Duarte, who lives in a violent region in the south of Sao Paulo. ""Violence was so strong that no one could leave at night to watch a movie or eat a pizza. Slowly things are improving.""
Others, like 18-year-old journalism student Lucas Batista, are worried by Bolsonaro&apos;s frequent nods to Brazil&apos;s military dictatorship when his administration comes under criticism.
""He is an authoritarian leader who believes he is the only one capable of solving the country&apos;s problems,"" Batista said. ""I fear Bolsonaro and his followers want to reintroduce a military regime.""

Police won't charge Australian teen or senator over egg spat,www.foxnews.com,TREVOR MARSHALLSEA,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/police-wont-charge-australian-teen-or-senator-over-egg-spat,"Victoria state police said in a statement Tuesday that after reviewing footage and interviewing both participants, they had issued an official caution only to 17-year-old Will Connolly. They said they concluded Sen. Fraser Anning had acted in self-defense when he twice struck the teen afterward. Connolly gained fame as ""Egg Boy"" for egging Anning in Melbourne last month, after the senator controversially blamed the Christchurch mosque massacre on Muslim immigration.
Connolly said in an interview with Ten network&apos;s ""The Project"" that he was disgusted by the senator&apos;s comments but understood his actions were wrong.
""I understand what I did was not the right thing to do. I can understand why some people would react the way they did,"" he said. ""There is no reason to physically attack anyone.""
Police said they were still trying to identify a man who allegedly kicked Connolly while the teen was restrained on the floor by Anning&apos;s supporters.
Anning&apos;s colleagues in Australia&apos;s Parliament passed a censure motion against him last week for divisive comments ""seeking to attribute blame to victims of a horrific crime and to vilify people on the basis of religion, which do not reflect the opinions of the Australian Senate or the Australian people.""
Anning sits as an independent lawmaker and had dismissed the censure motion as an attack on free speech.
Last month he also defended striking Connolly, saying: ""He got a slap across the face, which is what his mother should have given him long ago, because he&apos;s been misbehaving badly.""

Baltimore Orioles $23-million-per-year slugger Chris Davis’ futility at the plate has reached a historic point, as he set the mark for the longest hitless streak by a position player in Monday’s win over the Oakland Athletics . Davis went 0-for-5 with two strikeouts, extending the streak to 49 consecutive at-bats without a hit. He hasn’t had a hit since recording a double against the Chicago White Sox on Sept. 14.
OAKLAND ATHLETICS' KHRIS DAVIS FINISHES SEASON WITH AN ASTOUNDING FEAT
According to ESPN Stats & Info, Los Angeles Dodgers ’ Eugenio Velez was scrubbed from the record books by Davis. He went 47 straight at-bats without a hit from 2010-2011.
Davis’ poor start is especially abysmal considering the amount of money the Orioles owe him. The first baseman, who led the league in home runs in 2013 with 53 and in 2015 with 47, signed a seven-year, $161 million deal with the team prior to the start of the 2017 season.
Since that signing, he’s hitting .185 with 42 home runs with 402 strikeouts. The Orioles still owe him $92 million through the 2022 season. He turns 34 next March.
Orioles manager Brandon Hyde appeared to be encouraged by some of Davis’ at-bats.
“He hit three balls on the nose,” Hyde said. “So I'm taking that as a positive moving forward. Hopefully, it's a good start.”
Hyde, who is in his first season with the Orioles, added that he admired Davis for what he’s going through.
Though it is early in the season, there is a small glimmer of hope for Baltimore. The team is 5-5 to start the season and are tied for second place in the American League East.

Acting appointments help Trump avoid saying 'You're hired',www.foxnews.com,ZEKE MILLER,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/acting-appointments-help-trump-avoid-saying-youre-hired,"President Donald Trump holds up his fist as he finishes his speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual leadership meeting, Saturday April 6, 2019, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) WASHINGTON – As President Donald Trump looks to reshape the executive branch, he's avoiding the words ""You're hired."" Trump's choice of Kevin McAleenan as acting replacement for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen spotlights the president's increasing reliance on a once-obscure federal statute that governs how to fill vacant federal posts. It also raises fresh questions about his reliance on temporary appointments for key security roles. The reality-star president, who once made staff churn into prime-time television, has overseen massive turnover in just two years in office. But he's shown little concern for creating uncertainty about the leadership of some of the country's most important agencies.
Disordered departures have become the rule in the Trump administration, with aides and even Cabinet officials pushed out at a record pace, often with no clear replacement plan in place. And when he does have a plan, Trump has made a habit of taking the creative route, going around in-place deputies to select other officials he believes are more loyal or amenable to his agenda.
Officials with ""acting"" titles abound in key roles, from the secretary of defense to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and even the White House chief of staff. And when Linda McMahon's resignation as Small Business Administrator takes effect later this week, that agency will be led by yet another acting official. Trump has announced his intention to nominate Jovita Carranza, the current treasurer of the United States, for the role.
The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 gives a president wide berth to fill openings across the executive branch and he's used it without restraint to re-jigger the succession plans of the Departments of Justice and Veterans Affairs. But in selecting McAleenan, Trump will have to go even further. The agency's undersecretary of management, Claire Grady, is technically next in line for the job. She will need to resign — or more likely be fired — in order for McAleenan to assume the acting position under the act.
Allowing individuals to fill roles in an acting capacity allows the White House to avoid Senate confirmation battles. Trump has seen several high-profile nominations founder, and others that have become distracting political fights.
""I like acting. It gives me more flexibility. Do you understand that?"" Trump said in January, facing questions about acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan. ""I like acting. So we have a few that are acting. We have a great, great Cabinet.""
But it also serves as a ""run around Congress,"" said the Brookings Institution's Darrell West. ""He's worried that he would not be able to get all of these people through the U.S. Senate, even though Republicans still control the Senate.""
West added: ""It makes the administration look chaotic and not really in control of what it is doing, but Trump seems comfortable with that and he seems willing to live with that reality.""
White House officials acknowledged that the roster of ""actings"" was not ideal, saying Trump's haste to make personnel changes, even without establishing succession plans, reflected his experience in the private sector. Some suggested it marked Trump's wariness to hire the wrong people.
But the president has struggled to attract top-tier talent since even before taking office, in part because he has maintained a loyalty test that has kept away many qualified Republicans who were critical of his candidacy during the presidential campaign.
Shanahan assumed the post in December after Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned over the president's Syria withdrawal plans and Trump has not named a permanent replacement. Mulvaney has been acting in the role since January, after the departure of chief of staff John Kelly.
At the Interior Department, David Bernhardt is serving in an acting capacity while his nomination to fill the role full time is pending before the Senate. The Office of Management and Budget is led by Russell Vought, while Mulvaney is at the White House.
""White House jobs and administration jobs are uber temporary because they're very difficult,"" said Matt Schlapp, a White House ally and chairman of the American Conservative Union. That's especially true for those who work for a Republican and especially Trump, Schlapp added, citing negative press and heightened media scrutiny.
Additional ""actings"" fill posts at the sub-Cabinet level.
Trump last week suddenly rescinded the nomination of acting Immigrations and Customs Enforcement director Ron Vitiello to lead the agency permanently. And the Federal Aviation Administration has been led by an acting administrator, Daniel Elwell, since January 2018. Trump didn't nominate a permanent replacement until last month in the wake of a pair of aviation disasters.
The Senate Judiciary Committee's top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, said at the Homeland Security Department alone at least 10 top positions are filled in an acting capacity.
""The purge of senior leadership at the Department of Homeland Security is unprecedented and a threat to our national security,"" she said.
On Capitol Hill Trump's use of acting officials has drawn scrutiny from within his own party as well, both over concerns that Trump was usurping their authority and that the instability could make the nation less safe.
""I don't know what his rationale is, but it's bound to create more challenges,"" said Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the number two Republican in the chamber. ""They're not subject to Senate confirmation when they're in acting, and I think we need some more certainty, more predictability would be good.""

Opening statements expected in ex-Minneapolis cop's trial,www.foxnews.com,AMY FORLITI,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/opening-statements-expected-in-ex-minneapolis-cops-trial,"Email
Former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor, center, arrives for the first day of jury selection with his attorneys Peter Wold, left, and Thomas Plunkett, at the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis, Minn., on Monday, April 1, 2019. (Renee Jones Schneider/Star Tribune via AP) MINNEAPOLIS – With a jury in place, opening statements were scheduled Tuesday in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed an unarmed woman after she called 911 to report a possible rape in the alley behind her home. Mohamed Noor, 33, who is Somali American, is charged with murder and manslaughter in the July 2017 death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a 40-year-old dual Australian-American citizen who was shot when she approached his squad car.
It took a week to select a jury . After 75 prospective jurors answered questions about their views on Somalis and police officers, as well as their experiences with firearms, on-the-job training and other issues, 12 men and four women were selected Monday to hear the case. In the end, only 12 will deliberate and four will serve as alternates. The jurors include a firefighter and paramedic, an obstetrician-gynecologist, a civil engineer, a grocery store manager, a restaurant host, a carpenter and a Homeland Security immigration officer.
Six jurors are people of color, including two Filipino men, an Ethiopian man and a Pakistani woman.
Damond, who was white, was a life coach and set to be married the month after her death. The night she was shot, she had called 911 twice before Noor and his partner, Officer Matthew Harrity, arrived.
Harrity told investigators he was driving a police SUV when he heard a voice and a thump and caught a glimpse of someone outside his window. Harrity said he was startled and thought his life was in danger. He said he then heard a noise and turned to see that Noor, in the passenger seat, had fired his gun and hit Damond, who was in her pajamas.
Noor refused to talk to investigators. The officers did not turn on their body cameras until after the shooting, and there was no squad car video.
Prosecutors charged Noor with second-degree intentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, saying there is no evidence he faced a threat that justified deadly force. They must prove he acted unreasonably when he shot Damond.
Minnesota law allows police officers to use deadly force to protect themselves or their partners from death or great bodily harm; Noor's attorneys have said they plan to argue he used reasonable force and acted in self-defense.
Noor's attorneys haven't said whether he will testify. If he does, prosecutors may be able to introduce some evidence that the defense wanted to keep out of the state's case, including that he has refused to talk to investigators. They also could bring up a 2015 psychological test that showed Noor disliked being around people and had difficulty confronting others. Despite that test, a psychiatrist found him fit to be a cadet officer.
The shooting, which got international attention, raised questions about Noor's training . The police chief defended Noor's training, but the chief was forced to resign days later. The shooting also led to changes in the department's policy on use of body cameras.

Cousin: Upstate NY burial likely for remains of WWII airman,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/cousin-upstate-ny-burial-likely-for-remains-of-wwii-airman,"Wayne Rogers told The Associated Press on Monday that the family would like to inter the remains of his first cousin, Vincent J. Rogers Jr., in York Corners Cemetery in Willing, New York. Details of the reburial, including the date, are still being worked out with Pentagon officials, Wayne Rogers, of Menifee, California, said.
Vincent Rogers, from Snyder, near Buffalo, was a 21-year-old radio operator when he and six other men were killed on Jan. 21, 1944. The men died when their B-24 bomber crashed after taking off from an airfield on the Pacific atoll of Tarawa, two months after U.S. Marines took the island from the Japanese in a bloody three-day battle.
The plane nicknamed ""Miss Bee Haven"" crashed into a shallow lagoon. Three crewmembers survived. The bodies of the seven killed were buried on Tarawa. Three of the bodies were disinterred after the war and brought back to the U.S. for burial, but information on the whereabouts of the other four crewmembers&apos; remains was lost.
The Pentagon announced last week that Rogers&apos; remains were the last of the missing four to be identified after they were located on Tarawa in 2017 by History Flight, a private group helping the U.S. military recover the remains of American servicemen lost in WWII.
In 2011, Wayne Rogers donated more than 200 of his cousin&apos;s wartime letters to the aviation museum at March Field in Southern California, where Vincent Rogers had trained with his bomber crew. Museum Director Jeff Houlihan used the letters as the basis for a popular exhibit detailing a typical Air Force recruit&apos;s experiences during WWII.
Wayne Rogers said he was just 2 years old when his cousin was killed. He said other relatives who live in New York and Massachusetts plan to attend the reburial.
""I&apos;m glad he&apos;s back,"" Wayne Rogers said. ""It kind of brings the family back together.""

Iranian lawmakers convene with chants of 'Death to America',www.foxnews.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-lawmakers-convene-with-chants-of-death-to-america,"Email
In this picture released by an official website of the office of the Iranian supreme leader, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei speaks at a meeting with a group of Revolutionary Guards and their families, in Tehran, Iran, Tuesday, April 9, 2019. Khamenei praised Iran's Revolutionary Guard and said America's ""evil designs would not harm"" the force after the White House designated the guard a foreign terrorist organization. (Office of the Iranian Supreme Leader via AP) TEHRAN, Iran – Iranian lawmakers dressed in paramilitary uniforms chanted ""Death to America"" as they convened Tuesday for an open session of parliament after the White House designated Iran's Revolutionary Guard a foreign terrorist organization. President Hassan Rouhani declared that the force's popularity would only surge in the wake of the designation, saying guard members would be dearer ""than any other time in the hearts of Iranian nation.""
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei praised the guard and said America's ""evil designs would not harm"" the force.
The move by Washington on Monday was an unprecedented declaration against a foreign government entity — one that could prompt retaliation and make it harder for Americans to work with allies in the region who have contact with members and affiliates of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC.
It marks the first time the United States has designated an entire entity of another government as a terrorist organization, placing a powerful and expansive armed force with vast economic resources that answers only to Iran's supreme leader in the same category as al-Qaida and the Islamic State group.
Iran's rival, Saudi Arabia, welcomed the U.S. decision, describing it as a ""serious and practical step to combat terrorism."" A Foreign Ministry official said the designation ""translates Saudi Arabia's repeated demands for the international community to confront terrorism supported by Iran.""
Within hours of the Trump administration's declaration, Iran's Supreme National Security Council responded by designating the U.S. Central Command, also known as CENTCOM, and all its forces as terrorist, and labeling the U.S. a ""supporter of terrorism.""
In Tehran on Tuesday, many of the lawmakers wore the uniform of the guard in a show of support as they convened for a parliament session marking the National Day of the Revolutionary Guard, which follows the lunar calendar. This year it coincides with the April 9 holiday known as Nuclear Day.
Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani denounced the U.S. decision as the ""climax of stupidity and ignorance."" The Supreme National Security Council's spokesman, Keivan Khosravi, said that going forward, ""any unusual move by American forces in the region will be perceived as the behavior by a terrorist group."" He did not elaborate.
Iranian newspapers carried reports of the U.S. move along with bellicose commentary on their front pages.
The Guard-affiliated Javan daily said any attack on Revolutionary Guard bases and facilities will be ""recognized as a right"" for Iran to respond. The hard-line Kayhan newspaper said it gave Iranians ""permission"" to kill American military personnel.
State-owned IRAN daily went a step further, saying the U.S. move was a ""designation of the entire Iranian nation"" as terrorist.
The pro-reform Shargh daily described it as ""the last card"" of President Donald Trump against Iran. Trump last year pulled America out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and re-imposed sanctions on the country, mainly targeting Iran's vital oil sector.
Marking Nuclear Day, Rouhani unveiled dozens of ""achievements"" in nuclear technology, something he does every year. This time he touted the beginning of an installation of a chain of advanced centrifuges at the uranium enrichment facility in the central town of Natanz as well as an addition at the Fordo underground facility.
He called the Revolutionary Guard a ""devoted"" force that fought militant groups in Iran as well as in Iraq and Syria. The guard has fought Islamic State group's militants, who view Shiites as heretics, in Syria and has assisted Syrian President Bashar Assad's government forces.
The U.S., Rouhani said, is the ""head of global terrorism"" and Trump's sanctions have only inspired Iran to make more strides in new missiles and weapons technology. America will not be able to ""block Iran's progress,"" he said.
Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, met with the Guard on Tuesday, telling them that ""Americans imagine they are designing and making trouble against the guard, in fact against the revolution and Iran, but their evil designs will not harm"" the force.
China urged countries outside of the Mideast to ""promote peace and stability ... and avoid actions that may lead to further escalation of the situation."" Beijing is a close economic partner of Tehran and has sided with Russia and its regional ally Iran in the conflict in Syria.
""We oppose power politics and bullying by any countries,"" China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said when asked about the U.S. designation.
On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the designation of the Revolutionary Guard is intended to increase pressure on Iran, isolating it further and diverting some of the financial resources it uses to fund terrorism and militant activity in the Middle East and beyond.
But, in addition to the potential for Iranian retaliation, it complicates a delicate balance for U.S. personnel in at least two key countries- Iraq and Lebanon. Iraq has prominent Iranian-affiliated Shiite militias and its government has strong ties to Iran. In Lebanon, the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group is in parliament and the government.

(AP Photo/Vincent Thian) KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia – Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has defended Singapore's proposed law to fight ""online falsehoods,"" but his Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohamad warned that anti-fake news laws could be abused by governments to stay in power. The two leaders were speaking after talks Tuesday aimed at resolving territorial disputes that had strained ties since Mahathir's alliance swept to power in elections last May.
Lee said many countries including France, Germany and Australia have legislation to combat fake news.
The bill unveiled last week includes a jail term of up to 10 years and hefty fines. Rights groups have voiced fears it could stifle free speech, but Lee said their objective is ""to continue to do things that will work for Singapore."" Trending in World"

A wet Connecticut baseball field was doused with 24 gallons of gasoline and set on fire Saturday in a bizarre attempt to dry the field for a high school game .
Ridgefield High School&apos;s baseball team was scheduled to play against a rival school at Governor Park that morning, but the grass was too wet to safely play, Ridgefield officials wrote on the town&apos;s Facebook page .
At some point, a “poor decision” was made to “dry the field quicker” by dousing the field with 24 gallons of gasoline and set it on fire, the post read.
Authorities were quickly notified and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s hazmat group responded to the scene, WTNH reported . The game was postponed and there were no reported injuries.
It wasn’t immediately clear who was responsible. Town officials cited by WABC estimated the cost to replace the contaminated soil with fresh soil will be about $50,000.
Captain Shawn Platt told WTNH that authorities have opened “an active investigation of who instructed, if anybody instructed.”
The field is expected to remain closed for several weeks, WABC reported . Ridgefield is located about 40 miles west of New Haven and about 60 miles north of New York City.

Barr to face grilling on Mueller report summary at Capitol Hill hearing,www.foxnews.com,Gregg Re,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-to-face-grilling-on-mueller-report-summary-at-capitol-hill-hearing,"Barr to face grilling on Mueller report summary at Capitol Hill hearing The attorney general is set to make his first appearance before Congress since the release of the Mueller report; Catherine Herridge reports on what to expect at the House budget hearing. Attorney General William Barr is set to testify Tuesday morning on Capitol Hill, in his first appearance before lawmakers since he revealed the long-awaited central findings of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Top Democrats have made it clear that, following multiple media reports citing leaks from those close to Mueller's team, Barr will have some explaining to do.
The hearing -- conducted by the House Appropriations Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee and scheduled to begin at 9:30 a.m. ET -- is expected to include a number of questions on routine budgetary matters. The hearing was scheduled to address Barr's fiscal year 2020 spending request for the Justice Department.
However, Fox News is told Barr's four-page summary of Mueller's conclusions will feature prominently. The subcommittee's chairman, Democrat José Serrano of New York, will cast doubt on Barr's actions in his prepared opening remarks, according to an excerpt released by his office late Monday.
BARR SETS DEADLINE FOR SENDING MUELLER REPORT TO CONGRESS
""In extremely quick fashion, you turned a 300-plus page report into a 4-page letter that supposedly summarized [Mueller's] findings,"" Serrano will say.
Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Serrano indicated that while Barr mainly will face questions concerning appropriations, the Mueller findings would be ""almost impossible"" to ignore during the hearing.
Serrano also said he was worried Barr would send the Mueller report to Congress with ""too many scratch-outs"" and redactions.

Barr's letter to lawmakers, which stated that Mueller found no evidence of Trump-Russian collusion despite efforts by Russians to involve the Trump campaign, also said that Mueller had not exonerated Trump on the issue of obstruction of justice.
Barr and Attorney General Rod Rosenstein cleared the president of criminal culpability on that count as well, noting that Mueller had provided evidence on both sides of the issue and left the determination up to them. In his letter, Barr noted that legally-mandated redactions were in progress before the report itself could be released to lawmakers.
""Last week, the New York Times reported that the Special Counsel’s office had already created summary documents that were ignored in your letter, and that some investigators within the Special Counsel’s office felt that your summary understates the level of malfeasance by the President and several of his campaign and White House advisors,"" Serrano's prepared statement asserts.
WOW: CHELSEA HANDLER SAYS SHE HAS 'FEELINGS' FOR ROBERT MUELLER
""The American people,"" Serrano will say, ""have been left with many unanswered questions; serious concerns about the process by which you formulated your letter; and uncertainty about when we can expect to see the full report.""
Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani hit back against those leaks last week in an interview with Fox News'""MediaBuzz"" with Howard Kurtz.
“That leak really indicates all you need to know about Mueller’s prosecutors,” Giuliani, who favors releasing the Mueller report, said on the Times’ unnamed sources. “Leaking like that…that’s been the biggest canard in this investigation.”

House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey, D-N.Y., will also slam Barr's handling of the report as ""unacceptable,"" according to her prepared remarks.
""I must say, it is extraordinary to evaluate hundreds of pages of evidence, legal documents, and findings based on a 22-month long inquiry and make definitive legal conclusions in less than 48 hours,"" Lowey will say. ""Even for someone who has done this job before, I would argue it is more suspicious than impressive.""
In a statement last week responding to media reports, the DOJ defended Barr's rollout of Mueller's conclusions.
""Given the extraordinary public interest in the matter, the Attorney General decided to release the report's bottom-line findings and his conclusions immediately — without attempting to summarize the report — with the understanding that the report itself would be released after the redaction process,"" the Justice Department statement said.
The statement also said that every page of Mueller's report was marked that it may contain grand jury material ""and therefore could not immediately be released.""
A Justice Department official, speaking Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss a confidential process, said summaries of the findings that Mueller's team included as part of its report also contained grand jury information, making it hard for a swift release.

Comedian Chelsea Handler says she is ‘not embarrassed’ by her sexual attraction to Robert Mueller.
Fox News is told the Tuesday hearing could also focus on the Trump administration's recent decision not to defend ObamaCare in court , as well as solutions to gun violence.
Serrano's opening statement will be followed by remarks from the top Republican on the subcommittee, Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt.
On Monday, Aderholt told Fox News he hopes the hearing will focus primarily on appropriations, and not the Mueller report.

Lowey will also speak prior to Barr's opening statement.
Barr will then present an opening statement. The hearing, which is expected to run approximately until noon, will then toggle between questions posed by Democrats and Republicans.

Turkish electoral board rejects full Istanbul vote recount,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/turkish-electoral-board-rejects-full-istanbul-vote-recount,"Middle East Published 1 hour ago Turkish electoral board rejects full Istanbul vote recount Associated Press Facebook Twitter Flipboard Print Email ANKARA, Turkey – Turkey&apos;s top electoral authority has rejected a request by the ruling party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a full recount of votes in the Istanbul mayoral race.
Recep Ozel, a member of the Supreme Electoral Board, said early Tuesday that the electoral authority has, however, allowed a recount of 51 ballot boxes in the city. The board was still to rule on a demand for a re-run of the vote in one Istanbul district.
Erdogan&apos;s party suffered a major setback in the country&apos;s March 31 local elections. Opposition candidates won in Turkey&apos;s capital, Ankara, and squeezed out Erdogan&apos;s party in Istanbul.
The ruling party has demanded a recount, maintaining that the elections were marred by irregularities. The opposition denounced the claim as a ploy to secure a re-run."
