Canada PM warns of Russian interference in parliamentary polls | 1Click Par | information you can trust,1clickpar.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://1clickpar.com/?p=161243,"Canada PM warns of Russian interference in parliamentary polls Canada PM warns of Russian interference in parliamentary polls admin April 6, 2019
OTTAWA – Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday warned of the danger of interference by Russia in Canadian parliamentary elections scheduled for this fall.
“We’ve seen over the previous variety of years a rise within the interference or the implication of overseas actors in democratic processes,” Trudeau advised a information convention in Toronto.
“We noticed very clearly that nations like Russia are behind a whole lot of the divisive campaigns, a whole lot of the divisive social media, you already know, spreads which have turned our politics much more divisive and extra anger-filled than they've been up to now,” he stated.
“Our minister of democratic establishments, Karina Gould, is shifting ahead on a lot of vital methods to make sure that the election that's arising in six months will likely be determined by Canadians,” he added.“That's what Canadians anticipate.”
The Canadian chief echoed his overseas minister, Chrystia Freeland, who stated that exterior interference within the nation’s upcoming vote was “very doubtless.”
“We're very involved. Our judgment is that interference may be very doubtless and we expect there have in all probability already been efforts by malign overseas actors to disrupt our democracy,” Freeland stated on the sidelines of a G7 assembly in northern France.
“What we're seeing in lots of liberal democracies, the hassle isn't a lot to safe a selected consequence in an election,” she stated. “The hassle is to make our societies extra polarized and make us, as residents of democracies, extra cynical about democracy and that it might work.”
Dealing with such dangers, Ottawa introduced in late January the institution of a particular job power to combat disinformation and overseas meddling within the upcoming polls. "

Democrats lost the presidency to Donald Trump in 2016, partly because the Clinton campaign couldn’t compete in the arena of digital media.
But that was then. Now, it’s a whole new world , and Democratic 2020 candidates have all made using the internet effectively one of their top priorities.
And because of this, having a very competitive Democratic primary will actually help the ultimate nominee destroy Trump in November. This will give Democrats a chance to hone their digital skills against one another.
Speaking to POLITICO , Robby Mook, campaign manager for Clinton in 2016 pointed out how times have changed, saying:
“It’s fantastic we are seeing digital natives and digital experts in the highest ranks. Digital leaders in management roles is now the new normal.”
Mook pointed out that Democratic contenders are giving much more power to their digital directors in an effort to reach more voters.
In a way, they are copying Donald Trump who made his 2016 digital director, Brad Parscale, into his 2020 campaign manager.
What’s really going on is a reaction to the new ways that voters absorb campaign information. Social media is now leading the way, becoming much more important for many voters now than traditional TV or print media.
“President Donald Trump left many in Washington scratching their heads when he put his 2016 campaign’s digital chief in charge of his entire reelection effort,” POLITICO reported, but then pointed out:
“Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Beto O’Rourke are among the White House hopefuls replicating Trump’s approach by giving senior campaign leadership roles to data and social media mavens.”
“It’s a recognition of how central the online space — from raising breathtaking gobs of money via email to winning the minute-by-minute messaging wars on social media — has become to any candidate for the White House.”
According to POLITICO , digital strategists are happy about the change, since they believe they can reach people faster with their messaging. News cycles now often don’t even last for a full day, and many voters check for news updates continually throughout each 24 hour period.
Catherine Algeri, ex-digital director for both the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, explained the situation this way:
“One of the underlying frustrations was, for a long time, feeling that digital wasn’t allowed to sit at the adults’ table.”
But now, they are at the head of the table.
Laura Olin, a Democratic digital strategist who worked on President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection, pointed out the importance of these new developments, saying:
“Now it’s just so clear that if you don’t have a senior leadership team that really understands how to dominate social media and the ways that news travels around the web, you’re just at a huge disadvantage.”
“Campaign vets say the new phenomenon of digital experts running campaigns is, to some extent, simple matriculation: With the internet first applied to politics in the early 2000s, the twenty-somethings who worked those campaigns are reaching campaign-manager age for the first time,”
According to POLITICO :
“Many American voters expect to be able to engage in politics online, and often through their mobile phones, the same way they engage in just about every other facet of their lives.”
Joe Trippi pioneered using the internet as a way to reach voters during Vermont Governor Howard Dean’s presidential run in 2008, and he says he’s glad that Democrats have caught up with the changing times. He said:
“Digital impacts so many different areas of the campaign, whether it’s fundraising, the platform you’re moving your media on, targeting, or organizing your volunteers.“
“And so people who are really proficient at it are actually better prepared to deal with campaign manager and deputy campaign manager jobs.”
The 2020 Democratic field of candidates will be the largest and most diverse in history. Although this creates some logistical and other problems, overall it is probably a good thing.
Bringing younger candidates onto the playing field does not hurt the Democratic Party i n the long run. In fact, to the extent that this moves the party establishment fully into the digital age of the 21st century, it may turn out to be a very good thing.
And this may be the one new strategy that Democrats have that will allow them to totally destroy Donald Trump in the 2020 election , and send him ignominiously into retirement."

Share on Facebook Share on LinkedIn +
The system of international cooperation that emerged from the ashes of World War II is at risk. Multilateralism and the institutions that support it – including the World Trade Organization, the United Nations, and the European Union – are being called into question as more countries embrace inward-looking nationalism, leading in some cases to political instability and even conflict. So why aren’t business and finance leaders doing much more to combat these troubling trends?
Postwar history shows that global economic integration – including freer trade and higher cross-border investment – helps markets and societies to prosper, with health, education, and life expectancy improving significantly in many parts of the world. True, globalisation has also produced major societal imbalances, which are fueling popular discontent. But rejecting it, as a growing number now do, threatens the very system that has helped to create wealth, combat poverty, and expand the ranks of the global middle class.
Business and finance have arguably benefited the most from the open, rules-based international political and economic order. Yet CEOs and chairpersons rarely use their influential voices to defend multilateralism and global cooperation.
This is partly because most private enterprises still focus on bread-and-butter lobbying, often via trade associations, in connection with national regulations and policies. Similarly, corporate boards tend to deal with basic governance and risk-management issues and seldom address broader geopolitical concerns – and when they do, directors are often unsure of how to make a meaningful contribution.
But in the face of increasing global disorder, business and finance leaders can no longer afford to be reticent. Instead, they should do three things to make a strong, renewed case for international cooperation.
For starters, they need to rediscover and recommit to the core values and principles of key multilateral organizations, principally the WTO and the UN. These organisations embody the belief that, more often than not, countries will achieve better long-term outcomes by acting together than by going it alone. In this regard, UN Secretary-General António Guterres recently made a persuasive case for a “ networked multilateralism ” that connects bodies like his with important regional organizations and initiatives.
Second, corporate chiefs should formally endorse important multilateral private-sector initiatives. The thousands of companies and investors that have signed the UN Global Compact and the Principles for Responsible Investment, for example, are still in the minority. Many more must step up and sign on. Other important private-sector programs with a multilateral origin or orientation include the banking sector’s Equator Principles (originally from the World Bank) and the OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises .
These and other similar initiatives help in two ways. Many of them – including the UN Global Compact – involve multi-stakeholder collaboration. In other words, they bring together the private and public sectors, civil society, and other actors to address critical international issues such as the rule of law, global governance, and climate change.
In addition, global policymakers frequently respond to these initiatives and coalitions by creating new possibilities for cooperation. The UN, for example, recently launched an exercise in multilateralism with a financial twist: an annual investment forum designed to promote collaboration and deal-making between governments and institutional investors.
Finally, business and finance leaders should triple down on the new global sustainability agenda. This is arguably the best hedge against current threats, challenges, and insecurities, and presents extraordinary opportunities to make a positive global impact.
The 17 Sustainable Development Goals and their associated targets are a blueprint for humanity, and, we would add, for the global economy. Achieving the SDGs would make globalization more sustainable and inclusive, while also effectively addressing the threat of climate change.
Private-sector organizations need to integrate the SDGs into their business and investment strategies, and not only for altruistic reasons. The Business and Sustainable Development Commission previously estimated that companies and investors could unlock at least $12 trillion in market opportunities by 2030 and create up to 380 million jobs by pursuing just a few key SDGs.
And at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos in January, the UN Global Compact and PIMCO jointly urged companies, investors, and governments around the world to make the SDGs a high priority and explore ways of financing progress toward them, including through new instruments such as “SDG bonds.”
Global cooperation is crucial for our common security and economic success, but it is under threat. By publicly supporting multilateralism, business and finance leaders can help to shape a more prosperous and sustainable future – for their organisations and the world. Share on Facebook"

France will surpass the 3% Deficit ceiling set by the Fiscal Compact, following updated growth and revenue forecasts, the Finance Ministry said. President Emmanuel Macron ’s government has decided to make a one-off payroll tax credit scheme a permanent tax cut. Moreover, Macron has to fund a €10 billion package of measures aimed at boosting working class income and purchasing power. The French government initially projected a 3.2% deficit, revised downwards to 3.1% after better-than-expected growth in the last quarter of 2018. This led to growth projections of 1.7%. The French government has now downwardly revised its 2019 growth projection to 1.4%, from 1.6% in 2018, with Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire admitting that the global slowdown is weighing on the outlook.

Director/actor Rob Reiner has been at the forefront of the Hollywood chapter of the anti-Trump Resistance since well before the 2016 election. For the most part, much of Reiner’s focus has been on his certainty that Trump colluded with Russia to “steal” the election. Since it doesn’t look like the Mueller report is going to deliver the goods on that front, a new element is being added to the mix: Trump’s taxes: Our Founding Fathers created a document to protect us against a king. They never could have anticipated anyone as self dealing and corrupt as Trump. We are being tested. We need to see his taxes. We need to see the Report. We need to know if America is in the hands of a mad king.

BOZELL: Trying To Unplug 'Unplanned' | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,L. Brent Bozell Iii,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45629/bozell-trying-unplug-unplanned-l-brent-bozell-iii,"April 6, 2019 views
The conversion of Abby Johnson — from one of the youngest Planned Parenthood clinic directors in America to pro-life leader — sounds like the kind story line that would never make its way into the movie theater. But it has. ""Unplanned"" debuted in 1,059 theaters on March 29 and grossed $6.1 million on its opening weekend, double the commercial expectations. It received an A-plus CinemaScore from audiences. It has been expanded to 1,700 sites and is captivating millions with its heart-wrenching portrayal of the reality of abortion and the organization that champions the atrocity.
Johnson estimates she was personally responsible for overseeing 22,000 abortions at her clinic in Bryan, Texas, during her Planned Parenthood career. She had two of her own. This is her story, necessarily rated R because of its honest depiction of what transpires inside the Planned Parenthood clinic. The opening scene depicts the moment of conversion. Abby, who serves in a management capacity, is asked to assist with an ultrasound abortion of a 13-week-old baby. She watches — and the viewer watches very real footage — as the unborn baby resists, moving desperately to avoid the suction tube. It swooshes into the cylinder of death, exiting into a bucket with blood and pieces of human tissue. The womb is now empty. Abby Johnson falls apart.
We go to the start of the story, with her two abortions, her unlikely marriage into a strongly pro-life family and her rise of the ranks of her local Planned Parenthood outlet. She knows she has made it when director Cheryl ceremoniously invites her to come into the ""P.O.C"" room — the clinic's sanctum sanctorum, open only to the chosen few. When a nurse asks if Abby knows what ""P.O.C."" stands for, she offers the euphemism ""products of conception."" Her colleague sardonically provides the correct answer: ""pieces of children."" Abby and Cheryl approach the table containing the body parts of countless babies. Little feet. Little hands. Little heads. The parts of every aborted child must be accounted for so they can be sure nothing is left inside the womb.
Unsurprisingly, ""Unplanned"" has received the same opprobrium from the cultural elites as last year's pro-life movie ""Gosnell."" A half dozen major music labels refused to license their tunes for the movie, including Disney, Universal Music and Sony/ATV. Cable TV networks refused to run ads for the movie — USA, Lifetime, HGTV, the Travel Channel, the Cooking Channel, the Food Network ... even the Hallmark Channel!
The movie was trashed on TBS. Unfunny radical feminist Samantha Bee bizarrely claimed the movie was ""mostly made up"" and mocked it for suggesting that taking on the nation's largest and most powerful abortion conglomerate is scary.
Bee tried to suggest that Johnson couldn't possibly turn her heroes into monsters: ""No matter where you go, no matter where you hide, I will give you health care!"" Ripping babies apart is ""health care.""
Even social media giants were hostile. On the opening weekend, the movie's Twitter account was suspended for a time, which Twitter claimed was a mistake, as if anyone believes that line any longer. Then fans of the movie couldn't successfully follow the account. Twitter has a nasty habit of blocking pro-life material as ""inflammatory.""
Newspapers refused to review the movie. The New York Times reviewed 12 new movies on debut day, but not ""Unplanned."" This included a review of ""Diane"" (released in only three theaters nationwide), a liberal documentary on former Trump strategist Steve Bannon called ""The Brink"" (in four theaters) and the French Canadian teen comedy ""Slut in a Good Way"" (in seven theaters).
The Washington Post had no review from its own critics in the ""Weekend"" section but directed readers to its Common Sense Media page for parents, where those outside critics said the film was inappropriate for children under 17. This camp thinks abortion is appropriate for teenage girls but a movie about abortion is not.
Maybe this near silence is for the best, since one of the few film reviewers, Frank Scheck of the Hollywood Reporter, thought he was being witty when he explained, ""There have been films that treated Nazi doctors conducting evil experiments in concentration camps more sympathetically.""
Scheck somehow can't absorb the fact that there is evil in Planned Parenthood, that it is a big business making a profit from exterminating more than 300,000 unborn babies a year.
Abby Johnson came to understand it and devoted her life to fighting the horror of abortion from that moment forward.
Her babies are in paradise, dancing with delight.

WILLIAMS, PH.D. 6 Apr 2019 The highest-ranking African cardinal said this week that the Church risks becoming just another NGO if it focuses on “horizontal” issues like immigration and ecology rather than preaching Jesus Christ. Some Catholic leaders urge the Church “not to speak about God, but to throw itself body and soul into social problems: migration, ecology, dialogue, the culture of encounter, the struggle against poverty, for justice and peace,” said Guinean Cardinal Robert Sarah in an interview this week with La Nef.
While all of these problems are, of course, important, “a Church such as this is of interest to no one,” said Sarah, who heads up the Vatican’s liturgical office.
“The Church is only of interest because she allows us to encounter Jesus,” he continued. “She is only legitimate because she passes on Revelation to us. When the Church becomes overburdened with human structures, it obstructs the light of God shining out in her and through her.”
While never mentioning Pope Francis by name, a number of observers on social media were quick to take the cardinal’s words as an indictment of Francis, who devotes enormous attention to the social problems Sarah highlighted.
“The crisis of the Church is above all a crisis of the faith. Some want the Church to be a human and horizontal society; they want it to speak the language of the media. They want to make it popular,” the cardinal said in his interview.
“We are tempted to think that our action and our ideas will save the Church. It would be better to begin by letting her save herself,” he said.
Sarah further suggests that the world is under assault from a “virulent atheism” that affects everyone, including those in the Church.
“It permeates everything, even our ecclesiastical discourse. It consists in allowing radically pagan and worldly modes of thinking or living to coexist side by side with faith,” he said. “And we are quite content with this unnatural cohabitation! This shows that our faith has become diluted and inconsistent!”
“The first reform we need is in our hearts. We must no longer compromise with lies. The Faith is both the treasure we have to defend and the power that will permit us to defend it,” he said.

Boeing to cut 737 Max production in wake of two deadly crashes,thehill.com,taxelrod@thehill.com (Tal Axelrod),04-06-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/transportation/aviation/437689-boeing-to-cut-737-max-production-in-wake-of-two-deadly-crashes,"Boeing to cut 737 Max production in wake of two deadly crashes By Tal Axelrod - 04/06/19 09:56 AM EDT
Boeing is cutting back production of its 737 Max aircraft as the company continues to face intense scrutiny in the wake of two deadly crashes.
The company announced Friday it will slow its production rate from 52 airplanes per month to 42 starting in mid-April but did not give a time frame on when the cutback would end.
""We have the responsibility to eliminate this risk, and we know how to do it. As part of this effort, we're making progress on the 737 MAX software update that will prevent accidents like these from ever happening again,"" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement Friday.
Boeing said it would not cut jobs amid the slowdown and that its board will establish a committee to review how the company designs and develops airplanes.
""Safety is our responsibility, and we own it. When the MAX returns to the skies, we've promised our airline customers and their passengers and crews that it will be as safe as any airplane ever to fly,"" Muilenburg said. The moves comes one day after a preliminary report on the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash involving a 737 Max revealed that the pilots followed the aircraft manufacturer's procedures but were ultimately unable to control the plane before it crashed, killing all 157 people on board. For weeks, Boeing 737 Max jets have been grounded in the U.S. and other major countries as a cautionary measure. The Federal Aviation Administration said earlier this week that Boeing needs more time to propose a software fix to the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) and that the proposal is expected in the coming weeks. Ethiopian investigators concluded in their preliminary report that the aircraft’s MCAS, which can make the plane swiftly nose-dive in certain dangerous situations, was activated in the final minutes of the Ethiopian flight. They also concluded that external sensors fed the plane’s flight control system incorrect data. Muilenburg on Thursday posted a video saying that ""erroneous"" data contributed to the March Boeing 737 Max 8 plane crash as well as October's Lion Air crash in Indonesia."

Can't defend your city from marauders because they are not the same stock as you. Can't criticize because it has to be based on deep racist feelings, not the persons in questions actions.
I know somewhere there are people studying this, and charting the reaction time, and the % of population before a area becomes uninhabitable to any but muslambs. How long till white flight takes place in surrounding areas. How long before the garbage just never gets picked up, and how long before brand new social housing becomes dilapidated and condemned.
How many viewers maher lost by condoning and endorsing pedophilia by a ex VP, how many women logged on to that cow lina dunahams twitter to see her pictures of her self at ""the most she has ever weighed""
This is just a big experiment to someone very evil."

The Croatian frontier police are quite good, but there are not enough of them. Before the onset of winter last year, the migrant trafficking organizations were trying to find ways around the reinforced border in the Bihac region(USK), which is very difficult terrain and where transit is complicated by minefields from the 1990s conflict. Some were trying the coastal route favored by drug traffickers, while others were trying to move around the Bosnia-Croatia border by going into Serbia and then into Croatia. The Serbs and Croats seem to have been cooperating to counter that. But you make an excellent point, namely that the border is a major problem involving a thousand miles of protection and monitoring. One nation can't do it all, and the problem is complicated by EU interference, pro-migrant NGOs, organized crime, extremist politics (often allies with organized crime), and a lot else below the surface."
