As there is absolutely no legitimate evidence whatsoever that will substantiate that pure utter nonsense.
As Muslim stealth jihadists, i.e., enemy Muslim invaders and conquerors, posing as being so-called migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees migrating to the West to wage stealth demographic jihad never ever assimilate and integrate. As that would constitute apostasy and be an automatic death sentence for them. So instead, they settle into Muslim no-go zones ruled by Sharia that in effect are really tiny independent Islamic Sharia Statelets residing within the larger host non-Muslim unbeliever societies as ticking time bombs.
In fact, the government of France, a few years ago, counted in excess of 700 Muslim no-go zones in France alone and they are almost as prevalent throughout the EU and the UK and are also rapidly forming throughout the USA and Canada today as well.
Hence, saying that Muslim stealth jihadists, i.e., enemy Muslim invaders and conquerors, are migrants is out and out intentional deception, and the people responsible for it should all be held to account and locked up behind bars for the remainder of their damn lives."

Clashes Between Greek Police and Migrants Trying to Force the Border,www.breitbart.com,LuciusAnnaeusSeneca,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/04/06/third-day-clashes-between-greek-police-migrants-trying-to-force-border/#post-100,"Croatia, Hungary, and perhaps Slovenia and Serbia all seem to understand the basic reality you explained in your comment. That is why there is a lot of cooperation among these and other countries. The Croats, considering their limited resources, have been doing yeoman labor in keeping the migrant hordes in the Bihac region on the Bosnian side of the border. They kept the would-be illegals bottled up nicely in northwest Bosnia all last year.
But now the migrants, or, rather, the organized criminal networks that move them, have been trying to move around the Bosnia-Croatia border in the USK, and are looking at a coastal route as well as a route through Serbia. Let's hope the security forces in the region are agile enough to block all this. But there are hundreds of thousands in Turkey that still want to try their luck at getting into the EU. And Erdogan has no qualms about using them as his nuclear option."

Opry Entertainment Launches New Video Series 'The Write Stuff',tennesseestar.com,Bethany Bowman,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://tennesseestar.com/2019/04/06/opry-entertainment-launches-new-video-series-the-write-stuff/ ,"4 Opry Entertainment Group is set to launch their newest series “The Write Stuff.” Mixing exclusive Opry performances from the stars themselves with intimate commentary from the songwriters that first gave the songs life, “The Write Stuff” introduces viewers to the often-incredible backstories of some of country music’s biggest hits. The series creates an environment where the writers forget the cameras are there and viewers witness creative relationships come to life offering a unique and rare peek behind the curtain to relive the actual writing of the song.
In the coming weeks, eye-opening episodes of “The Write Stuff” will take deep dives into a number of songs including Little Big Town’s groundbreaking hit “Girl Crush.”
“We just didn’t think it was a song someone would cut,” recalls “Girl Crush” co-writer Lori McKenna in an upcoming episode. “It just seemed like such a personal thing. We didn’t even know if it made sense. It made sense to us because we were all there when it happened but we didn’t know if someone else coming in for the first time would get it right away.”
Produced in house by Opry Entertainment Group, the new video series will focus in on the inspirations, the lyrics and the challenges of writing songs that would eventually turn into hits for stars such as Hunter Hayes, RaeLynn and Lee Brice.
“From the Grand Ole Opry stage to our backstage dressing rooms, we have been fortunate to hear firsthand so many moving stories behind these songs,” shares Sally Williams, SVP of Programming & Artist Relations for OpryEntertainment and General Manager of the Grand Ole Opry. “It is with those moments in mind that ‘The Write Stuff’ was created as part of our continued efforts to preserve the heritage and origins of these great contributions to American music.”
“We wrote ‘Boy’ because I was pregnant,” recalls songwriter Nicolle Galyon of Brice’s 2017 hit. “I was 39 weeks pregnant and it was my last day to write. This song was really more of a stream of consciousness. We literally wrote it from first line to last line.”
And in true Opry tradition, a handful of “The Write Stuff” episodes will also take a closer look into the stars and the hits of the future from artists such as Tenille Townes, Ryan Kinder and Travis Denning.

WATCH: Fox News Hosts Bash Veterans for Accessing Their Benefits | HillReporter.com,hillreporter.com,Todd Neikirk,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://hillreporter.com/watch-fox-news-hosts-bash-veterans-for-accessing-their-benefits-29973,"BY Todd Neikirk April 6, 2019
21st century conservatives have made support for the military one of the most important ideals of their platform. Donald Trump Jr. even criticized congresswomen for not wearing flag pins during the State of the Union. Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images
This background makes it seems strange that Fox News would criticized those who have served their country. But hosts Brian Kilmeade and Pete Hegseth did just that, slamming veterans who utilize their VA benefits.
Hegseth had particular vitriol for those who he didn’t consider injured enough to receive maximum benefits. The host said , “Because it’s proportional for different injuries that you have. Groups out there — vets groups, mostly — encourage vets to apply for every government benefit they can ever get after they leave the service.”
When asked why they shouldn’t do so, Hegseth responded, “I don’t want to be dependent if I don’t have to be.” His co-host, Brian Kilmeade, agreed, “You got to have integrity. You got to have personal integrity.”
Hegseth closed the segment by blaming charities for encouraging vets to access their benefits. He claimed , “Well and right now a lot of groups are convincing vets to give — get, take more from the system as opposed to just what you need for the service you gave.”

Former Auburn University head football coach Tommy Tuberville is running for Senate in Alabama as a Republican, he announced Saturday.
“After more than a year of listening to Alabama’s citizens, I have heard your concerns and hopes for a better tomorrow,"" Tuberville wrote in a tweet and a statement on a campaign website. ""I am humbled to announce the next step — I will be a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate.""
Tuberville is joining the race to run against Democratic Sen. Doug Jones, who won a special election in 2017 and is running for a full term next year. Republican Rep. Bradley Byrne is already in the race, and several other Republicans are considering jumping into the primary to challenge Jones, who is viewed as the most vulnerable Democrat on the ballot next year.
Sean Spicer, President Donald Trump’s former White House communications director, is expected to assist with the campaign, according to sources familiar with the budding operation, though a formal role hasn’t been determined yet. Spicer tweeted that Tuberville’s entance would make the race a GOP ""pickup.""
Tuberville, 64, coached football for 21 seasons, including 10 for Auburn. He also coached at Texas Tech University and the University of Cincinnati, where he finished his career in 2016 with a 4-8 record.
His 85-40 record at Auburn includes a 13-0 season in 2004, though the Tigers were passed over by the Bowl Championship Series and were not invited to play in the national championship game. Tuberville resigned from Auburn following the 2008 season, in which the Tigers recorded only their second losing season in his decade-long tenure.
The announcement came just hours before Auburn’s men’s basketball team was set to play in the Final Four in Minneapolis.

Trump lashes out at Mueller probe as release of report approaches,seriouslypolitics.com,Gabby Orr,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/06/11/50/04/trump-lashes-out-at-mueller-probe-as-release-of-report-approaches/,"This post is by Gabby Orr from Politics, Policy, Political News Top Stories
Click here to view on the original site: Original Post
President Donald Trump took to Twitter Saturday to attack the latest barrage of investigations and subpoena threats from his political opponents on Capitol Hill.
In his Saturday tweets, the president repeated claims that the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller was run by “13 Angry Trump hating Dems” who found no wrongdoing on his behalf after spending “$30 million” over the course of the investigation. He added that the 22-month long probe was a “total waste of time.”
His tweets come amid reports that some members of the special counsel’s team have been frustrated by the way U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr cast their findings in the summary he submitted to Congress late last month.
This week, the House Judiciary, Intelligence and Oversight committees have all ramped up probes into different aspects of Trump’s financial history, policy agenda and campaign, and Trump was hit Thursday with a formal from Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) for his individual tax returns dating back to 2013.
The oversight escalation on Capitol Hill comes as Democrats continue to demand an unredacted copy of Mueller’s approximately 400-page report, which was provided to Attorney General Bill Barr more than two weeks ago. That request shows congressional Democrats “will never be satisfied,” Trump stated Saturday.
But as Barr’s self-imposed deadline to submit a copy of Mueller’s report to Capitol Hill fast approaches, Trump’s confidence in its “complete and total exoneration” of him has waned, according to one Republican close to the White House.
“He wouldn’t be bringing this up still if everything was hunky dory,” this person said, referring to the president’s tweets about Mueller and his team of federal investigators.
White House officials, Trump campaign aides and Republican lawmakers have all cited Barr’s four-page summary of the special counsel’s conclusions as an exoneration of Trump, who was cleared of conspiracy with Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election and did not face obstruction of justice charges due to insufficient evidence, according to Barr.
“I have not read the Mueller Report yet… Only know the conclusions, and on the big one, No Collusion,” Trump wrote on Twitter, hours before he was set to address a crowd of supporters and deep-pocketed GOP donors at the annual Republican Jewish Coalition summit in Las Vegas.
In separate reports late Wednesday, both The New York Times and The Washington Post described a band of investigators who believed the results of their probe into the president and his associates were far more damaging than Trump’s attorney general made them out to be. The same individuals have reportedly become worried that public opinion is being formed around an incomplete description of what they found, according to the Times.
Trump slammed the Times’ reporting as “fake news” in a tweet on Friday, shortly before departing Washington for a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border to highlight a newly renovated section of the current barrier that exists.
“The New York Times had no legitimate sources, which would be totally illegal, concerning the Mueller Report. In fact, they probably had no sources at all!” he wrote on Twitter.
A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about the president’s tweets on Saturday, though a second official indicated that Trump was likely to broach the topic during his remarks in Las Vegas.

Trump administration wants 2 years to ID migrant children separated from families,seriouslypolitics.com,(Associated Press),04-06-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/06/11/44/17/trump-administration-wants-2-years-to-id-migrant-children-separated-from-families/,"This post is by (Associated Press) from Politics, Policy, Political News Top Stories
Click here to view on the original site: Original Post
The Trump administration wants up to two years to find potentially thousands of children who were separated from their families at the border before a judge halted the practice last year, a task that it says is more laborious than previous efforts because the children are no longer in government custody.
The Justice Department said in a court filing late Friday that it will take at least a year to review about 47,000 cases of unaccompanied children taken into government custody between July 1, 2017 and June 25, 2018 — the day before U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw halted the general practice of splitting families. The administration would begin by sifting through names for traits most likely to signal separation — for example, children under 5.
The administration would provide information on separated families on a rolling basis to the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued to reunite families criticized the proposed timeline on Saturday.
“We strongly oppose a plan that could take up to two years to locate these families,” said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU’s lead attorney. “The government needs to make this a priority.”
Sabraw ordered last year that more than 2,700 children in government care on June 26, 2018 be reunited with their families, which has largely been accomplished. Then, in January, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department’s internal watchdog reported that thousands more children may have been separated since the summer of 2017. The department’s inspector general said the precise number was unknown.
The judge ruled last month that he could hold the government accountable for families that were separated before his June order and asked the government submit a proposal for the next steps. A hearing is scheduled April 16.
Sheer volume makes the job different than identifying children who were in custody at the time of the judge’s June order, Jonathan White, a commander of the U.S. Public Health Service and Health and Human Services’ point person on family reunification, said in an affidavit.
White, whose work has drawn strong praise from the judge, would lead the effort to identify additional families on behalf of Health and Health and Human Services with counterparts at Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs and Enforcement. Dr. Barry Graubard, a statistics expert at the National Cancer Institute, developed a system to flag for early attention those most likely to have been separated.
The vast majority of separated children are released to relatives, but many are not parents. Of children released in the 2017 fiscal year, 49 percent went to parents, 41 percent to close relatives such as an aunt, uncle, grandparent or adult sibling and 10 percent to distant relatives, family friends and others.
The government’s proposed model to flag still-separated children puts a higher priority on the roughly half who were not released to a parent. Other signs of likely separation include children under 5, younger children traveling without a sibling and those who were detained in the Border Patrol’s El Paso, Texas, sector, where the administration ran a trial program that involved separating nearly 300 family members from July to November 2017.
Saturday marks the anniversary of the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy to criminally prosecute every adult who enters the country illegally from Mexico. The administration retreated in June amid an international uproar by generally exempting adults who come with their children. The policy now applies only to single adults.

Former Sen. Ernest Hollings of South Carolina dead at 97,seriouslypolitics.com,(Associated Press),04-06-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/06/06/44/11/former-sen-ernest-hollings-of-south-carolina-dead-at-97/,"This post is by (Associated Press) from Politics, Policy, Political News Top Stories

Ernest F. ""Fritz"" Hollings, the silver-haired Democrat who helped shepherd South Carolina through desegregation as governor and went on to serve six terms in the U.S. Senate, has died. He was 97.
Family spokesman Andy Brack, who also served at times for Hollins as spokesman during his Senate career, said Hollins died early Saturday.
Hollings, whose long and colorful political career included an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, retired from the Senate in 2005, one of the last of the larger-than-life Democrats who once dominated politics in the South.
He had served 38 years and two months, making him the eighth longest-serving senator in U.S. history.
Nevertheless, Hollings remained the junior senator from South Carolina for most of his term. The senior senator was Strom Thurmond, first elected in 1954. He retired in January 2003 at age 100 as the longest-serving senator in history.
In his Senate speech in 2004, Hollings lamented that lawmakers came to spend much of their time raising money for the next election, calling money ""the main culprit, the cancer on the body politic.""
""We don’t have time for each other, we don’t have time for constituents except for the givers. … We’re in real, real trouble.""
Hollings was a sharp-tongued orator whose rhetorical flourishes in the deep accent of his home state enlivened many a Washington debate, but his influence in Washington never reached the levels he hoped.
He sometimes blamed that failure on his background, rising to power as he did in the South in the 1950s as the region bubbled with anger over segregation.
However, South Carolina largely avoided the racial violence that afflicted some other Deep South states during the turbulent 1960s.
Hollings campaigned against desegregation when running for governor in 1958. He built a national reputation as a moderate when, in his farewell address as governor, he pleaded with the legislature to peacefully accept integration of public schools and the admission of the first black student to Clemson University.
""This General Assembly must make clear South Carolina’s choice, a government of laws rather than a government of men,"" he told lawmakers. Shortly afterward, Clemson was peacefully integrated.
In his 2008 autobiography, ""Making Government Work,"" Hollings wrote that in the 1950s ""no issue dominated South Carolina more than race"" and that he worked for a balanced approach.
""I was ‘Mister-In-Between. The governor had to appear to be in charge; yet the realities were not on his side,"" he wrote. ""I returned to my basic precept … the safety of the people is the supreme law. I was determined to keep the peace and avoid bloodshed.""
In the Senate, Hollings gained a reputation as a skilled insider with keen intellectual powers. He chaired the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and held seats on the Appropriations and Budget committees.
But his sharp tongue and sharper wit sometimes got him in trouble. He once called Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the ""senator from the B’nai B’rith"" and in 1983 referred to the presidential campaign supporters of former Sen. Alan Cranston, D-California, as ""wetbacks.""
Hollings began his quest for the presidency in April 1983 but dropped out the following March after dismal showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Early in his Senate career, he built a record as a hawk and lobbied hard for military dollars for South Carolina, one of the poorest states in the union.
Hollings originally supported American involvement in Vietnam, but his views changed over the years as it became clear there would be no American victory.
Hollings, who made three trips to the war zone, said he learned a lesson there.
""It’s a mistake to try to build and destroy a nation at the same time,"" he wrote in his autobiography, warning that America is now ""repeating the same wrongheaded strategy in Iraq.""
Despite his changed views, Hollings remained a strong supporter of national defense which he saw as the main business of government.
In 1969 he drew national attention when he exposed hunger in his own state by touring several cities, helping lay the groundwork for the Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, feeding program.
A year later, his views drew wider currency with the publication of his first book ""The Case Against Hunger.""
In 1982, Hollings proposed an across-the-board federal spending freeze to cut the deficit, a proposal that was a cornerstone of his failed presidential bid.
He helped create the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and write the National Coastal Zone Management Act. Hollings also attached his name to the Gramm-Rudman bill aimed at balancing the federal budget.
Hollings angered many of his constituents in 1991 when he opposed the congressional resolution authorizing President George Bush to use force against Iraq.
In his later years, port security was one of his main concerns.
As he prepared to leave office, he told The Associated Press: ""People ask you your legacy or your most embarrassing moment. I never, ever lived that way. … I’m not trying to get remembered.""
He kept busy after the Senate helping the Medical University of South Carolina raise money for the cancer center which bears his name and lecturing at the new Charleston School of Law.
Hollings’ one political defeat came in 1962 when he lost in a primary to Sen. Olin Johnston. After Johnston died, Hollings won a special election in 1966 and went to the Senate at age 44, winning the first of his six full terms two years later.
Ernest Frederick Hollings was born in Charleston, South Carolina, on Jan. 1, 1922. His father was a paper products dealer but the family business went broke during the Depression.
Hollings graduated from The Citadel, the state’s military college in Charleston, in 1942. He immediately entered the Army and was decorated for his service during World War II. Back home, he earned a law degree from the University of South Carolina in 1947.
The next year, he was elected to the state House at age 26. He was elected lieutenant governor six years later and governor in 1958 at age 36.
As governor, he actively lured business, helped balance the budget for the first time since Reconstruction and improved public education.
