Cornyn warns White House to consult Senate before announcing nominees like Herman Cain - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Ted Barrett,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/john-cornyn-white-house-senate-nominees-herman-cain/index.html,"Washington (CNN) A senior Republican senator warned the White House on Tuesday that it needs to do a better job consulting with the Senate before announcing controversial nominees like Herman Cain for the Federal Reserve Board, because it's not ""a given that everybody whose name gets sort of floated without vetting and without consultation can be confirmed.""
Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a member of the GOP leadership team, predicted that Cain, a former businessman and Republican presidential candidate who faced sexual harassment allegations, will ultimately be cleared by the Republican-controlled Senate but said the ""bigger issue"" is that the White House can avoid problems by reaching out in advance. ""Rather than have the embarrassment for the nominees or for the President or for senators, the thing that I just encourage is there should be consultation,"" Cornyn said. President Donald Trump has said he wants Cain and Stephen Moore , a conservative economic and political commentator, who share Trump's views on monetary policy, to fill seats on the Fed, which the President has routinely criticized . Democrats say neither man is a serious choice for the central bank, which is supposed to be independent of the White House. Cornyn's comments come amid a spate of openings for top jobs in the Trump administration, as the President has made many changes at the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies. Read More It's not clear if Cain or Moore can be confirmed in the Senate, where Republicans have a narrow 53-47 majority. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell notably did not make any effort to defend them when he was asked at a news conference if they were acceptable nominees. ""Well, we are going to look at whoever the President sends up. It's his choice to decide and once he makes a nomination, we'll take a look at it,"" the Kentucky Republican said. Sen. Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican who's a senior member of the Banking Committee, which would hold confirmation hearings for the pair, repeatedly noted to reporters that neither Cain or Moore had been officially nominated yet. Shelby said Moore has ""been around"" and ""active in politics."" But he seemed less comfortable with Cain. ""Cain's nomination, if it comes around, will be interesting to watch,"" he said."
"Claire Grady, acting No. 2 at Homeland Security, latest to leave department - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Kate Sullivan,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/acting-deputy-secretary-dhs-resignation/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Transportation Security Administration Administrator David Pekoske is expected to be named acting deputy secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, according to two administration officials.
On Tuesday night, outgoing Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced the imminent resignation of Claire Grady, the acting deputy of Homeland Security, paving the way for President Donald Trump's pick of Kevin McAleenan to lead the department in an acting capacity. Following Nielsen's forced resignation Sunday night, Grady was statutorily next in line to become acting secretary. ""Acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady has offered the President her resignation, effective tomorrow. For the last two years, Claire has served @DHSgov w excellence and distinction. She has been an invaluable asset to DHS -- a steady force and a knowledgeable voice,"" Nielsen tweeted. With Grady's departure, DHS is changing the order of succession. The previous line of succession included deputy secretary, under secretary for management, Federal Emergency Management Administration, which does not currently have a permanent administrator, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. It's unclear what the new order is. Read: DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's letter on acting deputy secretary's resignation Pekoske was confirmed by the Senate to lead TSA in August 2017. Last year, Congress established a five-year term for the TSA administrator. Pekoske is expected to return to his role at TSA, according to a source. Read More CNN has reached out to TSA for comment. A former administration official told CNN that Grady ""knew her fate was tied to Nielsen."" ""She is one of the people who got stuff done at DHS. Someone everyone went to at the department when they were having a bad day,"" the former official said. How Stephen Miller tightened his grip over Trump's immigration and border policy After Trump announced her resignation, Nielsen said on Twitter that she planned to stay on until Wednesday to help with the transition. Grady's departure comes as Trump is cleaning house in the department. The day after Nielsen's resignation was announced, Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles was ousted, and at least two officials have been named as possibly heading out the door: US Citizenship and Immigration Services director Francis Cissna and Office of the General Counsel's John Mitnick. ""There is a near-systematic purge happening at the nation's second-largest national security agency,"" an official has told CNN. At least some of the sudden personnel changes come at the urging of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, who played a key role in Nielsen's ouster. In recent weeks, the President empowered Miller to lead the administration's border policies ""and he's executing his plan"" with what amounts to a wholesale decapitation of the department's leadership, an official has told CNN."
Trump to sign executive orders meant to free up oil and gas pipeline development - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Jill Disis and David Goldman, CNN Business",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/trump-executive-order-oil-gas-pipeline/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The Trump administration on Wednesday will announce two executive orders aimed at freeing up more pipelines to supply the United States with oil and gas. The orders could give the federal government more power over states in approving energy projects.
The United States is producing more oil and gas than any point in its history, in large part because of the shale boom in the Permian Basin in West Texas. But producers have trouble getting all of that supply to customers due to constraints on the number of pipelines. Canadian oil is also a problem, because Canada has run out of pipelines to send oil to the United States. Several states have invoked the Clean Water Act to delay approval of sections of pipelines, arguing that the pipelines will cause environmental damage. New York, for example, rejected a natural gas pipeline three years ago that state officials said failed to meet water quality standards. Developers still want to build that pipeline, which was supposed to transport natural gas throughout markets in the Northeast. Read More One of the executive orders will direct the Environmental Protection Agency to revise the way states can consider the Clean Water Act when deciding whether to approve pipelines, according to a senior administration official. The official told reporters Tuesday night that there are ""a lot of problems"" with the way the Clean Water Act is being interpreted, adding that the administration expects the executive order to ""alleviate"" some of those issues. A second executive order is aimed at making cross-border energy infrastructure approval more streamlined. It says that any decision to issue or deny a cross-border permit shall be made solely by President Donald Trump. There's trouble in OPEC and oil prices are up 50% That executive order isn't limited to pipelines, but would cover other kinds of energy infrastructure projects, too. It comes amid controversy over the Keystone XL Pipeline, which is operated by TransCanada and which would bring Canadian oil into the United States. The Obama administration opted to shut down that pipeline, but the Trump administration has sought to reopen it . An official said Tuesday that the new executive order would affect ""future"" permitting for energy projects at the border. As energy prices have risen over the past several months, Trump has called on OPEC, the oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia, to help reduce the price of oil in the United States. Oil prices have risen because of a variety of factors including fighting in Libya, sanctions against Venezuela and Iran, and the inability of United States energy producers to deliver their vast supply to US customers. It is unclear if the executive order will have its intended, if any, impact. Many states are embroiled in bitter legal disputes with the Trump administration, and the executive order is unlikely to settle any of those disputes."
Gun manufacturer asks Supreme Court to take on lawsuit involving Sandy Hook families,edition.cnn.com,Sarah Jorgensen,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/sandy-hook-lawsuit-supreme-court/index.html,"(CNN) Gun manufacturer Remington is asking the US Supreme Court to hear a lawsuit involving the company and families of Sandy Hook victims.
In a filing dated Friday , Remington asked the Connecticut Supreme Court for a motion of stay as it petitions the high court to hear its argument. Remington is asking the court to decide on the state's interpretation of a federal statute that grants gun manufacturers immunity from any lawsuit related to injuries that result from criminal misuse of their product. The case could determine the degree to which gun manufacturers are liable for the marketing of their products. The Connecticut lawsuit is believed to be the first of its kind to reach the discovery phase after the enactment of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in 2005, which grants immunity to manufacturers and is at the center of Remington's motion. Remington manufactured the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle that the 20-year-old gunman used in the 2012 shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. Twenty children and six adults were killed in the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, in one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern US history. Following a state court ruling last month, Remington says it's heading to the US Supreme Court because ""the basis for jurisdiction in the Supreme Court is this court's decision on an important federal question that conflicts with a decision of a United States court of appeals."" Read More The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in March that Remington can be sued under state law for how it marketed the AR-15. State law does not permit advertisements that encourage criminal behavior, according to the decision. However, Remington argues federal law should prevent the company from being sued. The attorney for the Sandy Hook families, Josh Koskoff, said Remington's attempt to stay the case is merely a tactic to delay discovery. ""Remington's attempt to stay the case is simply another tactic designed to delay and prevent the families from learning the truth of what went on behind closed doors. Fortunately for all of us, transparency is a cornerstone of our civil justice system, and nobody -- not even Remington -- is above the law."" CNN has reached out to attorneys for Remington for additional comment. In 2014, the families of nine of the victims filed a wrongful death suit against the manufacturers and distributors of the Bushmaster rifle. That case was dismissed in 2016 by Connecticut Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis, citing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. However, Sandy Hook families appealed the dismissal, and last month , the Connecticut Supreme Court allowed the lawsuit against gun manufacturers to go forward. The families argue that the gun manufacturers knowingly marketed the gun to those who ""carry out offensive, military style combat missions against their perceived enemies."" In their original complaint, the families cite some of the marketing practices allegedly used for the Bushmaster. For example, the Bushmaster Defendant's 2012 Bushmaster Product Catalog, the lawsuit says, shows ""the silhouette of a soldier holding his helmet against the backdrop of an American flag"" and ""text that reads 'when you need to perform under pressure, Bushmaster delivers.' "" CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect Remington's position on why the US Supreme Court should hear the case."
Illinois to ensure Medicaid coverage of gender-change surgery,us.cnn.com,"Theresa Waldrop, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/illinois-medicaid-gender-affirming-surgery/index.html,"(CNN) Illinois' Medicaid program will soon ensure coverage of gender-affirming surgeries for transgender adults who meet certain diagnostic criteria, the state's Department of Healthcare and Family Services said in a release .
The department is developing rules for the coverage, and it's likely to be adopted this summer, according to the release. Medicaid members must be at least 21 years old and have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, a term that describes the distress people suffer when the gender they identify with doesn't match the gender assigned to them at birth. ""For those facing gender dysphoria, every day can be a painful challenge, Theresa Eagleson, HFS director, said in the statement. ""Helping these individuals overcome their struggles through compassionate and comprehensive treatment is the right approach for them and for Illinois."" What is medically necessary treatment for gender-affirming health care? Expanding Medicaid coverage of the procedure would be cost-effective, the department said, since it prevents ""negative health impacts,"" including depression and suicide. HFS is using Vermont's policies as a model, it said. Cost increases have not been reported by 17 states, and the District of Columbia, that offer this coverage, the department said. Read More In a study published in September, transgender teens reported the highest rates of suicide attempts . Among transgender male teens, almost 51% said they had tried to take their lives, the study said. ""Expanding Medicaid to cover gender affirming surgeries is cost effective, helps avoid long-term health consequences, and most importantly is the right thing to do,"" Gov. J. B. Pritzker said in the release. CNN has reached out to the department for comment on the policy change, but hasn't yet had a response. To be herself, she needs to change her body. But first, comes the battle with insurers The US Department of Health and Human Services in 2016 made a rule that interpreted the ban on sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity in federally funded health care facilities and insurance plans. The Illinois HFS said the previous administration didn't ""create the policies and coverage requirements to accomplish this."" The Trump administration has signaled it intends to undo the rule."

Samantha Josephson: State lawmakers push for rideshare safety bill after student's death,us.cnn.com,Meridith Edwards,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/usc-uber-killing-law-south-carolina/index.html,"(CNN) The South Carolina House has passed a bill to require rideshare vehicles to display illuminated signs in the wake of the death of a USC student who got into a vehicle she believed was her Uber.
South Carolina Rep. Seth Rose and Rep. Micah Caskey co-sponsored the ""Samantha L. Josephson Ridesharing Safety Act"" bill to make it easier for riders to identify Uber and Lyft vehicles. The bill passed by a vote of 99-1, Rose said. The bill now advances to the Senate. ""This legislation creates an initial step by which someone should be able to start the process of verifying that a rideshare is in fact their vehicle,"" said Rose, who filed the bill just days after Josephson's death. ""You still need to check the license plate, ask the driver to recite your name and follow other safety procedures that are available and in place. But with this bill, we are trying to allow the citizen to verify from a distance that a vehicle may be their rideshare."" Josephson, a 21-year-old student at the University of South Carolina, had called for an Uber around 2 a.m. March 29 in Columbia outside a bar. She was last seen getting into a black vehicle that was not her Uber. Her body was found with multiple sharp force injuries 14 hours later in a field about 90 miles away, authorities said . Read More Police arrested Nathaniel David Rowland on murder and kidnapping charges after an officer saw him driving a vehicle that matched the one seen in the surveillance video. Josephson's blood was found in the car's passenger side and the trunk, and her cell phone was in the passenger compartment, authorities said. JUST WATCHED Man mistaken for Uber driver charged in student's death Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Man mistaken for Uber driver charged in student's death 01:09 The rideshare apps have a number of safety features that provide checks for riders so that they don't get into the wrong vehicle, as happened to Josephson. For example, the Uber app informs the rider of the make, model and color of the vehicle, the license plate number and the driver's name and photo. Uber and Lyft also allow drivers and riders to text or call each other, and riders can send their trip information and location to friends during the ride. Under current South Carolina law, rideshare drivers are required to have reflective stickers. What other campuses have done The issue of fake Uber drivers is particularly acute on college campuses, full of tech-savvy students who often use Uber and Lyft as a way to get around, especially when drinking alcohol. Uber said it has been working with police and college campuses to address this issue. ""Since 2017, we've been working with local law enforcement and college campuses across the country to educate the public about how to avoid fake rideshare drivers,"" an Uber spokesperson said. ""Everyone at Uber is devastated to hear about this unspeakable crime, and our hearts are with Samantha Josephson's family and loved ones. We remain focused on raising public awareness about this incredibly important issue."" Several college towns, including Columbia in the past few days, have taken steps in the wake of violent incidents. Since Josephson's death, Columbia Police placed fliers with safety tips for rideshare and taxi rides onto the windows of businesses in the city. The flier highlights a specific drop-off and pick-up zone, and advises riders to cross streets at crosswalks, put down their phones and avoid excessive alcohol consumption. Ridesharing guidelines and tips were placed on business windows in downtown Columbia, South Carolina. In an interview with CNN, Rose noted that USC currently holds a University 101 class for students that offers a crash course in what to do and what not to do in Columbia. He plans to send a formal letter to USC's president and board of trustees asking them to incorporate rideshare safety advice into that course. ""I think every place across this country, every university, needs to take note that this is a real danger and we need to take precautions to educate everyone that this is a possibility,"" Rose said. Florida Gulf Coast University had a similar reaction after an alleged assault by a fake Uber driver in August 2017. In that case, a female student mistakenly got into a car she believed was from a rideshare service, university police said, and the driver then allegedly assaulted the student. The university said officials speak on a regular basis with students, including at orientation, about the importance of personal safety. ""We encourage them to adopt the buddy system with their friends to minimize a criminal's opportunity to exploit a situation like we believe happened in this case you referenced,"" the university said in a statement. ""At the time the crime occurred, our University Police issued a reminder to all students and employees to carefully confirm the make, model and license plate of a private transportation company's car to make sure they are getting into the right vehicle."" Think you know how to Uber and Lyft? Make sure you're aware of these safety tips In November 2017, police said a man posing as an Uber driver sexually assaulted a woman on American University's campus, according to CNN affiliate WJLA . DC Superior Court records showed that the victim and her boyfriend had flagged down the suspect and paid him in cash, WJLA reported, and the assault allegedly occurred after the boyfriend left the vehicle. Court records show that the vehicle did have an Uber sticker visible, according to WJLA. An American University spokesman said they have a number of safety features and advice for students taking rideshares. ""We advise students to follow the safety policies of the rideshare services, including using the app to call and identify an authorized driver, rather than relying on a window decal,"" the spokesman said. ""In addition, AUPD offers a safety app called Rave Guardian that can be used in the District of Columbia. Rave Guardian has an emergency icon for Campus Police and Local Police Emergencies depending on on- or off-campus use. ""Finally, AUPD offers a Safe Ride back to Campus program. If a student finds themselves stranded in DC for any reason, they can call a cab and have it take them to University Police headquarters. The student should notify AUPD that they are on their way by calling 202-885-2527. AUPD will pay for the cab and place the charge on the student's account, ensuring that even without money or a ride, students can always return safely to campus. This service can be utilized within a 10-mile radius of the main campus."""
Judge demands white supremacist Andrew Anglin turn up for deposition. He says he's afraid.,us.cnn.com,Mallory Simon,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/andrew-anglin-daily-stormer-lawsuit/index.html,"(CNN) The founder of one of the most highly trafficked neo-Nazi websites must face questioning in person under oath in the United States about allegations he called for a ""troll storm"" against a Jewish woman, a federal judge ruled.
But that's not likely to happen, according to Andrew Anglin's lawyer Marc Randazza. ""He doesn't live in the United States and doesn't want to come to the United States,"" Randazza says. ""I really can't tell you why...But I am duty bound to respect it."" Anglin, who was raised in the U.S. but has claimed he is no longer a citizen, was willing to sit for a deposition via video conference or in an embassy and argued in court motions that he should be able to do so instead of coming to the United States. Anglin has argued that he does not live in the United States and ""claims he fears violence from Southern Poverty Law Center supporters and harassment from the Southern Poverty Law Center itself,"" according to court documents. Those are allegations the court ""correctly concluded..."" ""were unfounded and without basis,"" David Dinielli, deputy legal director of the SPLC told CNN. Read More Anglin, founder of the Daily Stormer website, is being sued in a lawsuit which seeks to hold him liable after using his website to encourage his thousands of readers to contact Tanya Gersh. Most of the messages contained hate-filled language and centered on the fact that Gersh is Jewish. Anglin has argued his speech is protected by the First Amendment. An avalanche of hate: How a Montana mom became the target of a neo-Nazi troll storm Gersh, with the help of the Southern Poverty Law Center, is suing Anglin for ""invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and violations of Montana's Anti-Intimidation Act."" That suit was filed in April 2017 in the US District Court for Montana. Lawyers for Gersh and Anglin have been going back and forth about conditions for Anglin's deposition, which is central to the case. But US Magistrate Judge Jeremiah C. Lynch ruled that ""Anglin's personal safety concerns are factually unsupported"" to provide a blanket protective order that would allow him to be deposed outside the U.S. Lynch did say the court could resolve disputes about the deposition as they arose if Anglin did come to the United States. But Anglin has told his lawyer he will not come to the United States under any circumstance. ""The court has decided [Anglin] must re-emigrate to the United States in order to defend himself,"" Randazza told CNN. ""Unless he has a change of heart, he is never going to cross into the United States as long as he lives."" ""He has no fear of answering the questions. Just not under the circumstances the court is mandating."" What happens next Andrew Anglin is the founder of The Daily Stormer website. Randazza says he expects now Anglin will ""willingly accept a default"" judgement instead. Neither Anglin nor his attorneys have filed any paperwork indicating that he will defy the judge's order and not come to the U.S. In the meantime, Dinielli says Gersh and the SPLC will continue to seek justice in the case. ""We'll proceed under the rules of procedure and if Mr. Anglin does not comply with his discovery obligations then there'll be consequences,"" Dinielli says. Dinielli says ""Anglin has from the beginning played games"" and this is merely a ""continuation of that pattern."" Randazza calls it a situation where ""everyone loses."" ""The end result of that will be that the SPLC will get a piece of paper, my client will pay nothing and there won't even be a decision on the legal merits, at least clarifying the law,"" he says. Gersh's lawyers say they intend to see the process through and believe this isn't an everyone-loses situation. And it's not just a ""piece of paper,"" if a judge rules against Anglin in this case. ""That would be a very important piece of paper for Tanya Gersh to possess,"" Dinielli says. ""A significant judgment if not ultimately collected is an important message to people who would consider doing this kind of thing."" Case had been set up as a First Amendment clash Lawyers on both sides of the case had prepared for a legal battle expected to examine the boundaries of the First Amendment and attempts to hold people responsible for their words. In this case, the words came from readers of the Daily Stormer after Anglin wrote about Gersh on his website and asked people to unleash a troll storm on her. Most of the messages from his readers came in the form of anti-Semitic slurs. There were edited images of her face on the gates of the Nazi Auschwitz death camp. A voicemail with the sound of gunshots. There were letters sent to the home she shared with her husband and young son, who also received messages on social media. Randazza, Anglin's lawyer and a well-known First Amendment attorney, told CNN in the past, ""The only thing he (Anglin) did was call for people to speak, but people want to draw the line for speech they don't like."" Tanya Gersh says harassing messages reached her in every corner of her life. Gersh told CNN when she filed the lawsuit that she believed reducing the Daily Stormer readers to simply ""trolls"" minimizes the impact they had on her life. ""These are not trolls. They are terrorists,"" she told CNN. ""They are very harmful, they are very malicious and they are dangerous."" That is not how the law sees it, Anglin's lawyers have argued during the case's early stages. ""Even Nazi expression, no matter the psychic harm on Jewish residents, is nonetheless protected speech,"" Anglin's lawyers wrote. Speech that may be abhorrent to some still constitutes free speech, his lawyers maintain. ""Every word uttered by Mr. Anglin in this public dispute is protected by the First Amendment, no matter how many people find those views intolerable,"" Anglin's lawyers argue. Fighting on It's unclear now what may happen to the case. Discovery is still underway in the case. Gersh's lawyers are still trying to interview people connected to the ""troll storm."" But the case may lack the courtroom showdown that was once expected. ""I'm not terribly disappointed nor excited one way or another. Unfortunately, the public likes to see a spectacle in cases. They are used to the movie version of legal cases,"" Randazza says. ""That's just not how our court system works. The vast majority end with a whimper not with a bang."" Gersh's lawyers maintain that's not how they see this playing out. And that Gersh intends to make sure Anglin gets the message that what he did is not acceptable. ""She is intent on prosecuting the case to conclusion ... in order to demonstrate the depths of harm when an individual is targeted with the hate and vitriol Mr. Anglin directed at her,"" Dinielli says."
Bonnie Haim: Trial begins for man accused of killing his wife in 1993 cold case,us.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/bonnie-michael-haim-trial/index.html,"(CNN) When Aaron Fraser began excavating behind his childhood home in Jacksonville, Florida, as part of a renovation in 2014, he made a gruesome discovery: human remains.
They were the skull and bones of his mother, Bonnie Haim, who had gone missing in January 1993 and whose body had not been found. Prosecutors say that discovery led officials to arrest her then-husband, Michael Haim, and charge him with second-degree murder. ""The truth was always out there, buried in their backyard,"" Assistant State Attorney Alan Mizrahi said in opening statements in the murder trial on Tuesday. Michael and Bonnie Haim had been having marital problems, and he has long been a prime suspect in the case, his defense attorney Janis Warren said in her opening remarks. Read More But he has maintained his innocence since her disappearance. In an interview with CNN affiliate WJXT shortly after Bonnie Haim disappeared in 1993, Michael Haim said she left their home on the night of January 6 after a relationship issue. ""Basically she just wasn't happy and she wanted to leave, and I couldn't stop her from leaving,"" he told WJXT . Michael Haim is accused of killing his wife, Bonnie Haim, in 1993. Warren said prosecutors did not have enough evidence to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ""We agree she's dead. We agree that's her body in the backyard. But they have to prove to you that he did it,"" she said. ""When you listen to the evidence, ladies and gentlemen, and when you're finished, you're gonna see the lack of evidence in this case far outweighs any evidence they brought you."" The childhood memories of Fraser, who was 3 when his mother disappeared, are expected to be a major part of the case against Michael Haim, CNN affiliate WJXT reported . After his mother disappeared, he told a child welfare worker at the time, ""Daddy hurt Mommy,"" WJXT reported. ""Aaron also stated that 'Daddy shot Mommy' and 'My daddy could not wake her up,'"" a 2015 arrest affidavit said, according to WJXT . Opening statements in the trial Bonnie Haim's remains were found under a shower pallet in the home's backyard, Mizrahi said. A .22-caliber shell was also found near the body, he said, and Michael Haim owned a .22-caliber rifle. Although a medical examiner could not affirmatively determine how she was killed, Mizrahi argued that Michael Haim shot her and then buried her there in 1993. ""The defendant's actions before the killing and after the killing demonstrate his depraved indifference to Bonnie Haim's life,"" he said. Investigators had searched the property several times in the years after her disappearance, but did not find her remains until Fraser's discovery two decades later. ""That was the piece of the puzzle that we really felt we were missing,"" Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Director Mike Bruno told WJXT in 2015. ""There are so many unsolved or cold cases that are in this same situation of we just need that one clue, that one tip, that one piece. Here, we were able to get it, and to start that piece of closure."" Warren, Haim's attorney, said on Tuesday that prosecutors would not be able to prove that he killed her and placed her body there on the night she disappeared. ""The only thing that's important is: Can they prove he killed her? And can they prove he put the body in the yard? There's no evidence of either one of those,"" she added."

She has been an invaluable asset to DHS -- a steady force and a knowledgeable voice,"" Nielsen tweeted. With Grady's departure, DHS is changing the order of succession. The previous line of succession included deputy secretary, under secretary for management, Federal Emergency Management Administration, which does not currently have a permanent administrator, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. It's unclear what the new order is. Read: DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's letter on acting deputy secretary's resignation Pekoske was confirmed by the Senate to lead TSA in August 2017. Last year, Congress established a five-year term for the TSA administrator. Pekoske is expected to return to his role at TSA, according to a source. Read More CNN has reached out to TSA for comment. A former administration official told CNN that Grady ""knew her fate was tied to Nielsen."" ""She is one of the people who got stuff done at DHS. Someone everyone went to at the department when they were having a bad day,"" the former official said. How Stephen Miller tightened his grip over Trump's immigration and border policy After Trump announced her resignation, Nielsen said on Twitter that she planned to stay on until Wednesday to help with the transition. Grady's departure comes as Trump is cleaning house in the department. The day after Nielsen's resignation was announced, Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles was ousted, and at least two officials have been named as possibly heading out the door: US Citizenship and Immigration Services director Francis Cissna and Office of the General Counsel's John Mitnick. ""There is a near-systematic purge happening at the nation's second-largest national security agency,"" an official has told CNN. At least some of the sudden personnel changes come at the urging of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, who played a key role in Nielsen's ouster. In recent weeks, the President empowered Miller to lead the administration's border policies ""and he's executing his plan"" with what amounts to a wholesale decapitation of the department's leadership, an official has told CNN."
"Maxine Waters to Steve Mnuchin: 'If you wish to leave, you may leave' CNNPolitics",us.cnn.com,Donna Borak,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/maxine-waters-steven-mnuchin-clash/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ended a long day of testimony before House lawmakers in a verbal sparring match with California Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, over his insistence on leaving for a previously scheduled appointment.
The Treasury secretary at 5:08 p.m. ET interrupted the question-and-answer session with lawmakers to remind the committee of their agreement that he would be able to leave at 5 p.m. Mnuchin said he was scheduled to meet with a senior official from the government of Bahrain to discuss efforts to combat counterterrorism financing, but would be willing to stay until 5:15 and return at a later date to testify before the committee. ""It will be embarrassing if I keep this person waiting for a long period of time,"" Mnuchin said. Waters responded: ""Unfortunately, we are all pressed for time."" Read More The exchange came at the end of Mnuchin's back-to-back appearances before a panel of the House Appropriations Committee and then before Waters' full committee, where he was grilled about his plans for responding to Democrats' requests for access to President Donald Trump's tax returns. Waters has long been an antagonist to Trump, who has openly ridiculed her on Twitter and in rallies. She was quick to assert her new authority over Mnuchin, reminding him that ""it's a new day and it's a new chair"" when Mnuchin said that previous Treasury secretaries have never testified for longer than three hours. ""I have the gavel at this point,"" Waters said. ""If you wish to leave, you may."" Mnuchin momentarily paused and asked for a clarification from the chair, ""OK, so we're dismissed? Is that correct?"" To which Waters repeated: ""If you wish to leave, you may leave. You're wasting your time, remember you have a foreign dignitary in your office."" The secretary then threatened to ""rethink"" whether he would voluntarily return back to the committee to testify if he was going to poorly treated. ""If you'd wish to keep me here so that I don't have my important meeting and continue to grill me, then we can do that,"" said Mnuchin. ""I will cancel my meeting and I will not be back here. I will be very clear if that's the way you'd like to have this relationship."" Waters seized on the comments and proceeded with acknowledging the next member in line to ask a question, only to have Mnuchin correct the record by saying that the chairwoman was ""instructing"" him to stay and cancel his meeting. ""No. You just made an offer,"" said Waters. ""No, I didn't make you an offer,"" Mnuchin replied. ""You made me an offer that I accepted,"" Waters said. ""No, I'm not ordering you. I said you may leave anytime you want and you said OK. If that's what you want to do, I'll cancel my appointment and I'll stay here. So I'm responding to your request, if that's what you want to do."" Mnuchin responded by telling Waters she would need to dismiss him before he could leave the hearing room. ""You're supposed to take the gavel and bang it, that's the appropriate ..."" He was interrupted by Waters: ""Please do not instruct me as to how I am to conduct this committee."" Shortly thereafter, Mnuchin was advised by a member of his staff that he was not required to stay and left shortly thereafter. He testified for three and a half hours. Waters told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Tuesday night that Mnuchin's meeting was secondary to the committee's oversight responsibilities. ""When he said that he had somebody important (to meet), I don't think that there's anything or anybody more important than the Congress of the United States of America trying to find out what exactly this secretary is doing,"" she said."

A perfect quote to understand the Trump presidency CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/donald-trump-family-business-presidency-angus-king/index.html,"Washington (CNN) ""This guy thinks he's CEO of America and it's a family-owned company. He doesn't have to answer to anybody.""
That's Maine Sen. Angus King on Donald Trump during an interview on CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday . And, man, did the Mainer nail it. Trump runs his White House -- and the broader government -- much in the same way he ran his eponymous company. He has surrounded himself with a small inner circle filled with a combination of family members and people willing to tell him he is always right. He demands total loyalty from those who work for him and, as is the case with the traditionally independent Justice Department, fumes when they refuse to follow his orders to a ""T."" He purposely -- and publicly -- contradicts people within his own administration as a way to assert his dominance and keep them on their toes. Put another way: All you need to know about how Donald Trump views the presidency you can learn by watching a single episode of ""The Apprentice."" What has become abundantly clear in Trump's two-plus years on the job is that Washington and the presidency isn't changing him. In fact, it's the other way around.

Trump, more so than any other modern president, has reshaped the norms governing what a president can -- and should -- do with the power conveyed by the office. He has, among other things, sought to discredit the idea of an independent media, devalued the idea of truth, threatened to close the US's southern border, said that there was blame on both sides for white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, attacked a cable TV host for her alleged facelift and on and on and on. He's also repeatedly expressed disdain for the role of the legislative and judicial branches in the system of checks and balances. And expressed his admiration for the power exerted by authoritarian dictators around the world. Through it all, Trump has never understood -- or cared to understand -- why what he says (and wants) doesn't just happen. The Point : Whether Trump wins a second term in 2020 or not, his legacy will be the way in which he changed how people think about a) who should be president and b) how a president should act in office. Trump acts as though he has unlimited power to do whatever he wants in office -- and attacks those who question that view. He might be the first to see the office that way, but he has ensured he won't be the last."
House Democrats unveil resolution condemning white supremacy CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Ashley Killough,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/house-democrats-white-supremacy-resolution-condemn/index.html,"(CNN) More than 80 House Democrats are sponsoring a nonbinding resolution condemning white supremacist rhetoric and violence that specifically targets immigrants.
While the resolution does not mention President Donald Trump, its supporters brought up Trump's rhetoric in a news conference on Tuesday. They repeatedly referenced his characterization of the border situation as an ""invasion,"" as well as his use of the word ""animals,"" which he had used to describe MS-13 gang members at a 2018 event and some took as a comment about undocumented immigrants overall. RELATED: Monthly apprehensions at the US-Mexico border highest since 2008 Pressed on whether Trump should bear most of the blame for the rise of white supremacy in the United States, Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey -- a freshman Democrat who introduced the resolution -- said the President is ""failing"" in his responsibility to keep Americans safe. ""I think he has the highest responsibility of anybody in the country to combat the threat. No one has a greater responsibility to keep us safe than the President, by his actions and by his words, and certainly I would contend that he's failing in that responsibility,"" he said. Read More ""We've always had Nazis. We always will,"" added Malinowski. ""We've never had to question where the president of the United States stands on their way of thinking."" Rep. Lieu shows video at hate-crimes hearing of Candace Owens discussing Hitler Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell of Florida -- who, like Malinowski, is an immigrant -- especially pushed back on Trump's rhetoric about immigrants at the border. ""We are not invaders,"" she said. ""Accepting refugees and asylum seekers does not pose an intrinsic threat to our way of life."" While the House passed a resolution last month broadly condemning discrimination against multiple groups, this one focuses on white supremacy and was inspired by the mosque attacks in New Zealand. Trump has condemned the New Zealand attacks as ""a horrible massacre"" and ""scenes of evil killing."" When pressed further about the issue, he said he did not see a global rise of white supremacy and attributed recent attacks to a small group of people ""with very, very serious problems."" The new resolution also calls for ramped-up funding at the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security for programs to combat domestic terrorism, and it urges social media companies to reevaluate policies that allow such rhetoric to go online. The resolution is expected to first go through the House Judiciary Committee, which held a hearing Tuesday on the rise of hate crimes and white supremacy. Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify the context of Trump's use of the word ""animals"" in 2018."
Gun manufacturer asks Supreme Court to take on lawsuit involving Sandy Hook families CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Sarah Jorgensen,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/sandy-hook-lawsuit-supreme-court/index.html,"(CNN) Gun manufacturer Remington is asking the US Supreme Court to hear a lawsuit involving the company and families of Sandy Hook victims.
In a filing dated Friday , Remington asked the Connecticut Supreme Court for a motion of stay as it petitions the high court to hear its argument. Remington is asking the court to decide on the state's interpretation of a federal statute that grants gun manufacturers immunity from any lawsuit related to injuries that result from criminal misuse of their product. The case could determine the degree to which gun manufacturers are liable for the marketing of their products. The Connecticut lawsuit is believed to be the first of its kind to reach the discovery phase after the enactment of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in 2005, which grants immunity to manufacturers and is at the center of Remington's motion. Remington manufactured the Bushmaster AR-15 rifle that the 20-year-old gunman used in the 2012 shooting. Twenty children and six adults were killed in the massacre at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school in one of the deadliest mass shootings in modern US history. In Friday's filing, Remington attorneys say the statute of limitations has passed on holding the company accountable under state unfair trade practices. Read More The attorney for the Sandy Hook families, Josh Koskoff, said Remington's attempt to stay the case is merely a tactic to delay discovery. ""Remington's attempt to stay the case is simply another tactic designed to delay and prevent the families from learning the truth of what went on behind closed doors. Fortunately for all of us, transparency is a cornerstone of our civil justice system, and nobody -- not even Remington -- is above the law."" CNN has reached out to attorneys for Remington for additional comment. In 2014, the families of nine of the victims filed a wrongful death suit against the manufacturers and distributors of the Bushmaster rifle. That case was dismissed in 2016 by Connecticut Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis, citing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. However, Sandy Hook families appealed the dismissal, and last month , the Connecticut Supreme Court allowed the lawsuit against gun manufacturers to go forward. The families argue that the gun manufacturers knowingly marketed the gun to those who ""carry out offensive, military style combat missions against their perceived enemies."" State law does not permit advertisements that encourage criminal behavior, according to the decision. In their original complaint, the families cite some of the marketing practices allegedly used for the Bushmaster. For example, the Bushmaster Defendant's 2012 Bushmaster Product Catalog, the lawsuit says, shows ""the silhouette of a soldier holding his helmet against the backdrop of an American flag"" and ""text that reads 'when you need to perform under pressure, Bushmaster delivers.'

On an April day in 1942 -- just four months after Pearl Harbor -- he sat next to Jimmy Doolittle as 16 B-25 Mitchell bombers lumbered down the deck of an aircraft carrier to begin a mission that ended in a huge morale boost for the United States.
Eighty gallant men volunteered for that successful mission -- which turned out to be a one-way attack -- vengeance for Japan's strike on Hawaii that crippled the US Navy fleet and left 2,403 dead. Cole, the last surviving Doolittle Raider, died Tuesday in San Antonio, the US Air Force announced. He was 103. ""Lt. Col.

The Doolittle mission called for crews to bomb five Japanese cities and fly on to China, where the men would connect with friendly forces who would help them get home. On April 18, 1942, Lt. Col. Doolittle, commander of the mission, and his co-pilot Cole sat in the cockpit of their B-25 going over a preflight checklist with the engines running. The USS Hornet was in the seas below Japan. ""I was setting the engine cowl flaps and watching to make sure the engines didn't overheat,"" Cole, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, told CNN in 2016.

Doolittle's bomber was the first to fly over Japan. It dropped four incendiary bombs on a Tokyo factory area.

He toasted the mission's 75th anniversary in April 2016 at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas. Hide Caption 11 of 11 Both Cole and Doolittle kept their hands on the engine throttles to make sure the levers didn't accidentally slip downward and -- in case of engine failure -- to quickly bring the plane to a stop. With his engines revving hard, Doolittle released the brakes, sending the plane barreling toward the ship's edge. Seconds later, the first raiders were airborne. A bomber takeoff from the deck of an aircraft carrier had never been done. The crew found themselves scrambling to make a hasty takeoff, 12 hours ahead of schedule, after they were spotted by Japanese fishing boats. The early departure also meant the planes would likely run out of fuel before landing in friendly China. 75 years ago, the Doolittle Raid changed history Cole grew up in Dayton, Ohio, admiring Doolittle, who set and broke many aeronautical records. Now here he was hurtling down the narrow deck of the Hornet in a small cockpit with Doolittle. His job? Making sure Doolittle was happy, he said, and handling the flaps on the plane so the engines wouldn't overheat. Cole said people thought the takeoff would be the most dangerous part of the mission. ""It turned out to be one of the easiest things,"" he said. Cole later added, ""Besides, I was flying with the best pilot, so why worry?"" The B-25 takeoff was filmed by US military cameramen on the Hornet and on nearby ships. Their fellow Doolittle Raiders waited anxiously in the 15 B-25 bombers behind them. Hundreds of the Hornet's crew watched from the deck and the bridge in suspense. The order had been given. If a plane stalled or a technical problem developed approaching takeoff, it would be pushed into the sea in order to get the other planes in the air on time. Richard ""Dick"" Cole talks with Civil Air Patrol color guard members in San Marcos, Texas, in 2018. The raiders flew at very low altitudes to avoid detection, 200 feet above the water. The planes arrived over Tokyo 12 hours ahead of schedule, making it a daylight raid instead of the planned night raid. A coincidental air raid drill conducted in Tokyo that morning did not prepare military defenses for the Doolittle Raiders. Bombs were dropped on their targets, oil storage facilities and military installations. Cole told CNN in 2017, ""I felt pretty good that we had done what we were supposed to do."" Then the race was on, as fuel ran low, to land in mainland China and seek help from Chinese supporters who were living under Japanese rule. They didn't make it. Doolittle ordered his crew to abandon the plane. Cole and almost all the Raiders had no experience jumping out of aircraft. In darkness and stormy weather, Cole leaped with his parachute and learned one thing quickly. ""They don't give a Purple Heart for self-inflicted injuries. I gave myself a black eye"" in pulling the ripcord so hard, he said. Last living Doolittle Raider recalls America's revenge attack He eventually landed in a pine tree and stayed there overnight. Chinese nationalists found him and brought him to a building where he was surprised to encounter Doolittle. The mission's commander went to the crash site and sat morosely on the wreckage, telling one of the crew that he felt the entire mission was a failure and he would be court-martialed. Doolittle feared the worst for the 16 planes. Engineer Paul Leonard consoled him, telling Doolittle he was wrong. He promised Doolittle the mission would be viewed as a success and the crews would be hailed as heroes. Back home, the raid was stunning news, with screaming headlines about the raid on the front page of daily newspapers. Japan was shocked. Cole said, ""It told the people of Japan their island could be struck by air."" Everything didn't go completely smoothly. Eleven crews had to bail out of their planes. Four bombers crash-landed. Pilot Ted Lawson lost a leg. He would go on to write the best-selling book ""Thirty Seconds over Tokyo,"" later a hit 1944 film. One crew flew to the Soviet Union and was interned before eventually being set free. Eight men were captured. One starved to death in a Japanese prison camp and three were executed by the Japanese. Dick Cole, front, and David Thatcher, left, during a 2015 event at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Cole and others went right back into the war after the Doolittle Raid. Cole flew transport planes carrying cargo and glider-borne troops in India, China and Burma. Some of the Raiders were killed fighting in the European theater. After the war ended, the crews returned to civilian life. Doolittle lived up to a preraid promise of a party if the attack succeeded. The tradition would go on. A special feature of every reunion was the crew sharing a cognac in silver goblets with each Raider's name engraved right-side up and upside-down. If a Raider passed away during that year, the goblet would be turned over. A toast was made each year until finally there were only four Raiders left alive in 2013. Cole gave the final toast after the remaining four Raiders agreed that their age and inability to travel would make it the last reunion. Cole raised his glass before a large audience at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton and said, ""I propose a toast to those who were lost on the mission and to those who have passed away since,"" adding, ""May they rest in peace."" In June 2016, David Thatcher, a tail gunner, died, leaving Cole as the last surviving Doolittle Raider. Casey, with the Doolittle Tokyo Raiders Association, said he attended Cole's 103rd birthday party last September in Comfort, Texas. A large group of well-wishers, including airmen with the US Air Force, helped Cole celebrate. ""He was dumbfounded by the turnout, how many people came out to express how much they cared."""

Samantha Josephson: State lawmakers push for rideshare safety bill after student's death - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Meridith Edwards,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/usc-uber-killing-law-south-carolina/index.html,"(CNN) The South Carolina House has passed a bill to require rideshare vehicles to display illuminated signs in the wake of the death of a USC student who got into a vehicle she believed was her Uber.
South Carolina Rep. Seth Rose and Rep. Micah Caskey co-sponsored the ""Samantha L. Josephson Ridesharing Safety Act"" bill to make it easier for riders to identify Uber and Lyft vehicles. The bill passed by a vote of 99-1, Rose said. The bill now advances to the Senate. ""This legislation creates an initial step by which someone should be able to start the process of verifying that a rideshare is in fact their vehicle,"" said Rose, who filed the bill just days after Josephson's death. ""You still need to check the license plate, ask the driver to recite your name and follow other safety procedures that are available and in place. But with this bill, we are trying to allow the citizen to verify from a distance that a vehicle may be their rideshare."" Josephson, a 21-year-old student at the University of South Carolina, had called for an Uber around 2 a.m. March 29 in Columbia outside a bar. She was last seen getting into a black vehicle that was not her Uber. Her body was found with multiple sharp force injuries 14 hours later in a field about 90 miles away, authorities said . Read More Police arrested Nathaniel David Rowland on murder and kidnapping charges after an officer saw him driving a vehicle that matched the one seen in the surveillance video. Josephson's blood was found in the car's passenger side and the trunk, and her cell phone was in the passenger compartment, authorities said.

Man mistaken for Uber driver charged in student's death 01:09 The rideshare apps have a number of safety features that provide checks for riders so that they don't get into the wrong vehicle, as happened to Josephson. For example, the Uber app informs the rider of the make, model and color of the vehicle, the license plate number and the driver's name and photo. Uber and Lyft also allow drivers and riders to text or call each other, and riders can send their trip information and location to friends during the ride. Under current South Carolina law, rideshare drivers are required to have reflective stickers. What other campuses have done The issue of fake Uber drivers is particularly acute on college campuses, full of tech-savvy students who often use Uber and Lyft as a way to get around, especially when drinking alcohol. Uber said it has been working with police and college campuses to address this issue. ""Since 2017, we've been working with local law enforcement and college campuses across the country to educate the public about how to avoid fake rideshare drivers,"" an Uber spokesperson said. ""Everyone at Uber is devastated to hear about this unspeakable crime, and our hearts are with Samantha Josephson's family and loved ones. We remain focused on raising public awareness about this incredibly important issue."" Several college towns, including Columbia in the past few days, have taken steps in the wake of violent incidents. Since Josephson's death, Columbia Police placed fliers with safety tips for rideshare and taxi rides onto the windows of businesses in the city. The flier highlights a specific drop-off and pick-up zone, and advises riders to cross streets at crosswalks, put down their phones and avoid excessive alcohol consumption. Ridesharing guidelines and tips were placed on business windows in downtown Columbia, South Carolina. In an interview with CNN, Rose noted that USC currently holds a University 101 class for students that offers a crash course in what to do and what not to do in Columbia. He plans to send a formal letter to USC's president and board of trustees asking them to incorporate rideshare safety advice into that course. ""I think every place across this country, every university, needs to take note that this is a real danger and we need to take precautions to educate everyone that this is a possibility,"" Rose said. Florida Gulf Coast University had a similar reaction after an alleged assault by a fake Uber driver in August 2017. In that case, a female student mistakenly got into a car she believed was from a rideshare service, university police said, and the driver then allegedly assaulted the student. The university said officials speak on a regular basis with students, including at orientation, about the importance of personal safety. ""We encourage them to adopt the buddy system with their friends to minimize a criminal's opportunity to exploit a situation like we believe happened in this case you referenced,"" the university said in a statement. ""At the time the crime occurred, our University Police issued a reminder to all students and employees to carefully confirm the make, model and license plate of a private transportation company's car to make sure they are getting into the right vehicle."" Think you know how to Uber and Lyft? Make sure you're aware of these safety tips In November 2017, police said a man posing as an Uber driver sexually assaulted a woman on American University's campus, according to CNN affiliate WJLA . DC Superior Court records showed that the victim and her boyfriend had flagged down the suspect and paid him in cash, WJLA reported, and the assault allegedly occurred after the boyfriend left the vehicle. Court records show that the vehicle did have an Uber sticker visible, according to WJLA. An American University spokesman said they have a number of safety features and advice for students taking rideshares. ""We advise students to follow the safety policies of the rideshare services, including using the app to call and identify an authorized driver, rather than relying on a window decal,"" the spokesman said. ""In addition, AUPD offers a safety app called Rave Guardian that can be used in the District of Columbia. Rave Guardian has an emergency icon for Campus Police and Local Police Emergencies depending on on- or off-campus use. ""Finally, AUPD offers a Safe Ride back to Campus program. If a student finds themselves stranded in DC for any reason, they can call a cab and have it take them to University Police headquarters. The student should notify AUPD that they are on their way by calling 202-885-2527. AUPD will pay for the cab and place the charge on the student's account, ensuring that even without money or a ride, students can always return safely to campus. This service can be utilized within a 10-mile radius of the main campus."""

Illinois to ensure Medicaid coverage of gender-change surgery - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Theresa Waldrop, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/illinois-medicaid-gender-affirming-surgery/index.html,"(CNN) Illinois' Medicaid program will soon ensure coverage of gender-affirming surgeries for transgender adults who meet certain diagnostic criteria, the state's Department of Healthcare and Family Services said in a release .
The department is developing rules for the coverage, and it's likely to be adopted this summer, according to the release. Medicaid members must be at least 21 years old and have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, a term that describes the distress people suffer when the gender they identify with doesn't match the gender assigned to them at birth. ""For those facing gender dysphoria, every day can be a painful challenge, Theresa Eagleson, HFS director, said in the statement. ""Helping these individuals overcome their struggles through compassionate and comprehensive treatment is the right approach for them and for Illinois."" What is medically necessary treatment for gender-affirming health care? Expanding Medicaid coverage of the procedure would be cost-effective, the department said, since it prevents ""negative health impacts,"" including depression and suicide. HFS is using Vermont's policies as a model, it said. Cost increases have not been reported by 17 states, and the District of Columbia, that offer this coverage, the department said. Read More In a study published in September, transgender teens reported the highest rates of suicide attempts . Among transgender male teens, almost 51% said they had tried to take their lives, the study said. ""Expanding Medicaid to cover gender affirming surgeries is cost effective, helps avoid long-term health consequences, and most importantly is the right thing to do,"" Gov. J. B. Pritzker said in the release. CNN has reached out to the department for comment on the policy change, but hasn't yet had a response. To be herself, she needs to change her body. But first, comes the battle with insurers The US Department of Health and Human Services in 2016 made a rule that interpreted the ban on sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity in federally funded health care facilities and insurance plans. The Illinois HFS said the previous administration didn't ""create the policies and coverage requirements to accomplish this."" The Trump administration has signaled it intends to undo the rule."

(CNN) The 2020 presidential election marks the first time more than two women have competed in the Democratic or Republican primaries, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Democratic congresswomen Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have all thrown their hats in the ring. And Marianne Williamson, a bestselling author and a spiritual counselor to Oprah, is also running.
Kara Alaimo While this is refreshing to see, an analysis of media coverage published by Northeastern University's School of Journalism finds that the percentage of positive words being used to describe the women is significantly lower than media sentiment about male candidates. But the problem isn't just the media. Studies suggest women are likely to face extra hurdles to winning over voters, as well -- simply because of their gender. In order for a woman to be elected president, a lot of us may need to re-examine some of our subconscious ways of thinking. Research indicates that voters may unknowingly discriminate against female candidates for president because a woman has never held the position, and therefore a woman won't appear to be a ""fit"" for the role. Scholars call this the gender-incongruency hypothesis . For example, studies have shown that female candidates don't do worse than men when they run for local and state-wide office, but they don't fare as well when they run for president. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand: Americans deserve a brave president In a 2007 study published in the journal Basic and Applied Social Psychology, when students were given identical resumes of candidates who they were told were running for president -- a position which, of course, has never been held by a woman -- they judged the candidate to have more presidential potential and to have had a better career when the candidate was named Brian than when the person was named Karen. But when students were shown resumes of candidates running for Congress -- where women already hold seats -- they didn't judge Brian more positively than Karen. A 2008 study of likely Ohio voters found similar results. When potential voters were asked about candidates who the researchers determined had similar credentials at the time -- Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Dole, John Edwards, Rudy Giuliani, and John McCain -- they perceived the men to be more qualified. They were also more likely to vote for a candidate who was not in their own political party when the candidate from their party was female. The researchers noted that the results, published in the Journal of Women, Politics & Policy, suggest that ""the presence of a woman candidate opponent for president may aid the competition."" (The language is telling in that they, too, appeared to assume ""the competition"" would be male). Read More Kamala Harris' plan for teachers is good policy and great politics Cornell University philosophy professor Kate Manne argued in her 2018 book ""Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny"" that when women run for public office or try to move into other domains that have typically been dominated by men, they are often judged hostilely by both men and women -- and by liberals and conservatives alike. But, Manne said, voters often don't realize they're being misogynistic. Instead, she said , ""Our minds subsequently search for a rationale to justify our ill feelings. Her voice is shrill; she is shouting; and why isn't she smiling?"" Manne also reported in the book that women are less likely to be perceived as competent. When they are considered competent, they're often disliked and considered polarizing. She said female candidates are also often judged to be untrustworthy ""on no ostensible basis"" and women's claims are viewed as less credible than claims by men. Then, when women defend themselves from unfair attacks, they're accused of ""playing the victim."" The next president: the polar opposite of Trump? ""To be sure, not every female politician ... is subject to such suspicion, condemnation, and the desire to see them punished,"" Manne wrote. ""But, when the mud-slinging does begin, it quickly tends to escalate. And there tends to be not only a pile-on ... but an 'oozing' effect -- where the suspicion and criticism encompasses every possible grounds for doubt about her competence, character, and accomplishments."" Manne cited reactions to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign as an example. She also noted that, like Clinton, former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard was portrayed by rival politicians and the media as a liar and investigated on allegations that ultimately proved unfounded. What's the solution? Manne told me that because these biases are so often unconsciously applied -- even by well-meaning people who want women to advance, like herself -- voters should engage in ""candidate comparisons"" when judging presidential contenders. ""If you are critical of a woman on certain grounds, you should look toward your favorite male politician and see whether he has similar features,"" she said. ""It can actually be quite surprising how certain criticisms go under the radar when it's a male candidate."" For example, Manne noted that Klobuchar has been accused in the media of mistreating her staff. (Klobuchar acknowledged in a CNN forum that she has sometimes been ""a tough boss"" and ""pushed people too hard.""). Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Yet Bernie Sanders -- the frontrunner among declared Democratic candidates -- has also been accused of mistreating his aides, but those allegations don't seem to have gotten the same media attention. One former staffer told the Vermont newspaper Seven Days in 2015 that Sanders was ""unbelievably abusive"" and claimed ""to have endured frequent verbal assaults."" The paper reported that others who worked for Sanders also said that ""the senator is prone to fits of anger."" A spokesperson for Sanders responded to Seven Days and said that Sanders ""had very positive relations with people who have worked with him."") And Sanders, in response to the article, told the Des Moines Register , ""Yes, I do work hard. Yes, I do demand a lot of the people who work with me. Yes, some people have left who were not happy. But I would say that by and large in my Senate office, in my House office, on my campaigns, the vast majority of people who have worked with me considered that to be a very, very good experience..."" Ultimately, the solution to women not appearing to fit the role of president because a woman has never been president seems obvious: Voters need to elect a woman president. But, in order for that to happen, even those of us who are eager to empower women may need to rethink how we judge female candidates."

Traditionally, the title is bestowed on the highest-ranking leader in Tibetan Buddhism. It is given to those deemed to be the reincarnation of a line of revered religious teachers. Asked in a recent interview what might happen after his death, the Dalai Lama anticipated a possible attempt by Beijing to foist a successor on Tibetan Buddhists. ""In (the) future, in case you see two Dalai Lamas come, one from here, in a free country, one is chosen by Chinese, and then nobody will trust, nobody will respect (the one chosen by China),"" he said.

First black hole photo expected soon from Event Horizon Telescope,us.cnn.com,"Jack Guy, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/world/first-black-hole-photo-scli-scn-intl/index.html,"(CNN) It's been a great year so far for space fans, with a partial solar eclipse , super blood wolf moon eclipse , and a Venus and Jupiter conjunction wowing onlookers.
Now there may be another exciting development to look forward to: the first ever photos of a black hole. Scientists from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration will present a ""groundbreaking result"" from the project on April 10, according to a media advisory. Anticipation is building ahead of the event, which will feature simultaneous press conferences in cities across the world and live streams in different languages. ""Have you heard that something is brewing on April 10th? It's no joke!"" reads a tweet from the collaboration. Read More The collaboration, called EHT, is a global network of telescopes that has been attempting to capture the first photograph of a black hole ever. The EHT project released this simulation image showing the accretion flow around Sagittarius A The first target is Sagittarius A, the site of a supermassive black hole 26,000 light years away from Earth, and the second is at the center of a galaxy known as M87. Black holes are made up of huge amounts of matter squeezed into a small area, according to NASA , creating a massive gravitational field which draws in everything around it, including light. These are the first massive black holes from the early universe In their attempt to capture an image of a black hole, scientists combined the power of eight radio telescopes around the world using Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry, according to the European Southern Observatory, which is part of the EHT. This effectively creates a virtual telescope around the same size as the Earth itself. Dong Lai, astronomy professor and black hole expert at Cornell University believes that the EHT team is gearing up for a big reveal. ""My guess is EHT will produce an image of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and also an image of one at the center of the nearby galaxy M87,"" said Lai, who is not involved in the EHT project, in a press release. Astronomers have found the fastest-growing black hole ever seen, and it's got a monster appetite ""More precisely, these are images of radiating hot gas orbiting very close to the black hole. The strong gravity -- the 'event horizon' -- of black holes create a dark shadow with a distinct shape where no light can be seen."" As Lai explained, it's hard to see black hole shadows clearly because any images are blurred by interstellar gas, which presents a complicated challenge for the EHT team. You can watch Wednesday's press conference in English via the European Commission YouTube channel or the National Science Foundation live stream at 9 a.m. ET. The existence of black holes is universally accepted among today's astronomers, but there is still a lot that we don't know about them. In June 2018, researchers at Australian National University found the fastest-growing black hole ever seen in the universe. The supermassive black hole, known as a quasar, is growing so fast it can devour a mass the size of the sun every two days. And in January 2019, scientists saw the oldest black holes in the universe for the first time. More than 13 billion years after they formed, the light that was released to create these distant massive black holes is now reaching our telescopes."
Benjamin Netanyahu's re-election plans in limbo as Israeli election too close to call,us.cnn.com,Oren Liebermann,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-election-exit-poll-intl/index.html,"Jerusalem (CNN) Benjamin Netanyahu's hopes of securing a record fifth term as Israeli Prime Minister are on hold for the moment, after early results showed a tight election race with his main rival.
Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party appear neck and neck with the centrist Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz, with more than 90% of votes counted. Both sides are projected to win 35 seats each based on actual results, report Israel's Channel 12 and 13. Netanyahu's Likud party has secured 26.28% of the vote so far, while Gantz's Blue and White has 25.97% -- a difference of less than 13,000 votes, according to the results from the Central Elections Committee. But Netanyahu may have the advantage when it comes to putting together a coalition. His bloc, made up of the right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties, has 65 seats according to the latest results. A center-left bloc led by Gantz looks to have only 55 seats. To form a governing coalition, a candidate will need to put together 61 seats in the Israeli Knesset. Read More This picture could yet change if some of the smaller right-wing parties decide to support Gantz, a move observers say is unlikely. With no clear winner having yet to emerge, both Netanyahu and Gantz claimed victory on Tuesday evening. ""The right-wing bloc led by the Likud won a clear victory. I thank the citizens of Israel for the trust. I will start forming a right-wing government with our natural partners as soon as tonight,"" Netanyahu said. Gantz, meanwhile, said the election had one clear winner and that he, not Netanyahu, should be called on to form the next government. ""We won! The Israeli public has had their say!"" Gantz said in a statement. ""These elections have a clear winner and a clear loser. Netanyahu promised 40 seats and lost. The President can see the picture and should call on the winner to form the next government. There is no other option!"" Officially, it's up to Israel's President to decide who is tasked with forming the next government. He announces his decision after consulting with the heads of the political parties that have secured enough votes to enter the Knesset. These consultations take a few days, and the President is likely to announce his decision about a week after the elections. Netanyahu prepares to cast his vote on Tuesday. Gantz waves to his supporters after casting his vote earlier Tuesday. Netanyahu's veer to the right A tense night beckons for Netanyahu as he waits to see if his dream of becoming Israel's longest ever serving leader will be fulfilled. He would pass the founder of the state, David Ben Gurion, during the summer. Most of the final pre-election polls on Friday showed Netanyahu trailing by a few seats to Gantz. Casting himself as the underdog, Netanyahu veered sharply to his right in the final days of the campaign, pledging to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected, and warning his voter base that the end of his strong right-wing government would signal the beginning of a weak left-wing government. How Israel's political debate moved from peace talks to annexation Netanyahu fought the election in the face of looming indictments for bribery and breach of trust offenses. His campaign sought to portray his pending indictments as a witch-hunt led by left-wing elites and fed by the media. As CNN discovered when it visited a Likud stronghold in Beersheva, that message resonated strongly with many blue-collar Israelis. The local Likud organizer in the town compared Netanyahu to Moses, saying, ""The more they go after him, the stronger he becomes."" The election was called in December, ostensibly after the government gave up on efforts to get a new military draft law through Parliament. Netanyahu believed the timing was right -- sending voters to the polls before any indictments were brought against him, and with a message he could sell to the electorate. Speaking to his Likud lawmakers on the day the election was called, he said the outgoing government had ""outstanding achievements"" on which to campaign. Gantz enters the fray At first facing a diverse array of opponents, Netanyahu saw his challenge crystallize after a dramatic announcement in February, which saw three former army chiefs come together with a former TV news anchor-turned-politician to create the Blue and White party. The name was simple but significant. Blue and White are the colors of the Israeli flag. The message was equally simple: Blue and White had been created to reclaim the state of Israel from Prime Minister Netanyahu. The man who would lead that campaign and present himself as the anti-Netanyahu candidate was Gantz, a former head of the army, who had held that position under Netanyahu, fighting two wars in Gaza during his tenure. Bibi forever? Supporters in Netanyahu's heartland think so Gantz's entry into the political arena had been widely anticipated, and, indeed, hoped for in many quarters. Blue and White's polling numbers quickly surged, turning it into a two-horse race. The campaign was hard and personal. After it emerged that Iran had allegedly hacked Gantz's phone, Netanyahu questioned whether he could be trusted to keep the country safe if he couldn't look after his phone. Netanyahu loyalists also suggested Gantz had abandoned a dying soldier after an attack many years ago in the West Bank town of Nablus. Blue and White rejected the slur, and Gantz was also cleared by a military inquiry. For his part, the Prime Minister announced he intended to sue Gantz and his key ally, Moshe Ya'alon, after the latter suggested Netanyahu could be guilty of treason in connection with an investigation into military procurement. The ""Ultimate Deal"" lurks in the background During the race, Netanyahu -- known to supporters and detractors alike as ""Bibi"" -- focused on burnishing his status as a global player with close ties to both the President of the United States and the President of Russia. In a visit to Washington during the campaign, Donald Trump signed a proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, in defiance of the overwhelming international consensus. And in the election's closing days, on a visit to Moscow, Netanyahu was able to personally thank Vladimir Putin for Russia's key role in locating the body of an Israeli soldier who had been missing in Lebanon for nearly 37 years. As the election went into its final days, most polls showed Gantz with a slim lead over his rival. But the same polls suggested that Netanyahu's route to building a successful coalition would be more straightforward, due to the number of other right-wing parties projected to win seats. Why Trump and Netanyahu desperately need each other Lurking in the background throughout the campaign was the prospect that President Trump is set to unveil his plans soon for the ""Ultimate Deal"" -- his name for a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. Nevertheless, the conflict did not play a key role in the campaign, and there was little discussion by the main parties of the merits or otherwise of pursuing a two-state solution. And whatever coalition gets built, there remains the ticking clock that is the Attorney General's intention to indict Netanyahu pending a hearing within the next few months. One more hearing is expected over the summer. Any decision by the Attorney General to press forward and bring charges is certain to change the political landscape once again. As counting gets underway, a word of caution: exit polls in Israel, as in many other places, are notoriously unreliable. Four years ago, all three main Israeli networks' exit polls were badly off. All of them significantly underestimated Netanyahu's tally of seats, and two of the three actually suggested he would lose to his then-chief rival, Isaac Herzog.

Cantonese might not be so lucky,us.cnn.com,James Griffiths,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/asia/endangered-languages-welsh-hawaiian-cantonese-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) At work in central Hong Kong, David Hand is surrounded by people speaking Chinese and English. But inside his home, the Welsh language rules.
Hand's three children -- Arwen, Huw and Tomos -- have never lived in Wales, spending their entire lives in Asia. Inculcating his native language in them thousands of kilometers from the only place it is widely spoken wasn't easy. As well as only speaking to them in Welsh himself, Hand hired nannies from Wales -- usually teenagers taking time out between high school and university -- and arranged for them live to with the family. Their Australian mother speaks to them in English. ""As the kids were growing up until the age of five we always had a Welsh speaker at home in addition to me,"" Hand said. Read More ""It's about the mindset of thinking of yourself as Welsh and a Welsh speaker, and compare yourself to a French person or a Spaniard or a German. They wouldn't contemplate not teaching their children their own language."" Despite this, Hand's family is something of a rarity. Many Welsh speakers see their language skills diminish after they leave the country and switch to primarily speaking English or another language. There also aren't the international schools and other institutions available to French, German or Japanese who want their children to grow up speaking a particular language. Nor is the fact that the Hand children speak Welsh remarkable just due to where they live. Only a generation ago, the language was on the verge of dying out completely, joining the hundreds of other languages which have gone extinct in the last half century. Today it is spoken by about half a million people in Wales, or just under 19% of the population -- a rate which has remained stable for almost a decade. The story of the Welsh revival is one of tremendous organizing and effort by activists and politicians, who not only saved their own tongue but also established a blueprint of sorts which can be used by other languages under threat, including Hong Kong's own Cantonese. Such a blueprint is desperately needed. Languages are far more vulnerable than many people realize, and can die out in a single generation if not passed down from parent to child. This year is the United Nations International Year of Indigenous Languages , an event designed to raise awareness of the more than 1,700 languages listed as endangered by UNESCO. More and more languages die out every year. And even as digital tools and communities help in the fight against the decline, some experts warn changes in how we communicate online could drastically accelerate language extinction. Listen to an introduction to Welsh in that language. Language under threat (Iaith dan fygythiad) ""The Welsh language is a vast drawback to Wales, and a manifold barrier to the moral progress and commercial prosperity of the people."" So concluded an 1847 report prepared for the UK government in the wake of widespread social unrest in Wales which much of the English press blamed on the ""lack of education of the Welsh people."" ""It is not easy to overestimate its evil effects,"" the report said of the country's native language, adding ""there is no Welsh literature worthy of the name."" In the wake of the report, Welsh Nots , planks of heavy wood that were hung around students' necks if they were caught speaking Welsh in school, became a common sight across the country. As one teacher wrote in his school's log book in 1870: ""Endeavored to compel the children to converse in English by means of a piece of wood. Offenders to be shut in after school hours."" These attitudes, along with increased immigration to England, helped lead to a staggering drop in the use of Welsh. By the time Plaid Cymru -- the Party of Wales -- was founded in 1925, the number of Welsh speakers had fallen to 37% of the population and appeared headed into terminal decline. Growing up in west Wales in the 1950s and '60s, Toni Schiavone was constantly aware of the language's second-class status in the eyes of the English-speaking elite which governed the country. ""Our culture was being slowly destroyed,"" he said. ""Although I was born and grew up in a Welsh-speaking area, my education was 95% in the medium of English, everything around us was in English. It was being predicted that there would be no Welsh speakers by the turn of the century."" Schiavone was an early member of Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg -- the Welsh Language Society -- which organized to protect the country's native tongue via demonstrations and non-violent direct action. Members of Cymdeithas vandalized English-only road signs, staged sit-ins and protests, and campaigned for the establishment of a Welsh-language public television station, which was finally launched in 1982 as S4C. This took no small amount of commitment to the cause. ""In the 1970s people went to jail because road signs weren't available in Welsh, or because they refused to pay the TV license because we didn't have a Welsh language TV channel,"" Schiavone said. Thanks to pressure from groups like Cymdeithas and the growing electoral success of Plaid Cymru, the political winds began to turn in favor of Welsh. In 1993 a law was passed to permit the language's use in court and put it on an equal footing with English for all public services. In decades since, Welsh education has been ramped up nationwide and in 2011 it became the country's official language. The reversal in attitudes came not a moment too soon. At the 1991 census, only 18.5% of the population spoke Welsh, an all-time low. A decade later, however, that figure was more than 20% -- and the language's decline appears to have halted since, stabilizing at about a fifth of the population despite continued immigration from England and other countries. The government of Wales -- which won partial autonomy from the UK in 1997 -- is now thoroughly invested in promoting the Welsh language, setting a target of one million Welsh speakers by 2050, for an estimated population of around 3.5 million. ""We've turned the tide in that people genuinely expected the Welsh language to have been destroyed by now,"" Schiavone said. Listen to an introduction to Hawaiian in that language. Learning by example (Ke aʻoʻia e kahi hiʻohiʻona) Far from being on the verge of extinction, Welsh is often held up today as an example of how grassroots organizing and government support can revive a language. This was the case in Hawaii, where indigenous language activists were facing a much harder task than their Welsh counterparts, according to Gary Holton, a researcher with the Endangered Language Project . ""Almost everywhere the language had ceased to be a first language,"" he said. ""The break in transmission was fairly complete, it required a real effort to jump start the language again ... you had to essentially skip a generation, bring in these grandparents and great-grandparents and get them to interact with preschool-age children."" Ekela Kaniaupio-Crozier was one of the people who helped turn it around. A native Hawaiian speaker, she was a rarity among her school friends, and remembers being the only child attending a language class run by a local church. Despite this, she still struggled to overcome prejudices baked into Hawaiian society against the state's indigenous language. ""I was raised by my grandmother to speak the language. She was very adamant that I speak Hawaiian,"" she said. ""Because I thought it was strange I didn't really choose to speak it back to her but I understood everything."" After university -- in which she trained as a Hawaiian teacher -- Kaniaupio-Crozier became involved in the statewide campaign to revitalize the language. That project has seen remarkable success , leading to a generation of new second-language speakers who are able to pass Hawaiian on to their own children. The language has also become popular among non-indigenous Hawaiians, Holton said, and like in Wales, indigenous names have been restored to many locations. Media has also played a role, with public radio broadcasting a "" Hawaiian Word of the Day "" segment and the state's largest newspaper, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, running a weekly column in the language. Now in her late 50s, Kaniaupio-Crozier is at the cutting edge of digital language preservation and promotion. Along with several other teachers from the Kamehameha School network, she is working alongside a team from the Pittsburgh-based language app Duolingo to create a Hawaiian course for English speakers. On the Slack messaging app and via Skype, Kaniaupio-Crozier and her colleagues liaise with Duolingo developers to come up with bitesize chunks of Hawaiian people can learn and practice on the go through the app's gamified mobile interface. ""It's been interesting,"" she said. ""We're all language teachers, to try and figure out how to do it on this app has been a real challenge. For us to think in those terms, what's most important to somebody, what do they want to see? We had to think different, approach our language teaching differently."" Myra Awodey, a senior Duolingo community specialist, said minority languages had not been ""on our radar"" when the app was first launched. ""To have a big impact we were covering the big languages,"" she said. While there were many requests to add minority languages, developers often couldn't justify focusing on them over more widely used ones. Irish was the company's breakthrough moment. A team of volunteers built out a database for the language and ""blew us away,"" Awodey said. The course now has almost 1 million active learners, or about 60% of the total number of Irish speakers in Ireland itself . About 4 million people have used it at some point, Duolingo said. Since then, Duolingo has added Welsh (330,000 active learners), Esperanto (380,000), and the South American minority language Jopara (340,000), as well as High Valyrian and Klingon, two made-up languages from the TV shows ""Game of Thrones"" and ""Star Trek"" respectively. While serious concerns have been raised over the risk of "" digital language death "" -- whereby indigenous languages are not used on modern communication platforms, hastening their demise -- technology also plays a role in preserving languages. Apps and games, along with YouTube shows and podcasts, are new and increasingly successful ways of keeping a language alive and vibrant. David Hand, the Welsh-speaking Hong Konger, said the previous proliferation of Welsh-language books, music, TV shows and films all helped keep the language alive. Hand runs the St David's Society of Hong Kong , which organizes events for Welsh speakers and expats in the city, as well as fundraising for charity. ""One of the challenges of course about reinforcing (a) language is not to be backward looking,"" he said. ""To make it a living language rather than something to be protected."" But while both Welsh and Hawaiian are seeing a major resurgence, in Hand's adopted home there is increasing concern and paranoia about the future of the city's own native language: Cantonese. Listen to an introduction to Cantonese in that language. Language preservation (語言保育) Nestled at the foot of Castle Peak in Hong Kong's northwest New Territories, the huge white-brick expanse of Harrow International School looms over large green football fields. Students wearing blazers and straw boaters pass under neoclassical arches as they head to class inside the boarding school, reminiscent of a foregone era. But while its look may be old fashioned, Harrow has found itself embroiled in a thoroughly modern controversy. Earlier this year, the school announced it was dropping the traditional Chinese characters used in Hong Kong and Taiwan in favor of the simplified versions favored in China. In a letter to parents, Harrow defended the move as necessary ""to prepare our pupils to be fully literate in the context that Hong Kong will be in by 2047."" That is when the city's current constitutional arrangements expire and it could lose its semi-autonomy and be fully absorbed into China. Institutional support for education was pivotal in the revival of Welsh. It's an approach that has been adopted in Hawaii, Iceland and New Zealand, where the government has pledged to make Maori a core subject in all schools by 2025. However in Hong Kong, many fear Cantonese is heading in the opposite direction. Language has become a key battleground for those pushing back against encroachment from China and seeking to emphasize the city's unique identity in the shadow of its much larger neighbor. Some 144 Chinese languages are listed as in danger by UNESCO, with 24 on the verge of extinction -- including Manchu, the language spoken by the country's former imperial masters. That Cantonese could follow suit can seem alarmist, bordering on ridiculous. About 90% of Hong Kongers -- some 6.8 million people -- speak it as their first language, and a further 73 million people worldwide speak Cantonese or a closely related dialect. Yet the fear is that just as English pushed out Welsh as the dominant language of Wales, Mandarin -- the official language of China -- will increasingly replace Cantonese in Hong Kong, sending the latter tongue into decline. In the past decade, schools across Hong Kong have been encouraged by the government to switch to using Mandarin rather than Cantonese as the primary language in Chinese lessons, which officials say is intended to ""enhance the biliteracy and trilingualism of students."" While less than 20% of primary schools and only 2.5% of secondary schools use solely Mandarin to teach Chinese -- with the majority using a mix of Cantonese and Mandarin -- the figure is growing. Supporters of the policy say Mandarin competency increases the competitiveness of Hong Kongers in the job market and enables them to operate in China, where Cantonese is not widely spoken. There was outrage in October when Education Secretary Kevin Yeung suggested that continued use of Cantonese over Mandarin in the city's schools could mean Hong Kong would lose its competitive edge in the future. Concerns about Cantonese were on display in ""Ten Years,"" a hugely popular Hong Kong movie anthology released in 2016 which predicted a dark future for the city under Chinese rule . In one chapter titled ""Dialect,"" a taxi driver finds himself unable to work after a regulation requires fluency in Mandarin and marginalizes native Cantonese speakers. The man's son speaks primarily Mandarin, and the pair find it hard to communicate in Cantonese. This is already happening across the border in Guangdong province, the region of China where Cantonese (Gwongdungwa) originated. National government policies have been aggressive in pushing Mandarin as the medium of instruction in schools, often at the expense of regional languages and dialects. Television broadcasts and other media have also switched to Mandarin, and most young people in China use Pinyin, a system of inputting Chinese characters based on Mandarin, when they communicate online. ""What is happening with the renaissance of Welsh is the polar opposite of Cantonese,"" said Marco Kwan, founder of Words.hk, a website dedicated to documenting how the city's language is used in daily life. ""To preserve or promote or kill a language is largely dependent on educational policy."" While he says many defenders of the language overstate the risk it faces, Kwan is wary of a ""top-down aversion to Cantonese."" He says this is largely down to city officials and schools seeking to curry favor with the Chinese government by promoting Mandarin teaching in its stead. On the other side of the debate, he pointed to a ""worrying tendency to frame Cantonese as an integral part of the separatist movement, or a revolutionary element, which will make it harder to garner funding and be all the more detrimental to its development."" Holton, the endangered language researcher, was also skeptical of whether Cantonese could ever enter fatal decline due to the sheer number of first-language speakers in the Chinese diaspora. Nevertheless, he was sympathetic to the concerns expressed by many Hong Kongers, and said it was important even for speakers of major languages not to be complacent. ""Language survival is not just about taking speaker numbers into account,"" Holton said. ""Is it used in education, is it used in commerce, or is it only used in the home? ""If policy doesn't support the language, then that makes it difficult regardless of the number of speakers."""

Airbnb reverses stance on Israeli settlements,us.cnn.com,Sara Ashley O'Brien,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/tech/airbnb-reverses-israeli-settlement-stance/index.html," Airbnb has reversed its controversial stance to remove listings of rentals in Israeli settlements in the West Bank.
The company said Tuesday that it will allow listings in the region, but says it will not profit off them. Instead, any profits from the region will be donated to non-profits focused on humanitarian aid in different parts of the world, Airbnb said in its announcement. The updated policy comes as part of the settlement of lawsuits brought by hosts and potential hosts who objected to the company's move to ban listings in disputed areas, the company said. ""We understand the complexity of the issue that was addressed in our previous policy announcement,"" the company said. ""Airbnb has always opposed the [Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions] movement. Airbnb has never boycotted Israel, Israeli businesses, or the more than 20,000 Israeli hosts who are active on the Airbnb platform. We have always sought to bring people together and will continue to work with our community to achieve this goal."" In November 2018, Airbnb said it would remove listings in Israeli settlements ""at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians."" At the time, it said the decision would affect about 200 Airbnb listings. The move was praised by Palestinian leaders and condemned by Israeli leaders. Read More The announcement comes against the backdrop of a defining election in Israel on Tuesday that's still shaping up. Benjamin Netanyahu, who first served as prime minister from 1996 to 1999 and again since 2009, is vying to be the country's longest serving prime minister, if reelected. In his final days of campaigning ahead of the election, Netanyahu discussed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and pushed for annexation of the West Bank. Notably, the company said the policy doesn't just apply to the West Bank: It will also be implemented in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, two other disputed regions. The ""breakaway provinces"" are both officially part of Georgia but supported by Russia. ""Airbnb recognizes that there are many other disputed territories around the world,"" the company said. ""If Airbnb determines homes — the core of our business — are central to ongoing tensions, we will adopt the same approach."" -- CNN's Oren Liebermann contributed reporting"
Magic leaves Lakers front office job - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Steve Almasy, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/sport/magic-johnson-leaves-lakers/index.html,"(CNN) Magic Johnson , the beloved former point guard behind five world titles for the Los Angeles Lakers, announced Tuesday night he was quitting as the team's president of basketball operations.
Johnson was in his second full season in the position for the Lakers, who are 37-44 and will be sitting out the playoffs. The Lakers website says Johnson and General Manager Rob Pelinka are responsible for all basketball-related decisions. That included firing and hiring coaches and signing players to contracts. At an impromptu news conference Johnson told shocked reporters, ""I want to go back (to) having fun. I wanna go back being who I was before taking on this job,"" according to CNN affiliate KTLA . The Lakers released a statement following Johnson's announcement. The team said it was ""deeply grateful to Magic"" for all he has done as ""a player, an ambassador and an executive."" Read More The Lakers will work ""in a measured and methodical fashion to make the right moves for the future of our organization,"" the statement said. ""We thank (Johnson) for his work these past two years as our President of Basketball Operations and wish him, Cookie, Andre, EJ and Elisa all the best with their next steps,"" the statement said. ""He will always be not only a Lakers icon, but our family."" Johnson returned to the Lakers on February 2, 2017, to advise ownership on basketball and business. He wasted no time on saying what his intentions were and he was put in charge weeks later. Jeanie Buss, controlling owner of the Lakers, announced the hiring , saying, ""Together, (Magic), Luke (Walton) and our new general manager will establish the foundation for the next generation of Los Angeles Lakers greatness."" Walton is 98-147 as coach of the Lakers, who have not had a postseason game since 2013. Johnson said Tuesday he had more fun as a mentor to players, as a big brother figure. He said he couldn't do that in his business role. He appeared to hint that he would have had to fire Walton on Wednesday, and it pushed him toward stepping down. ""Tomorrow I would have to affect somebody's livelihood and their life,"" he said. ""That's not fun for me. That's not who I am."" Johnson said his team was ""halfway"" toward the progress he once promised, with superstar LeBron James joining the team this season. He said another star will join the team this summer. ""I think this team is really going to be able to contend for championships with the growth of the young players."" The basketball hall of famer told reporters Buss didn't know Johnson was going to quit, video posted on NBA.com shows. He complained about back-stabbing and whispering. ""I don't like a lot of things that went on that didn't have to go on,"" he said."

I have always been so open with you all about my family, fitness, pregnancies...and I don't want to keep this from you, just because it isn't as positive and shiny as the rest. I think it's important to show the truth...because my job is to help people by being real and open. Furthermore, I have no shame or embarrassment with this experience. I want to be a part of the effort to normalize miscarriage and remove the stigma from it. There is so much secrecy during the first trimester. This works for some, but I personally find it to be exhausting. I'm nauseous, tired, my body is changing. And I have to pretend that everything is just fine—and it truly isn't. I don't want to have to pretend anymore. I hope you understand. So, this is what is going on now: the embryo has a heartbeat, but it isn't strong, and the baby isn't growing very much. So we wait—and this is hard. So much uncertainty...but the chances are very, very small that this is a viable pregnancy. I have complete confidence that my family and I will get through this, even if the journey is difficult. I am so blessed with my amazing doctor, my dear friends, and my loving family...My husband and my four very healthy babies help me keep it together and have the perspective of how truly beautiful life is, even when it occasionally seems ugly. The luck and gratitude I feel that I am my babies' mommy, is wonderfully overwhelming and comforting. In your comments, please be kind. I'm feeling a bit fragile and I need support. I'm hoping, that by sharing this, I can contribute to raising awareness about this sensitive topic.

"The story of rhino poaching, elephant trampling and man-eating lions is even more complicated (opinion)",us.cnn.com,Craig Packer,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/opinions/poacher-lion-elephant-poverty-danger-packer/index.html,"Craig Packer is the director of the Lion Center , a research and conservation center at the University of Minnesota. The views his own. View more opinion on CNN.
(CNN) Lions eat people. In fact, they eat them all the time. And although the news last week focused on a suspected rhino poacher who was eaten by lions after being trampled by elephants, the story may tell us more about the hazards of poverty than about nature taking vengeance against the sins of mankind.
In southern Tanzania, lions attacked nearly 900 people in a 15-year period starting in the 1990s, and two-thirds of their victims died. The motive? Humans make a decent food source. These lions, who had lost most of their normal prey to habitat damage and human population growth, instead began consuming bush pigs, a native species that is also a serious and nocturnal crop pest. Craig Packer To protect their crops, subsistence farmers had to sleep in their fields at harvest time. Lions followed the pigs to the fields, and some learned to add sleeping farmers to their diet. A similarly desperate situation has persisted for many years in South Africa's Kruger National Park, which is located along the border with the much poorer nation of Mozambique. Impoverished Mozambicans seeking employment in South Africa have continuously attempted to cross Kruger Park on foot, and hundreds have ended up victims to Kruger's many lions. I once met a Kruger ranger who had recently performed a routine inspection of a dead lion in the middle of the park. Its stomach contents included a human hand. Read More In recent years, Kruger has attracted another type of illicit foot traffic: As home to one of the largest remaining populations of rhinos, it has drawn record numbers of poachers . From the point of view of a poor family in Mozambique, a single rhino horn is the equivalent of a year's salary. The risks of getting caught by rangers, trampled by elephants or eaten by lions may seem insubstantial compared to the opportunity to feed your entire family for a whole year. Not all rhino poachers are poor villagers -- the trade in illegal animal parts can attract a broad section of corrupt society , including drug dealers and gun traders. And while I don't know if last week's suspected poacher was acting out of desperation or greed, the fact that he was on foot implies a similar dilemma as a Tanzanian farmer who must choose between the near certain loss of his sole crop of the year versus the risks of a lion attack. So, when I read about the death of the Kruger rhino poacher, I thought first of the poverty that drives so many people toward danger. Add in Mozambique's overwhelming humanitarian disaster caused by last month's Cyclone Idai, and there's even more reason to ask what drove this man into the park in the first place. The combination of rhino poaching, elephant trampling and man-eating lions may have captured the attention of the moment, but this man wasn't the first -- and he won't be the last. Stay up to date...

In the industrialized world, we view lions and elephants with affection and an enduring sense of awe. But all-pervasive poverty is the root cause of the conservation crisis in Africa -- land is increasingly scarce, elephants trample crops and lions kill livestock and people. The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals aim to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030 . If this lofty ambition were actually to be achieved, we might one day be justified in considering a trampled poacher to have received his just deserts, but until then, let's also consider the possibility that his death might signify a much larger problem."

(CNN) If newly-minted Attorney General William Barr thought he could skate through his Congressional testimony -- purportedly about the Justice Department's budget proposal for the fiscal year 2020 -- without addressing what one congressional leader referred to as the ""elephant in the room,"" he was sorely mistaken .
Caroline Polisi Instead, Barr faced relentless questions regarding his handling of the Mueller report at every turn, not to mention the Justice Department's handling of the Trump administration's attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act. And while he generally stayed cool under fire, he actually revealed quite a few new pieces of information about the national mystery surrounding his intentions with respect to the release of the Mueller report. Among them are: The wait is almost over . Barr stated affirmatively that he is still on track to release the redacted report within a week. Not only will the redactions be color-coded according to which of Barr's previously-stated four categories of withheld information they happen to fall into, but Barr also said he plans to provide explanatory documentation justifying each redaction. This will (hopefully) minimize contention among members of Congress over the redactions; at the very least, it will provide Congress with a more specific road map toward which pieces of redacted information they may want to challenge. The public -- not Congress -- will get the first look at the redacted report. Barr made one thing certain. His first agenda item is to release as much of the report as he can to the public at large. And he does not plan on seeking a court order to release grand jury information (which, according to the Federal rules of criminal procedure , must be kept secret unless certain exceptions are met), something Democrats have demanded in recent days. Instead, after the initial release of the report to the public, Barr said he plans to engage with the chairmen of both Congressional judiciary committees in order to deal with potential backlash.

Barr expects to release Mueller report within a week 02:50 He's sticking to his guns and doubling down on his view of what is required of him under the special counsel regulations. Barr was asked what justified him in claiming discretion to withhold information related to the privacy concerns and reputational interests of ""peripheral"" individuals who were not charged in the investigation. He noted that, not only do the special counsel regulations not require any disclosure to the public of any information at all, the Department of Justice's longstanding policy and practice to decline to release damaging or derogatory information about a person if they are not being criminally charged is also guiding his decision-making process. He invoked James Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email scandal here as an example of what not to do. Mueller declined to review Barr's four-page letter. While he emphasized that neither the White House nor the special counsel was involved in the drafting of his now-infamous four-page letter of March 24, 2019, Barr said in the hearing that he did provide Robert Mueller the opportunity to review it, which Mueller declined. In defending his decision to release just the ""bottom line conclusions"" of the special counsel's investigation, Barr insisted that those conclusions were simply ""binary"" -- crimes were either charged or they were not. And while he said he endeavored to use ""as much of the special counsel's own language"" as he could ( which amounted to 101 words ), his letter was never meant to ""summarize"" the report.

Investigate the investigators. Perhaps the most newsworthy revelation is the attorney general's confirmation that Inspector General Michael Horowitz is in the midst of an investigation into the surveillance tactics used by the FBI and Justice Department during the summer of 2016. That report is likely to be released in May or June. Meanwhile, Trump and Republicans have been demanding an investigation into why and how the investigation of the Trump campaign began."

(CNN) The 2020 presidential election marks the first time more than two women have competed in the Democratic or Republican primaries, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Democratic congresswomen Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have all thrown their hats in the ring. And Marianne Williamson, a bestselling author and a spiritual counselor to Oprah, is also running.
Kara Alaimo While this is refreshing to see, an analysis of media coverage published by Northeastern University's School of Journalism finds that the percentage of positive words being used to describe the women is significantly lower than media sentiment about male candidates. But the problem isn't just the media. Studies suggest women are likely to face extra hurdles to winning over voters, as well -- simply because of their gender. In order for a woman to be elected president, a lot of us may need to re-examine some of our subconscious ways of thinking. Research indicates that voters may unknowingly discriminate against female candidates for president because a woman has never held the position, and therefore a woman won't appear to be a ""fit"" for the role. Scholars call this the gender-incongruency hypothesis . For example, studies have shown that female candidates don't do worse than men when they run for local and state-wide office, but they don't fare as well when they run for president. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand: Americans deserve a brave president In a 2007 study published in the journal Basic and Applied Social Psychology, when students were given identical resumes of candidates who they were told were running for president -- a position which, of course, has never been held by a woman -- they judged the candidate to have more presidential potential and to have had a better career when the candidate was named Brian than when the person was named Karen. But when students were shown resumes of candidates running for Congress -- where women already hold seats -- they didn't judge Brian more positively than Karen. A 2008 study of likely Ohio voters found similar results. When potential voters were asked about candidates who the researchers determined had similar credentials at the time -- Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Dole, John Edwards, Rudy Giuliani, and John McCain -- they perceived the men to be more qualified. They were also more likely to vote for a candidate who was not in their own political party when the candidate from their party was female. The researchers noted that the results, published in the Journal of Women, Politics & Policy, suggest that ""the presence of a woman candidate opponent for president may aid the competition."" (The language is telling in that they, too, appeared to assume ""the competition"" would be male). Read More Kamala Harris' plan for teachers is good policy and great politics Cornell University philosophy professor Kate Manne argued in her 2018 book ""Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny"" that when women run for public office or try to move into other domains that have typically been dominated by men, they are often judged hostilely by both men and women -- and by liberals and conservatives alike. But, Manne said, voters often don't realize they're being misogynistic. Instead, she said , ""Our minds subsequently search for a rationale to justify our ill feelings. Her voice is shrill; she is shouting; and why isn't she smiling?"" Manne also reported in the book that women are less likely to be perceived as competent. When they are considered competent, they're often disliked and considered polarizing. She said female candidates are also often judged to be untrustworthy ""on no ostensible basis"" and women's claims are viewed as less credible than claims by men. Then, when women defend themselves from unfair attacks, they're accused of ""playing the victim."" The next president: the polar opposite of Trump? ""To be sure, not every female politician ... is subject to such suspicion, condemnation, and the desire to see them punished,"" Manne wrote. ""But, when the mud-slinging does begin, it quickly tends to escalate. And there tends to be not only a pile-on ... but an 'oozing' effect -- where the suspicion and criticism encompasses every possible grounds for doubt about her competence, character, and accomplishments."" Manne cited reactions to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign as an example. She also noted that, like Clinton, former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard was portrayed by rival politicians and the media as a liar and investigated on allegations that ultimately proved unfounded. What's the solution? Manne told me that because these biases are so often unconsciously applied -- even by well-meaning people who want women to advance, like herself -- voters should engage in ""candidate comparisons"" when judging presidential contenders. ""If you are critical of a woman on certain grounds, you should look toward your favorite male politician and see whether he has similar features,"" she said. ""It can actually be quite surprising how certain criticisms go under the radar when it's a male candidate."" For example, Manne noted that Klobuchar has been accused in the media of mistreating her staff. (Klobuchar acknowledged in a CNN forum that she has sometimes been ""a tough boss"" and ""pushed people too hard.""). Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

Yet Bernie Sanders -- the frontrunner among declared Democratic candidates -- has also been accused of mistreating his aides, but those allegations don't seem to have gotten the same media attention. One former staffer told the Vermont newspaper Seven Days in 2015 that Sanders was ""unbelievably abusive"" and claimed ""to have endured frequent verbal assaults."" The paper reported that others who worked for Sanders also said that ""the senator is prone to fits of anger."" A spokesperson for Sanders responded to Seven Days and said that Sanders ""had very positive relations with people who have worked with him."") And Sanders, in response to the article, told the Des Moines Register , ""Yes, I do work hard. Yes, I do demand a lot of the people who work with me. Yes, some people have left who were not happy. But I would say that by and large in my Senate office, in my House office, on my campaigns, the vast majority of people who have worked with me considered that to be a very, very good experience..."" Ultimately, the solution to women not appearing to fit the role of president because a woman has never been president seems obvious: Voters need to elect a woman president. But, in order for that to happen, even those of us who are eager to empower women may need to rethink how we judge female candidates."
Kirsten Gillibrand is one of six women seeking the Democratic nomination and one of six senators running for president,www.cnn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/kirsten-gillibrand-town-hall/index.html,"23 hr 1 min ago Inside the Green Room with Kirsten Gillibrand
Democratic presidential hopeful Kirsten Gillibrand just chatted with CNN and answered a few questions after tonight's town hall.
Weasked her five, simple questions so voters can get to know her better.
Here's what she said:
CNN : What's one thing about you that surprises people?
Gillibrand : ""One thing that surprises people about me is that I used to speak Chinese.""
CNN : What’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever received?
Gillibrand : ""Never give up. Be brave. Be bold. Believe in yourself.""
CNN : What’s your favorite movie and why?
Gillibrand : ""Wonder Woman 'cause she's kick-ass and she's strong and bold and brave and never gives up.""
CNN : What three issues do we have to deal with right now?
Gillibrand : ""A lot — global climate change, making sure we have health care as a right not a privilege, making sure people who want to be working or underemployed or unemployed have a job. Full employment.""
CNN : Name one thing that makes you different than all the other 2020 Democratic candidates.
Gillibrand : ""Well I have a very different story and I come from a rural part of a state as diverse as New York. I won a 2 to 1 Republican district twice and then I brought my whole state together with the highest vote total at 72% and bring people together in Congress all the time. I actually pass a lot of legislation big bills like 9/11 health bill and ""Don't ask, don't tell"" repeal and small bills like the 18 bills that passed in the last Congress, like more money for rural broadband or more money for manufacturing."" 11:43 p.m. ET, April 9, 2019 Gillibrand on her faith: ""I define myself by my faith. It centers me.""
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand was asked Tuesday night about her faith, specifically where it fit in the Democratic Party and if there is room for a religious left.
""Perfect question for me,"" she answered. ""I go to two Bible studies a week and a prayer breakfast. And so my faith is really important to me.""
She added that Democrats are better on some Christian principles than Republicans: ""I think anyone should be able to have faith, whether they're ultraconservative or liberal. And if you're coming from a Christian perspective, I would say the gospel doesn't leave anybody out. Because are you feeding the poor? Are you helping the sick? Are you visiting the incarcerated? Do you believe in helping the least among us? Do you believe in the golden rule? Do you treat others the way you want to be treated? I would argue the Democrats are often better on those issues than Republicans. So there's no reason you can't be a person of any faith in any political party.""
When she was asked if she ever felt like being a person of faith in the Democratic Party was ""odd,"" since conservatives in the Republican party tend to be more outspoken in their religious beliefs, she answered, ""No.""
""I define myself by my faith. It centers me. It's something that is one of the reasons why I'm running for president,"" she said. 11:11 p.m. ET, April 9, 2019 Should the voting age be lowered? Here's what Gillibrand said
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said she doesn't know if the voting age should be lowered.
""I don't know. I really don't know. I like the idea of it because we want to inspire more young people. But I like the fact that when you turn 18, you earn this right. It's a special right. It's a right of passage. It's also the time when you're independent of your parents as a matter of law. So I like the simplicity of 18,"" she said.
Gillibrand went on to say she would think about it. 11:05 p.m. ET, April 9, 2019 Gillibrand greets audience during the break
Democratic presidential candidate Kirsten Gillibrand took a few moments to shake hands and talk to voters during the commercial breaks.
Check out the moment: 11:02 p.m. ET, April 9, 2019 Gillibrand casts her record on guns from a conservative NY district as a benefit, not a flaw From CNN's Dan Merica
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand argued on Tuesday that the fact she once held an A-rating with the National Rifle Association makes her better equipped to talk to gun owners about the need for gun control.
Gillibrand, a mother of two, also said the way to reach conservatives on this issue is to make it about family and children.
“I think I can walk into any voter in a red state or a purple state or a blue state, gun owners, NRA members, and say, you do care about a four-year-old dying on a park bench in Brooklyn, don’t you,” Gillibrand said. “And the humanity of each person in this country should kick in.” She added: “And you are going to ask them to imagine that happening to their own child, their own loved one, and their own family. And I think you can change hearts that way.”
Gillibrand said earlier this year that she was “embarrassed” by her past positions on guns. She began to changed her position after she became a senator and met with Jennifer Pryear and Alberto Yard, the parents of Nyasia Pryear-Yard, a young woman who was killed in a 2009 shooting in Brooklyn.
“So, I had an A-rating as a House member,” she said in Iowa earlier this year. “I only really looked at guns through the lens of hunting. My mother still shoots the Thanksgiving turkey. But when I became senator, I recognized I had a lot to learn about my state and all of the 20 million I was going to represent.” 10:56 p.m. ET, April 9, 2019 Gillibrand on vaccines: We need to do a better job of educating parents about preventable diseases
Asked if she would support making vaccines mandatory, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said she needed to think about it before answering, but she added that parents need more information on preventable diseases overall.
""I haven't thought about whether I would make it mandatory. I would need to think about that. But I do believe that parents need more information about why vaccines are so essential. Parents need to know that their child could die of preventable diseases, that they could spread a preventable disease and other children could die,"" she said.
Gillibrand said she thinks vaccines save lives and that parents are just afraid because of rumors and myths.
""I think parents have been afraid. I think they've been made afraid by rumors and myths and, you know, fake news. So I think that we need to do a much better job of educating parents about the essential nature of vaccines. It does save lives, and I will work as hard as I can to make sure that every parent knows that vaccines are absolutely necessary,"" she said. 10:50 p.m. ET, April 9, 2019 Gillibrand's son's advice before running for president? ""Don't make any mistakes, mom""
When Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand decided to enter the race, she said she sat down with her two sons over the holidays to go over the decision.
The New York Democrat said they told her, ""Yeah, mom, this is really important."" Her son, Theo and Henry, also gave advice. ""Don't make any mistakes, mom, and don't say the wrong words,"" Henry, told her.
She went on to say her sons have been ""exceedingly encouraging and they believe in this mission."" 10:49 p.m. ET, April 9, 2019 Here’s how Gillibrand would address health care
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand just heard from two members of the audience with health challenges who asked how she would negotiate the health care challenges Americans face. Does she support Medicare for All? Would she banish private health care companies? Here's what she said.
""I'm for Medicare for All, and I believe the best way to get there is let people buy in, and that's how we get to single payer over a very short transition, period,"" she said, laying out her support for the a key legislative priority that has pushed the Democratic party to the left both in Congress and the 2020 presidential primary. She then added that ""part of the corruption and greed in Washington"" is traced directly to the ""insurance industry as the middleman for health care.""
""Because they don't necessarily care about which surgeries you need or which medicine you need or how many days in the hospitals you need,"" she added. ""Ultimately they're for-profit companies, and they ever to care about their bottom line and their shareholders. I think that's the misalignment in health care today,"" she said.
And what for the private insurance companies?
""You have to see if they want to compete or not. I don't think they will... If the insurance industry wants to continue to participate to offer some kind of coverage for some kind of things, they'll have to compete for those customers. But if you let Americans choose basic medicare which is affordable, I don't see that most Americans wouldn't choose it,"" she explained. 10:46 p.m. ET, April 9, 2019 Gillibrand doesn’t think comments about Bill Clinton hurt her relationship with Hillary Clinton From CNN's Dan Merica
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said Tuesday that her comments that former President Bill Clinton should have resigned amid the Monica Lewinsky scandal did not cost her the close relationship she had with Hillary Clinton.
Gillibrand told the New York Times in 2017 that Bill Clinton’s resignation would have been “the appropriate response.”
“I don’t think so,” Gillibrand said when asked whether the comment cost her the bond she has with Hillary Clinton, someone the US senator from New York counts as a mentor.
Gillibrand went on to say that she has talked to Hillary Clinton about her 2020 run and that the former secretary of state has given her advice. “Secretary Clinton is still a role model for all of us,” Gillibrand said. “My views on her husband is very different. And I’ve said all I’m going to say about that.”
Gillibrand added: “She’s somebody who I still admire and look up to, and she’s given a lot to this country.”
Hillary Clinton wrote the forward on Gillibrand’s memoir and Gillibrand went on to write that the former secretary of state changed her life by inspiring her to run.
“My commitment to Hillary was personal,” Gillibrand wrote. Search "
"Jill Noe, former basketball star, is carrying twin babies for her twin sister - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Loumay Alesali and Amanda Jackson,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/jill-noe-surrogates-for-her-twin-sister-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) When her sister couldn't get pregnant, this twin stepped up to make her dreams come true.
Jill Noe and Whitney Bliesner, 34, from Portland, Oregon, have always shared a special bond because they are twins. That bond is growing stronger, as Noe has become a surrogate for Bliesner. Bliesner was diagnosed with a rare genetic disease called Neurofibromatosis type 2, or NF2, which is the growth of noncancerous tumors in the nervous system, according to the US National Library of Medicine. NF2 stopped Bliesner from having children, since pregnancy puts her at a higher risk of tumors due to hormonal changes, according to Noe, a former basketball star who played at Arizona State University. Bliesner always dreamed about being a mother, especially after she married her husband, Peter, three years ago. Over the holidays in 2017, she told Noe she didn't think her dream would become a reality. Bliesner said it was too expensive for her to get a surrogate or adopt a child. Read More At that moment, Noe recalled to CNN, she could hear the sound of defeat from her sister and didn't think twice about volunteering to be her surrogate. ""I was like, yeah! Let's just do it!"" Noe said. ""Let's just see where this goes and let's see if I can get my body to where it needs to be to have your kids."" Noe said her twin looked at her in disbelief before the joy rushed over her face. ""I was very happy and excited, but also shocked,"" Bliesner said. ""Because I know how active and fun and exciting her life is, and for her to want to actually stop that for me was just kind of like a shock."" Bliesner faced several health issues because of her condition, including hearing loss in her right ear that she said can be passed on genetically. She also had a partial hysterectomy because of fibroid tumors. ""We couldn't use my eggs because there's a 50/50 chance I could pass it on and I just don't think I would be able to live with myself if I knew I passed this condition to my kids,"" Bliesner said. Noe is now 30 weeks along in her pregnancy with a healthy set of twins, a boy and a girl, due June 6. The soon-to-be parents have already picked out the names, Rhett for the boy and Rhenley for the girl. Noe and Bliesner have been supported by their family, especially their mother, whom Noe described as ""the catalyst"" for them to be such a strong family. ""It's just instilled in me and Whitney, and obviously my other siblings, that no matter what adversities we faced, we're always there together and we'll go through it as one big strong unit,"" Noe said."
This drug-resistant fungus is spreading. Scientists warn of new superbugs to come,us.cnn.com,"Michael Nedelman, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/candida-auris-fungus-drug-resistance/index.html,"(CNN) It began in 2009 , when doctors in Tokyo swabbed the ear of a 70-year-old woman and found an unknown strain of fungus that can infect humans and, in severe cases, cause a blood infection in high-risk patients. It's called Candida auris.
Now, a decade after it was discovered, cases have been reported in more than 30 countries around the globe -- including the United States, Australia, India, Germany, Israel, Venezuela and South Africa, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When you need antibiotics -- and when you don't But how we got here is a mystery: While the fungus seems to have cropped up relatively recently, its genetics reveal distinct groups that evolved apart, on different continents. ""We really can't explain that ... unless it goes back thousands of years,"" said Dr. Tom Chiller, chief of the CDC's Mycotic Diseases Branch. But when scientists went looking for C. auris in old samples -- knowing that earlier tests may have misidentified it or not picked it up -- it was hardly anywhere to be found. Read More ""It's a bit of a paradox, really,"" said Dr. David Eyre, an infectious disease physician based at Oxford University. ""Why has it suddenly come to cause a problem at a similar time in different parts of the world?"" Could it have to do with our use of antibiotics and antifungal drugs? Changes in the health care environment? Or perhaps it's some other evolutionary change, experts wonder. ""We've got an estimated 5 to 6 million different species of fungi. Only a few hundred cause human disease,"" Chiller explained. ""So there's a ton of potential for more things to emerge. ""Why did this Candida emerge?"" A fungus that acts 'like a bacteria' To Chiller, the emergence of C. auris highlights the danger of antimicrobial resistance: the rise of ""superbugs"" that threaten to render many of our tried-and-true drugs powerless. But there's something different about this fungus. ""It's a yeast that's acting like a bacteria,"" he said. Other species of Candida already travel with us -- on our skin, in our guts -- and they don't tend to cause infections unless there's an imbalance. This can happen, for example, when antibiotics wipe out good bacteria with the bad, leaving a place for Candida to grow. When this happens in the mouth, it's commonly referred to as thrush. In the vagina, it's a yeast infection. But most Candida is not known to be transmitted in health care settings, and C. auris is. Progress on deadly staph infections slows; CDC calls for increased prevention According to the CDC , C. auris can travel through health care facilities by lingering on surfaces and medical equipment, or it can spread directly from one person to another. In a study published in October, Eyre and his colleagues found 70 cases of C. auris in Oxford University Hospitals over the course of roughly 2½ years, from February 2015 to August 2017. All but a handful had been admitted to its neurosciences ICU. Until public health authorities put out alerts about the fungus and doctors began actively looking for it, ""we weren't aware that Candida auris was such a big issue,"" Eyre said. But it would be several months before they could contain the problem. They used protective gear, changed how they cleaned, scaled back on bedside equipment and took other measures to stop the spread. ""But despite doing those, we continued to see new cases,"" Eyre said. Finally, they found the culprit: a probe for monitoring patients' temperatures. Doctors stopped using the probes, but the fungus still lingered. Study: Superbug genes from India found in Arctic ""Even taking away the main culprit, it was still able to hang around for a few more months before we could get rid of it completely."" Eyre said this was a success story: Only a handful of patients had had invasive fungal infections, no deaths were directly linked to it, and they haven't had a problem since. But he warns that it might not be so straightforward for other places, especially ones dealing with more resistant types of C. auris than he did. Samples of the fungus sent to the CDC are often resistant to one or two key antifungal drugs, the agency says . And it can develop resistance to another while a patient is being treated. ""When it becomes resistant, it stays resistant,"" Chiller said, even though other microbes may lose their resistance when those drugs are no longer used against it. ""We've seen it become resistant to all three classes of antifungals, making it a superbug, making it really untreatable, because there is no drug that kills it."" Using drugs responsibly In the United States, 587 confirmed clinical cases have been reported in 12 states as of February 28, according to the CDC. Over 1,000 additional patients have been found to be colonized with the fungus through targeted screening in seven of these states. The world is running out of antibiotics, WHO says Most of the clinical cases have been found in New York, Illinois and New Jersey -- with 309, 144 and 104 confirmed cases, respectively. Chiller said that C. auris is ""another hard-to-treat organism in a patient population that's already really challenging to treat ... the sickest of the sick."" The patients Dr. Susan Bleasdale has seen in Illinois, for example, are chronically ill people who acquired the fungus in long-term care facilities, where they receive a number of other medical treatments. Fortunately, most of the cases she's seen have still been treatable with common antifungals, but she added that the appearance of C. auris underscores why we need to use drugs like antibiotics and antifungals responsibly. Get
""It's not about using less antibiotics. It's about using the right antibiotic for the right diagnosis and for the right duration of time,"" said Bleasdale, director of infection control and antimicrobial stewardship at the University of Illinois Hospital and Clinics. When it comes to bacteria, drug-resistant infections affect 2 million people a year in the United States, killing at least 23,000, the CDC says. And drug-resistant infections more broadly could claim 10 million lives per year around the globe by 2050 -- up from today's 700,000, according to one estimate . ""We live in a world covered with antibiotics,"" Chiller said. ""We really need to be thinking hard about how we use those drugs."""
Catholic bishop charged with raping nun in India - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Sugam Pokharel,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/india/india-kerala-catholic-bishop-rape-intl/index.html,"New Delhi (CNN) Police in India have charged a Catholic bishop with raping a nun, following months of protests and allegations of a coverup.
Bishop Franco Mulakkal is accused of raping a nun multiple times between 2014 and 2016 at a church guest house in Kerala, in the country's southwest. The police official who led the investigation, K. Subash, told CNN the charge sheet against Mulakkal had statements from 83 witnesses, including a cardinal, three bishops, 11 priests and 25 nuns. Medical reports show the nun was raped, Subash said. Mulakkal was arrested in September following sustained protests by nuns in the area accusing police of a coverup. He was released on bail about a month after arrest. Read More The 44-year-old nun, who has not been named, first filed a police report in June, accusing Mulakkal of raping her 13 times between 2014 and 2016. She alleged the abuse occurred while Mulakkal was staying in Kerala in a guest house belonging to the St. Francis Mission Home. Mulakkal is the bishop of Jalandhar, a city in India's northern Punjab state. His diocese said the bishop was a frequent visitor to Kerala for church-related events. Christianity is a minority religion in India, practiced by 2.3% of the population, according to the most recent census data, but Kerala is home to a sizable Christian community that dates back hundreds of years. The majority are Catholics. According to recent government figures, the southern state is home to more than 6 million Christians, or 19% of the population. Communities there draw their heritage from Thomas the Apostle, who is traditionally believed to have traveled to India to preach the gospel in the first century."
Fear stalks ordinary Kashmiris as Indian election approaches - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Nikhil Kumar,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/india/kashmir-constant-fear-intl/index.html,"Uri, Indian controlled Kashmir (CNN) If it wasn't for the military installations that dot the mountain passes, the endless coils of barbed wire, or the armed soldiers around every corner, this small border town in Indian controlled Kashmir might be mistaken for a tranquil mountain paradise.
The air is cool and the surrounding peaks are capped with snow, blindingly white in the early Spring sun. But the tremor and the terror in Mohammad Riyad's voice as he recalls what happened in the middle of the night in late February betrays the true reality of the situation. Riyad lives in a small village just beyond the town of Uri, in the shadow of the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides this disputed region between India and Pakistan. It is one of the world's most militarized frontiers, the site of frequent armed showdowns between the two nuclear foes, both of which claim Kashmir in its entirety. Violence here is always just a hair trigger away. Read More Shelling across the frontier is common. According to official figures tabled in the Indian parliament in March last year, cross border firing incidents along the LoC have risen dramatically in recent years, from 152 in 2015 to 860 in 2017. Riyad and numerous other local residents say the situation has worsened in recent weeks. Mohammad Riyad shows the scars he received after shrapnel split open his abdomen. ""I was asleep when a shell landed right outside my window,"" he says, his voice cracking as he lifts up his shirt to reveal what happened next: Shrapnel rained down on his bed, splitting open his abdomen. Emergency surgery in Srinagar, main city in Indian controlled Kashmir, saved his life. A blackish ladder of stitches runs up and across his stomach. Thankfully, he says, his wife and children were sleeping away from the window and escaped without any injuries. The family remains fearful of further attacks. ""It could happen again tonight."" Constant tension Tensions across the region spiked after a February 14 car bomb attack on Indian forces in south Kashmir. Forty Indian paramilitaries died, making it the worst ever attack on Indian forces stationed here. Delhi, which says Pakistan had a ""direct hand"" in the bombing, responded by sending fighter jets across the LoC, deploying air power to strike in its opponent's territory for the first time in five decades. India says it was targeting a training camp run by the group behind the attack, an account Pakistan disputes. Islamabad also denies any role in the bombing. Next came an aerial skirmish between the two sides, and then the capture of an Indian pilot by Pakistan. The town of Uri in Indian controlled Kashmir, close to the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides this disputed region between India and Pakistan. The pilot's quick release helped reduce hostilities, pulling the two countries back from a violent spiral that many observers feared could tip into all out war and, in the most extreme scenario, even give rise to a nuclear clash. But, locals here say, the two sides continue to fire artillery shells across the LoC, each side blaming the other for the violence. Meanwhile, as India gears up for national elections set to begin on April 11, the conflict has become a major campaign issue, with India's nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his allies holding up the recent air skirmishes as proof that he's strong on defense -- stronger, they insist, than his predecessors and rivals. Signposts on the road between Uri and Srinagar. In a recent interview with the local Economics Times daily, Amit Shah, President of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and his closest political aide, said: ""Until now, there were only two countries which took revenge for the martyrdom of their soldiers -- the US and Israel. Because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is now the third country to do so."" In case there was any doubt about whether the BJP wanted to make national security an election issue, Shah added : ""National elections have to be fought on who can ensure better national security."" Modi has also referred to the border tensions. ""Enough is enough,"" he said at a public event in March, referring to the February attack, and an earlier 2016 attack on a military installation in Uri, according to the Indian news agency PTI. ""We cannot keep suffering till eternity."" Mohammad Ansar, 16, was knocked unconscious when a shell landed close to where he stood. 'Out of nowhere' As politicians' grandstand, fear stalks ordinary Kashmiris, like 16-year-old Mohammad Ansar, who lives in another village near the de facto border. Ansar was at home having lunch with his mother and two brothers in mid-March when they heard the sound of shelling outside. ""We ate and then went outside to see where it was coming from when a shell landed right where were standing,"" he says. Ansar says it seemed to come out of nowhere. ""It was quiet when we went outside. We didn't hear anything and suddenly it hit us."" Babur Ali and his wife say they have become refugees in their own land. Ansar was knocked down and suffered a head wound. His brothers, both ten, and his mother were also injured: One of the young boys still has a cast around one leg, and bandages around the other. Their mother's neck and shoulders are covered with surgical bandages. ""We're still very scared,"" Ansar says. ""Every time I hear a loud noise, I panic."" So do Babur Ali's children. Ali used to live near the border, but increased shelling in the aftermath of the February air skirmishes forced him to flee with his family. Babur Ali's children now live in temporary housing near Srinagar. Huddled together in temporary housing near Srinagar in the biting Kashmiri cold, he says his children are terrified of returning to their village because of the shelling. ""We had to leave our home, our possessions, everything... we had no choice."" With Kashmir still tense, they've become refugees in their own land."

I couldn't be prouder of the person that gymnastics has made me to become. It's taught me hard work, humility, integrity, and dedication, just to name a few. It's given me challenges and road blocks that I would have never imagined that has tested who I am as a person. It may not have ended the way I had planned, but nothing ever goes as planned. Thank you Auburn family for giving me a home and a chance to continue doing the sport that will always be my first love. I am honored to have had the privilege to represent the navy and orange AU for the past 4 years with my team by my side. Thank you for letting me share my passion with you. Thank you for letting me be a part of something bigger than myself. War Eagle Always 💙🧡

Six takeaways from CNN's presidential town - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Dan Merica,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-town-hall-takeaways/index.html,"(CNN) Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Tuesday did something most politicians aren't willing to do: Unequivocally admit when they think they've made a mistake.
Gillibrand came into CNN's town hall with a long list of progressive policies that she regularly touts on the campaign trail. But she also stepped into the spotlight with a record that includes conservative positions on immigration and guns, something that has followed her throughout her 2020 campaign and raised questions about her progressive credentials. Gillibrand looked to both apologize for her past record while also using that history as proof of her ability to reach out and connect with conservative voters on Tuesday night. The US senator from New York, who officially launched her campaign in March in outside President Donald Trump's eponymous hotel in Manhattan, has so far failed to break out of the large and growing pack of Democrats running for president in 2020, but the CNN town hall offered Gillibrand a platform to do just that. 'It's really important ... to admit when you're wrong' Read More Gillibrand said on Tuesday that she was ""ashamed"" of her past conservative views on immigration, telling voters that she believes she is in the ""right place"" right now. Gillibrand ran and won a House seat near Albany, New York, in 2006 by attacking her Republican opponent from the right on immigration and guns, calling securing the border ""a national security priority."" Gillibrand said her policy positions at the time did not treat people like she would want to be treated. ""I did not do that as a House member. I was ashamed,"" she said. She built on that answer Tuesday night by arguing her ability to admit she is wrong sets her apart from Trump. Kirsten Gillibrand takes questions at CNN town hall ""When I was a member of Congress from upstate New York, I was really focused on the priorities of my district. When I became senator of the entire state, I recognized that some of my views really did need to change,"" Gillibrand said. ""They were not thoughtful enough and didn't care enough about people outside of the original upstate New York district that I represented. So, I learned."" She added: ""And I think for people who aspire to be president, I think it's really important that you're able to admit when you're wrong and that you're able to grow and learn and listen and be better, and be stronger. That is something that Donald Trump is unwilling to do. He is unwilling to listen, he is unwilling to admit when he's wrong. He's actually incapable of it. And I think it's one of the reasons why he is such a cowardly president."" Gillibrand's more conservative record is one of the key criticisms her candidacy receives from the left, but it shows how the 2020 candidate's early strategy is to face up to questions about her record and not run away from them, believing that embracing her story and evolution on issues like guns and immigration could win plaudits from caucus-goers in Iowa and convince them that she could win a general election against Trump by appealing to a spectrum of voters. Past views on guns also a benefit Gillibrand, in the same hour that she apologized for her past position on immigration, also cast the fact that she once had an A-rating from the National Rifle Association as making her better equipped to talk to gun owners about the need for gun control. Gillibrand, a mother of two, said the way to reach conservatives on this issue is to make it about family and children. ""I think I can walk into any voter in a red state or a purple state or a blue state, gun owners, NRA members, and say, 'You do care about a 4-year-old dying on a park bench in Brooklyn, don't you?'"" Gillibrand said. ""And the humanity of each person in this country should kick in."" She added: ""And you are going to ask them to imagine that happening to their own child, their own loved one, and their own family. And I think you can change hearts that way."" Gillibrand said earlier this year that she was ""embarrassed"" by her past positions on guns. She began to change her position after she became a senator and met with Jennifer Pryear and Alberto Yard, the parents of Nyasia Pryear-Yard, a young woman who was killed in a 2009 shooting in Brooklyn. ""So, I had an A-rating as a House member,"" she said in Iowa earlier this year. ""I only really looked at guns through the lens of hunting. My mother still shoots the Thanksgiving turkey. But when I became senator, I recognized I had a lot to learn about my state and all of the 20 million I was going to represent."" 'I don't know' Rarely do you see a politician cop to not knowing something. But Gillibrand, on two separate occasions on Tuesday night, said she didn't know the answer to a policy question and pledged to look into it more. First, when asked about whether she would support mandatory vaccination except in the case of medical exception, Gillibrand said she had not ""thought about whether I would make it mandatory."" Gillibrand sees Trump as 'a toddler who is melting down and making bad decisions' ""I would need to think about that,"" she said. ""But I do believe that parents need more information about why vaccines are so essential. Parents need to know that their child could die of preventable diseases, that they could spread a preventable disease and other children could die."" Later, when asked whether she would lower the voting age, Gillibrand said, ""I don't know."" ""I really don't know. I like the idea of it because we want to inspire more young people,"" Gillibrand said. ""But I like the fact that when you turn 18, you earn this right. It's a rite of passage. It's a time when you're independent of your parents as a matter of law. So, I like the simplicity of 18. But because you've asked the question, I will think about it."" Defends fundraising Gillibrand argued Tuesday that she isn't beholden to any special interests and urged voters to look at her record if they believed she was. After touting her voting record on standing up to drug companies, Gillibrand defended her decision to allow a top executive at pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to host a fundraiser for her 2020 campaign, using it as an example of how she can be close with certain industries while also stringently regulating them. Sally Susman, Pfizer's executive vice president and chief corporate affairs officer, hosted a fundraiser for Gillibrand earlier this year. Asked about the fundraiser on Tuesday, Gillibrand said her connection to Susman was personal. ""Why did you allow the Pfizer vice president to do that?"" CNN's Erin Burnett asked. ""Because she's my friend, and she supports LGBTQ equality, she supports my beliefs,"" Gillibrand said. ""You don't want to undermine an individual's right to participate, but because you made that assumption, it's one of the reasons we need to get money out of politics. Because it corrodes people's belief that our democracy is strong."" Gillibrand, in response to a question from a voter, defended her record on dealing with drug prices. ""I stand up to the drug companies,"" she said. ""I've sponsored legislation to stand up to the drug companies and I'm not beholden to donors. That's why I'm in favor of publicly funded elections. It's why I don't take lobbyist money and it's why I don't want to have an individual super PAC. I believe if you want this in your own hands, you have to fight for public elections. I'm not beholden to any industries, and my drug record proves it."" Not worried about relationship with Clinton Gillibrand once wrote that Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, first lady and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, changed her life inspiring her to run for office. But that relationship did not stop the New York senator who took over Clinton's seat when she became secretary of state to tell The New York Times in 2017 that she believes former President Bill Clinton should have resigned amid the Monica Lewinsky affair. Asked about how those comments changed her relationship with Hillary Clinton, Gillibrand said that it had not. ""I don't think so,"" Gillibrand said when asked whether the comment cost her that friendship. Gillibrand went on to say that she has talked to Hillary Clinton about her 2020 run and that the former secretary of state has given her advice. ""Secretary Clinton is still a role model for all of us,"" Gillibrand said. ""My views on her husband is very different. And I've said all I'm going to say about that."" Gillibrand added: ""She's somebody who I still admire and look up to, and she's given a lot to this country."" Gillibrand on faith: 'It centers me' Although Gillibrand talks about her faith regularly on the campaign trail, Tuesday allowed the Democratic presidential candidate to describe how her faith fits into her life in front of a national audience. ""I define myself by my faith. It centers me. It's something that is one of the reasons why I'm running for president,"" she said. Gillibrand was asked whether she believed there was room in the Democratic Party for a religious left. ""I think anyone should be able to have faith, whether they're ultraconservative or liberal. And if you're coming from a Christian perspective, I would say the gospel doesn't leave anybody out,"" Gillibrand said before discussing some of the social teachings of Christianity. ""I would argue the Democrats are often better on those issues than Republicans. So, there's no reason you can't be a person of any faith in any political party."" When she was asked if she ever felt like being a person of faith in the Democratic Party was ""odd,"" since conservatives in the Republican party tend to be more outspoken in their religious beliefs, she answered directly. ""No,"" the senator said."
EU-China summit: Why tensions between Europe and China are rising,rss.cnn.com,Charles Riley,04-09-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/QnbMveyclgI/index.html,"London (CNN Business) An annual summit between the European Union and China threatens to expose deep cracks in the foundation of one of the world's most important trading relationships.
The leaders of Europe's largest countries are increasingly wary of the brand of economic nationalism practiced by China, and are responding with new barriers designed to blunt Beijing's influence. The messages emanating from European capitals have not been subtle. In March, the European Commission said that China can no longer be considered a developing country and labeled it a ""systemic rival."" French President Emmanuel Macron went further, accusing China late last month of trying to divide the bloc and declaring that ""the period of European naiveté is over."" ""I think the Chinese have been surprised by how quickly the mood in Europe has turned,"" said Erik Brattberg, director of the Europe Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. EU leader Juncker criticizes uneven relations with China days after Xi visit A key test of the relationship between China and its largest trading partner will come Tuesday, when Chinese Premier Li Keqiang meets EU officials in Brussels for an annual summit . Trade in goods between the European Union and China was worth roughly €575 billion ($650 billion) in 2017. Read More Three sticking points loom large: Restrictions on Chinese investment in Europe, rules that shut European companies out of China and concerns over the security of telecoms gear made by China's Huawei. Chinese investment in Europe Chinese foreign direct investment in the European Union dropped for a second consecutive year in 2018 to €17.3 billion ($19.5 billion), according to the Rhodium Group. It peaked at €37.2 billion ($42 billion) in 2016. The slump came as some of the biggest EU economies updated their rules on company takeovers and subjected investment from China to increased scrutiny. At least one deal has been blocked and others have faced delays. The European Union has since launched its own framework to screen state-supported foreign investment, especially in sensitive areas such as technology and critical infrastructure. ""There is a growing perception in Europe that investment from Chinese state-owned or state-controlled companies is strategically targeted at certain sectors and not motivated by a compelling business case,"" said Brattberg. European companies in China China also faces accusations of failing to level the playing field for European companies doing business there. ""China has increasingly become a strategic competitor for the EU while failing to reciprocate market access,"" the European Commission wrote last month in a strategic outlook on China. ""China preserves its domestic markets for its champions."" China's factories are now defying the economic slowdown EU officials have accused Beijing of shielding its companies from competition through licensing and investment restrictions, subsidizing state-owned companies heavily and selectively enforcing intellectual property protections. The European Commission has used the fintech and online payments industry as an example. Chinese companies in those industries are expanding in Europe, but European competitors are not allowed to do business in China. ""Given the magnitude of our trade and investment links, it is important to develop a more balanced and reciprocal economic relationship,"" the Commission wrote in March. The Huawei problem The European Union has come under intense US pressure to ban Huawei equipment from 5G networks following accusations that products made by the Chinese company pose a security risk. Huawei has repeatedly denied the allegations, and called on the Trump administration to provide evidence to back up its claims. Former top US generals issue 'grave' warning to ban Chinese tech The European Commission has made clear that EU member states are responsible for making their own security decisions, but it has also asked them to complete 5G risk assessments by the end of June. Countries will also complete a security review by the end of 2019 that will include steps to safeguard 5G at the EU level. A blanket ban on Huawei equipment appears unlikely, but targeted actions could also anger Beijing. ""This issue has major implications not only for Europe's relationship with China, but also for Europe's relationship with the United States,"" said Brattberg."
Japanese F-35 fighter crashes into the Pacific,rss.cnn.com,Brad Lendon,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/6WbsZKTra5Y/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) A Japanese F-35 stealth fighter, one of the world's most-advanced warplanes, crashed into the Pacific Ocean while on a training mission Tuesday, Japanese defense officials said.
The single-engine jet from Japan's Air Self-Defense Force was on a training flight with three other F-35s when contact was lost Tuesday evening, Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya said. Debris from the plane was found early Wednesday. The lost jet's pilot signaled a need to abort the mission shortly before radar contact was lost, Iwaya told reporters Wednesday morning. Search teams have recovered parts from the plane's tail fins, Iwaya said. Japanese and US forces continue to look for the pilot, he said. The Japanese jets, based at Misawa Air Base on the northern tip of the main Japanese island of Honshu, were about 135 kilometers (84 miles) off the east coast of Aomori prefecture when contact was lost, officials said. Read More Japanese Air Self-Defense Force staff in 2016 in Arizona for the arrival of the first Japanese F-35A. Japan's first squadron of the $100 million fighter jets went operational just 11 days ago, with 13 of the jets forming the 302nd Squadron at the Misawa base, according to a report from The Diplomat.com . Iwaya said the remaining dozen F-35s would be grounded until the cause of Tuesday's crash is determined. The Japanese jet, an F-35A model, is the second lost to an accident. A US Marine Corps F-35B crashed in Beaufort, South Carolina, in late September. US defense officials in October said a faulty fuel tube was the likely cause , and all F-35s operated by the United States and its allies were temporarily grounded for inspection. Japan is one of 14 countries in the F-35 program, according to the plane's maker, Lockheed Martin Corp. Tokyo announced in December it would be buying 147 of the planes, making it the biggest customer for the aircraft besides the United States. At present, some of the Japanese F-35 are assembled in the United States and others at a plant in Nagoya, Japan. The plane that crashed Tuesday was the first one assembled in Nagoya, the Ministry of Defense said. The F-35 comes in three versions. The F-35A, like the one Japan lost contact with Tuesday, is the one designed for air forces to use off conventional runways. The F-35B, like the one the US Marine Corps lost, is designed for short takeoff and vertical landings. The F-35C model is the US Navy's version, designed for use off its aircraft carriers. The F-35 comes in three versions. The one that went missing Tuesday is the Air Force's F-35A model. Japan has announced plans to buy 105 of the F-35A models and 42 F-35Bs, which it could eventually use to turn its Izumo-class helicopter destroyers into small aircraft carriers , its first since World War II. The F-35 stealth jet has been called the most expensive weapons system in history, and its development was beset by multiple delays before it was deemed combat ready. US F-35 fighter jet conducts first-ever airstrike The first US combat mission conducted by an F-35 happened in October when a Marine Corps jet launched off the amphibious warship USS Essex struck targets in Afghanistan. In May, Israel announced it had conducted the first combat missions using the F-35 but offered few details. In the Pacific, South Korea and Australia have joined Japan in acquiring the jets. The F-35's advanced electronic warfare suite can allow seamless integration among users, making the planes strong counters to China's growing fleet of stealth aircraft, including the J-20 and J-31."
"Tiger Woods: 'I don't need to win the Masters, but I really want to'",rss.cnn.com,"Rob Hodgetts, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_golf/~3/CjB0tVgpLjQ/index.html,"(CNN) He may be battling time, an ailing body and a raft of young guns inspired by his past heroics, but Tiger Woods is once again the talk of the town ahead of the 83rd Masters at Augusta this week.

""I've got a pretty good library in my head of how to play the golf course,"" said Woods, who last year also briefly led the Open before finishing tied sixth and was runner up at the US PGA.

— Masters Tournament (@TheMasters) April 8, 2019 Even without Woods, the Masters is the one golf event even non golfers are glued to. It's a spring rite, a sporting spectacle at a revered venue layered in rich history and dripping in tradition. The vivid greens, ice-white sand of the bunkers and explosions of iridescent pinks and reds of blooming azaelas make for a brilliant backdrop, in stark contrast to the raffish Washington Road strip beyond the fence. It's a bucket-list event and the difficulty of getting tickets -- a yearly lottery offers a limited number of day passes, but the waiting list for weekly badges is long-since closed -- adds to the allure. For the players, Augusta places a premium on length and second-shot accuracy -- knowing where to miss is often touted as one of the keys -- while a sharp short game and deft putting stroke is required on the slick, sloping greens. When the tournament really hots up on Sunday afternoon, the roars accompanying great shots will explode like incendiaries and reverberate around the towering pines like nowhere else in golf. ""This is unlike any other golf tournament. It's just a very special place,"" said Woods.

Farce and loathing in Donald Trump's Washington - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Stephen Collinson,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/donald-trump-washington-congress-barr-mueller-mnuchin-taxes/index.html,"Washington (CNN) It might have been the day when Donald Trump's Washington finally slipped the limits of credulity.
The administration's big guns -- Attorney General William Barr, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin -- got a hostile reception on Capitol Hill from Democrats eager to pull back a presidency they see as out of control. Tuesday zipped by in a blur of grave constitutional tussles scented with the whiff of corruption. Surreal exchanges unfolded in Congress that left witnesses spluttering. There were superficial feuds over alternative facts. The bizarre sideshow encompassed climate denial, a spat about Adolf Hitler, one senator's meditation on Hollywood's molesting actors and a schoolroom-style squabble between a top Democrat and Mnuchin. The weird juxtaposition of the weighty and the frivolous seemed an apt metaphor for how Trump's presidency has torn age-old codes of political custom and behavior to shreds. Read More In the odd new normal of the Trump era, several top Cabinet officials found themselves answering questions about topics that would have seemed unthinkable in more conventional times. Barr faced a grilling over his conclusions about the most serious investigation into presidential conduct in years -- and a report by special counsel Robert Mueller that Americans have yet to read. Mnuchin was beating back demands for the release of Trump's tax returns, after the President bucked tradition and refused to share them with Americans. Both men left serious questions unanswered that offered ample evidence of the Trump administration's allergy to scrutiny, which is knotting up the political system. Their intransigence offered a reminder that while Democrats in the House now have the duty of oversight after the midterm elections, making effective use of their power is far from easy. For once, the President himself was not in the brightest spotlight. But Trump had his moments, saying that a visiting Arab dictator accused of arresting and torturing opponents was doing a ""great job"" and blaming former President Barack Obama for locking up kids in cages at the southern border. More than anything, though, a day of barely suppressed tensions, flaring mistrust and a disconnect between foes who barely share a common political language exemplified the effect the 45th President has had on the culture and character of Washington.

Burnett: Barr refusing to give clear and simple answers 02:45 The capital is still reverberating after the forced resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Sunday, in a White House purge of her agency amid an immigration crisis. But the Russia scandal, which dominated politics for two years before a brief hiatus when Mueller ended his probe last month, came roaring back. Barr sparked new intrigue when he refused to say whether the White House has seen, or will see, the full Mueller report ahead of the release of a redacted version he promised to release within in a week. His reticence only fanned Democratic suspicions that the newly installed attorney general is running interference for Trump -- after Barr released a letter last month underlining what he says are bottom-line findings that are largely favorable to the President. Such misgivings will hardly be eased by Barr's testimony that Mueller had been given the chance to review the letter before it went out but had declined. Reports last week said members of Mueller's team had been dismayed, feeling that Barr inadequately portrayed the findings of a probe they thought was more damaging to Trump than he suggested. Furious Democrats accused Barr of covering up for his new boss. ""It's what he was hired to do, which is to protect the President,"" said House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff. ""The President wanted his own Roy Cohn and apparently he got one,"" the California Democrat said, comparing Barr to the New York attorney and Machiavelli who had mentored Trump as a rising real estate kingpin. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, until recently part of a GOP majority that spent months trying to make public documents embarrassing to Democrats, argued against Congress exercising oversight over the unredacted report. ""Do you think they would keep a secret? No. We would harm people,"" he said. The kind of chaos now unfolding in Washington -- with American set against American and skepticism rife about the legitimacy of the President -- is the kind of result of which Putin can only have dreamed at the start of the Russian election interference effort. It may not be a coincidence that he chose this moment to offer his most expansive remarks yet on the Mueller probe, which appear calculated to sow even more discord. Choosing talking points similar to Trump's own, Putin said in St. Petersburg that the scandal was ""total nonsense aimed only at a domestic audience."" ""It's clearer to Trump what a witch hunt is. We know the history of the United States. It's a dark page in American history,"" Putin said of the investigation. Like Barr, Mnuchin left his Democratic inquisitors with the impression that the White House was stacking the deck behind the scenes. He revealed that his department's lawyers had consulted with the White House before Democrats lodged their request with the IRS for six years of the President's tax returns last week. Given that the legal process underlying the request is supposed to be insulated from the White House to avoid interference, his answer set alarm bells ringing again. ""I don't see that as interference,"" Mnuchin said, arguing that his team had not taken direction from White House lawyers. Even the lighter moments on Tuesday emphasized the feeling of giant disconnect that pervades Washington. Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois opened the hearing by asking Mnuchin how his NCAA bracket had panned out. ""I'm a bigger fan of professional basketball,"" Mnuchin replied. Festering ill feeling between the administration and Democrats boiled over when Mnuchin sought to leave a later hearing for an appointment with a senior official from Bahrain. After an exchange that sounded like bickering between a teacher and a challenging student, Mnuchin told House Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters that he needed to be formally dismissed: ""You're supposed to take the gavel and bang it, that's the appropriate ..."" The California Democrat replied: ""Please do not instruct me as to how I am to conduct this committee."" 'Are you serious?' JUST WATCHED John Kerry fires back at congressman: Are you serious?

John Kerry fires back at congressman: Are you serious? 05:21 Tuesday's most flagrant display of failing to connect came over at the House Oversight Committee, where two old Washington bulls -- John Kerry and Chuck Hagel -- testified on climate change. Republicans on the panel greeted Kerry like a returning victim ready for another roughing up in a hearing that revealed two rival sides working from a contradictory vision of fact. The former secretary of state had trouble believing the assaults mounted by GOP members on the subject of global warming. At one point, Kentucky's Republican Rep. Thomas Massie questioned Kerry on his Yale degree, suggesting that someone who had majored in political science was unqualified to testify on climate change. ""I think it's appropriate that someone with a pseudo-science degree is here pushing pseudo-science in front of our committee today,"" Massie said. A baffled Kerry replied: ""Are you serious?"" After another exchange, in which Massie downplayed the impact of humans on climate change, Kerry shot back, saying this was ""just not a serious conversation."" ""Your testimony is not serious,"" Massie replied. Hearing on climate change and national security becomes an angry partisan clash In a more sinister sign of the times, YouTube was forced to disable comments on a livestream of a House Judiciary Committee hearing on hate crimes after it was flooded with racist and anti-Semitic remarks. In a contentious moment inside the hearing room, Rep. Ted Lieu held up his cell phone to play earlier comments made by a witness that he suggested legitimized Hitler and played into white nationalist sentiment. The witness, Candace Owens, of the conservative group Turning Point USA, who had subsequently distanced herself from the remarks, hit back angrily at the California Democrat. ""I think it's pretty apparent that Mr. Lieu believes that black people are stupid and will not pursue the clip in its full entirety,"" she said. Owens accused Lieu of taking her remarks out of context, but the exchange was a reminder that it is never a good idea to include Hitler in any contemporary political analogy. In an equally strange twist on another difficult issue, Sen. John Kennedy offered a typically florid aside in a floor speech touting his bill on tackling sexual harassment. ""I don't know how the actors in Hollywood have time to make movies,"" said the Louisiana Republican. ""They are too busy molesting each other."" In the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it was a case of poacher-turned-gamekeeper as Pompeo turned up to testify. Pompeo, in a previous incarnation as a Kansas congressman, was a master of committee histrionics, especially when Hillary Clinton was in the witness chair. Now that he's taken her place, he's disdainful of such behavior, and there were tense exchanges on US policy in the Middle East and Trump's scything of the diplomatic budget, which Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, blasted as ""bananas."" But finally, at the end of a long, dispiriting Washington day, there was a rare moment of comity, after Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, offered a survey of foreign policy challenges in Africa. ""I think I agree with everything you said there,"" Pompeo said."

Democrats prepare their response to Barr's redacted report - CNNPolitics,rss.cnn.com,Jeremy Herb,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_us/~3/Xaj_POol2L8/index.html,"(CNN) House Democrats are prepping a swift response to Attorney General William Barr's plans to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report within the next week , after Barr's first public comments Tuesday did little to quell the Democratic anger over Barr's rollout of the special counsel probe.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler is preparing to ""very quickly"" subpoena the Justice Department and go to court seeking to obtain grand jury information, while House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff says he's made a formal request to obtain the counterintelligence information from Mueller's investigation to learn whether the President is ""compromised"" in any way. ""I think that's a betrayal to what he promised during his confirmation,"" Schiff told CNN, referring to Barr's refusal so far to not provide Congress with the full report and underlying evidence. ""But it's what he was hired to do, which is to protect the President. The President wanted his own Roy Cohn and apparently he got one. But it is deeply concerning."" The multi-pronged approach is the clearest sign yet that Barr's release of a redacted report will not stop the brewing showdown between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the 22-month special counsel investigation. The fight is almost assuredly going to wind up in court as Democrats seek to pry material from the Mueller investigation out of the Justice Department beyond what Barr says he will provide. Barr laid down his marker at a Tuesday budget hearing, his first appearance before Congress since Mueller's investigation wrapped last month. Barr said he was working to make as much information public as possible and that he would work with Nadler if he sought additional material. Read More But he drew the line at providing the full report or grand jury material. ""I don't intend at this stage to send the full, unredacted report to the committee,"" Barr told a House Appropriations subcommittee. ""Until someone shows me a provision"" permitting the release of grand jury material, Barr added, ""Congress doesn't get"" that material. In response, Nadler said he expected to issue the subpoena, which the committee authorized last week for the report and underlying materials, once Barr releases the report. ""I assume we will get the redacted report within a week. When we do so, if we don't get everything, we will issue the subpoena and go to court,"" the New York Democrat said, adding that the subpoena was likely to come ""very quickly."" 4 key takeaways from William Barr's testimony on the Mueller report But that's not the only effort underway in Congress to obtain the information from the Mueller report. Schiff said Tuesday that he had made a formal request for his committee to obtain the counterintelligence materials from Mueller's investigation. ""We have made a formal request for all of the information and findings in the counterintelligence investigation, as they're required to provide us under the National Security Act of 1947,"" the California Democrat said. ""Our priority at the moment has been to make sure this report is made public, and make as much of the report public as possible, but we will be following through to make sure we get the counterintelligence information that they're obligated to provide."" A committee aide said the request was made in the last few weeks. The request to the Justice Department, Schiff said, would fall under a grand jury exemption for material related to counterintelligence matters, and Schiff didn't rule out using a subpoena if necessary. ""We have an independent basis to want the counterintelligence information, after all of this began as a counterintelligence investigation, to determine, to find out whether the President or people in his campaign had been compromised in any way by a foreign power,"" Schiff said. ""That means giving us classified information, that means giving us grand jury information."" Schiff's comments suggesting that President or his team could be compromised have been criticized by Republicans in the wake of Mueller's investigation wrapping. The Republicans on the Intelligence Committee cited Barr's summary stating that Mueller's probe did not establish a criminal conspiracy to jointly call for Schiff's resignation as chairman last month. Republican fury aimed at Schiff, face of the Russia investigation Still, at Tuesday's hearing Barr appeared more open to the notion of providing classified material to Congress. ""I could envision a situation where under appropriate safeguards, that information would be shared,"" Barr said. Barr had a very different reaction about grand jury material, arguing there was nothing in the special counsel regulations that states it should be provided to Congress. And in a dig at Nadler, Barr also noted in his testimony that the current special counsel regulations, which make the report confidential, were written after the Ken Starr investigating into President Bill Clinton. ""Many of the people who are right now calling for the release of this report were basically castigating Ken Starr and others for releasing the Starr report,"" Barr said, echoing President Donald Trump's criticism of Nadler. Democrats had their own criticisms of Barr's comments in Tuesday's hearing, particularly his decision not to respond to questions on whether the White House had been briefed on the Mueller report. ""It was clear to me that the attorney general felt that he was an appointee of the President of the United States of America, and it's very hard for me to believe that he didn't make any changes or additions based on any suggestions that might have come from the White House,"" said House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat. Asked why he was waiting for Barr to release his report before issuing a subpoena -- given the attorney general's comments about the unredacted report -- Nadler said his committee wanted to show the courts ""we're making every effort to accommodate"" the Justice Department. Republicans have criticized Democrats' efforts to obtain additional materials from the Mueller report, accusing them of an unwillingness to accept the results of Mueller's investigation and arguing there's no precedent for Nadler to seek grand jury material unless he launches impeachment proceedings. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday that Congress shouldn't be given the unredacted Mueller report because it would leak. ""Do you think they would keep a secret? No. We would harm people,"" the California Republican said Tuesday. ""I'm sure they'll keep a secret -- the problem is the people they tell wouldn't be able to keep a secret."" Nadler has argued that Congress is entitled to grand jury information, citing previous cases that include the Clinton and Watergate investigations. Asked whether those were different because they were part of formal impeachment proceedings, Nadler said the court has also allowed material to be provided in cases that are ""preparatory to a judicial proceeding."" ""An impeachment inquiry is a judicial proceeding, or has been considered in the past,"" Nadler said. ""And certainly an inquiry which may help you determine whether or not to initiate an impeachment is preparatory to that."" This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday."
Fact-checking Trump's claims that Obama separated families - CNNPolitics,rss.cnn.com,Maegan Vazquez,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_us/~3/p6lDAF5hrsE/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he's not considering reimplementing his administration's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy, dredging up his earlier claim that President Barack Obama's administration separated migrant families.
""President Obama separated children. They had child separation. I was the one who that changed it,"" Trump said. Facts First: As discussed in a previous fact check , this is false and requires context. Under Obama, children were separated from parents only when authorities had concerns for their well-being or could not confirm that the adult was in fact their legal guardian, but not as a blanket policy. The family separation crisis was triggered last spring when Trump tweaked the status quo he inherited from Obama and ramped up strict enforcement of federal immigration laws that were already on the books. Under past administrations , some border-crossers were occasionally prosecuted, and were thus separated from their families. Read More The main difference between Trump and Obama, experts have said, centers on how they handled immigrants caught near the US-Mexico border. Under Obama, the Justice Department was given broad discretion on who should face criminal charges, and federal prosecutors rarely went after families. But in April 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Justice Department would prosecute 100% of illegal border-crossers in a policy known as ""zero-tolerance."" Adults went to jails and awaited criminal proceedings. Children were sent to detention centers run by the Department of Health and Human Services, and some were eventually placed in foster care. This specific change is what led to the widespread separation of parents and children, according to Jessica Bolter, a researcher with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute who has published 200 pages of reports on Trump's immigration policies. 'Those cages ... were built by President Obama's administration' On Tuesday, the President also claimed ""cages"" were built by Obama to house migrant children. ""Those cages that were shown -- I think they were very inappropriate -- they were built by President Obama's administration, not by Trump,"" the President said. Facts First: This appears to be true but requires context. Many of these processing facilities do pre-date the Trump administration, and were constructed during the Obama administration. These include those where migrants are kept in fenced enclosures, the so-called cages. Given the recent rise in migrants coming to the border, the Trump administration has continued to use the chain-link style fencing enclosures -- at least while migrants are being processed following apprehension. And according to a watchdog report released by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general's office last fall, immigration authorities have sometimes held migrant children in these processing facilities for much longer than they should be. Typically shelters maintained by Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement, the office which handles facilities for unaccompanied minors, do not maintain the same chain-link type fencing often associated with the description of ""cages."" They do, however, confine the children to the shelter properties and many did become overcrowded amid family separations. Outgoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was asked during a March congressional hearing how facilities being used to house unaccompanied minors are different from cages. New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman asked: ""Does it differ from the cages you put your dogs in when you let them stay outside? Is it different?"" Nielsen replied: ""Yes ... It's larger. It has facilities. It provides room to sit, to stand, to lay down."" 'Many more are coming' Trump also claimed that ending the zero-tolerance policy has led to an increase in illegal immigration. ""Now, I'll tell you something, once you don't have it, that's why you have many more people coming. They are coming like it's a picnic, like 'Let's go to Disneyland,' "" Trump said. Facts First: Saying that ending zero-tolerance policy is the root cause for an increase in migration to the US ignores a confluence of other factors. It's true that the number of people arriving at the border are now set to reach levels not seen in a decade, and there has been an increase since the end of the policy. More undocumented immigrants were apprehended along the southern border in March than any month since 2008, according to Customs and Border Protection data released Tuesday . The increase has been paired with a shift in demographics of migrants. There are now more families and children trying to cross into the US, and a majority of the migrants are Central Americans. Family units before the zero-tolerance policy were slightly increasing, and directly after the policy ended, they skyrocketed. Though there was a slight decrease in total apprehensions and inadmissables logged by CBP during the months in 2018 that the zero-tolerance policy was implemented, apprehensions and inadmissables never got back to their historic 2017 lows. But they shifted up after the program was ended, and are continuing to shoot up now. A recent increase in migration also comes alongside a series of other factors pressuring individuals to attempt to enter the US, including deteriorating conditions in their home countries, criminal organizations encouraging migration and threats of an imminent US-Mexico border closure."
Australia election: Why China is unlikely to be a hot topic,edition.cnn.com,Julia Hollingsworth,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/australia/australia-china-election-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Fresh accusations of Chinese influence-peddling have emerged in Australia weeks before a national election, following claims a billionaire seeking Australian citizenship paid a lobbyist thousands of dollars to meet the then-immigration minister.
An investigation , screened Monday by ABC's Four Corners, claimed Peter Dutton -- then immigration minister in the Liberal government -- had a one-on-one lunch in 2016 with Chinese property developer Huang Xiangmo. The meeting was purportedly arranged by former Liberal senator Santo Santoro, now a lobbyist to whom Huang is alleged to have paid thousands of dollars. Dutton is alleged to have met with Huang when the businessman was seeking Australian citizenship in 2016, and Dutton was immigration minister. Huang, who local media alleged has ties to China's Communist Party , was embroiled in an earlier political row. Last year, Australia passed a bill to ban foreign political donations after revelations of Huang's connections to a politician from the major opposition party, Labor. Read More Monday's report comes as Australia gears up for a federal election expected in May, with opinion polls suggesting the Liberal-led coalition government will be defeated. Dutton, who is now home affairs minister, dismissed allegations of interference. ""I have never received a dollar from this individual,"" he told reporters Tuesday . ""I had one meeting with him over lunch. I have never seen him since."" CNN has reached out to the office of Santoro for further comment. Yet in a country which has had five leaders in a decade, analysts say the latest revelation will only fuel public wariness of politicians -- even though it will likely not be a vote-changer. ""I think it just adds to the distrust in the big parties,"" Macquarie University China researcher Adam Ni told CNN. ""It's not just one of the parties, the activities are across the board."" Chinese influence? It's not the first time Australia has been rocked by alleged links between a Chinese businessman and a politician -- or the first time billionaire Huang has been in the headlines. In 2017, Labor politician Sam Dastyari quit the Senate after revelations about his own connections to Huang, including his alerting the businessman that he might be under state surveillance. Earlier this year, Huang called Australia "" a giant baby "" after it revoked his permanent residency status, in part due to his alleged ties to the Chinese government. Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull speaks at a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra on August 23, 2018. (MARK GRAHAM/AFP/Getty Images) On Monday, Dastyari linked to a story about the Dutton allegations on his Twitter account, commenting : ""I resigned for less."" Ex-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also criticized his former colleague, saying the allegations were very ""concerning and troubling."" ""Peter Dutton has a lot to explain about this,"" Turnbull said . ""He is supposed to be the minister responsible for the domestic security of Australia. He's supposed to be the minister responsible for ensuring that our politics is not influenced by foreign actors. ""The idea that the minister responsible for enforcing those laws (about foreign influence) has had a meeting of this kind does raise a lot of questions."" He also said current Prime Minister Scott Morrison urgently needed to address the allegations. ""The buck stops with him,"" Turnbull added. Election issue In the wake of the earlier revelations about Huang, Australia last year passed legislation banning foreigners from donating to political campaigns, and stopping foreign powers from interfering in policy-making. The law drew bipartisan support. Even so, neither party is eager to make the latest allegations a hot election topic. ""The issue of Chinese influence and interference is not a vote issue for Australians in the way that tax, health and education is,"" Richard McGregor, a senior fellow with the Lowy Institute and an expert on China's foreign relations, told CNN. ""It's not a vote-changer."" He said the political agenda during an election tended to be set by the two major parties, and neither would gain from discussing Chinese political influence. ""I just don't see them putting China at the dead center of it because there's not much mileage in it for them,"" McGregor said. ""Their larger polices (on China) are not that different."""
NY pizzeria extortion plot: 3 people face 20 years in prison - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Faith Karimi,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/new-york-fake-mobsters-pizzeria-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) An actor and two other people face 20 years in prison after they confessed to trying to extort $198,000 from a former New York pizzeria owner in a plot federal officials described as similar to a mob shakedown.
Douglas Singer, Leroy Wilson and Marianne Wood each pleaded guilty Tuesday to an extortion conspiracy involving an unnamed victim in Brooklyn. Mafia don Frank Cali's killing is a reminder the mob is alive. Just not as flashy The incident started last year after the victim sold his pizzeria in a building he owned to Singer, the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York said in a statement. The victim sold the pizzeria for $60,000, a $15,600 security deposit and monthly rent payments of $5,200, according to the court documents. From there, the business deal turned into a scene from a mobster movie, complete with a muscle man in a dark outfit and sunglasses. Read More The three carefully scripted an intimidation plot to force the victim into giving them $200,000, said Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. A threat and a flash of a prop pistol Court documents described how the incident played out when Wilson, Singer and Wood rolled up to the pizzeria in November last year after planning the extortion plot for months. Wood said she worked for an organization that handles Singer's business relating to the pizzeria, according to court documents. She told the owner that he owed the organization $198,000, a figure she said she got as a result of costs such as equipment and renovations, and purported operating losses incurred by Singer. She demanded payment the same day. In an attempt to intimidate, Wood showed the victim photographs of his spouse and children and told him it would be in the best interest of his family for him to pay up, the documents said. During the conversation, Wilson -- described as a professional actor in court documents -- leaned toward the victim to expose a pistol holstered on his hip. Wilson had been recruited to play the role of a muscle or a bodyguard, court documents said. The victim reported the incident to the authorities and an investigation revealed a series of messages among the three showing how they planned the alleged extortion. An 'acting gig' and an all-black outfit Before the meeting at the restaurant, the three exchanged a slew of messages by phone and Facebook to plan the extortion, court documents said. Singer asked Wilson via Facebook Messenger if he was interested in an ""acting gig."" ""I need a couple of guys to escort my associate [Wood] while she delivers a demand to my landlord. You will simply have to stand in the background and appear to be muscle,"" the message said. For the role, Singer asked Wilson to wear a dark suit with no tie, a white shirt and dark sunglasses, court documents said. When everyone was on board for the plot, Singer sent a message to the trio saying, ""Let the games begin!"" Wood responded: ""Oh yeah baby!!"" Fake gun. Real-life inmates Their excitement was short-lived. On December 14, FBI agents executed a search warrant at Wilson's home and found a black prop pistol and the leather jacket he was seen wearing on surveillance footage during the pizzeria meeting, federal officials said. ""A group of people doing their best to act like a group of mobsters, shaking down a pizzeria owner, will now face a steep price for what they described as 'kinda fun,'"" said William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBI New York field office, who announced the guilty plea. ""Business owners who are trying to make an honest living shouldn't have to fear someone with no legal power over them extorting and threatening their livelihoods."" Singer, 54; Wilson, 47; and Wood, 61; each face up to 20 years in prison."
May's position is looking shakier than ever as Brexit negotiations drag on,edition.cnn.com,"Analysis by Jane Merrick, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/uk/may-european-union-brexit-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May will face her fellow -- for now -- European Union leaders at a summit Wednesday with everyone around the table knowing she is running out of options on Brexit .
May was supposed to have come up with a credible alternative Brexit plan, that could be passed by her Parliament, to present at the summit in Brussels, yet talks with the UK opposition Labour Party on that new deal have failed to bear fruit. May to ask Merkel and Macron for a Brexit extension as Parliament votes to block no-deal It's likely, then, that the summit will be difficult, but not a disaster for May. And yet even if she squeaks through it unscathed, the storm clouds are gathering back home. Those talks with the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his allies are not just about window dressing, but a serious attempt by both parties to reach a consensus on Brexit. But they are in danger of coming to nothing because both sides remain far apart on issues like a permanent customs union between the UK and EU after Brexit. The talks are scheduled to resume Thursday, but there is a sense in Westminster that because both parties remain far apart on the fundamentals the two sides are just going through the motions. Read More This sense is being picked up in Europe too, which is why EU leaders are pressing for a long delay to Brexit -- of up to a year -- because there is no quick deal in sight. Party split Of more urgent concern to May will be the mood of her Conservative Party. There was a point, a week or so ago, when despite crushing parliamentary defeats on the prime minister's original Brexit deal, Conservative Eurosceptic lawmakers were starting to weaken their opposition to May's plan -- in the interest of making sure Brexit happens and stopping Corbyn becoming prime minister. Yet May's decision to open up talks with the Labour leader have caused outrage inside her own government, ordinary Conservative lawmakers and grassroots activists. Now, the prospect of the EU imposing a lengthy delay to Brexit has only compounded that outrage. Conservative lawmakers are starting to get restless, once again, about May's ability to cling to power. Theresa May seeks Brexit delay from Merkel and Macron An ominous sign of this restlessness for the prime minister appeared in the House of Commons Tuesday, when more than half of Conservative members failed to support May on what should have been a straightforward vote to approve the PM's request for a short extension to Brexit until June 30. As May traveled to Berlin and Paris to appeal for support from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, 97 Conservative lawmakers voted against the short delay, and a further 80, including some ministers, abstained. The measure passed thanks to Labour support. While May is protected from a vote of no confidence in her leadership by her own party until December -- due to an official year-long period of grace following an unsuccessful bid to unseat her last Christmas -- this is not stopping some Conservative Brexiteers from wanting her to renew their attempts to get rid of her and replace her with a tougher leader and prime minister who would be happy for the UK to leave the EU without a deal. May to step down? Last month, May signaled her intention to step down once Brexit takes place. This position is too vague for the most rebellious of her own MPs. What's more, May has already made clear she should not stay on as leader if Brexit slips beyond a June 30 timetable. If EU leaders press for that longer delay, to the end of December or even March next year, the pressure on May to stand down will be immense. UK lays groundwork to participate in European Parliament elections First, she must get through this week's summit. European Council president Donald Tusk, and a majority of EU leaders, are happy to give the UK its ""flextension"" -- a flexible extension period which could be shortened if the Commons finally passes a deal. A draft conclusion for EU leaders to back, circulated last night, states that the UK must act in a ""constructive and responsible manner"" during the delay period -- in an attempt to prevent a more hardline future prime minister cutting up rough over Brexit. But French President Macron is driving a harder bargain, insisting on tougher rules for the UK, including a review of its progress towards a Brexit deal every three months and relegating its membership status to ""intermediate,"" with few rights or influence. May has a weak hand going into Wednesday's summit -- but every day longer the UK stays in the EU, the more unstable her position becomes back home."
Farce and loathing in Donald Trump's Washington - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Stephen Collinson,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/donald-trump-washington-congress-barr-mueller-mnuchin-taxes/index.html,"Washington (CNN) It might have been the day when Donald Trump's Washington finally slipped the limits of credulity.
The administration's big guns -- Attorney General William Barr, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin -- got a hostile reception on Capitol Hill from Democrats eager to pull back a presidency they see as out of control. Tuesday zipped by in a blur of grave constitutional tussles scented with the whiff of corruption. Surreal exchanges unfolded in Congress that left witnesses spluttering. There were superficial feuds over alternative facts. The bizarre sideshow encompassed climate denial, a spat about Adolf Hitler, one senator's meditation on Hollywood's molesting actors and a schoolroom-style squabble between a top Democrat and Mnuchin. The weird juxtaposition of the weighty and the frivolous seemed an apt metaphor for how Trump's presidency has torn age-old codes of political custom and behavior to shreds. Read More In the odd new normal of the Trump era, several top Cabinet officials found themselves answering questions about topics that would have seemed unthinkable in more conventional times. Barr faced a grilling over his conclusions about the most serious investigation into presidential conduct in years -- and a report by special counsel Robert Mueller that Americans have yet to read. Mnuchin was beating back demands for the release of Trump's tax returns, after the President bucked tradition and refused to share them with Americans. Both men left serious questions unanswered that offered ample evidence of the Trump administration's allergy to scrutiny, which is knotting up the political system. Their intransigence offered a reminder that while Democrats in the House now have the duty of oversight after the midterm elections, making effective use of their power is far from easy. For once, the President himself was not in the brightest spotlight. But Trump had his moments, saying that a visiting Arab dictator accused of arresting and torturing opponents was doing a ""great job"" and blaming former President Barack Obama for locking up kids in cages at the southern border. More than anything, though, a day of barely suppressed tensions, flaring mistrust and a disconnect between foes who barely share a common political language exemplified the effect the 45th President has had on the culture and character of Washington.

Burnett: Barr refusing to give clear and simple answers 02:45 The capital is still reverberating after the forced resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Sunday, in a White House purge of her agency amid an immigration crisis. But the Russia scandal, which dominated politics for two years before a brief hiatus when Mueller ended his probe last month, came roaring back. Barr sparked new intrigue when he refused to say whether the White House has seen, or will see, the full Mueller report ahead of the release of a redacted version he promised to release within in a week. His reticence only fanned Democratic suspicions that the newly installed attorney general is running interference for Trump -- after Barr released a letter last month underlining what he says are bottom-line findings that are largely favorable to the President. Such misgivings will hardly be eased by Barr's testimony that Mueller had been given the chance to review the letter before it went out but had declined. Reports last week said members of Mueller's team had been dismayed, feeling that Barr inadequately portrayed the findings of a probe they thought was more damaging to Trump than he suggested. Furious Democrats accused Barr of covering up for his new boss. ""It's what he was hired to do, which is to protect the President,"" said House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff. ""The President wanted his own Roy Cohn and apparently he got one,"" the California Democrat said, comparing Barr to the New York attorney and Machiavelli who had mentored Trump as a rising real estate kingpin. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, until recently part of a GOP majority that spent months trying to make public documents embarrassing to Democrats, argued against Congress exercising oversight over the unredacted report. ""Do you think they would keep a secret? No. We would harm people,"" he said. The kind of chaos now unfolding in Washington -- with American set against American and skepticism rife about the legitimacy of the President -- is the kind of result of which Putin can only have dreamed at the start of the Russian election interference effort. It may not be a coincidence that he chose this moment to offer his most expansive remarks yet on the Mueller probe, which appear calculated to sow even more discord. Choosing talking points similar to Trump's own, Putin said in St. Petersburg that the scandal was ""total nonsense aimed only at a domestic audience."" ""It's clearer to Trump what a witch hunt is. We know the history of the United States. It's a dark page in American history,"" Putin said of the investigation. Like Barr, Mnuchin left his Democratic inquisitors with the impression that the White House was stacking the deck behind the scenes. He revealed that his department's lawyers had consulted with the White House before Democrats lodged their request with the IRS for six years of the President's tax returns last week. Given that the legal process underlying the request is supposed to be insulated from the White House to avoid interference, his answer set alarm bells ringing again. ""I don't see that as interference,"" Mnuchin said, arguing that his team had not taken direction from White House lawyers. Even the lighter moments on Tuesday emphasized the feeling of giant disconnect that pervades Washington. Democratic Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois opened the hearing by asking Mnuchin how his NCAA bracket had panned out. ""I'm a bigger fan of professional basketball,"" Mnuchin replied. Festering ill feeling between the administration and Democrats boiled over when Mnuchin sought to leave a later hearing for an appointment with a senior official from Bahrain. After an exchange that sounded like bickering between a teacher and a challenging student, Mnuchin told House Financial Services Chair Maxine Waters that he needed to be formally dismissed: ""You're supposed to take the gavel and bang it, that's the appropriate ..."" The California Democrat replied: ""Please do not instruct me as to how I am to conduct this committee."" 'Are you serious?' JUST WATCHED John Kerry fires back at congressman: Are you serious?

John Kerry fires back at congressman: Are you serious? 05:21 Tuesday's most flagrant display of failing to connect came over at the House Oversight Committee, where two old Washington bulls -- John Kerry and Chuck Hagel -- testified on climate change. Republicans on the panel greeted Kerry like a returning victim ready for another roughing up in a hearing that revealed two rival sides working from a contradictory vision of fact. The former secretary of state had trouble believing the assaults mounted by GOP members on the subject of global warming. At one point, Kentucky's Republican Rep. Thomas Massie questioned Kerry on his Yale degree, suggesting that someone who had majored in political science was unqualified to testify on climate change. ""I think it's appropriate that someone with a pseudo-science degree is here pushing pseudo-science in front of our committee today,"" Massie said. A baffled Kerry replied: ""Are you serious?"" After another exchange, in which Massie downplayed the impact of humans on climate change, Kerry shot back, saying this was ""just not a serious conversation."" ""Your testimony is not serious,"" Massie replied. Hearing on climate change and national security becomes an angry partisan clash In a more sinister sign of the times, YouTube was forced to disable comments on a livestream of a House Judiciary Committee hearing on hate crimes after it was flooded with racist and anti-Semitic remarks. In a contentious moment inside the hearing room, Rep. Ted Lieu held up his cell phone to play earlier comments made by a witness that he suggested legitimized Hitler and played into white nationalist sentiment. The witness, Candace Owens, of the conservative group Turning Point USA, who had subsequently distanced herself from the remarks, hit back angrily at the California Democrat. ""I think it's pretty apparent that Mr. Lieu believes that black people are stupid and will not pursue the clip in its full entirety,"" she said. Owens accused Lieu of taking her remarks out of context, but the exchange was a reminder that it is never a good idea to include Hitler in any contemporary political analogy. In an equally strange twist on another difficult issue, Sen. John Kennedy offered a typically florid aside in a floor speech touting his bill on tackling sexual harassment. ""I don't know how the actors in Hollywood have time to make movies,"" said the Louisiana Republican. ""They are too busy molesting each other."" In the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, it was a case of poacher-turned-gamekeeper as Pompeo turned up to testify. Pompeo, in a previous incarnation as a Kansas congressman, was a master of committee histrionics, especially when Hillary Clinton was in the witness chair. Now that he's taken her place, he's disdainful of such behavior, and there were tense exchanges on US policy in the Middle East and Trump's scything of the diplomatic budget, which Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, blasted as ""bananas."" But finally, at the end of a long, dispiriting Washington day, there was a rare moment of comity, after Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, offered a survey of foreign policy challenges in Africa. ""I think I agree with everything you said there,"" Pompeo said."

Six takeaways from CNN's presidential town - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Dan Merica,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-town-hall-takeaways/index.html,"(CNN) Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand on Tuesday did something most politicians aren't willing to do: Unequivocally admit when they think they've made a mistake.
Gillibrand came into CNN's town hall with a long list of progressive policies that she regularly touts on the campaign trail. But she also stepped into the spotlight with a record that includes conservative positions on immigration and guns, something that has followed her throughout her 2020 campaign and raised questions about her progressive credentials. Gillibrand looked to both apologize for her past record while also using that history as proof of her ability to reach out and connect with conservative voters on Tuesday night. The US senator from New York, who officially launched her campaign in March in outside President Donald Trump's eponymous hotel in Manhattan, has so far failed to break out of the large and growing pack of Democrats running for president in 2020, but the CNN town hall offered Gillibrand a platform to do just that. 'It's really important ... to admit when you're wrong' Read More Gillibrand said on Tuesday that she was ""ashamed"" of her past conservative views on immigration, telling voters that she believes she is in the ""right place"" right now. Gillibrand ran and won a House seat near Albany, New York, in 2006 by attacking her Republican opponent from the right on immigration and guns, calling securing the border ""a national security priority."" Gillibrand said her policy positions at the time did not treat people like she would want to be treated. ""I did not do that as a House member. I was ashamed,"" she said. She built on that answer Tuesday night by arguing her ability to admit she is wrong sets her apart from Trump. Kirsten Gillibrand takes questions at CNN town hall ""When I was a member of Congress from upstate New York, I was really focused on the priorities of my district. When I became senator of the entire state, I recognized that some of my views really did need to change,"" Gillibrand said. ""They were not thoughtful enough and didn't care enough about people outside of the original upstate New York district that I represented. So, I learned."" She added: ""And I think for people who aspire to be president, I think it's really important that you're able to admit when you're wrong and that you're able to grow and learn and listen and be better, and be stronger. That is something that Donald Trump is unwilling to do. He is unwilling to listen, he is unwilling to admit when he's wrong. He's actually incapable of it. And I think it's one of the reasons why he is such a cowardly president."" Gillibrand's more conservative record is one of the key criticisms her candidacy receives from the left, but it shows how the 2020 candidate's early strategy is to face up to questions about her record and not run away from them, believing that embracing her story and evolution on issues like guns and immigration could win plaudits from caucus-goers in Iowa and convince them that she could win a general election against Trump by appealing to a spectrum of voters. Past views on guns also a benefit Gillibrand, in the same hour that she apologized for her past position on immigration, also cast the fact that she once had an A-rating from the National Rifle Association as making her better equipped to talk to gun owners about the need for gun control. Gillibrand, a mother of two, said the way to reach conservatives on this issue is to make it about family and children. ""I think I can walk into any voter in a red state or a purple state or a blue state, gun owners, NRA members, and say, 'You do care about a 4-year-old dying on a park bench in Brooklyn, don't you?'"" Gillibrand said. ""And the humanity of each person in this country should kick in."" She added: ""And you are going to ask them to imagine that happening to their own child, their own loved one, and their own family. And I think you can change hearts that way."" Gillibrand said earlier this year that she was ""embarrassed"" by her past positions on guns. She began to change her position after she became a senator and met with Jennifer Pryear and Alberto Yard, the parents of Nyasia Pryear-Yard, a young woman who was killed in a 2009 shooting in Brooklyn. ""So, I had an A-rating as a House member,"" she said in Iowa earlier this year. ""I only really looked at guns through the lens of hunting. My mother still shoots the Thanksgiving turkey. But when I became senator, I recognized I had a lot to learn about my state and all of the 20 million I was going to represent."" 'I don't know' Rarely do you see a politician cop to not knowing something. But Gillibrand, on two separate occasions on Tuesday night, said she didn't know the answer to a policy question and pledged to look into it more. First, when asked about whether she would support mandatory vaccination except in the case of medical exception, Gillibrand said she had not ""thought about whether I would make it mandatory."" Gillibrand sees Trump as 'a toddler who is melting down and making bad decisions' ""I would need to think about that,"" she said. ""But I do believe that parents need more information about why vaccines are so essential. Parents need to know that their child could die of preventable diseases, that they could spread a preventable disease and other children could die."" Later, when asked whether she would lower the voting age, Gillibrand said, ""I don't know."" ""I really don't know. I like the idea of it because we want to inspire more young people,"" Gillibrand said. ""But I like the fact that when you turn 18, you earn this right. It's a rite of passage. It's a time when you're independent of your parents as a matter of law. So, I like the simplicity of 18. But because you've asked the question, I will think about it."" Defends fundraising Gillibrand argued Tuesday that she isn't beholden to any special interests and urged voters to look at her record if they believed she was. After touting her voting record on standing up to drug companies, Gillibrand defended her decision to allow a top executive at pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to host a fundraiser for her 2020 campaign, using it as an example of how she can be close with certain industries while also stringently regulating them. Sally Susman, Pfizer's executive vice president and chief corporate affairs officer, hosted a fundraiser for Gillibrand earlier this year. Asked about the fundraiser on Tuesday, Gillibrand said her connection to Susman was personal. ""Why did you allow the Pfizer vice president to do that?"" CNN's Erin Burnett asked. ""Because she's my friend, and she supports LGBTQ equality, she supports my beliefs,"" Gillibrand said. ""You don't want to undermine an individual's right to participate, but because you made that assumption, it's one of the reasons we need to get money out of politics. Because it corrodes people's belief that our democracy is strong."" Gillibrand, in response to a question from a voter, defended her record on dealing with drug prices. ""I stand up to the drug companies,"" she said. ""I've sponsored legislation to stand up to the drug companies and I'm not beholden to donors. That's why I'm in favor of publicly funded elections. It's why I don't take lobbyist money and it's why I don't want to have an individual super PAC. I believe if you want this in your own hands, you have to fight for public elections. I'm not beholden to any industries, and my drug record proves it."" Not worried about relationship with Clinton Gillibrand once wrote that Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, first lady and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, changed her life inspiring her to run for office. But that relationship did not stop the New York senator who took over Clinton's seat when she became secretary of state to tell The New York Times in 2017 that she believes former President Bill Clinton should have resigned amid the Monica Lewinsky affair. Asked about how those comments changed her relationship with Hillary Clinton, Gillibrand said that it had not. ""I don't think so,"" Gillibrand said when asked whether the comment cost her that friendship. Gillibrand went on to say that she has talked to Hillary Clinton about her 2020 run and that the former secretary of state has given her advice. ""Secretary Clinton is still a role model for all of us,"" Gillibrand said. ""My views on her husband is very different. And I've said all I'm going to say about that."" Gillibrand added: ""She's somebody who I still admire and look up to, and she's given a lot to this country."" Gillibrand on faith: 'It centers me' Although Gillibrand talks about her faith regularly on the campaign trail, Tuesday allowed the Democratic presidential candidate to describe how her faith fits into her life in front of a national audience. ""I define myself by my faith. It centers me. It's something that is one of the reasons why I'm running for president,"" she said. Gillibrand was asked whether she believed there was room in the Democratic Party for a religious left. ""I think anyone should be able to have faith, whether they're ultraconservative or liberal. And if you're coming from a Christian perspective, I would say the gospel doesn't leave anybody out,"" Gillibrand said before discussing some of the social teachings of Christianity. ""I would argue the Democrats are often better on those issues than Republicans. So, there's no reason you can't be a person of any faith in any political party."" When she was asked if she ever felt like being a person of faith in the Democratic Party was ""odd,"" since conservatives in the Republican party tend to be more outspoken in their religious beliefs, she answered directly. ""No,"" the senator said."
Fact-checking Trump's claims that Obama separated families - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Maegan Vazquez,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/fact-check-trump-claim-obama-separated-families/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he's not considering reimplementing his administration's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy, dredging up his earlier claim that President Barack Obama's administration separated migrant families.
""President Obama separated children. They had child separation. I was the one who that changed it,"" Trump said. Facts First: As discussed in a previous fact check , this is false and requires context. Under Obama, children were separated from parents only when authorities had concerns for their well-being or could not confirm that the adult was in fact their legal guardian, but not as a blanket policy. The family separation crisis was triggered last spring when Trump tweaked the status quo he inherited from Obama and ramped up strict enforcement of federal immigration laws that were already on the books. Under past administrations , some border-crossers were occasionally prosecuted, and were thus separated from their families. Read More The main difference between Trump and Obama, experts have said, centers on how they handled immigrants caught near the US-Mexico border. Under Obama, the Justice Department was given broad discretion on who should face criminal charges, and federal prosecutors rarely went after families. But in April 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Justice Department would prosecute 100% of illegal border-crossers in a policy known as ""zero-tolerance."" Adults went to jails and awaited criminal proceedings. Children were sent to detention centers run by the Department of Health and Human Services, and some were eventually placed in foster care. This specific change is what led to the widespread separation of parents and children, according to Jessica Bolter, a researcher with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute who has published 200 pages of reports on Trump's immigration policies. 'Those cages ... were built by President Obama's administration' On Tuesday, the President also claimed ""cages"" were built by Obama to house migrant children. ""Those cages that were shown -- I think they were very inappropriate -- they were built by President Obama's administration, not by Trump,"" the President said. Facts First: This appears to be true but requires context. Many of these processing facilities do pre-date the Trump administration, and were constructed during the Obama administration. These include those where migrants are kept in fenced enclosures, the so-called cages. Given the recent rise in migrants coming to the border, the Trump administration has continued to use the chain-link style fencing enclosures -- at least while migrants are being processed following apprehension. And according to a watchdog report released by the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general's office last fall, immigration authorities have sometimes held migrant children in these processing facilities for much longer than they should be. Typically shelters maintained by Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement, the office which handles facilities for unaccompanied minors, do not maintain the same chain-link type fencing often associated with the description of ""cages."" They do, however, confine the children to the shelter properties and many did become overcrowded amid family separations. Outgoing Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was asked during a March congressional hearing how facilities being used to house unaccompanied minors are different from cages. New Jersey Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman asked: ""Does it differ from the cages you put your dogs in when you let them stay outside? Is it different?"" Nielsen replied: ""Yes ... It's larger. It has facilities. It provides room to sit, to stand, to lay down."" 'Many more are coming' Trump also claimed that ending the zero-tolerance policy has led to an increase in illegal immigration. ""Now, I'll tell you something, once you don't have it, that's why you have many more people coming. They are coming like it's a picnic, like 'Let's go to Disneyland,' "" Trump said. Facts First: Saying that ending zero-tolerance policy is the root cause for an increase in migration to the US ignores a confluence of other factors. It's true that the number of people arriving at the border are now set to reach levels not seen in a decade, and there has been an increase since the end of the policy. More undocumented immigrants were apprehended along the southern border in March than any month since 2008, according to Customs and Border Protection data released Tuesday . The increase has been paired with a shift in demographics of migrants. There are now more families and children trying to cross into the US, and a majority of the migrants are Central Americans. Family units before the zero-tolerance policy were slightly increasing, and directly after the policy ended, they skyrocketed. Though there was a slight decrease in total apprehensions and inadmissables logged by CBP during the months in 2018 that the zero-tolerance policy was implemented, apprehensions and inadmissables never got back to their historic 2017 lows. But they shifted up after the program was ended, and are continuing to shoot up now. A recent increase in migration also comes alongside a series of other factors pressuring individuals to attempt to enter the US, including deteriorating conditions in their home countries, criminal organizations encouraging migration and threats of an imminent US-Mexico border closure."
Democrats prepare their response to Barr's redacted report - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Jeremy Herb,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/democratic-response-redacted-mueller-report/index.html,"(CNN) House Democrats are prepping a swift response to Attorney General William Barr's plans to release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report within the next week , after Barr's first public comments Tuesday did little to quell the Democratic anger over Barr's rollout of the special counsel probe.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler is preparing to ""very quickly"" subpoena the Justice Department and go to court seeking to obtain grand jury information, while House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff says he's made a formal request to obtain the counterintelligence information from Mueller's investigation to learn whether the President is ""compromised"" in any way. ""I think that's a betrayal to what he promised during his confirmation,"" Schiff told CNN, referring to Barr's refusal so far to not provide Congress with the full report and underlying evidence. ""But it's what he was hired to do, which is to protect the President. The President wanted his own Roy Cohn and apparently he got one. But it is deeply concerning."" The multi-pronged approach is the clearest sign yet that Barr's release of a redacted report will not stop the brewing showdown between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the 22-month special counsel investigation. The fight is almost assuredly going to wind up in court as Democrats seek to pry material from the Mueller investigation out of the Justice Department beyond what Barr says he will provide. Barr laid down his marker at a Tuesday budget hearing, his first appearance before Congress since Mueller's investigation wrapped last month. Barr said he was working to make as much information public as possible and that he would work with Nadler if he sought additional material. Read More But he drew the line at providing the full report or grand jury material. ""I don't intend at this stage to send the full, unredacted report to the committee,"" Barr told a House Appropriations subcommittee. ""Until someone shows me a provision"" permitting the release of grand jury material, Barr added, ""Congress doesn't get"" that material. In response, Nadler said he expected to issue the subpoena, which the committee authorized last week for the report and underlying materials, once Barr releases the report. ""I assume we will get the redacted report within a week. When we do so, if we don't get everything, we will issue the subpoena and go to court,"" the New York Democrat said, adding that the subpoena was likely to come ""very quickly."" 4 key takeaways from William Barr's testimony on the Mueller report But that's not the only effort underway in Congress to obtain the information from the Mueller report. Schiff said Tuesday that he had made a formal request for his committee to obtain the counterintelligence materials from Mueller's investigation. ""We have made a formal request for all of the information and findings in the counterintelligence investigation, as they're required to provide us under the National Security Act of 1947,"" the California Democrat said. ""Our priority at the moment has been to make sure this report is made public, and make as much of the report public as possible, but we will be following through to make sure we get the counterintelligence information that they're obligated to provide."" A committee aide said the request was made in the last few weeks. The request to the Justice Department, Schiff said, would fall under a grand jury exemption for material related to counterintelligence matters, and Schiff didn't rule out using a subpoena if necessary. ""We have an independent basis to want the counterintelligence information, after all of this began as a counterintelligence investigation, to determine, to find out whether the President or people in his campaign had been compromised in any way by a foreign power,"" Schiff said. ""That means giving us classified information, that means giving us grand jury information."" Schiff's comments suggesting that President or his team could be compromised have been criticized by Republicans in the wake of Mueller's investigation wrapping. The Republicans on the Intelligence Committee cited Barr's summary stating that Mueller's probe did not establish a criminal conspiracy to jointly call for Schiff's resignation as chairman last month. Republican fury aimed at Schiff, face of the Russia investigation Still, at Tuesday's hearing Barr appeared more open to the notion of providing classified material to Congress. ""I could envision a situation where under appropriate safeguards, that information would be shared,"" Barr said. Barr had a very different reaction about grand jury material, arguing there was nothing in the special counsel regulations that states it should be provided to Congress. And in a dig at Nadler, Barr also noted in his testimony that the current special counsel regulations, which make the report confidential, were written after the Ken Starr investigating into President Bill Clinton. ""Many of the people who are right now calling for the release of this report were basically castigating Ken Starr and others for releasing the Starr report,"" Barr said, echoing President Donald Trump's criticism of Nadler. Democrats had their own criticisms of Barr's comments in Tuesday's hearing, particularly his decision not to respond to questions on whether the White House had been briefed on the Mueller report. ""It was clear to me that the attorney general felt that he was an appointee of the President of the United States of America, and it's very hard for me to believe that he didn't make any changes or additions based on any suggestions that might have come from the White House,"" said House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat. Asked why he was waiting for Barr to release his report before issuing a subpoena -- given the attorney general's comments about the unredacted report -- Nadler said his committee wanted to show the courts ""we're making every effort to accommodate"" the Justice Department. Republicans have criticized Democrats' efforts to obtain additional materials from the Mueller report, accusing them of an unwillingness to accept the results of Mueller's investigation and arguing there's no precedent for Nadler to seek grand jury material unless he launches impeachment proceedings. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday that Congress shouldn't be given the unredacted Mueller report because it would leak. ""Do you think they would keep a secret? No. We would harm people,"" the California Republican said Tuesday. ""I'm sure they'll keep a secret -- the problem is the people they tell wouldn't be able to keep a secret."" Nadler has argued that Congress is entitled to grand jury information, citing previous cases that include the Clinton and Watergate investigations. Asked whether those were different because they were part of formal impeachment proceedings, Nadler said the court has also allowed material to be provided in cases that are ""preparatory to a judicial proceeding."" ""An impeachment inquiry is a judicial proceeding, or has been considered in the past,"" Nadler said. ""And certainly an inquiry which may help you determine whether or not to initiate an impeachment is preparatory to that."" This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday."

"Jill Noe, former basketball star, is carrying twin babies for her twin sister - CNN",us.cnn.com,Loumay Alesali and Amanda Jackson,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/us/jill-noe-surrogates-for-her-twin-sister-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) When her sister couldn't get pregnant, this twin stepped up to make her dreams come true.
Jill Noe and Whitney Bliesner, 34, from Portland, Oregon, have always shared a special bond because they are twins. That bond is growing stronger, as Noe has become a surrogate for Bliesner. Bliesner was diagnosed with a rare genetic disease called Neurofibromatosis type 2, or NF2, which is the growth of noncancerous tumors in the nervous system, according to the US National Library of Medicine. NF2 stopped Bliesner from having children, since pregnancy puts her at a higher risk of tumors due to hormonal changes, according to Noe, a former basketball star who played at Arizona State University. Bliesner always dreamed about being a mother, especially after she married her husband, Peter, three years ago. Over the holidays in 2017, she told Noe she didn't think her dream would become a reality. Bliesner said it was too expensive for her to get a surrogate or adopt a child. Read More At that moment, Noe recalled to CNN, she could hear the sound of defeat from her sister and didn't think twice about volunteering to be her surrogate. ""I was like, yeah! Let's just do it!"" Noe said. ""Let's just see where this goes and let's see if I can get my body to where it needs to be to have your kids."" Noe said her twin looked at her in disbelief before the joy rushed over her face. ""I was very happy and excited, but also shocked,"" Bliesner said. ""Because I know how active and fun and exciting her life is, and for her to want to actually stop that for me was just kind of like a shock."" Bliesner faced several health issues because of her condition, including hearing loss in her right ear that she said can be passed on genetically. She also had a partial hysterectomy because of fibroid tumors. ""We couldn't use my eggs because there's a 50/50 chance I could pass it on and I just don't think I would be able to live with myself if I knew I passed this condition to my kids,"" Bliesner said. Noe is now 30 weeks along in her pregnancy with a healthy set of twins, a boy and a girl, due June 6. The soon-to-be parents have already picked out the names, Rhett for the boy and Rhenley for the girl. Noe and Bliesner have been supported by their family, especially their mother, whom Noe described as ""the catalyst"" for them to be such a strong family. ""It's just instilled in me and Whitney, and obviously my other siblings, that no matter what adversities we faced, we're always there together and we'll go through it as one big strong unit,"" Noe said."
NY pizzeria extortion plot: 3 people face 20 years in prison - CNN,us.cnn.com,Faith Karimi,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/new-york-fake-mobsters-pizzeria-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) An actor and two other people face 20 years in prison after they confessed to trying to extort $198,000 from a former New York pizzeria owner in a plot federal officials described as similar to a mob shakedown.
Douglas Singer, Leroy Wilson and Marianne Wood each pleaded guilty Tuesday to an extortion conspiracy involving an unnamed victim in Brooklyn. Mafia don Frank Cali's killing is a reminder the mob is alive. Just not as flashy The incident started last year after the victim sold his pizzeria in a building he owned to Singer, the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York said in a statement. The victim sold the pizzeria for $60,000, a $15,600 security deposit and monthly rent payments of $5,200, according to the court documents. From there, the business deal turned into a scene from a mobster movie, complete with a muscle man in a dark outfit and sunglasses. Read More The three carefully scripted an intimidation plot to force the victim into giving them $200,000, said Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. A threat and a flash of a prop pistol Court documents described how the incident played out when Wilson, Singer and Wood rolled up to the pizzeria in November last year after planning the extortion plot for months. Wood said she worked for an organization that handles Singer's business relating to the pizzeria, according to court documents. She told the owner that he owed the organization $198,000, a figure she said she got as a result of costs such as equipment and renovations, and purported operating losses incurred by Singer. She demanded payment the same day. In an attempt to intimidate, Wood showed the victim photographs of his spouse and children and told him it would be in the best interest of his family for him to pay up, the documents said. During the conversation, Wilson -- described as a professional actor in court documents -- leaned toward the victim to expose a pistol holstered on his hip. Wilson had been recruited to play the role of a muscle or a bodyguard, court documents said. The victim reported the incident to the authorities and an investigation revealed a series of messages among the three showing how they planned the alleged extortion. An 'acting gig' and an all-black outfit Before the meeting at the restaurant, the three exchanged a slew of messages by phone and Facebook to plan the extortion, court documents said. Singer asked Wilson via Facebook Messenger if he was interested in an ""acting gig."" ""I need a couple of guys to escort my associate [Wood] while she delivers a demand to my landlord. You will simply have to stand in the background and appear to be muscle,"" the message said. For the role, Singer asked Wilson to wear a dark suit with no tie, a white shirt and dark sunglasses, court documents said. When everyone was on board for the plot, Singer sent a message to the trio saying, ""Let the games begin!"" Wood responded: ""Oh yeah baby!!"" Fake gun. Real-life inmates Their excitement was short-lived. On December 14, FBI agents executed a search warrant at Wilson's home and found a black prop pistol and the leather jacket he was seen wearing on surveillance footage during the pizzeria meeting, federal officials said. ""A group of people doing their best to act like a group of mobsters, shaking down a pizzeria owner, will now face a steep price for what they described as 'kinda fun,'"" said William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBI New York field office, who announced the guilty plea. ""Business owners who are trying to make an honest living shouldn't have to fear someone with no legal power over them extorting and threatening their livelihoods."" Singer, 54; Wilson, 47; and Wood, 61; each face up to 20 years in prison."
Half a million children at risk as Libya violence continues: UNICEF,us.cnn.com,Euan McKirdy,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/africa/libya-tripoli-violence-intl/index.html,"(CNN) More than half a million children are at ""direct risk"" in Libya as renegade general Khalifa Haftar's forces advance on the United Nations-recognized government in the capital of Tripoli, according to UNICEF.
In a statement Tuesday, the UN agency called on all parties to refrain from ""committing grave violations against children"" -- including the recruitment of children as soldiers. The agency said it would remain on the ground during the conflict to provide support to children and their families. Years of fighting among various militias in the war-torn country reached an apparent crescendo Thursday when Haftar ordered the Libyan National Army (LNA) to march on Tripoli in a bid to take the capital from the government. Gun-mounted vehicles belonging to fighters loyal to the internationally recognised GNA are pictured near a military compound in a suburb of Tripoli. The World Health Organization (WHO) said Tuesday that least 47 people were killed and 181 wounded in the first three days of fighting in the beleaguered North African country. Nine of the dead are civilians, including two doctors working to provide critical healthcare in Tripoli, the WHO said. About 3,400 people have been displaced, according to UN estimates. Read More Militias from the coastal towns of Misrata and Zawia -- which are not under the UN-recognized government's direct control -- have deployed troops to the capital as part of the counter-offensive against the LNA. Members of Misrata forces, under the protection of Tripoli's forces, prepare themselves to go to the front line in Tripoli. Death toll rises In the eight years since former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was deposed and killed in 2011 -- following a military intervention led by France and the UK -- Haftar has been one of a handful of strongmen to take advantage of the nation's descent into disarray. Based in the city of Benghazi, the general wields control over much of eastern Libya, and has his sights set on Tripoli. Earlier this week, Tripoli's only working airport, Mitiga, was shuttered after it was targeted in an airstrike that ignored international calls for a truce. The GNA quickly condemned the aerial bombardment, calling it a war crime. There has also been fighting around Tripoli's international airport, 15 miles (24 km) south of the city center, which has not been operational for years. The GNA admitted Monday that it temporarily lost control of the site to Haftar's fighters. Armed clashes have been concentrated in areas close to Tripoli, with both sides using ""artillery shelling, airstrikes, anti-aircraft missiles and heavy shooting in residential areas,"" according to a Health Sector Working Group situation report seen by CNN. Militants, believed to be from the terrorist group ISIS, carried out an attack on the town of Al-Fuqaha, about 370 miles (600 km) southeast of Tripoli Tuesday, killing two people including the head of the city council, according to Libya's Al-Ahrar News. The attackers also kidnapped another person, Al-Ahrar said. The militant group said in a statement it took control of the town for several hours, but did not provide evidence for this claim. A member of the Libyan security forces points towards a crater on the ground following an air strike at Mitiga International Airport in the capital Tripoli on April 8, 2019. Peace conference? The UN had planned to hold a conference between April 14 and 16 in the southwestern Libyan town of Ghadames to broker a solution to the crisis. Amid the escalation of fighting, the UN Special Envoy to Libya Ghassan Salame called for the conference to be held ""as soon as possible"" -- but it was unclear when that would be, given recent developments. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres visited Benghazi last week for talks with Haftar to push for an international peace deal, but left empty handed. Following their meeting, Guterres said he was leaving Libya ""with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli."""

Fear stalks ordinary Kashmiris as Indian election approaches,us.cnn.com,Nikhil Kumar,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/india/kashmir-constant-fear-intl/index.html,"Uri, Indian controlled Kashmir (CNN) If it wasn't for the military installations that dot the mountain passes, the endless coils of barbed wire, or the armed soldiers around every corner, this small border town in Indian controlled Kashmir might be mistaken for a tranquil mountain paradise.
The air is cool and the surrounding peaks are capped with snow, blindingly white in the early Spring sun. But the tremor and the terror in Mohammad Riyad's voice as he recalls what happened in the middle of the night in late February betrays the true reality of the situation. Riyad lives in a small village just beyond the town of Uri, in the shadow of the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides this disputed region between India and Pakistan. It is one of the world's most militarized frontiers, the site of frequent armed showdowns between the two nuclear foes, both of which claim Kashmir in its entirety. Violence here is always just a hair trigger away. Read More Shelling across the frontier is common. According to official figures tabled in the Indian parliament in March last year, cross border firing incidents along the LoC have risen dramatically in recent years, from 152 in 2015 to 860 in 2017. Riyad and numerous other local residents say the situation has worsened in recent weeks. Mohammad Riyad shows the scars he received after shrapnel split open his abdomen. ""I was asleep when a shell landed right outside my window,"" he says, his voice cracking as he lifts up his shirt to reveal what happened next: Shrapnel rained down on his bed, splitting open his abdomen. Emergency surgery in Srinagar, main city in Indian controlled Kashmir, saved his life. A blackish ladder of stitches runs up and across his stomach. Thankfully, he says, his wife and children were sleeping away from the window and escaped without any injuries. The family remains fearful of further attacks. ""It could happen again tonight."" Constant tension Tensions across the region spiked after a February 14 car bomb attack on Indian forces in south Kashmir. Forty Indian paramilitaries died, making it the worst ever attack on Indian forces stationed here. Delhi, which says Pakistan had a ""direct hand"" in the bombing, responded by sending fighter jets across the LoC, deploying air power to strike in its opponent's territory for the first time in five decades. India says it was targeting a training camp run by the group behind the attack, an account Pakistan disputes. Islamabad also denies any role in the bombing. Next came an aerial skirmish between the two sides, and then the capture of an Indian pilot by Pakistan. The town of Uri in Indian controlled Kashmir, close to the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides this disputed region between India and Pakistan. The pilot's quick release helped reduce hostilities, pulling the two countries back from a violent spiral that many observers feared could tip into all out war and, in the most extreme scenario, even give rise to a nuclear clash. But, locals here say, the two sides continue to fire artillery shells across the LoC, each side blaming the other for the violence. Meanwhile, as India gears up for national elections set to begin on April 11, the conflict has become a major campaign issue, with India's nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his allies holding up the recent air skirmishes as proof that he's strong on defense -- stronger, they insist, than his predecessors and rivals. Signposts on the road between Uri and Srinagar. In a recent interview with the local Economics Times daily, Amit Shah, President of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and his closest political aide, said: ""Until now, there were only two countries which took revenge for the martyrdom of their soldiers -- the US and Israel. Because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India is now the third country to do so."" In case there was any doubt about whether the BJP wanted to make national security an election issue, Shah added : ""National elections have to be fought on who can ensure better national security."" Modi has also referred to the border tensions. ""Enough is enough,"" he said at a public event in March, referring to the February attack, and an earlier 2016 attack on a military installation in Uri, according to the Indian news agency PTI. ""We cannot keep suffering till eternity."" Mohammad Ansar, 16, was knocked unconscious when a shell landed close to where he stood. 'Out of nowhere' As politicians' grandstand, fear stalks ordinary Kashmiris, like 16-year-old Mohammad Ansar, who lives in another village near the de facto border. Ansar was at home having lunch with his mother and two brothers in mid-March when they heard the sound of shelling outside. ""We ate and then went outside to see where it was coming from when a shell landed right where were standing,"" he says. Ansar says it seemed to come out of nowhere. ""It was quiet when we went outside. We didn't hear anything and suddenly it hit us."" Babur Ali and his wife say they have become refugees in their own land. Ansar was knocked down and suffered a head wound. His brothers, both ten, and his mother were also injured: One of the young boys still has a cast around one leg, and bandages around the other. Their mother's neck and shoulders are covered with surgical bandages. ""We're still very scared,"" Ansar says. ""Every time I hear a loud noise, I panic."" So do Babur Ali's children. Ali used to live near the border, but increased shelling in the aftermath of the February air skirmishes forced him to flee with his family. Babur Ali's children now live in temporary housing near Srinagar. Huddled together in temporary housing near Srinagar in the biting Kashmiri cold, he says his children are terrified of returning to their village because of the shelling. ""We had to leave our home, our possessions, everything... we had no choice."" With Kashmir still tense, they've become refugees in their own land."
Theresa May's position looks shakier than ever as Brexit negotiations drag on,us.cnn.com,"Analysis by Jane Merrick, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/uk/may-european-union-brexit-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May will face her fellow -- for now -- European Union leaders at a summit Wednesday with everyone around the table knowing she is running out of options on Brexit .
May was supposed to have come up with a credible alternative Brexit plan, that could be passed by her Parliament, to present at the summit in Brussels, yet talks with the UK opposition Labour Party on that new deal have failed to bear fruit. May to ask Merkel and Macron for a Brexit extension as Parliament votes to block no-deal It's likely, then, that the summit will be difficult, but not a disaster for May. And yet even if she squeaks through it unscathed, the storm clouds are gathering back home. Those talks with the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and his allies are not just about window dressing, but a serious attempt by both parties to reach a consensus on Brexit. But they are in danger of coming to nothing because both sides remain far apart on issues like a permanent customs union between the UK and EU after Brexit. The talks are scheduled to resume Thursday, but there is a sense in Westminster that because both parties remain far apart on the fundamentals the two sides are just going through the motions. Read More This sense is being picked up in Europe too, which is why EU leaders are pressing for a long delay to Brexit -- of up to a year -- because there is no quick deal in sight. Party split Of more urgent concern to May will be the mood of her Conservative Party. There was a point, a week or so ago, when despite crushing parliamentary defeats on the prime minister's original Brexit deal, Conservative Eurosceptic lawmakers were starting to weaken their opposition to May's plan -- in the interest of making sure Brexit happens and stopping Corbyn becoming prime minister. Yet May's decision to open up talks with the Labour leader have caused outrage inside her own government, ordinary Conservative lawmakers and grassroots activists. Now, the prospect of the EU imposing a lengthy delay to Brexit has only compounded that outrage. Conservative lawmakers are starting to get restless, once again, about May's ability to cling to power. Theresa May seeks Brexit delay from Merkel and Macron An ominous sign of this restlessness for the prime minister appeared in the House of Commons Tuesday, when more than half of Conservative members failed to support May on what should have been a straightforward vote to approve the PM's request for a short extension to Brexit until June 30. As May traveled to Berlin and Paris to appeal for support from German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, 97 Conservative lawmakers voted against the short delay, and a further 80, including some ministers, abstained. The measure passed thanks to Labour support. While May is protected from a vote of no confidence in her leadership by her own party until December -- due to an official year-long period of grace following an unsuccessful bid to unseat her last Christmas -- this is not stopping some Conservative Brexiteers from wanting her to renew their attempts to get rid of her and replace her with a tougher leader and prime minister who would be happy for the UK to leave the EU without a deal. May to step down? Last month, May signaled her intention to step down once Brexit takes place. This position is too vague for the most rebellious of her own MPs. What's more, May has already made clear she should not stay on as leader if Brexit slips beyond a June 30 timetable. If EU leaders press for that longer delay, to the end of December or even March next year, the pressure on May to stand down will be immense. UK lays groundwork to participate in European Parliament elections First, she must get through this week's summit. European Council president Donald Tusk, and a majority of EU leaders, are happy to give the UK its ""flextension"" -- a flexible extension period which could be shortened if the Commons finally passes a deal. A draft conclusion for EU leaders to back, circulated last night, states that the UK must act in a ""constructive and responsible manner"" during the delay period -- in an attempt to prevent a more hardline future prime minister cutting up rough over Brexit. But French President Macron is driving a harder bargain, insisting on tougher rules for the UK, including a review of its progress towards a Brexit deal every three months and relegating its membership status to ""intermediate,"" with few rights or influence. May has a weak hand going into Wednesday's summit -- but every day longer the UK stays in the EU, the more unstable her position becomes back home."
Top Treasury aide heading to Blackstone Group,us.cnn.com,Cristina Alesci,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/eli-miller-blackstone/index.html,"Washington (CNN Business) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's chief of staff, Eli Miller, is heading to the private sector.

Trump to sign executive orders meant to free up oil and gas pipeline development,us.cnn.com,"Jill Disis and David Goldman, CNN Business",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/business/trump-executive-order-oil-gas-pipeline/index.html," The Trump administration on Wednesday will announce two executive orders aimed at freeing up more pipelines to supply the United States with oil and gas. The orders could give the federal government more power over states in approving energy projects.
The United States is producing more oil and gas than any point in its history, in large part because of the shale boom in the Permian Basin in West Texas. But producers have trouble getting all of that supply to customers due to constraints on the number of pipelines. Canadian oil is also a problem, because Canada has run out of pipelines to send oil to the United States. Several states have invoked the Clean Water Act to delay approval of sections of pipelines, arguing that the pipelines will cause environmental damage. New York, for example, rejected a natural gas pipeline three years ago that state officials said failed to meet water quality standards. Developers still want to build that pipeline, which was supposed to transport natural gas throughout markets in the Northeast. Read More One of the executive orders will direct the Environmental Protection Agency to revise the way states can consider the Clean Water Act when deciding whether to approve pipelines, according to a senior administration official. The official told reporters Tuesday night that there are ""a lot of problems"" with the way the Clean Water Act is being interpreted, adding that the administration expects the executive order to ""alleviate"" some of those issues. A second executive order is aimed at making cross-border energy infrastructure approval more streamlined. It says that any decision to issue or deny a cross-border permit shall be made solely by President Donald Trump. There's trouble in OPEC and oil prices are up 50% That executive order isn't limited to pipelines, but would cover other kinds of energy infrastructure projects, too. It comes amid controversy over the Keystone XL Pipeline, which is operated by TransCanada and which would bring Canadian oil into the United States. The Obama administration opted to shut down that pipeline, but the Trump administration has sought to reopen it . An official said Tuesday that the new executive order would affect ""future"" permitting for energy projects at the border. As energy prices have risen over the past several months, Trump has called on OPEC, the oil cartel led by Saudi Arabia, to help reduce the price of oil in the United States. Oil prices have risen because of a variety of factors including fighting in Libya, sanctions against Venezuela and Iran, and the inability of United States energy producers to deliver their vast supply to US customers. It is unclear if the executive order will have its intended, if any, impact. Many states are embroiled in bitter legal disputes with the Trump administration, and the executive order is unlikely to settle any of those disputes."

This drug-resistant fungus is spreading. Scientists warn of new superbugs to come - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Michael Nedelman, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/09/health/candida-auris-fungus-drug-resistance/index.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rss%2Fcnn_health+%28RSS%3A+CNN+-+Health%29,"(CNN) It began in 2009 , when doctors in Tokyo swabbed the ear of a 70-year-old woman and found an unknown strain of fungus that can infect humans and, in severe cases, cause a blood infection in high-risk patients. It's called Candida auris.
Now, a decade after it was discovered, cases have been reported in more than 30 countries around the globe -- including the United States, Australia, India, Germany, Israel, Venezuela and South Africa, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When you need antibiotics -- and when you don't But how we got here is a mystery: While the fungus seems to have cropped up relatively recently, its genetics reveal distinct groups that evolved apart, on different continents. ""We really can't explain that ... unless it goes back thousands of years,"" said Dr. Tom Chiller, chief of the CDC's Mycotic Diseases Branch. But when scientists went looking for C. auris in old samples -- knowing that earlier tests may have misidentified it or not picked it up -- it was hardly anywhere to be found. Read More ""It's a bit of a paradox, really,"" said Dr. David Eyre, an infectious disease physician based at Oxford University. ""Why has it suddenly come to cause a problem at a similar time in different parts of the world?"" Could it have to do with our use of antibiotics and antifungal drugs? Changes in the health care environment? Or perhaps it's some other evolutionary change, experts wonder. ""We've got an estimated 5 to 6 million different species of fungi. Only a few hundred cause human disease,"" Chiller explained. ""So there's a ton of potential for more things to emerge. ""Why did this Candida emerge?"" A fungus that acts 'like a bacteria' To Chiller, the emergence of C. auris highlights the danger of antimicrobial resistance: the rise of ""superbugs"" that threaten to render many of our tried-and-true drugs powerless. But there's something different about this fungus. ""It's a yeast that's acting like a bacteria,"" he said. Other species of Candida already travel with us -- on our skin, in our guts -- and they don't tend to cause infections unless there's an imbalance. This can happen, for example, when antibiotics wipe out good bacteria with the bad, leaving a place for Candida to grow. When this happens in the mouth, it's commonly referred to as thrush. In the vagina, it's a yeast infection. But most Candida is not known to be transmitted in health care settings, and C. auris is. Progress on deadly staph infections slows; CDC calls for increased prevention According to the CDC , C. auris can travel through health care facilities by lingering on surfaces and medical equipment, or it can spread directly from one person to another. In a study published in October, Eyre and his colleagues found 70 cases of C. auris in Oxford University Hospitals over the course of roughly 2½ years, from February 2015 to August 2017. All but a handful had been admitted to its neurosciences ICU. Until public health authorities put out alerts about the fungus and doctors began actively looking for it, ""we weren't aware that Candida auris was such a big issue,"" Eyre said. But it would be several months before they could contain the problem. They used protective gear, changed how they cleaned, scaled back on bedside equipment and took other measures to stop the spread. ""But despite doing those, we continued to see new cases,"" Eyre said. Finally, they found the culprit: a probe for monitoring patients' temperatures. Doctors stopped using the probes, but the fungus still lingered. Study: Superbug genes from India found in Arctic ""Even taking away the main culprit, it was still able to hang around for a few more months before we could get rid of it completely."" Eyre said this was a success story: Only a handful of patients had had invasive fungal infections, no deaths were directly linked to it, and they haven't had a problem since. But he warns that it might not be so straightforward for other places, especially ones dealing with more resistant types of C. auris than he did. Samples of the fungus sent to the CDC are often resistant to one or two key antifungal drugs, the agency says . And it can develop resistance to another while a patient is being treated. ""When it becomes resistant, it stays resistant,"" Chiller said, even though other microbes may lose their resistance when those drugs are no longer used against it. ""We've seen it become resistant to all three classes of antifungals, making it a superbug, making it really untreatable, because there is no drug that kills it."" Using drugs responsibly In the United States, 587 confirmed clinical cases have been reported in 12 states as of February 28, according to the CDC. Over 1,000 additional patients have been found to be colonized with the fungus through targeted screening in seven of these states. The world is running out of antibiotics, WHO says Most of the clinical cases have been found in New York, Illinois and New Jersey -- with 309, 144 and 104 confirmed cases, respectively. Chiller said that C. auris is ""another hard-to-treat organism in a patient population that's already really challenging to treat ... the sickest of the sick."" The patients Dr. Susan Bleasdale has seen in Illinois, for example, are chronically ill people who acquired the fungus in long-term care facilities, where they receive a number of other medical treatments. Fortunately, most of the cases she's seen have still been treatable with common antifungals, but she added that the appearance of C. auris underscores why we need to use drugs like antibiotics and antifungals responsibly.

""It's not about using less antibiotics. It's about using the right antibiotic for the right diagnosis and for the right duration of time,"" said Bleasdale, director of infection control and antimicrobial stewardship at the University of Illinois Hospital and Clinics. When it comes to bacteria, drug-resistant infections affect 2 million people a year in the United States, killing at least 23,000, the CDC says. And drug-resistant infections more broadly could claim 10 million lives per year around the globe by 2050 -- up from today's 700,000, according to one estimate . ""We live in a world covered with antibiotics,"" Chiller said. ""We really need to be thinking hard about how we use those drugs."" "
Technology that never stops looking for missing and exploited children,edition.cnn.com,"Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/health/missing-exploited-children-technology/index.html,"(CNN) When John Shehan joined the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 1999, people looking to create and share child sexual abuse material online belonged in the dark corners of the internet, he said. They had to purchase digital cameras and video recorders, wait on slow dial-up connections to upload content and find designated chat rooms with like-minded individuals.
Today, children can be easily photographed and recorded on mobile phones, high-speed internet has become available around the world, and social networking sites have gained popularity. All of this has made it easier to create and share child sexual abuse material, explained Shehan, who is now the vice president of the center's Exploited Children Division. Heartbreak all over again for Timmothy Pitzen's family ""It's a much more interconnected world now,"" he said. But the same interconnection that puts children at risk is now being used to find them when they go missing, and rescue them when they're being exploited. The old way: Posters and faxes distributed locally Read More Years ago, when a child was reported missing, the search involved creating posters and fliers that were distributed in the neighborhood and then faxed them to other jurisdictions if officers believed that the child may have been taken elsewhere, Shehan explained. ""Back in 1984, John Walsh, our founder, used to talk about how it was easier to track and find a missing car or a horse than it was a missing child,"" he said. The system was cumbersome and not well-connected, he added. Missing children, perception vs. reality Beyond paper fliers, law enforcement around the world did not have established systems to share the information online. ""Twenty years ago, we realized many law enforcement agencies did not know how to create websites or photos of missing kids online,"" said Caroline Humer, director of the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The organization has since created a system, known as the Global Missing Children Network Engine or GMCNgine, that allows law enforcement in 29 member countries to quickly create electronic posters in their local language. The posters are just one part of what the GMCNgine has become. The new way: Geotargeting, facial recognition and engines that never give up ""We wanted to build an engine that allows law enforcement to explain to these families that there is a system out there that will never stop looking for your child,"" Humer said. The engine ""never ends, never sleeps, never gives up; it never has a change of shift. It is a system that essentially runs 24/7, 365 days until the child is found ... regardless of how long the child has been missing."" Once the GMCNngine creates a poster with a missing child's information, it submits it to both local law enforcement and the Federation for Internet Alerts, which then sends an alert to everyone in the geographic region where the child is believed to be missing. It works by taking over advertisement space on individual websites, explained Jason Bier, president of the Federation for Internet Alerts. As people browse the web, rather than seeing an ad for clothes or shoes, they see an alert about a missing child. ""We have links in the alerts that, if you click them, you can look at a missing child poster,"" he said. ""We see millions of people that have looked at posters as a result."" In addition to the alerts, the GMCNgine uses facial recognition software to search for pictures matching that of the missing child. The global nature of the engine is particularly important, Humer explained, adding that a child can go missing at any time, anywhere, regardless of background, income or demographic. Similarly, the internet knows no boundaries, she added. Facial recognition software has recently come under scrutiny for some of its biases in identifying women and people of color. The American Civil Liberties Union has also raised privacy and effectiveness concerns. But Humer says artificial intelligence, and specifically facial recognition software, is used to narrow the field and keep investigators from having to comb through thousands of photos. Investigators then look at all the images the software presents as leads. Similar software is used to find exploited children who may or may not be missing. Finding trafficked children In recent years, technology companies have stepped up to help law enforcement find children who are trafficked online. One of these is Thorn, a startup that partnered with the technology company Digital Reasoning to create a sex trafficking investigation tool known as Spotlight. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
According to a survey conducted by the company in 2012, 75% of child sex-trafficking survivors had been sold online, most through escort websites. Spotlight finds images of minors in those ads, again helping law enforcement work through cases faster. ""We build software to help those in the front lines do their job better,"" said Julie Cordua, CEO of Thorn. Since its launch four years ago, Spotlight has helped officers in the United States and Canada open more than 21,000 trafficking cases and identify about 18,000 victims, including more than 6,000 children, according to the company's data. Spotlight and the GMCNgine work separately: One looks for exploited people, including children, and the other looks for missing children. ""What we do hope in the future is that we can connect these two together to make sure that if a child is missing and is being trafficked, our systems will pick that up,"" Humer said. ""That is the challenge for law enforcement. They only have one piece of the puzzle, so we are trying to give them as many pieces to put it all together."""

Buying a $1 Italy dream house just got easier,www.cnn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/italy-one-euro-home-websites/index.html,"t Cheese grottoes Set atop a sandstone hill, it's a maze of caves and zig-zag, circular alleys connected by huge, uneven grass-covered cobblestone steps that wind up to a stunning fortress. Named one of Italy's Most Beautiful Villages in 2015 in a national award, it straddles the Apennine Mountains, equidistant from the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian coasts. Related content Italian town of Sambuca in Sicily sells homes for a dollar Medieval bridges lead to a cluster of blue, pink, green and yellow pastel-colored farm dwellings and dome-shaped aristocratic mansions where just 1,000 people live. Bright flowers adorn street corners and grapevines grow over arches and old olive mills. Inside multi-layered Byzantine caves once used as storage rooms during the Crusades, teardrop-shaped Caciocavallo cheeses are now hung to season. Sounds good? Well here's how you get a slice of the action... and maybe some of that cheese. Step uno : Head to Zungoli's official website -- www.comunezungoli.it . On the left column, there's a link titled ""Case in vendita a €1."" You might need Google Translate to help you out at this point, or some rudimentary knowledge of Italian (which would be no bad thing anyway if you're thinking of living there.) Step due : Click on the link and you'll see dozens of 50- to 100-square-meter dwellings listed. They're all in need of some TLC, so you'll need some imagination. Step tre : Download the application form for the property you like. At this point you commit to renovating one within three years and must explain the type of project -- be it a private house, B&B or artisan shop. Step quattro : Attach a copy of your ID and forward everything to the mayor's office by email or mail. Step cinque: If your plan is approved, Caruso will send you a contract and then it's up to you to fly over to Italy and close the deal. The catch: As with all these cheap home deals, buyers must pay a €2,000 security deposit and commit to refurbishing the property. Work needs to start within a few months. Once it's complete and the purchase deed is made, the deposit is refunded. There are tax deductions of up to 85% for any restyling works. Rustic attractions Zungoli has a unique setting and a lot to offer -- guided trekking and cycling tours regularly explore the wild and pristine landscape. Once plagued by bandits and criss-crossed by pilgrimage routes and shepherd trails, known as tratturi, the terrain is dotted with Roman coins often filled with ancient coins. For 6,000 years, nomadic shepherds led their herds across its pastures into neighboring Puglia, a tradition now celebrated in festivals and in rustic local dishes like chiapparelle e bietole -- ravioli stuffed with chard. But it's not stuck in the past. ""We want to make things easy for new buyers"", says Caruso. ""My town has upgraded infrastructure, public LED lights and great Wi-Fi. Piazzas and pavements have just been revamped. Life quality is important."" Honey paradise If even that process sounds too complicated, the larger Italian town of Mussomeli, in Sicily, has made it even easier, creating a new multilingual real estate agency to handle its €1 houses deals. Photos of dwellings can be checked via the website www.case1euro.it , which features an interactive map that has detailed information on each building -- and it's all in English. Many of the abandoned stone farm dwellings are in good shape and need only minimal work. Related content Cash for babies, $10,000 gifts, $1 homes: The battle for the soul of rural Italy ""Original owners calls us each day to dispose of their old houses,"" says heritage councillor Toti Nigrelli. ""There are 100 on sale now and potentially another 400 are suitable. ""This project is my life mission but had I dealt with it on my own, I would have gone nuts."" Honeysuckle and eucalyptus are found across this sweet patch of land. Mussomeli's name stems from the latin Mons Melis, aka the ""Hill of Honey,"" and local delicacies include honey-coated guastedde buns and cuddureddi fried milk-soaked doughnuts. 'Sea of clouds' The fertile green farmland is dotted with old sulfur mines, sanctuaries, Roman necropolises and traces of primitive settlements. The town, rising on a 700-meter high hill, has views of the Etna volcano and the Valley of Temples. A local weather phenomenon called the ""Sea of Clouds"" can be seen from the top. Related content Buy your own Italian paradise island from $1.1 million ""Looking down you see the valley covered in a dense blanket of clouds as if the town were suspended mid-air. We want customers to experience all this,"" says Nigrelli. The historic center is divided into districts all of which, he swears, have different climatic features depending on which side of the hill you stand. Sounds like the ideal place? Step uno : Email the agency with a list of houses you like and download the documentation, following the instructions. It's all pretty straightforward. Step due : You still need to fly over to see exactly what you're getting, especially since the purchase cannot be done by email or telephone. So you need to fix an appointment and a tour of the houses. Step tre : The local agents will arrange a meeting with the notary and draw up an agreement under which you must commit to refurbishment within three years or forfeit a €5,000 security deposit. Interested buyers will be given a guided tour of the town, visiting top sites and tasting the local cuisine. The agency's staff will assist every step of the way. The catch: ""There's a €400 fee for such tailored services to be paid only at the end if a €1 house is actually purchased,"" says Nigrelli. Mystical vibe Anyone taking the private tour will see Mussomeli's panoramic piazzas, lavish gold-colored Baroque buildings and winding alleys leading to one of Italy's most breathtaking fortresses, dubbed the Enchanted Castle. Clinging like a spider on a pointed rock with steep, twisting staircases, the castle is said to conceal Saracen treasure and is haunted by the ghost of a murdered soldier. It's not the only eerie presence. Related content The phantoms of three girls, who were locked up by their jealous and tyrannical father and starved to death, have been heard crying at night. According to storytellers, they were found dead having chewed their own shoes for sustenance. Actors dressed in medieval clothes often animate the castle while religious parades create a mystical vibe. One festival, Batticchié, sees folks re-enact Sicilian daily life from the 1940s while enjoying local dishes such as 'mbriulate -- a bread bun stuffed with olives, onions and pork. Delicious. And not just the food."

Netanyahu on cusp of victory after tight Israeli election results - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Oren Liebermann,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/middleeast/israel-election-results-benjamin-netanyahu-benny-gantz-intl/index.html,"Jerusalem (CNN) Benjamin Netanyahu was on course to secure a record fifth term as Israeli Prime Minister after his main election rival conceded defeat on Wednesday evening.
After a dramatic finish to a tightly-fought race, former army chief Benny Gantz accepted that Netanyahu had won. ""We are all democratic, we all accept the decision of the nation,"" Gantz said. With more than 97% of the vote counted, according to Israeli media, a bloc led by Netanyahu's Likud party would secure 65 seats in the 120-strong Knesset. A center-left bloc led by Gantz's Blue and White party, supported by the Arab parties, would only muster 55 seats. Likud supporters celebrate as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu waves to them at its headquarters in Tel Aviv. Likud tied with Blue and White, gaining 35 seats each. But Netanyahu's path back to power is clearer, combining seats won by two ultra-orthodox religious parties, which both polled well, with those of smaller right-wing groups. How Israel's political debate moved from peace talks to annexation Netanyahu claimed victory Tuesday night. ""The right-wing bloc led by the Likud won a clear victory. I thank the citizens of Israel for the trust. I will start forming a right-wing government with our natural partners as soon as tonight,"" Netanyahu said. Read More Having all but secured his cherished fifth term, Netanyahu will become Israel's longest-serving leader in the summer, overtaking David Ben-Gurion, the country's founder. The votes of diplomats abroad and soldiers are yet to be counted. Israel's President, Reuven Rivlin, will decide who will form the next government after consultations with the heads of the political parties that secured enough seats in the Knesset. The President is likely to announce his decision in about a week. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump congratulate on Twitter , ""Spoke to Bibi @Netanyahu to congratulate him on a great and hard-fought win. The United States is with him and the People of Israel all the way!"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accompanied by his wife Sara, greets supporters. In the final days of the campaign, Netanyahu veered sharply to the right, pledging to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected, and warning his voter base that the end of his strong right-wing government would signal the beginning of a weak left-wing government. Netanyahu fought the election in the face of looming indictments for bribery and breach of trust offenses, which he sought to portray as a witch-hunt led by left-wing elites and fed by the media. The date for a final hearing in the case is yet to be set. At first, Netanyahu faced a diverse array of opponents. But then three former army chiefs come together with a TV news anchor-turned-politician to create the Blue and White party, named after the colors of the Israeli flag. Led by Gantz, a former head of the army under Netanyahu, Blue and White's polling numbers surged, and the election quickly became a two-horse race. Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz addresses his supporters after Israeli general elections polls closed. Netanyahu -- known to supporters and detractors alike as ""Bibi"" -- focused on burnishing his status as a global player with close ties to both the President of the United States and the President of Russia. In a visit to Washington made by Netanyahu during the campaign, Donald Trump signed a proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, in defiance of the overwhelming international consensus. And in the election's closing days, on a visit to Moscow, Netanyahu was able to personally thank Vladimir Putin for Russia's key role in locating the body of an Israeli soldier who had been missing in Lebanon for nearly 37 years. With his victory all but certain, attention will now turn to the corruption case. The Supreme Court will rule on whether Netanyahu can continue in office if he is charged. For his part, Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing."

The miniscule insects, known as sweat bees, are 3 to 4 millimeters (0.12-0.16 inches) in length, according to CNN affiliate CTS. ""I saw something that looked like insect legs, so I pulled them out under a microscope slowly, and one at a time without damaging things inside,"" Hung Chi-ting, the head of the ophthalmology department at Taiwan's Fooyin University Hospital, told reporters at a news conference. Sweat bees, also known as halictidae, ""nest near graves and in fallen trees, so it's easy to come across them while hiking in mountains,"" Hung explained.

First, the man can still ball. Second, his life outside of basketball may one day eclipse his legacy on the court.
Follow @cnnsport The defining player of the Miami Heat's 32-year history, Wade has enjoyed a throwback year, putting up vintage performances capped by a remarkable buzzer-beater to beat Golden State on February 27. That pandemonium-inducing one-legged bank shot had him leaping onto the scorer's table and pounding his chest to the crowd, turning Miami-Dade County into ""Wade County"" yet again.

— NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 28, 2019 Wade's lasting impact on the NBA will be as a Finals MVP in 2006, a scoring champion in 2009, and most notably, the selfless enabler of the Big Three that brought LeBron James and Chris Bosh to Miami in 2010 -- igniting a super friends trend that ushered Kevin Durant to Golden State. Read More Wade's broader mark, however, will arguably be left as a social activist who, along with James, reawakened the political power of the pro athlete back in 2012. Four years before Colin Kaepernick took a knee in the NFL, the entire Miami Heat squad pulled their hoodies up in support of slain Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. The 17-year-old Heat fan was wearing a hoodie on his way home to watch the NBA All-Star Game when he was shot by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman . Wade -- whose then-girlfriend, now-wife Gabrielle Union alerted him to the case -- was the first to react, posting a photo of himself in a hoodie, before discussing the issue with James and rallying the team for a group snap. #WeAreTrayvonMartin #Hoodies #Stereotyped #WeWantJustice http://t.co/tH6baAVo
— LeBron James (@KingJames) March 23, 2012 ""We were fathers in a state where it happened, and we were taking a stand on what we believed,"" Wade tells CNN Sport. ""They needed more eyes brought to it. We definitely understood that."" Wade recognizes that the movement known as ""Hoodies Up"" created a ripple effect that continues to gain traction seven years later. ""It has allowed others to be comfortable to speak out,"" he says, though he did not envision it at the time. ""I don't think I was aware of how much it was going to change [social awareness in sports], but we were definitely aware of the platform we had to shed light on something that wasn't getting enough attention."" The Heat's stance on the Martin case was taken up by several other NBA stars before President Barack Obama spoke with empathy on the matter. Wade knows his job is hardly over, however. The 37-year-old will be the first of this select crop of superstar social activists to transition to retired athlete spokesperson. (That is, if you don't count Kaepernick as retired.) ""I think it changes,"" says Wade. ""The eyes that I have on me as an active athlete will be a lot different, but my voice doesn't change. Obviously, I'm one person. I can't change the world, but I can help affect change in communities. That's what I want to continue to do."" Visit cnn.com/sport for more news and videos 'One Last Dance' Wade's respect across the league has been felt during stopovers on his ""One Last Dance"" tour, as he has christened this season. Last month in San Antonio, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich -- who faced Wade in two NBA Finals -- called him an ""iconic figure"" and ""a guy that cared about more than just basketball."" ""He had a ferocious attitude on the court, but it was matched with a wonderful smile and a great understanding of the world and community off the court,"" the coach said as the team honored Wade before the game. ""I think that's what made him so special."" Part of what inspires Wade to give back to his community is his upbringing in Chicago's notoriously rough South Side. Wade's mother Jolinda has been public about her past drug addiction and imprisonment that led to Wade being raised by his stern father at a young age. ""The only way my family was able to have clothes was because someone else gave (what they) weren't wearing. The only way to eat at times, (was) because the church had trucks. Someone gave food; someone had the heart to give to the community,"" he says. ""The only reason I'm sitting here is because people reached a hand back and helped me out, and I want to continue to do the same thing."" Dwyane Wade and his actress wife Gabrielle Union are known for their roles in charitable causes and interests in fashion. 'A heck of a journey' Among its several causes, the Wade Family Foundation puts on an annual ""RunWade"" charity event where its patron engages in another off-court passion, bespoke clothing. In a league crowded with tall men taking sartorial risks, Wade has long been known as a fashion pioneer. He currently sports his own line of socks, as well as a range of accessories on his Amazon online store. Wade remains a brand ambassador to Hublot watches and, most notably, has a lifetime deal with Chinese athletic brand Li-Ning.

Wade says he gets the ""same cool feeling"" when he sees someone wearing his sock collection as he does hitting one of his patented spinning layups in the lane. ""I didn't go to school for fashion, I had to learn fabric and be involved, so it definitely feels good,"" he says. Wade has also been getting up to speed with fine wines. Considering he sipped his first glass at 27, he had some catching up to do for his partnership in D Wade Cellars. Based in Napa Valley, California, the 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon retails for a cool $215. ""I started to like the conversation of what wine was about. I started liking the room that I was in when people drank wine, and I started to like the way I felt after walking away from drinking wine. It was a little different from drinking other things,"" Wade explains. ""It's a fun passion project. If my work is drinking wine, I have an amazing life."" Part of that life after basketball will be focusing on his four children. That includes guiding 17-year-old Zaire through his college basketball recruiting process, and doting on five-month-old daughter Kaavia, his first child with Union. Kaavia, who was born via surrogate, has nearly 600,000 Instagram followers . ""Her mom gets all the credit for her thought (captions),"" Wade laughs. In Miami on Tuesday, Wade's career was celebrated throughout his final home game, where he scored 30 in a win over Philadelphia. Video tributes poured in, including one from Obama. ""You did us proud,"" he said. With so much going on in his life, what will the 13-time All-Star do once the buzzer sounds in Brooklyn after the Heat play the Nets for his final game? ""Exhale. I am going to look around and take it all in, because it's been a heck of a journey,"" he says. ""I want to be respected for what I brought to the game.

Missing Americans in the Dominican Republice: Friend wishes she could have held her hand before she died - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Madeline Holcombe,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/missing-americans-dominican-republic-friend/index.html,"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) A man and woman missing for two weeks likely died after a car accident in the Dominican Republic, authorities said. Although their bodies were found within days of the wreck, family and friends are only now learning what happened to them.
The National Police believe the car Orlando Moore and Portia Ravenelle were in plunged into the ocean in the early hours of March 27, not long after the pair left for the airport to catch a flight home to New York. A body fitting the description of Moore was found at sea in an advanced stage of decomposition, police said. A woman later identified as Ravenelle was found on the airport road on the day of the wreck but died in an ICU eight days later, they said, without explaining how or why she might have ended up on the road. ""She had to die by herself,"" family friend Francesca Figueroa told CNN. ""When one of us could have been there holding her hand."" Friends with Moore for about 25 years, Figueroa said she thinks of him as family. Both Moore and Ravenelle, friends who worked together, spent the night before their trip to the Dominican Republic at Figueroa's having dinner and watching a movie.

Missing New York couple's bodies may have been found days ago, Dominican Republic officials say They were due back in New York on March 27 at 5:45 a.m., Figueroa said. When they didn't return, Figueroa said her family started looking for them. Figueroa said she spoke to a US Embassy representative on March 31 who told her ""no bodies were found, there were no dead bodies reported, no accidents, no one was in jail."" She said she was relieved. Perhaps they were just lost. But on Tuesday, she learned that her friends likely were in a car accident on the way to the airport to go back home. ""I am saddened it took this many days to find out,"" Figueroa said. She was in intensive care for eight days National Police Col. Frank Félix Durán Mejia said Tuesday that an unconscious woman was found on the road to the international airport in Santo Domingo on March 27 and taken to a hospital. Fingerprints were used to identified the woman as Ravenelle, Durán Mejia said. Hospital spokesman Dario Mañon said she arrived with severe trauma and contusions to the head. It was about 12 hours after the pair's missed flight had left for New York. He said Ravenelle died on April 4, before she was in a condition in which hospital officials could take her photo and share it with the media. Authorities asked Tuesday for a photo taken while she was in intensive care, he said. Mañon told CNN that no one from her family or friends had called the hospital looking for her. Authorities are working to confirm an identity Portia Ravenelle, left, went sightseeing with Canadians Carter Warrington, center, and Cheryl Freeman, right. Airport surveillance cameras show that the two never made it inside the airport building on the morning of their flight. Authorities said there was no evidence of foul play. Fishermen reported seeing a vehicle at the bottom of the sea, but because of rough conditions, divers have not been able to identify the vehicle, Durán Mejia said. On March 31, the body of a man fitting the description of Moore was found at sea near Sans Souci, Durán Mejia said. The body had a tattoo that read ""Milan"" on its right arm, police said. Figueroa confirmed to the police on Tuesday that Moore has a tattoo with his daughter's name, ""Milan,"" on his arm. Autopsies of both bodies are underway, with results expected next week, Durán Mejia said. ""Everybody is devastated. Everybody is devastated,"" Figueroa said. ""His daughter is devastated, everybody is devastated, as I am, as my husband, as the mayor, as everybody in this town is because he's well known in this town. You go on the corner, and everybody knows Orlando."" They planned to drive at night for early morning flight Cheryl Freeman and Portia Ravenelle in Samama, Dominican Republic. Cheryl Freeman and her boyfriend said that they spent time with Moore and Ravenelle while on vacation in the resort town of Samana. Freeman said Moore and Ravenelle had a 2 a.m. flight and were driving a rental car to the airport. Ravenelle expressed anxiety about driving at night and said the rental company warned them to not stop and open their windows for anyone because the locals know which cars are rentals and try to mug tourists, Freeman said. How a missing couple from New York spent their last day in the Dominican Republic Ravenelle repeatedly asked Moore if he was sure they had enough gas to make it to the airport. She kept checking to make sure their phones were charged enough to use the GPS, Freeman said. After the pair left, Freeman's boyfriend sent Moore an email wishing them a safe flight. He never heard back from him. Freeman said she did not realize the two had gone missing until she returned home to Halifax, Nova Scotia, on March 31 and discovered several emails from Ravenelle's family. Traffic police investigators are conducting a review of the area of the supposed wreck site, Durán Mejia said. No police report was filed with respect to the location and there is no indication the pair's vehicle hit another vehicle there, he said. There is no word yet on the transportation of the pair's remains to the United States, Durán Mejia said, noting paperwork must be completed."

During Tuesday afternoon's Senate Republican lunch, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell advised senators concerned about Trump's selection of former presidential candidate and pizza executive Herman Cain and conservative economic commentator Stephen Moore to share their views with the White House now, before Trump officially moves forward with the nominations, a source familiar with the remarks told CNN. Why politicizing the Federal Reserve could have dangerous consequences GOP senators are worried about various controversies swirling around the two men -- particularly Cain, who faced sexual harassment allegations that effectively ended his 2012 presidential campaign -- but also that Trump's nominees could weaken the independence of the Fed, the world's most powerful central bank. Aiming to avoid a public fight over the confirmation, some Republicans hope to persuade Trump to reconsider ahead of Cain's official nomination. It's unclear how effective the strategy will be at convincing the President, who has been outwardly enthusiastic about the picks, though top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett earlier this week told reporters the nominations are still being vetted and are not done deals. Read More Trump said Wednesday morning that Cain ""will make that determination"" about whether to formally enter the confirmation process. ""Well, I like Herman Cain, and Herman will make that determination. Herman is a wonderful man, he's been a supporter of mine for a long time. He actually ran a very good campaign and that's up to Herman,"" the President told reporters outside the White House. Trump continued, ""Herman is, you know, he's already sat on one of the Fed Boards. And he's just somebody I like a lot, as to how he's doing in the process, that I don't know. You go through the process, but Herman's a great guy and I hope he does well."" Publicly, McConnell and other Republicans are projecting neutrality. ""Well, we are going to look at whoever the President sends up,"" McConnell said in a news conference Tuesday after the lunch. ""It's his choice to decide, and once he makes a nomination, we'll take a look at it."" In hallway interviews with nearly 20 Republican senators on Tuesday, most were reluctant to candidly discuss Cain's potential nomination. Many said they hadn't heard the days-old news that Trump was planning to select him. Others opted to withhold comment, while some expressed vague reservations. A few rejected the prospect outright. ""No,"" Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado quickly responded when asked if he would support Cain. ""It's not about his past. It's about who I think should be on the board,"" the senator explained. ""So that's that."" Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah has been openly critical of the idea as well. ""I don't think Herman Cain will be on the board of the Federal Reserve,"" the freshman senator told reporters Tuesday. ""It's important that the board be comprised of people who are academics, economists, and not people who are highly partisan."" Sen. Pat Roberts, like the majority of his colleagues, was slightly more diplomatic. ""When you first meet Herman Cain, he's very impressive,"" the Kansas Republican said. ""But whether he's qualified to be on the Fed, I just don't know."" Republicans are wary of Cain, a former CEO of Godfather's Pizza who served as chair of the Kansas City Fed, for a variety of reasons. Four women have said Cain harassed them during the 1990s, when he led the National Restaurant Association. Cain denied the allegations, most recently in a video posted last weekend. ""It's all just sort of a vague memory right now, but it's hard not to hear 'Herman Cain' in the context of something like this and not immediately recall some of those challenges,"" Sen. Kevin Cramer said of the harassment allegations. The North Dakota Republican told reporters those allegations would factor into his decisions as a member of the Senate committee that evaluates Fed nominees. Opponents also take issue with Cain's founding role in the pro-Trump political action group America Fighting Back. But several GOP senators on Tuesday pushed back on critics, saying Cain was qualified for the job. ""He has an impressive background in business and understands the importance that our economy plays in everyday lives,"" Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina told CNN. Scott shrugged off the idea that Cain is an unconventional choice: ""This has been an unconventional presidency, so that's not unusual."" Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa told reporters Tuesday that he wouldn't make up his mind until after a confirmation hearing, but he didn't have ""any reason not to"" support Cain. Republicans are in a slightly better position to confirm contentious appointees than they were before the 2018 midterm elections, with their new majority of 53, but they can still afford to lose only a few votes before any nomination would be doomed. That concern prompted Sen. John Cornyn of Texas on Tuesday to warn the White House to consult in advance with Senate leaders on nominations like these. Trump's endorsement of Cain came just weeks after the President announced he would nominate Moore, best known as a Wall Street Journal commentator, to the seven-member board. (Moore was also a CNN contributor.) The selection drew fire from Democrats, who said Moore was too partisan and was unqualified for the job. The two nominees' backgrounds in conservative politics have stoked fears about politicizing the Fed, even among Trump's GOP allies in Congress, after months of the President publicly railing against Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman he appointed, and the board's decision to raise interest rates late last year. Trump breaks precedent again with latest Fed pick ""I am concerned about that,"" Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said on Tuesday. ""The worst thing you can do in terms of your economy is to politicize or give the appearance that you're politicizing your central bank."" Moore has long run in Republican circles. He helped start the conservative Club for Growth and is a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation. He has recently been a vocal critic of the Fed leadership, siding with Trump on keeping interest rates low. And he has already garnered support among a number of leading GOP senators, who say they believe he will win enough votes -- something they won't say about Cain. ""Well, I know him better and I expect he'll be confirmed,"" Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, said of Moore, after sidestepping questions about Cain. Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby echoed that sentiment, praising Moore. ""Stephen Moore, I know well. I've worked with him. He does have a lot of experience in the area,"" said Shelby, an Alabama Republican. As for Cain's chances, he added, ""That will be a more interesting nomination."""
It's deadline day for Trump's tax returns - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Lauren Fox,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/trump-tax-returns-house-deadline/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin informed Congress early Wednesday evening that his department would be unable to comply with House Democrats' deadline for President Donald Trump's tax returns, inserting himself into what is sure to be a pitched battle for the closely held documents.
In a letter Wednesday to House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, Mnuchin said that ""the Treasury Department will not be able to complete its review"" by Wednesday's deadline Democrats had given Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Charles Rettig to turn over six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns. Highlighting what he called the ""unprecedented nature of this request,"" Mnuchin said that he would be overseeing the Treasury's handling of the request and that the Department of Justice was being consulted ""to ensure that our response is fully consistent with the law and Constitution."" Mnuchin's decision to involve himself and the Justice Department in processing the returns suggests that he does not feel compelled to stick to a deadline, making for a prolonged and politicized process. Congressional Democrats believe the law clearly allows them to ask for the information in this way, with Rettig acknowledging in a hearing earlier Wednesday that requests are typically handled by the IRS commissioner. Mnuchin stressed in the letter that his and the Justice Department's involvement was to protect all American taxpayers from the potential implications of the request. Read More ""The Committee's request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional scope of Congressional investigative authority, the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose, and the constitutional rights of American citizens,"" he wrote. ""The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power."" Neal said Wednesday that he would discuss the proper response with counsel since the Treasury Department ""has decided not to allow the IRS to comply with my request by the April 10 deadline."" The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, on Wednesday called Mnuchin's involvement ""a sign of political interference,"" adding that ""if Secretary Mnuchin does not provide the president's tax returns, he will break the law."" Mnuchin's letter follows the directive in a letter from Trump's attorney William Consovoy asking the Treasury Department to ""refrain from divulging the requested information until it receives a formal legal opinion from"" the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. Democrats anticipate lengthy battle A week after Neal made his formal request for Trump's tax information , including information on eight of the President's business entities, Democrats are fully anticipating a drawn-out political and legal showdown as the administration digs in and Democrats prepare to go to court. ""They want to rig this thing. They've already started to do that,"" Rep. Bill Pascrell, a Democrat from New Jersey, told CNN. ""Their excuses for not giving them up are the most hypocritical I have ever heard of any subject in the Congress, and I've been here 22 years. ... They're trying to rig it? Good. We're ready for you."" Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee huddled Tuesday afternoon to discuss potential next moves and to talk about other issues before their committee. Neal said Tuesday that he plans to send a follow-up request for the information in writing before taking more drastic steps. There are still questions about whether the committee would issue a subpoena on top of the request or if the request would be grounds enough to trigger a fight in court if the IRS didn't comply. Mnuchin defends consultation between White House and Treasury on Trump tax returns Earlier Wednesday, Mnuchin said he was consulting with the Justice Department on Neal's request. ""We need to make sure that the IRS and the individual taxpayer info does not become subject to political wills,"" said Mnuchin on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund. ""I take the obligation very seriously to make sure we follow the law correctly."" When asked by CNN if he had spoken Rettig in recent days, Mnuchin said, ""I speak to the IRS commissioner regularly. It's my job to supervise the IRS. I'm not going to comment on specific conversations that we've had together."" Democrats are relying on a 1920s-era law that has never been challenged in court before. The IRS statute, known as 6103, says three people on Capitol Hill -- the Senate Finance Committee chairman, the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the chairman of House Ways and Means Committee -- can ask for any individual's tax information for legislative purposes and the secretary of the treasury ""shall furnish"" the request. It's a provision that's been employed before and is typically used for research purposes by the Joint Committee on Taxation. But asking for the president's tax returns is uncharted territory, a fact that the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee was cognizant of as he was waiting to make the request. ""We wanted to make sure that the case we constructed was one that stood up under the critical scrutiny of the courts,"" Neal told CNN last week. Allies of the President have argued that the Democrats have no right to see his returns. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that Democrats would never see them and the American public had already settled the politics of it when they elected Trump. ""They knew they were not going to get these taxes,"" Mulvaney said of Democrats. ""That is not going to happen, and they know it. This is a political stunt by my former colleagues."" During a tense exchange before the Financial Services Committee on Tuesday afternoon, Mnuchin wouldn't commit to what precisely the Treasury Department would do next. Asked if he would comply, Mnuchin said he would ""comply with the law"" but stopped short of saying he would commit to handing over the returns. Democratic Rep. Nydia Velázquez of New York shot back, ""And the law says -- upon a written request from the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the chairman of the Committee on Finance of the Senate or the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the secretary shall furnish. So that's the law. "" Mnuchin responded, ""Again, I just want to be very clear. ... I have said that I will comply with the law. I have not made a comment one way or another whether we would supply the tax returns. I want to be very clear on that. We have said we will comply with the law."" No matter what comes next, Democrats say they are ready for the fight. ""Let 'em try it,"" Pascrell said. ""We're ready. We're ready. I am smacking my lips on this one, and America should be also."" This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday."

1. Politics Top Trump administration officials faced off against agitated House Democrats on Capitol Hill. It didn't go well at all : • Democrats on the House Judiciary committee were livid at Attorney General William Barr after he said he'd release a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report within a week. Chairman Jerry Nadler promised a subpoena demanding more. The Dems also didn't like that Barr wouldn't say whether the White House had been briefed on the Mueller report. • Over at the House Financial Services Committee hearing, Democrats blasted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin after he said his agency's lawyers talked to the White House about releasing President Trump's tax returns. Mnuchin said that's not interference because the lawyers weren't being directed by Team Trump. US Rep. Maxine Waters and others were very skeptical of that claim. Read More Meanwhile, at a House Judiciary hearing on hate crimes and white nationalism on social media, all hell broke loose. YouTube had to disable the comments on the livestream of the hearing because they were filled with anti-Semitic and racist remarks. And Democratic US Rep.

Right now, the contest is too close to call, with Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party neck and neck with Gantz's centrist Blue and White party, with 90% of the vote in. But Netanyahu, seeking a record fifth term, has an advantage. To form a governing coalition in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, a candidate needs at least 61 seats. It looks like Netanyahu's political bloc, made up of right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties, will have 65 seats. Gantz's bloc of center-left parties will only have 55 seats. Israel's President will decide who gets to form the next government, and that decision will probably come next week. JUST WATCHED Breaking down the voting in Israel's election Replay More Videos ...

May to face Parliament's questions over Brexit,edition.cnn.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/uk/live-news/brexit-delay-eu-summit-gbr-intl/index.html,"What we're covering here: What we're covering here: What's happening with Brexit?: European leaders have agreed to an extension to the Brexit process until Halloween, after debating into the night in Brussels to decide on Theresa May's request . What did May want? The British PM asked for Brexit day to be pushed back to June 30, but the decision lay with the EU. Opposition from France: Emmanuel Macron played hardball by pushing for a short postponement, while other leaders were keen for a lengthy delay. Expand less than 1 min ago Anticipation builds ahead of May news conference From CNN's James Frater in Brussels CNN
Photographers and journalists are anxiously waiting outside the UK's briefing room, where Theresa May is expected to speak shortly.
May has arrived back at the EU Council to meet with Donald Tusk and give her agreement to the October 31 delay to the Brexit process.
Cameras are being neatly lined up in order to grab a good spot for her news conference. 3 min ago Halloween Brexit delay sensible, says Malta PM
Malta's Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat , has said on Twitter that a October 31 extension is ""sensible,"" and will allow Britain to ""finally choose its way."" 4 min ago BREAKING: EU leaders agree to delay Brexit until October 31
EU leaders have agreed to grant the UK an extension to Brexit until 31 October, with a review in June, an EU diplomat has told CNN.
It means Britain will not crash out of the EU without a deal on Friday, as it had previously been on course to do.
The six-month delay makes it almost inevitable that the UK will have to hold European elections in May, unless Prime Minister Theresa May can force a deal through Parliament before then.
May had asked for a far shorter extension, until June 30. The lengthy postponement demonstrates a lack of faith within Europe that she can forge a consensus behind her Withdrawal Agreement in that time -- but could give hardliners within her own party enough time to attempt to force her out of her post.
French President Emmanuel Macron had been the major opponent to granting Britain a long extension, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel and many other leaders are understood to have favored the approach. 26 min ago BREAKING: Brexit extension agreed, Tusk tweets
EU Council President Donald Tusk has confirmed that European leaders have agreed to an extension -- without providing details. He will now meet with Theresa May to put the plan to her. 28 min ago BREAKING: Theresa May called back to summit
British Prime Minister Theresa May has arrived back at the European Council summit.
It was expected she would be summoned back when an extension had been agreed by EU leaders.
May will be presented with the details and have to agree to the plan before it is confirmed. 1 hr ago What's Theresa May doing?
While the 27 remaining EU leaders debate the fate of her flagship policy, Theresa May is keeping herself occupied.
May left the room hours earlier after making her pitch for a Brexit extension until June 30.
Since then, she has been nearby the European Council with her team, waiting to here what her counterparts decide.
It's possible she could be called back on short notice at any moment -- if the leaders are nearing a consensus. 1 hr 26 min ago What Thursday's papers are saying
For the second time in a matter of weeks, EU leaders are talking Brexit late into the night -- and showing scant regard for the print deadlines of British newspapers.
That means the first editions of Thursday's papers are filling in the blanks -- and a few are getting creative in doing so.
The Metro, a free newspaper read by commuters, has found a way to tie in one of the day's other big stories -- the first ever picture of a black hole -- with the ongoing Brexit chaos. As it happens, the news conference unveiling the groundbreaking image was also in Brussels, across town from where EU leaders are debating a Brexit extension.
Several papers lead on speculation swirling around Westminster. The Guardian -- also enamored with the historic image from space -- reports that Theresa May will attempt to hold onto power for another year. The i newspaper has the same story, as does The Times.
Any such plan will infuriate many hardline Brexiteers in May's own party -- and the Telegraph reports that she will be given a month before Conservative MPs make a move and attempt to oust her. 1 hr 47 min ago Macron tells leaders he isn't convinced by May's request, EU diplomat says From CNN’s Erin McLaughlin in Brussels KENZO TRIBOUILLARD/AFP/Getty Images
Emmanuel Macron has told European leaders he isn't yet convinced that Britain should be granted a long extension to Brexit, an EU diplomat has told CNN.
The French President, still locked in talks with other EU leaders, said he has “heard nothing yet that has convinced (him) that it might be useful to go beyond June 30,"" the date requested by the British Prime Minister but widely dismissed by many leaders as too short a period.
The diplomat said the discussions are still in the ""first phase,"" so a date for a delay has not yet been agreed and talks are ""ongoing.""
""There’s no date in the conclusion document yet. So they’re still explaining their initial position. He’s saying June 30 now, but doesn’t mean it will be his last position. It’s just where he’s coming from,"" the diplomat said. 1 hr 49 min ago What happens if Macron says non? Analysis from CNN's Luke McGee in Brussels
It's after 11 p.m. in Brussels and as the summit continues, talk has turned to a hypothetical question: what happens if French President Emmanuel Macron doesn't play ball and crashes the talks?
Disclaimer: we have received no intel to suggest that this could happen. Further disclaimer: the situations below are both entirely hypothetical and, in some instances, unprecedented. That said, let's get into it.
If Macron does decide to give the UK a firm ""non"" to any kind of extension, then Brexit day is on April 12, which the eagle-eyed among you will note is Friday. This leaves the UK with (as far as we can work out) three options. Let's go through them in order of complexity.
No-deal Brexit: In this scenario, the clock simply runs down and the UK leaves the EU on Friday without an agreement in place. The UK will immediately be outside of single market, customs union and all the other fun EU bodies you've come to know and love over the past three years. With the least popular outcome in the House of Commons suddenly a reality, political turmoil would ensue.
May's deal's last stand: In a mad rush to avoid a no deal, Theresa May could try to reach a compromise with the Labour Party – perhaps confirmatory votes on the future relationship to get the deal approved by Friday. This would start the implementation period and the cliff edge would be avoided. With relative calm and order restored, political chaos would ensue.
Revoke article 50: This is the complicated one. The UK, as we have known since December, can unilaterally withdraw Article 50, thus ending the Brexit process for good and remaining a member state of the European Union.
But it's not that simple. The European Court of Justice said in its ruling that, while the UK can indeed revoke Article 50 unilaterally, it would have to do so in ""accordance with its constitutional requirements."" In the opinion of the ECJ's advocate general, the UK set a precedent of requiring parliamentary approval for Article 50. Therefore, it is is logical ""that the revocation of that notification also requires parliamentary approval.""
Ramming an act of parliament – or a bill – through in two days is tricky. The government could either table a bill, which requires debate and for the proposed bill to be scrutinized by parliament via a drawn out legislative process.
This can takes days, weeks or months, though as the so-called Cooper Bill to avoid no-deal Brexit proved last week, they can be forced through in a couple of days.
An easier option could be for the government to place something called a statutory instrument before the Commons. A statutory instrument is a statement of law and is generally considered to be secondary to bill. This option would be quicker, but whether it passes the ECJ test or not is a different question: the decision to trigger Article 50 was passed as a bill.
Getting all of this passed in under 48 hours would be hugely controversial and, yes, political chaos would ensue.
A final point, during the Brexit process, parliament has shown us that if it wants to do something, it usually finds a way (H/T for this observation goes to the Financial Times's political editor, George Parker ).
Given that all of this is unprecedented, a bit of a mess, unlikely to happen and it's fast-approaching midnight here in Brussels, there is every chance I have got something wrong. Please feel free to correct me on Twitter, @lukemcgee. Search"
Brexit will be decided over a dinner table in Brussels - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Luke McGee,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/uk/brexit-brussels-luke-mcgee-uk-intl-gbr/index.html,"Brussels (CNN) The sheer weirdness of Brexit might be best described by the odd spectacle that will take place in Brussels on Wednesday evening.
The UK is the world's fifth largest economy. It is a nuclear-armed state with a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. It has a world-class services industry and a population of more than 60 million people. Malta, by contrast, is the world's 124th largest economy. It has, according to Eurostat, a population of under 500,000 people. Theresa May seeks Brexit delay from Merkel and Macron Yet at around 6:45 p.m. local time, Joseph Muscat, the Prime Minister of Malta, will have a greater say in the ultimate outcome of the UK's future than Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Because, Muscat, unlike May, will have a seat at the dinner table along with other EU leaders where the future of Brexit will be thrashed out. The UK's inability to agree on a political level how it wishes to leave the EU has caused the Brexit deadline, March 29, to be missed once already. The fact that the House of Commons rejected May's Brexit deal a third time on that very day has led to the unedifying events that will follow in Brussels a little later. Read More Late last week, May wrote to Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council, requesting an extension to Article 50, the process by which the UK leaves the EU. May asked that Brexit be delayed till June 30, allowing the UK just a little more time to get its house in order. It's unlikely June 30 will be agreed to be the other EU leaders. The problem Brexit faces now is that there's no road left to kick the can down -- or at least, not without consequences. The new Brexit deadline, April 12, was decided upon because it is the latest point at which the UK must declare its intention to stand in European Parliamentary elections or not. If the UK is still an EU member state on May 23, then it must field candidates in that poll. JUST WATCHED What happens if there's a no-deal Brexit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
What happens if there's a no-deal Brexit 01:12 By asking for an extension until June 30, May appears to have all but accepted this fate. She even admitted as much in her letter to Tusk. While this might seem a matter of huge embarrassment for May, it is a matter of even greater concern for the EU. In the days since May's letter to Tusk became public, hardline Brexiteers have said that, should the UK remain stuck in the union at this point, then it will ""become a Trojan horse within the EU."" This isn't just tough talk from sore losers: as a full member state with MEPs sitting in Brussels and Strasbourg, the UK will have full member state rights. It will be able to have input in EU projects -- and crucially budgets -- with little blowback. This is where we come back to June 30. May has selected this date as it comes one day before the newly elected EU Parliament will sit for the first time. This means that, even in the event of the UK taking part in these elections, should her deal be approved in time, Brexit will happen exactly as she wants. Lengthy Brexit delay on the cards? Theresa May heads to EU summit But what May wants and May gets have to date been very different things. At the moment, the thinking in Brussels is that the extension will be granted, but it will be much longer than June 30. It cannot be stated often enough how little the EU wants to be held responsible for pushing the UK towards a no-deal Brexit. However, other EU leaders are less satisfied with this. Emmanuel Macron, the French President, has been visibly frustrated by the oxygen Brexit is sucking out of European politics. While no one expects him to push for a no deal, it is no secret that in his eyes -- and not his alone -- there are worse outcomes than a no deal. One of those outcomes might be a Trojan-horse UK. This summit was called on March 29, as the first Brexit deadline disappeared. On Friday, it's possible another will disappear. The UK's future is being decided miles from London. It must be horrible to be a Brexiteer right now. "

That was on Monday, when Representative Devin Nunes filed a $150 million lawsuit against the McClatchy newspaper chain. He claimed a story in his district's newspaper, The Fresno Bee, defamed him. Nunes gave the scoop about the suit to Fox News, which led its home page with the story , treating the suit like something really serious. Sean Hannity brought Nunes on and celebrated the suit. You could almost hear Hannity's viewers at home at home saying, ""Yeah, sue the fake news!"" The reality is... very different. Nunes is getting ridiculed for his legal filings, first against Twitter, now against McClatchy. And the newspaper publisher isn't mincing words. McClatchy CEO Craig Forman sent a memo to the entire company on Tuesday reassuring staffers that ""we will vigorously defend The Fresno Bee.""

Hopefully, he will provide such answers during the litigation."" The company also said Nunes filed suit in Virginia, but California is the more appropriate venue. Here's the full statement .

9/11: Gay rugby hero whose legacy challenges homophobia,edition.cnn.com,Eoghan Macguire,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/sport/mark-bingham-international-gay-rugby-spt-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Alice Hoagland recalls the last time she spoke with her son, Mark Bingham. It was September 11, 2001, and Bingham was on board the hijacked United Flight 93.
""He just called and said 'Mom, I want to tell you that I love you. I'm on a flight from Newark to San Francisco.' ""'Three guys have taken over the plane and they say they have a bomb.'"" The hijackers, of which it later transpired there were four, were part of the al-Qaeda terror cell that crashed commercial jets into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington DC, killing 2,937 people. Flight 93, however, never reached its intended target, thought to be a major political target in Washington such as the Capitol. Passengers heroically battled with the hijackers before the plane crashed in a field near the town of Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

An item in memory of Mark Bingham at The Wall of Names at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pa. Yet out of the carnage and devastation, has come a form of healing for Hoagland and the flourishing of a sporting community close to Bingham for much of his life. The Bingham Cup Mention the Bingham Cup to members of the Atlanta Bucks rugby team and all will know what the tournament represents as well as the story of the man it's named after. Jeffrey Thorpe, who has played the rough and tumble sport with the Bucks for the past two years, tells CNN Bingham is someone who is ""really respected"" among his friends and teammates. The Bucks are part of International Gay Rugby (IGR), a network for inclusive teams located all over the world. Founded roughly 15-years-ago, the Bucks are one of close to 30 American IGR teams. According to Gus Ventura, North American trustee for IGR, Bingham's inspirational story has had ""an enormous impact on the growth (of the) sport"" in the US and helped ""mitigate the homophobia"" gay athletes often encounter. Alice Hoagland at a congressional hearing in 2014. Bingham was introduced to the sport in high school and played college rugby at University California Berkeley. As a gay man, he went on to play for IGR club the San Francisco Fog and was instrumental in setting up New York's Gotham Knights, another gay and inclusive team. Bingham's death at the age of just 31 was mourned by the many close friends he made in the game, some of whom decided to set up a competition in his honor. The Bingham Cup began in 2002 under the banner of the IGR and has been held every other year since. What began with just a handful of gay and inclusive teams has expanded rapidly. Last year, 78 teams from 20 countries came to Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to play in the Bingham Cup, making it one of the largest 15-a-side rugby tournaments in the world.

It's something I never would have done if I hadn't been part of this."" Gay heroes Hoagland describes being ""really touched"" whenever she hears such stories. She recalls her son pointing out before 9/11 that there were ""not enough gay heroes"" and that gay people tended to be treated with derision and jest in media and entertainment. Yet it's a source of pride, Hoagland adds, that Bingham continues to inspire others to challenge those stereotypes. She recites the words of Senator John McCain, who attended Bingham's memorial service in 2001, and highlighted how the actions of the passengers aboard Flight 93 may even have saved the politician's own life in Washington DC..

""If you look back at his story and know that he was a rugger, know that he was gay and then hearing what he did on 9/11, I think the majority of people would be taken aback,"" Thorpe says. ""A lot of people think that because you are LGBT, you can't play something this aggressive. That's false. Everyone wants to join a team and (have) that camaraderie."" The Bingham Cup has enabled many people to do just that while bringing together gay and inclusive teams from around the world. Last year's edition saw women's teams compete for the first time while organizers hope the 2020 event in Ottawa, Canada, will be even bigger. Rugby team rallies against deportation of gay player to Kenya There are now IGR teams on five continents, an incredible feat given the first gay and inclusive rugby team was only founded in London, England, in 1995. For Hoagland, who has attended every staging of the competition, it's a fitting way to remember her only son. ""Mark would say rugby is my life,"" she says, while he also loved the camaraderie and togetherness the sport encourages. Perhaps more powerfully, however, the friends Hoagland has made in attending the Bingham Cup have helped her to cope with the loss of a man she describes as ""remarkable"" and her very own ""hero."" ""The way they remember and honor him has helped me profoundly to deal with my grief,"" she says.

"Barr returns to Capitol Hill, where he'll face more Mueller questions - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Jeremy Herb,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/william-barr-senate-hearing/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General William Barr said special counsel Robert Mueller did not ask him or Congress to come to a determination on whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice, but that he made a conclusion there wasn't a case to prosecute because ""that's generally how the Department of Justice works.""
Barr also told a Senate subcommittee that spying on the Trump campaign occurred and that he's undertaking a review of the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into members of the Trump campaign and Russia to determine whether there was ""unauthorized surveillance."" ""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,"" Barr said. ""I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred. I'm saying that I'm concerned about it and looking into it, that's all."" Barr was back on Capitol Hill Wednesday for a second day of testimony on the Justice Department budget, this time before a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, but once again special counsel Robert Mueller's report dominated the conversation. Democrats pressed Barr to explain his decision not to prosecute on obstruction of justice, after Mueller reached no conclusions but wrote that the investigation did not exonerate Trump, according to Barr's summary. Barr says spying on Trump campaign 'did occur,' but provides no evidence Barr wouldn't respond to the questions, saying he would be able to explain in more detail once Mueller's report was released. But he acknowledged he didn't know whether Mueller agreed with him. Read More ""I don't know whether Bob Mueller supported my conclusion,"" Barr said. ""I am not going to sit here and try to characterize his reasoning or his report, that's why it's important to get the whole report out instead of trying to read these little tea leaves."" Barr did say that Mueller did not ask him to make a conclusion, as part of his underlying argument that it was his role as attorney general to do so. ""Generally, grand juries are to investigate crimes and a prosecutor's role at the end of the day is binary,"" Barr said. ""Are there charges, or no charges? Or, is this a crime or not a crime?"" For several other questions, such as whether the White House was briefed on the Mueller investigation, Barr also stuck to his line that he would be able to offer more explanation once the report is out, which he said was likely next week. Still, his testimony did elicit some new hints about what he will put out from the Mueller report. Barr reviewing origins of FBI's Russia investigation, says 'spying on a political campaign is a big deal' Barr told the panel, for instance, that his decision to redact information about the ""personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties"" did not apply to Trump. ""No, I'm talking about people in private life, not public office,"" Barr said. Barr also suggested that the report would not be filled with pages of redactions. ""You will get more than the gist,"" he told the panel. At Tuesday's House hearing, Barr said he expected to release a redacted version of the Mueller report within a week, with plans to color-code redactions and provide an explanation for why material was not released publicly. But Barr sparred with House Democrats who pressed him on why he would not release grand jury material or provide the full, unredacted Mueller report to Congress. ""I don't intend at this stage to send the full, unredacted report to the committee,"" Barr said, adding that wouldn't ask a court to release grand jury material ""until someone shows me a provision"" that allows it to be released. Barr stuck to his argument Wednesday, saying the restriction on including grand jury material that Democrats are demanding is ""inflexible under the law."" In the House, Barr was squaring off with Democrats who have subpoena power and have already authorized a subpoena in the Judiciary Committee to obtain the full Mueller report and underlying evidence. Democratic lawmakers expressed frustration after the hearing that Barr wouldn't answer certain questions, such as whether the White House had been briefed about the Mueller report. Senate Democrats also argued to Barr that he could provide Congress with grand jury material, saying Barr was within his discretion to go to court to do so. ""I think attempts to hide swaths of the report from public scrutiny along the way will only fuel suspicions that have been raised by many that the Justice Department, which represents the United States, is playing the role of President Trump's defense team,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. ""Your imprint on the course of justice, the rule of law, in these moments, are going to be scrutinized long after both you and I are gone from public service. The only way out in my view is transparency."" Republicans, however, suggested that providing grand jury material confidentially to Congress could result in it being leaked. ""Can we agree there is a material risk that the grand jury information would leak?"" asked Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana. ""I think so,"" Barr responded. Barr's decision to review the beginning of the 2016 counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, which was reported after his testimony Tuesday, was a topic of interest to both Democrats and Republicans. Barr said he wanted to look at all of the investigations that have already probed the matter, including Congress and the Justice Department inspector general, and see if any areas need additional investigation. ""One of the things that I want to do is pull together all the information from the various investigations that have gone on, including on the Hill, and in the department, and see if there are any remaining questions to be addressed,"" Barr said. Barr later said he did not have evidence that wrongdoing occurred in the Justice Department or the FBI, but he did have questions and concerns about what happened. ""I have no specific evidence right now that I would cite. I do have questions about it,"" Barr said, adding there could be ""abuses that may not rise to the level of a crime."" This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday."
'Lionel Messi is God': Can Manchester United stop Barcelona's divine talent? - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Nick Friend, for CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/football/lionel-messi-barcelona-manchester-united-champions-league-spt-intl/index.html,"(CNN) ""Bring it on"" was the rallying cry from Chris Smalling as the Manchester United defender was confronted with the reality of facing Lionel Messi in Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal.
With Smalling likely to start at the heart of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's defense and Messi intent on performing the role immortalized by his unparalleled phenomenon, the pair will -- by the game's close -- be well-acquainted. To leave Messi unattended is, at best, unwise. Mikael Silvestre -- a Champions League winner during his time at Manchester United -- acknowledged that it is Messi's divine brilliance that stands in his former team's way on its path to an unlikely semifinal place. ""Barcelona -- except 'God' (Messi) -- is a team that you can stop over two games,"" Silvestre told CNN Sport last month. ""I think United can stop Barcelona and progress."" Given both the Catalan side's style of play and the central importance of Messi, Silvestre is well aware of the grit and good fortune necessary if his former club is to remain in the game for long enough to concern the five-time winners.

""They did it against Paris [in the previous round, where United overcame a 2-0 first-leg deficit to win on away goals]. They ended up playing with Mason Greenwood, Tahith Chong, James Garner -- the three youngsters -- in the Parc des Princes. ""It was an inspiring performance, with that mental ability to stay in the game and believe and to never ever give up. It is in the club's DNA -- that never-give-up attitude."" Messi, though remains the key. As a defender who racked up 249 appearances during the Alex Ferguson era, Silvestre has a warning for his former team.

""[Stopping him] has been done before,"" he points out. ""We know how to do it."" Indeed, Silvestre himself has managed it; he came on as a late substitute when United beat Barcelona by a single goal in the 2008 semifinal. More than a decade on, though, Messi's icon has more than stood the test of time. That the Argentine has not been crowned as the world's greatest player since claiming his fifth Ballon d'Or title in 2015 is, in many ways, a red herring. Mikael Silvestre was part of the Manchester United squad that won the 2007/08 Champions League, coming on as a substitute against Barcelona at Old Trafford in the second leg of the 1-0 semifinal aggregate win. READ: How a painting helped soccer great Buffon cope with depression Timeless supremacy His unique ability has never declined, and nor have his own numbers; 26 goals in the 2015/16 La Liga season have subsequently been followed by 37 and 34, with the Argentine great sat on 33 with seven games of the current season remaining -- a year dominated by his Barcelona side. In this year's Champions League, Messi's six appearances have brought with them eight goals and a further three assists. It is a run that has added to an already exceptional overall record in Europe's major club competition; 108 goals in 131 appearances give him a superior minutes per goal ratio to that of his great rival Cristiano Ronaldo, though the Argentine remains 16 strikes behind the Juventus forward's 124. The duo's long-running battle for footballing supremacy has seen them competing in a competition of their own. Former Real Madrid captain Raul Gonzalez is the pair's closest challenger -- but even his 71 goals place him 37 behind Messi. Of those still active, Karim Benzema is the next closest, but his Champions League tally of 60 is less than halfway to Ronaldo's astronomic figure.

Yet, for almost as long as the theory has existed, it is a label that Messi has confounded. There are, of course, occasional outliers. Messi's record against Chelsea, for example, sits at just three goals in 10 games. However, his history with Manchester United is different. Although it currently shows just two goals in four games, those strikes came in the 2009 and 2011 finals. His performance at Wembley in the latter of the two is remembered for its sheer majesty, as Barcelona cruised to a 3-1 victory. READ: Tottenham edge out Manchester City but lose Harry Kane to injury Some hope, perhaps, for the Old Trafford faithful comes in Messi's record on English soil. While hardly a goalscoring famine, Messi has netted eight times in 15 games in England, as opposed to 13 in 14 matches at the Camp Nou. Indeed, he is also without a goal in his last 11 Champions League quarterfinals. Whether that is an omen for Solskjaer's side -- good or bad -- remains to be seen."
Modi biopic banned during Indian election - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Manveena Suri, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/asia/modi-biopic-india-election-intl/index.html,"New Delhi (CNN) A Bollywood biopic of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been banned from release during the country's elections, amid claims it would serve as political propaganda.
The Election Commission of India announced on Wednesday that it was halting the release of the biopic until after the elections -- which kick off on April 11 and last about six weeks. The move comes days after the film's producers announced its release would be postponed, after it failed to get a censor's certificate in time. The film -- in which Modi is played by Indian actor Vivek Oberoi -- depicts various moments throughout the future prime minister's life, including selling tea on the railways as a child, a two-year spiritual stint in the Himalayas as a teen and leading the nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to a landslide victory at the polls in 2014. Narendra Modi biopic slammed as propaganda by opposition ahead of Indian election Last month , the main opposition Congress Party slammed the release of the movie, labeling it propaganda and suggesting its release would contravene the country's election laws.

Last year, Snap struggled with a controversial redesign of its Snapchat app, its first-ever declines in daily active users, an exodus of top executives , and heightened competition from rival Instagram. Things seem to be stabilizing this year. Snapchat has stopped losing users, and now analysts are hopeful its parent company Snap's prospects are improving, especially following its first-ever Partner Summit in Los Angeles last week, which featured new product and business announcements. ""We came away from Snap's first big partner summit feeling more upbeat than before on the cadence of innovation and the overall trajectory of the business in 2019,"" wrote Barclays analyst Ross Sandler in a recent investor note.

At its event last week, Snap ( SNAP ) announced several new features that it hopes will increase the time users spend on the Snapchat app. The company launched a new gaming platform featuring titles only available on Snapchat, more additions to its lineup of original shows , and a way to post Snapchat Stories to other platforms such as Tinder. Snap event debuted new strategies ... and a changed Evan Spiegel Snap also outlined new monetization and advertising opportunities , including six-second ads in games and ways for advertisers to target users outside of the Snapchat app for the first time. JMP's Josey said he is impressed with Snap's reach and continued innovations in augmented reality and direct messaging. At the event, the company said it now reaches 90% of 13 to 34-year-olds in the US. Analysts also believe Snap is ""growing up."" Following a visit to the company's new headquarters in Santa Monica, Jefferies analysts said in March they ""felt like [Snap] had grown up from a startup to a more mature company,"" according to CNBC . The firm also said it was ""generally impressed"" with the company's ""cohesion and positive steps on the road to recovery."" Snapchat is betting big on social gaming In its most recent quarter , Snap stopped losing daily active users after two straight quarters of losses. The company's revenue hit a record $390 million, up 36% from the same period a year ago and well ahead of what investors had expected. Snap's new, supposedly faster Android app is rolling out , which could help it attract more users. In the past, Android users complained the app often crashed and had lesser camera quality than iOS. Not everyone is as optimistic. Research firm eMarketer slashed its Snapchat user estimates on Wednesday, citing the app's unpopular redesign . The firm expects Snapchat to have 77.5 million monthly users in the US in 2019, which is down 2.8% from last year. (Snapchat only shares daily user statistics, not monthly). ""I don't think it's all lost for Snapchat,"" eMarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told CNN Business. ""It's difficult to tell right now in the beginning of the year, but all of these [announcements] are good signs to increase engagement within the app, and possibly even add new users if this Android app turns out well."" Snap's priority this year should be all about increasing engagement and adding users, according to Josey. ""Things are certainly better than they were six to nine months ago, or even three to six months ago,"" he said. ""Now it's a matter of, can you execute and keep the momentum going."""

The investigation took a crucial turn last week when Huffman and a dozen other parents and one coach agreed to plead guilty to mail fraud and other forms of bribery, highlighting the separate actions both women have taken since the scandal broke. Here are the different ways the actresses have dealt with the fallout: Felicity Huffman Read More What is she accused of? Huffman has agreed to plead guilty to paying $15,000 to a fake charity associated with Rick Singer to facilitate cheating for her daughter on the SATs. Singer ran a college prep business, and helped wealthy parents cheat on standardized tests for their children. He also bribed college coaches to designate children falsely as recruited athletes, smoothing their path to admission, a criminal complaint says. Felicity Huffman's Netflix film won't release in April as scheduled Huffman and Singer exchanged emails about how to get extra time on her daughter's SAT, the complaint says. They arranged for Huffman's daughter to take the SAT at a location controlled by an administrator bribed by Singer, the complaint says. The daughter got a score of 1420 out of a maximum 1600 on the SAT, about 400 points over her Preliminary SAT exam a year earlier. Does she plan to plead guilty? Yes. As a result, federal prosecutors said they will recommend incarceration at the ""low end"" of the sentencing range, a $20,000 fine and 12 months of supervised release, according to a plea agreement. Prosecutors recommended a range of sentences for those pleading guilty, from 12 to 18 months. A federal judge will have the final say on the outcome for Huffman and the other defendants. In addition to lower sentencing, prosecutors will not bring further charges, the plea agreement says. What has she said about the alleged scandal? She issued an apology and took responsibility for her actions, saying her daughter was not aware of the payment. She said she had betrayed her daughter and wouldn't make any excuses for breaking the law. ""I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done ... and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,"" she said in a statement. ""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly."" Felicity Huffman will plead guilty to paying $15,000 to facilitate cheating for her daughter on the SAT. How much prison time is she facing? It's unclear whether a guilty plea will mean no time in prison. Prosecutors plan to seek a sentence of four to 10 months' jail time, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. Huffman is due back in court on May 21 for a sentencing hearing. The actress and the other defendants are facing anywhere between six to 21 months in prison if convicted or if they plead guilty, but the exact sentence will depend on several factors, a law enforcement source told CNN. Has the fallout affected her acting career? A Netflix comedy film starring Huffman won't be hitting the streaming platform on April 26, its previously scheduled release date. ""Otherhood"" is about three mothers who move from the suburbs to New York so they can reconnect with their children. While it is not uncommon for film release dates to shift, news of the film's pushback came a day after the ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""American Crime"" actress entered her plea in the college admissions scam. Lori Loughlin What is she accused of? Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying $500,000 to a fake charity to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew recruits. Their daughters did not participate in the sport. Does she plan to plead guilty? Loughlin and her husband both pleaded not guilty to two conspiracy charges in the college admissions scandal, according to federal court filings. Loughlin and 15 other parents face a charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering in addition to last month's charge of conspiracy to commit fraud. They were charged last Tuesday in a superseding indictment with conspiring to launder bribes and other payments through Singer's charity, prosecutors said. The added charges came a day after Huffman and others agreed to plead guilty in the case. Loughlin's attorneys did not engage in substantial plea discussions, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation. It's not too late, however, for those negotiations to still take place, the source said. CNN has reached out to Loughlin's counsel for comment. Lori Loughlin and her husband are accused of paying $500,000 to get their daughters into USC. What has she said about the alleged scandal? Not much. Late last month, the actress was caught on video by paparazzi in Los Angeles and said she was sorry, but she couldn't talk about her legal issues. ""You can follow me around all day if you want, but I just can't comment right now,"" Loughlin said. ""But thank you for your time."" How much prison time is she facing? The charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud are punishable by a maximum 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. The charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering is punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, according to federal officials. Has the fallout affected her acting career? The ""Full House"" actress was dropped by the Hallmark Channel and other brands in the wake of last month's charges. Sephora also ended a makeup partnership with her daughter, the social media influencer Olivia Jade, who was a student at USC."
New Zealand's parliament votes 119-1 to change gun laws after Christchurch massacre,edition.cnn.com,"Sarah Faidell and Bex Wright, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/asia/new-zealand-gun-law-reform-intl/index.html,"(CNN) New Zealand's parliament has voted almost unanimously in favor of changing the country's gun laws, less than a month after a mass shooting left 50 people dead.
Members of parliament voted 119 to 1 in favor of the ban on military-style semi-automatic weapons Wednesday, as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told lawmakers they were giving ""a voice"" to those killed in the Christchurch massacre. Once the bill is granted royal assent by the country's governor-general, it could come into force as law as soon as Friday, TVNZ reported. 'He is my human brother': Forgiveness at New Zealand's service for terror victims The passage of the bill comes just weeks after the March 15 mass shooting at two Christchurch mosques, which Ardern described as ""the darkest of days in New Zealand's history."" ""We are ultimately here because 50 people died, and they do not have a voice,"" she told parliament Wednesday. ""We in this house are their voice, and today, we have used that voice wisely."" Read More Ardern also said that a buyback scheme would ensure that gun owners would not lose out financially. The Australian man accused of carrying out the attack, Brenton Tarrant, 28, was last week formally charged with 50 counts of murder and 39 attempted murder counts. He is due to reappear in court on June 14, after a mental health assessment."

""I wanted to speak on behalf of the youth. ... I wanted to come out and say that Sudan is for all."" Just days later, her message has come to symbolize Sudan's protests -- and the prominent role Sudanese women are playing in it -- thanks to a photo of Salah, clad in a white robe and gold moon earrings, that's gone viral. It was snapped as she stood Monday on the vehicle's roof amid hundreds of protesters outside the presidential compound and army headquarters in Khartoum and chanted, as the throng responded, ""Revolution!"" ""Every time people responded with 'Thawra' ('Revolution'), I would get more excited,"" Salah said. ""We need international support, for people to be aware of what's happening and to understand our demands.""

'Game of Thrones' showrunners worried about the ending - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Lisa Respers France,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/entertainment/game-of-thrones-ending/index.html,"(CNN) David Benioff loved the way ""The Sopranos"" ended, but he well remembers all of the arguments about it.
Benioff and his fellow ""Game of Thrones"" showrunner Dan Weiss talked to Entertainment Weekly about their show's forthcoming series finale. The eighth and final season starts Sunday and viewers have already started theorizing about, and agonizing over, how it will all conclude. Benioff told EW ""From the beginning, we've talked about how the show would end."" ""A good story isn't a good story if you have a bad ending,"" he said. ""Of course we worry."" Read More 'Game of Thrones' releases behind-the-scenes videos Benioff talked about how hotly debated the ending of ""The Sopranos"" (with the screen cutting to black) was when it aired in 2007. ""I've gotten into a lot of arguments with people about why that was a great ending, but people felt legitimately cheated and that's their right to feel that way, just as it's my right to feel like they're idiots,"" he said. Benioff is not shying from such debate. ""It's also part of the fun of any show that people love arguing about it,"" he said. 'Game of Thrones' is wrapping up and we have SO many questions Weiss said there's another popular finale he hopes their ending evokes. ""I'm hoping we get the 'Breaking Bad' [finale] argument where it's like, ""Is that an A or an A+?,'"" he said. ""I want that to be the argument. I just wish we found better directors for it."" The worry over spoilers for the hit HBO series (HBO is owned by CNN's parent company) has been ever-present, with Benioff saying,""If the NSA and CIA can't protect all of their information, what hope do we have?"" ""Stuff is going to leak no matter what, so you try your best to limit it,"" he said. ""There's always going to be a certain level of douchery, of people trying to spoil things.

Barr reviewing origins of FBI's Russia investigation - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Laura Jarrett,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/barr-doj-investiation-fbi-russia/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General William Barr suggested to lawmakers Wednesday that Donald Trump 's presidential campaign was spied on, saying he will be looking into the ""genesis"" of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation that began in 2016 of potential ties between the campaign and the Russian government.
Barr returns to Capitol Hill, where he'll face more Mueller questions ""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,"" Barr said, echoing some of the more inflammatory claims lobbed by the President for months, but declining to elaborate on his concerns. ""I think spying did occur."" He did not provide evidence for his claims. The news will likely be viewed as a welcome development to the President, who has regularly called for an investigation and, as recently as last week, told reporters more should be done to examine the origins of the Russia probe. It will also likely raise concerns of politicization of the Department of Justice's work at an already tense time, as Democrats worry that Barr is bending to the President's demands and have called on Barr to release an unredacted version of the special counsel's confidential report on the Russia investigation to Congress. Read More Congressional Democrats fumed Wednesday over Barr's statements, accusing the attorney general of mischaracterizing the FBI's counterintelligence investigation in an effort to please Trump. ""I'm amazed that the AG would make that kind of statement, I think it's in many ways disrespectful to the men and women who work in the DOJ, and it shows, I think, either a lack of understanding or willful ignorance on what goes into a counterintelligence investigation,"" Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN. ""These comments directly contradict what DOJ previously told us,"" tweeted House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, who authorized the subpoena for the Mueller report. ""I've asked DOJ to brief us immediately."" Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who served in the Obama administration, told CNN's Anderson Cooper Wednesday night that Barr's statement was ""both stunning and scary."" Yet, according to a source familiar with his thinking, when Barr spoke of ""spying"" on the Trump campaign, he meant it in the ""classic sense"" of intelligence collection. He doesn't view the term as ""pejorative,"" the source said. When asked if Barr used the word ""spy"" to throw a bit of red meat toward conspiracy theorists who voiced concerns over surveillance tactics, the person said flatly: ""no."" The source emphasized repeatedly that Barr is focused on whether there was proper ""predication"" for any surveillance -- something he stated publicly at Wednesday's hearing. Barr's own review of the FBI's counterintelligence work, first reported by Bloomberg and confirmed by a US official to CNN, was briefly touched on during his House appropriations hearing, but the attorney general went further during Wednesday's Senate appropriations hearing explaining his reasoning. ""For the same reason we're worried about foreign influence in elections, I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,"" Barr said. I'm not suggesting those rules were violated but I think it's important to look at. . . . I think it's my obligation."" He added that he's not launching a full blown investigation into the FBI and and does not view it as a problem that is ""endemic"" to the FBI, but has in mind some colleagues to help him ""pull all this information together, and letting me know if there are some areas that should be looked at."" Trump said Wednesday morning that Barr was doing a ""great job"" and ""getting started on going back to the origins on where exactly this all started because it was an illegal witch hunt."" ""This was an attempted coup, this was an attempted takedown of a president,"" Trump said. The US official told CNN that Barr's review is separate from the ongoing work being conducted by the Justice Department's internal watchdog, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, but could not detail its precise scope nor explain how the work of US Attorney John Huber, who was also tasked with investigating surveillance matters, factors in at this stage. Barr did not elaborate further. In March 2018, amid calls by Republican lawmakers for a second special counsel to investigate how the Russia investigation began, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions revealed that Huber was looking into allegations that the FBI abused its powers in surveilling former Trump foreign policy aide Carter Page among other issues. At the same time, Horowitz's office confirmed it would ""review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source"" and ""review the DOJ's and FBI's relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court) applications."" Yet those efforts by Sessions to appease Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill appeared less than sufficient at the time. Trump claimed on Twitter that the inspector general was the wrong person to probe possible FISA abuse, calling the move ""disgraceful."" Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2018 Barr said Tuesday he expected Horowitz's review will be completed in ""May or June."" This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday."
UK economy just got a surprise lift from Brexit stockpiling - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Ivana Kottasová,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/economy/uk-economy-brexit-stockpiling/index.html,"London (CNN Business) The struggling UK economy is getting a boost from Brexit stockpiling.
UK GDP grew 0.3% in the three months to the end of February, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting an expansion of 0.2%. Economists said the faster pace of growth was partly due to manufacturing businesses stockpiling materials and parts that would be harder to acquire if Britain crashes out of the European Union. The Office for National Statistics said that it had seen evidence that manufacturers were engaged in stockpiling as the original Brexit deadline approached. UK politicians have still not agreed a deal that would prevent a disorderly Brexit, which could lead to lengthy delays at the country's borders. The latest deadline to avoid leaving the European Union without a deal is Friday. The 10 most dire warnings from business on Brexit Read More Economists expect there was even more stockpiling last month ahead of the original Brexit date of March 29. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, pointed to a survey that showed manufacturing activity spiked to its highest level in 13 months in March. ""It got a substantial lift from producers and their clients stockpiling inputs and finished products at a record rate to guarantee their supplies in case of a disruptive Brexit,"" he said. Some companies, including the drugmakers Sanofi ( GCVRZ ) and Novartis ( NVS ) , said they would stockpile treatments in the United Kingdom ahead of Brexit. Select food suppliers and supermarkets have said the same. Prime Minister Theresa May is traveling to Brussels on Wednesday to ask the European Union for yet another Brexit delay. The 10 most dire warnings from business on Brexit The UK economy has suffered because of prolonged uncertainty over Brexit. A weak housing market, slumping autos production, declining investment and downbeat executives all suggest that nearly three years of confusion over Brexit is causing the economy to stagnate. ""By normal standards, a 0.3% expansion would be considered quite feeble,"" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics."
