NBC's Chuck Todd fires back at CNN's Chris Cuomo after he mocks him,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/cuomo-versus-chuck-todd,"NBC's Chuck Todd fired off a mocking insult to CNN's Chris Cuomo after hearing that he dismissively compared the news anchor to Jake Tapper.
""I just read [Cuomo's comment] as somebody who wanted to defend that fact that nobody in broadcast television wanted to hire him, I guess, or he couldn't get the job that he wanted,"" Todd said.
""I don't know what it was, but he was awfully defensive so he took shots at other people,"" he concluded.
He added that Tapper is his friend and that he was ""angrier"" than anyone about Cuomo's comments.
Todd was made the comments to WABC in New York in response to a jab from Cuomo published on Wednesday.
""Anderson Cooper is a hell of a lot bigger than any male anywhere on network television,"" Cuomo said in the interview.
""I would argue that Chuck Todd ain't Jake Tapper,"" Cuomo added. ""Jake Tapper has a much bigger footprint in politics than Chuck Todd does.""
The Hill reported that Chuck Todd's Sunday program has almost four times as many average viewers as Tapper's daily news show on CNN.
Both MSNBC and CNN saw enormous ratings declines after the Mueller investigation ended, while Fox News saw a great increase in their viewer numbers.

Here's the stunning percentage of Millennials who regret taking a loan for college - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/millennials-and-student-debt,"A new poll shows the stunning percentage of Millennials who regret taking a loan out in order to attend college.
The Business Insider/Morning Consult poll says that four out of every ten of indebted Millennials regret going to college: 42 percent.
56 percent of Millennials said it was worth incurring a debt load to go college, with only 2 percent answering that they don't know.
That is a much higher percentage than Baby Boomers who were polled - 27 percent said college was not worth the debt load, while 68 percent said it was worth it.
Student debt has become a key political issue as some Democrats have called for the government to make college free, and others want to forgive the mounting debt that many say are crippling them from obtaining success.
The poll shows that among those who thought that college was worth attending, 64 percent had already paid off their loans, and 48 percent were still paying off their loans.
The total student loan debt has been estimated at about $1.6 trillion.
Despite that attitude about college and the ballooning student debt, experts say Millennials don't behave much differently from their forebears.
""Right now, millennials are in their 20s and 30s, and the types of financial decisions they're making are typical of someone in their 20s and 30s,"" said NerdWallet expert Sara Rathner.
""In 40 years,"" she explained, ""millennials will probably be in much the same place as baby boomers are today.""

Liberals melt down over this tweet President Trump slamming Omar's 9/11 comments,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/trump-tweets-about-ilhan-omar,"President Donald Trump once again poked the hornet's nest of social media when he tweeted a video meant to criticize Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) over her dismissive comments about the horrific 9/11 terror attacks.
""WE WILL NEVER FORGET!"" tweeted the president on Friday with a video compiling Omar's controversial comments with images from the 9/11 attack.
Omar has defended her comments describing the death of thousands of U.S. citizens by an Islamist terror attack as ""some people did something."" Other Democrats, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), stood by their fellow freshman colleague.
The reaction from many on the left to the presidential tweet was one of exasperation and horrified dismay. Many called on Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend the president's account or delete his video.
""I can't believe I'm saying this but please report the President of the United States who has just tweeted out this incendiary video,"" tweeted feminist writer Aimee Vanderpool. ""It's another dog whistle for some unhinged person to hurt her, just like the bombs to the media and the shooter at the synagogue. DESPICABLE.""
""While the CIA was top secret in its efforts leading up to assassinating JFK,"" tweeted progressive journalist Jordan Chariton, ""this is the president of the United States openly inciting people to bring harm to a sitting Muslim Congresswomen. HOW DOES THIS NOT MERIT A SUSPENSION @jack @Twitter?""
"".@Jack please take this video by Trump off Twitter,"" tweeted Democratic columnist David Weissman. ""Incitement doesn't always have to be words. You know how crazy his base can be with previous terror attacks that were committed them. @IlhanMN's life is worth more than some news worthy tweet. @TwitterSafety please do your job.
""Every American should be disgusted by @realDonaldTrump's continued incitement against Rep. @IlhanMN,"" tweeted CAIR Director Nahad Awad.
""Trump going full anti-Muslim here- Trump intercut 9/11 with a Muslim speaking,"" said Muslim comedian and activist Dean Obeidallah. ""This is just like the anti-Muslim videos I see from hate groups.""
After a serious of accusations over other comments that appeared to contain anti-Semitic tropes, it was reported that Democrats were already seeking to replace the controversial representative by searching out for another politician to defeat her in the next primary.
Here's the latest on Omar's 9/11 controversy: Rep. Ilhan Omar blasted for 9/11 remarks www.youtube.com"
Dan Crenshaw responds politely but forcefully to spiteful accusations AOC and Omar,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/crenshaw-fires-back-at-omar-and-ocasio,"Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) had a polite but forceful response to spiteful accusations from Reps. Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) that he wasn't supportive enough of the troops.
""It's terrorists who killed almost 3,000 Americans, and we should talk about it that way,"" Crenshaw told NBC News on Friday. ""We should talk about it with deference.""
He was speaking about the controversy surrounding comments from Rep. Omar that appeared to dismiss the gravity of the 9/11 terror attacks by describing it as ""some people did something.""
'Don't play the victim card' Crenshaw addressed criticism that the comments were taken out of context.
""It was not taken out of context, by the way, there are a lot of claims that it was,"" he explained, ""of course it wasn't. I think everyone should just look at the clip and decide for themselves. I don't think it's out of line to simply call that out and criticize it.""
He called it the ""height of partisanship"" that both sides can't come together and agree that it was improper to ""diminish"" the attack on U.S. soil.
""All Representative Omar had to do was really, I don't know, explain herself, say whatever she wants,"" Crenshaw continued.
""Say she didn't mean it,"" he offered, ""diffuse the situation, but don't double down, alright? Don't play the victim card and don't start making accusations of me — I just think that was uncalled for.""
Crenshaw didn't shrink from citing his own service in the military when he responded to the Democrats who claimed that he didn't do enough to support the military. Among those was Ocasio Cortez, who tweeted a scathing attack on the Afghanistan war veteran.
""You refuse to cosponsor the 9/11 Victim's Compensation Fund, yet have the audacity to drum resentment towards Ilhan w/completely out-of-context quotes,"" she tweeted in an attempt to deflect from Omar's 9/11 comments.
'I'm really disappointed in them' ""This is a really dishonest attack, and let me tell you how I am for 9/11 victims and 9/11 first-responders. I'm the guy who went overseas to make sure this never happens again, to take the fight to the enemy that committed these attacks,"" Crenshaw responded.
""I would go back and do it every day if I could,"" Crenshaw added. ""So to say that kind of attack, that is the height of partisanship and I'm really disappointed in them saying that, especially coming from New York.""
Crenshaw had already shot down a suggestion from Omar that he was inciting violence against her by criticizing her.

Bratcher, who plays real-life abortion clinic worker-turned-pro-life activist Abby Johnson, recently revealed some of the on-set “Unplanned"" prayer moments that she believes deeply inspired the cast and crew.
One of the most powerful scenes in ""Unplanned"" — a film currently showing in theaters across America — comes when Bratcher portrays the moment Johnson experienced complications from taking an abortion pill. The actress recently told PureFlix.com's ""Pure Talk"" that the scene was the ""most difficult"" to perform — but that prayer made a massive impact .

Shocking ruling from liberal 9th Circuit Court hands President Trump huge immigration victory,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ninth-circuit-trump-victory-asylum-request-policy,"The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has traditionally ruled against the Trump administration, handed President Donald Trump a rare immigration victory Friday night.
What are the details? The appeals court issued a stay against a lower court decision — which came just four days earlier — that blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a policy that forced migrants to wait in Mexico while U.S. authorities processed their asylum requests.
However, the stay was only temporary. The court will consider extending the stay sometime next week, according to the New York Times .
The court gave civil liberty groups until Tuesday to submit arguments for why the policy should be overthrown, while giving the Justice Department until Wednesday to submit arguments for why the policy should remain in place.
What's the background? On Monday, Federal District Court Judge Richard Seeborg granted an injunction against the Trump administration's policy . Seeborg claimed the policy violated existing immigration law. He also claimed the president did not have the power to enforce the policy.
Seeborg's injunction was set to go into effect Friday, which explains the emergency stay from the 9th Circuit.
In December, the Trump administration rolled out a new policy that forced migrants who entered the U.S. illegally to wait in Mexico while U.S. authorities processed their asylum requests.
The policy sought to end the controversial practice of so-called ""catch and release,"" where non-criminal migrants would essentially be released into the general population while courts decided their asylum requests."
College students and alum outraged and 'shaking' that Mike Pence will speak at commencement,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/college-students-outraged-and-shaking-that-mike-pence-will-speak-at-commencement,"The picture of the aggrieved and trembling college student unable to cope with hearing unpleasant things, or simply things with which they disagree, is fast becoming the face of higher education in the United States. It is therefore not a surprise that the invitation of Vice President Mike Pence to speak on a campus might result in some safe space complaining.
It is perhaps somewhat a surprise that, in this case, it's an evangelical Christian school: Taylor University. In the VP's own state of Indiana.
After it was announced that the Vice President of the United States would give the graduating students the honor of high office at their commencement, some students, and even alum and parents, went into meltdown. PJ Media's Tyler O'Neil has their reactions .
Naturally, there was a petition .
""Inviting Vice President Pence to Taylor University and giving him a coveted platform for his political views makes our alumni, faculty, staff and current students complicit in the Trump-Pence Administration's policies, which we believe are not consistent with the Christian ethic of love we hold dear,"" Alex Hoekstra, a former staffer for President Barack Obama and a 2007 Taylor University graduate, said in the petition.
Others proved more angry and visceral.
""I have never been made to feel so physically ill by an email before. Taylor University, you should be ashamed of yourselves,"" Claire Hadley, who graduated from Taylor in 2015, began in a long Facebook post . ""I am physically shaking. The fact that the school who claims to love and support me, and each of it's [ sic ] students and alum, would invite such a vile individual to speak on the most important day of the year??""
""VP Pence is no friend of mine. He does not support me. He does not support equality,"" Hadley declared. ""He does not uphold the values that are at the very core of the church, my own faith, and I would hope, of this University. He is rooted in hate. To stand beside President Trump would have been enough to put him on my watch list."" She argued that Mike Pence ""only values you if you fit in his very narrow, white, straight, box.""
""Taylor University, I feel personally attacked,"" she concluded. ""Please, I'm begging you. Don't do this.""
Lindsey Snyder, a 2014 graduate, said she emailed Taylor University President Lowell Haines. ""This invitation gravely concerns me, because whether intentional or not, it is politicizing Taylor University, aligning the school with the current administration,"" she reported writing. ""Many current and former Taylor students are adamantly against some of Pence's stances and will no doubt feel unsafe at their own graduation. Even if it was someone less controversial than Pence, having a political figure speak at commencement alights unnecessary and grievous conflict.""
There is so much more . Not everyone had the same reaction, and some among the student body and the alumni have responded. On Saturday, O'Neil reported that a counter-petition has been launched, and is picking up steam .
O'Neil spoke with one graduate, Kevin Holtsberry of the class of '94, who told him ""Inviting the sitting vice president of the United States, and former Indiana governor and congressman, to speak at commencement is not an attack on students, faculty or alumni with differing political views or opinions about Mike Pence,"" Kevin Holtsberry.
The fact that these students at a Christian university in middle America, in the state where Pence was the governor not that long ago, shows just how far the ""woke"" college experience has extended. It's not just coastal elites. It's right in your backyard."

Bernie's 'Medicare-for-All' plan includes paying for illegal immigrants,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/bernie-medicare-plan--illegal-immigrants,"Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders is right in line with the current liberal zeitgeist - in fact he says he was there first, and therefore is excused from being a white male - and his Medicare for All plan is being endorsed and embraced by his competition for the 2020 Democrat nomination.
As Fox News reported, that plan isn't just about no American paying for healthcare, or even nose jobs, it's about people who are not Americans, too. As in, people who are here illegally.
You see, rather than covering ""citizens"", the legislation Sanders unveiled this week would cover all ""residents"" in the United States. As Fox notes, that's ""a shift from the Affordable Care Act, which limited benefits to citizens, nationals and ""lawfully present"" immigrants. The House bill also prohibits the government from denying benefits because of ""citizenship status.""
More than that, as the Washington Examiner pointed out on Friday, it even aspires to cover those who can't meet the loose definition of resident. ""Even if an individual is not covered under a broad definition of 'residency' by the secretary of HHS, the federal government can take steps 'to ensure that every person in the United States has access to health care.'""
On Fox News on Saturday, Peter Doocy reported on the Medicare for all proposal, and if you listen, you can actually hear money burning. Watch:

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) broke her silence Saturday afternoon, responding to controversy that President Donald Trump ignited Friday when he tweeted out a video highlighting comments Omar made recently about the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
What did Omar say? She claimed that ""each and every day"" the Trump administration attacks the foundational principles of America's founding. She also repeated several lies.
Thank you for standing with me – against an administration that ran on banning Muslims from this country – to fight for the America we all deserve.💪🏽
— Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) April 13, 2019 Regarding Omar's claim that Trump's administration is guilty of ""cag[ing] children,"" TheBlaze previously reported :
In fact, an image of a child locked in what appears to be some form of cage — which went viral during the migrant crisis last summer that involved family separations — was actually from a staged protest in front of Dallas City Hall, according to fact-checker Snopes . Meanwhile, Trump's administration did not implement a policy ""banning Muslims."" Instead, Trump campaign on — and later implemented — a policy that temporarily prevented people from certain Muslim-majority countries, which are hotbeds for terrorism, from traveling to the U.S.
What's the background? On Friday, Trump tweeted a video criticizing Omar for recently referring to terrorists who attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001 as ""some people who did something."" Omar's comments were spliced together with dramatic scenes from 9/11.
In response, Democrats accused the president of inciting violence against Omar. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), one of Omar's closest progressive allies, even exploited the Holocaust in her effort to condemn Trump.
At the center of controversy are comments Omar made while speaking at a CAIR fundraiser in March. CAIR, of course, has been connected to terrorist activity , and was even listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation case, which resulted in numerous convictions for providing material support to Hamas.
""CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,"" Omar said at the event.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) ignited outrage Friday after she used a poem about the Holocaust to defend Rep. Ilhan Omar, the Minnesota Democrat who is embroiled in controversy herself.
What happened? On Friday, President Donald Trump tweeted a video criticizing Omar for referring to the Islamic terrorists who attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001 as ""some people who did something."" The video spliced together Omar's controversial comments with footage from 9/11.
In response, Ocasio-Cortez urged members of Congress to condemn Trump for ""dangerous targeting"" of Omar.
""Members of Congress have a duty to respond to the President's explicit attack today.@IlhanMN's life is in danger. For our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.
With her tweet, Ocasio-Cortez included a picture of the famous poem from German theologian Martin Niemöller, who was imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps from 1938-1945 for opposing Hitler's Nazi regime. Niemöller only narrowly escaped execution.
The poem, which is mounted on a wall at the National Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., reads:
First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
Because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
What was the reaction? Ben Shapiro — who is the biggest target of anti-Semitism online, according to the Anti-Defamation League — condemned Ocasio-Cortez's ""deeply disturbing"" comparison.
Others echoed Shapiro's sentiments:

Report: Former top Clinton aide running 'dark money' campaign to get Brett Kavanaugh fired from teaching job - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/clinton-aide-campaign-brett-kavanaugh,"Hillary Clinton's former campaign spokesman is leading a ""dark money"" campaign to get Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh fired from his summer teaching job at George Mason University, according to a new report.
What are the details? Fox News reported that Brian Fallon, who served as Clinton's 2016 national spokesman, is backing an effort to prevent Kavanaugh from teaching for the university this summer. Fallon leads Demand Justice, a progressive advocacy group that does not disclose its funding.
The effort, which has been dubbed ""Mason 4 Survivors,"" is circulating a petition that has so far garnered more than 5,000 signatures. The group is urging George Mason president Angel Cabrera to ""terminate AND void ALL contracts and affiliation with Brett Kavanaugh at George Mason University.""
""There is a historic amount of institutional negligence on your part to support survivors of sexual assault and the student body as a whole, which has bred a sense of mistrust and suffering within the Mason community and allies,"" the petition claims.
According to HuffPost , Fallon's group is running a Facebook advertisement campaign that targets anyone connected with George Mason University urging them to sign the petition. The ad also directs targeted users to sign a separate petition that calls on Congress to investigate Kavanaugh.
Though sexual misconduct allegations surfaced against Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation process last, none of the accusations ever proved credible.
What's the background? It was announced last month that Kavanaugh would join George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School as a distinguished visiting professor. He is set to co-teach a two-credit course this summer in England called ""Creation of the Constitution.""
Kavanaugh's appointment was met with immediate pushback and protests .
Fortunately, Cabrera has defended Kavanaugh's appointment, saying in a statement last month that the university will not revoke Kavanaugh's appointment.
""I respect the views of people who disagreed with Justice Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation due to questions raised about his sexual conduct in high school. But he was confirmed and is now a sitting Justice,"" Cabrera said. ""The law school has determined that the involvement of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice contributes to making our law program uniquely valuable for our students."""
New York Press Club to honor CNN's Jim Acosta with 'Truth to Power' award,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nypc-jim-acosta-truth-to-power,"CNN's Jim Acosta was family booted from the White House press corps, and almost as famously returned to it, after fighting for the microphone and refusing to stop talking when he was directing remarks to President Trump last year.
The hallmark of Acosta's reporting, and indeed career, is as a person who battles Trump from the left, rather than as a reporter or uncoverer of truth in his own right.
Acosta's style - a sort of preachy monologue as opposed to traditional question and answer - doesn't sit will with a lot of conservative viewers, and he's faced a good deal of criticism over it, especially at Trump's rallies.
It is presumably on those grounds, his provocateur milieu, on which the New York Press club has decided to award him their ""Truth to Power"" award at their upcoming awards dinner.
For a refresher in how Acosta's job as Trump foil has sky-rocketed his career, you can do worse than to read this explainer from last year at the Daily Wire. But if you want a more recent example, Glenn Beck's biting commentary here is a must.
In the press release announcing his selection, the NYPC said the purpose of the award, which is named for journalist Gabe Pressman, is designed to honor """"an individual whose body of work challenges the power establishment and/or defends journalists.""
Perhaps it is meant specifically with regard to the incident with the White House revoking his credentials, against which Fox News joined all the other press organizations in protest, as opposed to his more general job of simply launching social-media quality liberal talking points at any conservative or republican unfortunate enough to be in front of his mic."

On the other hand, in another hypothetical match-up - one that is slightly more hypothetical even if you take into account the lack of a formal announcement - Rasmussen finds a similar lead, but for Joe Biden over Donald Trump. In that one, the margin is 49% for Biden over 44% for Trump.
So a larger 5-point lead for Biden over Trump than the three pointer for Trump over Sanders.
Rasmussen writes of the match-ups they are polling:
Given the large number of candidates expected to enter the race for next year's Democratic nomination, Rasmussen Reports has opted to run a series of matchups over two-week cycles as the contest continues to develop. These longer cycles mean the matchup findings will be based on 5,000 respondents rather than the usual 1,000 for our regular surveys, and they lower the margin of error.
The survey of 5,000 Likely Voters was conducted on March 31-April 4 and April 7-11, 2019 by Rasmussen Reports. The margin of sampling error is +/- 1.5 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence. Field work for all Rasmussen Reports surveys is conducted by Pulse Opinion Research, LLC . See methodology .
In a separate poll released on Friday, Muhlenberg College/Morning Call's survey on the Pennsylvania Democratic primary finds Biden beating Sanders , too. And Sanders ahead of the rest of the pack of candidates who have actually declared.
Combined with the abysmal fundraising for Democrats so far, it's looking like a rough primary and election no matter how you slice it.
Then again, polls can always change. Can't they, Secretary Clinton?"
Oakland's liberal mayor attacks Trump over immigration policies. Trump swings back with defiant challenge. - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/donald-trump-libby-schaaf-immigration,"President Donald Trump and Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) traded barbs on social media Saturday over the president's controversial immigration policies.
What's the background? Last week, the Washington Post revealed top White House aides once considered releasing detained migrants in ""sanctuary cities,"" which are almost exclusively Democratic-led progressive cities. Trump later confirmed he is considering enacting the policy.
In fact, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox News' Jeanine Pirro Saturday that the administration is actively working with Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to begin sending illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities.
""They have said they wanted all of these illegal aliens into their communities,"" Gidley said. ""We're working with DHS, we're working with ICE, to try and make sure that happens because after all, it's what they want. They should not say 'This is retribution politically,' they should say, 'This is an olive branch.'""
What happened between Trump and Schaaf? After the Washington Post revealed the proposed policy, Schaaf, in an interview with KTVU-TV , called the policy idea an ""outrageous abuse of power,"" characterized it as un-American, and said the Trump administration essentially proposed using human beings as ""instruments of political payback.""
In a separate interview with CNN , Schaaf similarly denounced the proposed policy, but added that she is ""proud to be the mayor of a sanctuary city.""
Trump hit back at Schaaf on Saturday, questioning why non-sanctuary cities should be forced to carry the burden of caring for illegal immigrants when sanctuary cities already welcome them.
Schaaf swung back, accusing the president of ""fanning hate and division.""
About 30 minutes later, Trump responded by declaring the legal right to release illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities while demanding, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that California, a liberal safe haven, accept them.
Schaaf did not respond to Trump's last tweet."
Rep. Rashida Tlaib makes stunning accusation about Democratic Party leadership - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/rashida-tlaib-democratic-leaderhip-accusation,"Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) over the weekend accused Democratic Party leadership of exploiting Muslim lawmakers, only using them to bolster the party's image of diversity, yet silencing them at the legislative drawing board.
What did she say? Amid controversy between President Donald Trump and Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) — stemming from the president criticizing remarks Omar made recently when she refused to denounce the 9/11 attackers as terrorists — Tlaib launched a broadside at her party's leadership.
The Michigan lawmaker is seemingly upset over what she believes is a failure by Democratic leadership to properly condemn Omar's critics.
""They put us in photos when they want to show our party is diverse. However, when we ask to be at the table, or speak up about issues that impact who we are, what we fight for & why we ran in the first place, we are ignored,"" Tlaib charged. ""To truly honor our diversity is to never silence us.""
Tlaib echoed comments from Maheen Ahmed, a legislative staffer in the California Assembly. Ahmed charged that the failure from Democratic leadership to defend Omar and ""subsequent lack of support from Democratic leadership continues to prove that this system was never meant for us.""
""Do not applaud diversity and the 'first' Muslims in any space if you're not willing to be a true ally and defend us,"" Ahmed said.
Tlaib and Omar are the first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress.
What has Democratic leadership said? As Tlaib noted, party leaders have been somewhat muted on the issue. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) condemned Trump for using 9/11 footage in his Omar criticism video — yet did not rebuke the president for criticizing Omar.
Meanwhile, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, though he initially dodged questions , rebuked the president over the weekend.
On the other hand, Democrats running for president — including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke, and others — forcefully rebuked the president, even accusing Trump of inciting violence against Omar."

A man at the Mall of American in Minnesota apparently threw a 5-year-old boy over the third floor railing, and so far no one knows why. Police say the suspect, Emmanuel Aranda, 24, is cooperating.
WCCO-TV in Minnesota reported a witness heard the boy's mother shouting ""Everybody pray, everybody pray. Oh my God, my baby, someone threw him over the edge.""
The child, Landen Hoffmann of Woodbury, Minnesota, fell over forty feet and suffered significant injuries, according to authorities.
The family posted about the terrible incident on social media, and a GoFundMe was started to raise money for the family during this horrific time of need. It was started by friends of the family after Landen's cousin April Hoffmann, posted an Instagram tribute.
""This is Landen, he is the sweetest kindest 5 year old you will ever meet. His soul is soft and gentle and instantly brings a smile to everybody he meets,"" the fundraiser reads. ""He is full of energy and life and enjoys soccer, playing with friends and family and playing hockey with his brother and sister.""
It relates the family's story. ""He was enjoying a day at the Mall of America with his mom and friend on Friday morning when a stranger maliciously grabbed him and threw him over the 3rd floor balcony for no apparent reason. The family doesn't know him and are completely clueless as to why this monster would target their family with this heinous act of violence.""
The fundraiser was over $400,000 by Sunday morning.
In the press conference about the incident, Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts said Landen is ""receiving care. I think we're just asking for your thoughts and prayers for that child to recover.""
The suspect has been charged with attempted homicide. Police credited a concerned bystander for chasing the suspect, and the Mall security for tracking him to the transportation station where he was apprehended."
WATCH: Jake Tapper grills Eric Swalwell on his anti-gun agenda; he admits Second Amendment not 'absolute right',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/eric-swalwell-second-amendment-agenda-cnn,"Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, revealed his campaign's main agenda on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, which focuses on gun control.
But just how far does Swalwell want to go? CNN host Jake Tapper asked tough questions to clarify Swalwell's vision.
What did Swalwell say? Last year, Swalwell said that semi-automatic ""military-style assault weapons,"" like the AR-15, should be outlawed. He advocated gun buybacks and criminally prosecuting those who do not comply with stiff gun control measures. Tapper pressed on that point.
""What's the punishment for people who don't hand in their guns, do they go to jail?"" Tapper asked.
""Well Jake, they would,"" Swalwell admitted, ""but I also offer an alternative, which would be to keep them at a hunting club or a shooting range. And the reason I have proposed this is because these weapons are so devastating.""
The California Democrat said ""fear"" is another reason the Second Amendment should be curtailed.
""But it's not just the violence that they've caused, it's the fear, the immeasurable fear that our children live in because they are still on our streets. I want to get rid of that fear, I want to do what Australia did, and New Zealand just recently did. I think this issue just needs some bold leadership to do it,"" Swalwell said.
Noting that most gun owners are law-abiding citizens and that the vast majority of firearm-related deaths in the U.S. are not related to ""military-style semi-automatic"" rifles, Tapper asked: ""Isn't it fair to say you actually do want to take away people's guns?""
Under his vision for America, Swalwell said Americans would retain possession of handguns, long rifles, and shotguns — just not the ""weapons of war."" He said:
You know, keep your pistols, keep your long rifles, keep your shotguns. I want the most dangerous weapons, these weapons of war, out of the hands of the most dangerous people. But when it comes to what else we can do, because I don't even suggest this is all we can do, I also want background checks. So do 73% of NRA members. I want to invest in gang violence prevention programs, especially in our cities.
I want more community oriented policing. My brother is a sheriff's athletic league police officer. He works in tough neighborhoods and helps them get kids out of the streets and into sports. There's a lot that we can do on this issue, but unless it's the number one issue for a president, it's just going to be one that we respond to shooting to shooting. I want to lead on it.
Finally, Swalwell claimed the Second Amendment ""is not an absolute right.""
Swalwell's admission came when Tapper asked if the Second Amendment should be repealed, which former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens advocated last year.
""No. I don't agree, but I think the greatest threat to the Second Amendment is doing nothing,"" Swalwell said. ""And the Second Amendment is not an absolute right.""
""Just like free speech, you can't shout fire in a theater or lie about the products you're selling, you can't own a bazooka, you can't own a tank, you can't own rocket propelled grenades, so we should put some limits in place, and I think the American people are with me,"" he continued. ""I'm no longer intimidated by the NRA. The moms and the kids, they are behind us on this issue, and I think it just takes leadership in Washington.""
In the past, Sevens argued the Second Amendment should be amended to reflect his belief that the founders wrote the amendment in the context of a standing army, not personal defense.
However, last March, the retired justice revealed he wants the Second Amendment repealed altogether ."

Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley spoke with Fox News Channel's Jeanine Pirro on Saturday, and after he articulated the notion, Trump tweeted about it . Gidley indicated this an active plan that they are working on implementing right now.
""They are telling us you cannot keep family units who come here illegally and unlawfully at the southern border. You can't keep them at detention facilities. You can't deport them,"" said Gidley. ""The only thing you can do is, as an administration is, release them into American communities.""
""So, the president said listen, there are sanctuary cities out there where Democrats have said we welcome any and all whether they criminals, whether they are here illegally, seeking asylum, regardless. Anybody who disagrees with us is racist,"" he continued, putting the rationale into words. ""So the president said fine, I've got a great idea. We'd love to work with you guys to figure out exactly the best way to transport these people were here illegally and unlawfully and into your communities and your districts and your states.""
He added that no Democrats from those cities have come to the White House and said ""We love to work with the administration, send everybody to our town."""
Twice failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tells Dems how they should campaign to beat Trump,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/hillary-clinton-advice-2020-democrats,"Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state who ran two failed presidential campaigns, recently offered Democrats running for president advice on how to best campaign against President Donald Trump.
Clinton's advice came despite her loss to Trump in 2016.
What did Clinton say? Speaking with CNN's Fareed Zakaria at Tina Brown's Women in the World summit Friday, Clinton offered Democrats running for president two pieces of advice.
""You really have to do two things simultaneously — and it's challenging,"" Clinton said.
""You do have to present what you want to do,"" she explained. ""What is your vision? What is your hope for our country? How do you see the future? What are you going to propose that will make a difference in the lives of Americans and maintain the values, the ideas of America in a very complex world?""
""So, you bare that responsibility. At the same time,"" Clinton continued, ""you have to be able to counter and ignore where possible, respond where necessary, to the diversion and distraction that we see working, unfortunately, by the current incumbent in the White House.""
Zakaria also asked Clinton to respond to comments from South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is running for the Democratic nomination and recently told Washington Post magazine about Trump , ""at least he didn't go around saying that America was already great, like Hillary did.""
According to the Hollywood Reporter , Clinton responded: ""I don't want to comment on any of the candidates. Like I said, I think they have a lot to contribute not only to the Democratic party, but to the country. And it will be up to voters to decide who our nominee is.""
However, she later went on to criticize Bernie Sanders' Medicare-for-All proposal, which would reportedly cover illegal immigrants .
""The specifics, though, matter,"" Clinton said. ""What are the details? How do we pay for it? Who is going to get what they need? There are a lot of complicated questions."""
"'Hostile' migrants break border gate to enter Mexico, then attack police — and they're headed north - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/migrants-break-border-fence-mexico?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Daily-Newsletter__PM-Final%202019-04-14&utm_term=TheBlaze%20Daily%20PM%20-%20last%20270%20days,"Mexican authorities say a large group of migrants broke the locks on a gate at the Guatemalan-Mexican border on Friday, illegally entering the country in order to join a larger caravan of migrants making their way north to the United States.
What are the details? Mexico's National Immigration Institute announced that about 350 migrants broke down the border gate to enter Mexico, according to the Associated Press .
The agency said the migrants were ""hostile"" and ""aggressive."" Authorities also accused the migrants of attacking Mexican police in the border town of Metapa. The migrants later joined a larger caravan, of about 2,000, making their way north to the U.S.
One of the migrants who spoke to the AP, Claudia Jaqueline Sandoval said she is HIV positive. But that is not her reason for journeying north. Instead, money is scarce in her home country of Honduras, and she hopes to make a better life for her family in America.
According to the AP, there are already several caravans of migrants, including groups of several thousand people, making their way north. The only thing stopping them is Mexico's delayed process for issuing visas that allow the migrants to journey north to the U.S. border.
The AP explains:
A group of several hundred Cuban, African and Central American migrants have been waiting at the immigration offices in Tapachula for documents that would allow them to travel to the U.S. border, where most plan to request asylum.
Some members of that group have scuffled with immigration authorities and broken windows at the offices in recent days, accusing officials of making them wait too long for papers.
And another group of an estimated 2,500 Central American and Cuban migrants have been stuck for at least a week further west in the Chiapas town of Mapastepec, also waiting for papers. The situation has become so tense that a riot broke out at an immigration station in Tapachula, Mexico, last week, where migrants allegedly ransacked the building and burned documents.

Illinois lawmakers consider separating Chicago as its own state - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/illinois-lawmakers-consider-separating-chicago-as-its-own-state,"For his 2015 film, director Spike Lee dubbed the Windy City ' Chi-Raq ', obviously a take on the country of Iraq, for the level of gang violence and crime in America's 'Second City'. It is not another country, of course, but some lawmakers are considering whether it ought to be another state.
A group of Republican members of the state legislature have signed on to a resolution that would urge the U.S. Congress to separate the city from Illinois and make it its own state.
Speaking with the State Journal-Registe r, Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer said the resolution is a way to ""spark discussion."" And it has.
""It's more of a frustration of the policies than the true belief that Chicago and Illinois would be better off as separate states,"" Davidsmeyer told the paper. But he said he doesn't really think the separation is a solution, adding that ""our relationship is mutually beneficial.""
On the other hand, Rep. Brad Halbrook, one of the original sponsors of the bill, seems rather serious. The Journal-Register reports that he ""supports the idea of removing Chicago from the rest of Illinois"" over ""ideological differences,:"" offering examples like abortion and gun rights, where the urban center is out of step with the rural parts of the state.
Resentment for the big burg from those ""downstate"" locales, as the rest of Illinois is referred to, is an ongoing issue, and one that has bubbled up many times in the past. The new Chicago Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot addressed the ""resentment"" issue last week when speaking to the Illinois House of Representatives.
""We are all Illinoisans, and we all have the best interests of our constituents at heart,"" she said.
""Let's be clear. When Illinois thrives, Chicago thrives,"" she added. ""And the reverse is also true.""
But Rep. Davidsmeyer, articulating a belief held by many, said that ""the policies that come down from Chicago are actually pushing [the rest of the state's] economic opportunity away.""
The bill, House Resolution 101, delves into other issues as well, including taxes. The addition of Davidsmeyer's name to the list of Republicans in support has intensified the issue, and whether it is to spark debate, or a serious idea, won't change that the underlying issues are now taking a front seat in the state's politics.
And, like the blue states trying to undermine the electoral college, or the ticket sales for Unplanned, it's yet another example of the deep and seemingly unbreachable divide in this country along every social, political, and economic line."

Nancy Pelosi issues new demand of President Trump amid controversy over Omar 9/11 video,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-statement-trump-omar-video,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued a new demand of President Donald Trump on Sunday amid ongoing controversy over Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar's refusal to identify the 9/11 attackers as terrorists.
Instead, at a CAIR fundraiser last month, Omar referred to the 9/11 perpetrators as ""some people"" who ""did something.""
In response, Trump tweeted a video Friday highlighting Omar's controversial comments. Spliced in between her words were dramatic scenes from 9/11. Democrats later accused the president of inciting violence against Omar.
What did Pelosi say? In a short statement released Sunday afternoon, Pelosi demanded the president remove the video, which he has since ""pinned"" to the top of his Twitter account.
""The President's words weigh a ton, and his hateful and inflammatory rhetoric creates real danger. President Trump must take down his disrespectful and dangerous video,"" Pelosi said in a statement .
""Following the President's tweet, I spoke with the Sergeant-at-Arms to ensure that Capitol Police are conducting a security assessment to safeguard Congresswoman Omar, her family and her staff,"" she said. ""They will continue to monitor and address the threats she faces.""
Pelosi's statement comes after Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), who is one of Omar's closest progressive allies in Congress, criticized Democratic leadership for seemingly exploiting Muslims.
Omar and Tlaib are the first two Muslim women ever elected to Congress. They were elected last year."

The police tweeted the photos of their new design, which features the American flag within the lettering on the side, and that was enough to trigger a negative response from some. Enough of a response, in fact, that the City Council is going to meet to decide if they can keep it.
It's not the first meeting about the design.
""People are screaming that the American flag on a police car is somehow or another ... hurting people's feelings who might be immigrants or visitors,"" Councilman Peter Blake said according to the LA Times . ""People are actually ridiculous enough to bring up comments about our cop cars having American flags on them.""
At the first council meeting, a resident said the ""boldness"" of the design was ""shocking.""
She also said that she ""thought the aesthetic didn't really represent our community."" The aesthetic is the American flag, which apparently doesn't represent their ""amazing community of artists.""
""It feels very aggressive,"" she said.
Not everyone in the town is so upset by the red, white, and blue design. One officer told the Times that he is complimented on the freshly-painted vehicle ""every time"" he pulls up to a stop sign.
The new black and white design, with the colored logo, is meant to make the vehicles more visible, identifiable, and therefore safer, said the Police chief."
Democrats at War: Bernie Sanders fires both barrels at Clinton-allied think tank - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/sanders-clinton-ocasio-cortez-war-pelosi,"The Democrats are at war, and the biggest front to open so far was opened by 2020 candidate and self-diagnosed ""democratic socialist"" Bernie Sanders.
Sanders made big waves against a big target on Sunday as news of his scathing rebuke of the Center for American Progress made the rounds. It's not the only front on which the war is being fought, but it's the hottest strike zone so far.
That rebuke came in the form of a letter, obtained and printed by the New York Times , and it minces no words. Sanders is accusing the think tank, a John Podesta joint, of ""using its resources to smear Senator Booker, Senator Warren, and myself, among others,"" thereby undermining their mission to defeat Trump.
The battle line here is ideological, with Sanders and the ""progressives"" on one side, and American Progress and it's action fund on the other, stemming from articles published by the affiliated ThinkProgress website.
Sanders is arguing that the Clinton and Podesta part of the party is owned by corporate interests, and is therefore hostile to the turn, particularly among 2020 candidates, toward the politics now closely associated with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez--previously more closely associated with Sanders himself.
That dynamic is playing out in all sorts of ways lately, including in how Democratic leaders and long-time Democrat politicians discuss things like the controversies surrounding Rep. Ilhan Omar, but in the case of Sanders there is also the deeper wound of the 2016 primary.
Part of the fallout from the leaking of DNC emails was the revelation that the party was essentially deliberately undermining Sanders in favor of Clinton in 2016. Despite two years of effort at healing that wound, in many ways, and for many of his supporters, it's still very much open.
Amusingly, the particular article about him that set off the Vermont socialist was a criticism over his previously barely mentioned status as a full-fledged millionaire. The first line of that ThinkProgress article reads: ""It's all very off-brand and embarrassing, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is a millionaire.""
""Last week, you published an article on ThinkProgress criticizing me for my appearance and for the income I earned from writing a book,"" wrote Sanders in his letter. ""Then, a day later, you published a video that dishonestly attacked me for hypocrisy in my effort to address income inequality in America – a video that was excitedly discussed on many conservative websites.""
""Center for American Progress leader Neera Tanden repeatedly calls for unity while simultaneously maligning my staff and supporters and belittling progressive ideas,"" he said of that criticism.
On Sunday morning, Waleed Shahid, Democrat strategist and communications director for the far left PAC Justice Democrats, said on CNN that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib have ""significant disagreements"" with the Democratic leadership.
Shahid argued that Republicans know about that divide and hope to exploit it. ""It's another divide and conquer strategy because they know the Democratic party leadership will be slow in their response, and sometimes even dismissive"" of ""these three progressive women of color,"" and Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Steny Hoyer ""will not come out swinging tor them.""
Shahid singled out Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders as being the politicians who would defend the three.
Meanwhile on CNN's ""State of the Union"" host Jake Tapper spoke with member of the leadership Rep. Jerry Nadler about the 9/11 controversy swirling around Rep. Omar. He pointed out to Nadler that Pelosi's statement could be read as a slight dig at Omar's comments in addition to the President.
Quote: : ""The memory of 9/11 is sacred ground, and any discussion of it must be done with reverence.""
Tapper asked Nadler if he had any problem with Omar's comment about 9/11. He said ""I've had some problems with some of her other remarks but not with that one.""
So he didn't contradict Tapper about whether Pelosi's comment may have been partially aimed at Omar, and although he had ""no problem"" with her 9/11 comments, he made sure to point out he has had a problem with other comments she has made.
And of course, there was last week's dig at Ocasio-Cortez's substance by Speaker Pelosi in an interview with USA Today. ""While there are people who have a large number of Twitter followers, what's important is that we have large numbers of votes on the floor of the House,"" she said.
The hard left turn in the party, of which AOC was at least the harbinger if not the bringer, is not a group turn. It's meeting resistance. And with Bernie Sanders salvo at the Clinton-Podesta industrial complex, it's clearly not going to get better until it first gets worse."

The family posted about the terrible incident on social media, and a GoFundMe was started to raise money for the family during this horrific time of need. It was started by friends of the family after Landen's cousin April Hoffmann, posted an Instagram tribute.
""This is Landen, he is the sweetest kindest 5 year old you will ever meet. His soul is soft and gentle and instantly brings a smile to everybody he meets,"" the fundraiser reads. ""He is full of energy and life and enjoys soccer, playing with friends and family and playing hockey with his brother and sister.""
It relates the family's story. ""He was enjoying a day at the Mall of America with his mom and friend on Friday morning when a stranger maliciously grabbed him and threw him over the 3rd floor balcony for no apparent reason. The family doesn't know him and are completely clueless as to why this monster would target their family with this heinous act of violence.""
The fundraiser was over $400,000 by Sunday morning.
In the press conference about the incident, Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts said Landen is ""receiving care. I think we're just asking for your thoughts and prayers for that child to recover.""
The suspect has been charged with attempted homicide. Police credited a concerned bystander for chasing the suspect, and the Mall security for tracking him to the transportation station where he was apprehended.

WATCH: Jake Tapper grills Eric Swalwell on his anti-gun agenda; he admits Second Amendment not 'absolute right' - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/eric-swalwell-second-amendment-agenda-cnn?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Daily-Newsletter__AM-Final%202019-04-15&utm_term=TheBlaze%20Daily%20AM%20-%20last%20270%20days,"Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, revealed his campaign's main agenda on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, which focuses on gun control.
But just how far does Swalwell want to go? CNN host Jake Tapper asked tough questions to clarify Swalwell's vision.
What did Swalwell say? Last year, Swalwell said that semi-automatic ""military-style assault weapons,"" like the AR-15, should be outlawed. He advocated gun buybacks and criminally prosecuting those who do not comply with stiff gun control measures. Tapper pressed on that point.
""What's the punishment for people who don't hand in their guns, do they go to jail?"" Tapper asked.
""Well Jake, they would,"" Swalwell admitted, ""but I also offer an alternative, which would be to keep them at a hunting club or a shooting range. And the reason I have proposed this is because these weapons are so devastating.""
The California Democrat said ""fear"" is another reason the Second Amendment should be curtailed.
""But it's not just the violence that they've caused, it's the fear, the immeasurable fear that our children live in because they are still on our streets. I want to get rid of that fear, I want to do what Australia did, and New Zealand just recently did. I think this issue just needs some bold leadership to do it,"" Swalwell said.
Noting that most gun owners are law-abiding citizens and that the vast majority of firearm-related deaths in the U.S. are not related to ""military-style semi-automatic"" rifles, Tapper asked: ""Isn't it fair to say you actually do want to take away people's guns?""
Under his vision for America, Swalwell said Americans would retain possession of handguns, long rifles, and shotguns — just not the ""weapons of war."" He said:
You know, keep your pistols, keep your long rifles, keep your shotguns. I want the most dangerous weapons, these weapons of war, out of the hands of the most dangerous people. But when it comes to what else we can do, because I don't even suggest this is all we can do, I also want background checks. So do 73% of NRA members. I want to invest in gang violence prevention programs, especially in our cities.
I want more community oriented policing. My brother is a sheriff's athletic league police officer. He works in tough neighborhoods and helps them get kids out of the streets and into sports. There's a lot that we can do on this issue, but unless it's the number one issue for a president, it's just going to be one that we respond to shooting to shooting. I want to lead on it.
Finally, Swalwell claimed the Second Amendment ""is not an absolute right.""
Swalwell's admission came when Tapper asked if the Second Amendment should be repealed, which former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens advocated last year.
""No. I don't agree, but I think the greatest threat to the Second Amendment is doing nothing,"" Swalwell said. ""And the Second Amendment is not an absolute right.""
""Just like free speech, you can't shout fire in a theater or lie about the products you're selling, you can't own a bazooka, you can't own a tank, you can't own rocket propelled grenades, so we should put some limits in place, and I think the American people are with me,"" he continued. ""I'm no longer intimidated by the NRA. The moms and the kids, they are behind us on this issue, and I think it just takes leadership in Washington.""
In the past, Sevens argued the Second Amendment should be amended to reflect his belief that the founders wrote the amendment in the context of a standing army, not personal defense.
However, last March, the retired justice revealed he wants the Second Amendment repealed altogether ."
Only all-male historically black college in US to admit biological females who identify as males - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/americas-only-all-male-historically-black-college-to-admit-biological-females-who-identify-as-males,"America's only all-male historically black college — Morehouse College — will admit biological females who identify as males starting in the fall 2020, which the Associated Press said is a ""major shift"" for the Atlanta institution where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other famed figures attended.
But biological men who identify as women won't be allowed in, the policy states .
In addition, the policy ""affects students who transition while enrolled at Morehouse. Once admitted, students are expected to continue to self-identify as men throughout their matriculation at Morehouse. If a student transitions from a man to a woman, that student will no longer be eligible to matriculate at Morehouse.""
'Masculine pronouns'
The policy also said that the school ""will continue to use masculine pronouns, the language of brotherhood, and other gendered language that reflects its mission as an institution designed to develop men with disciplined minds who will lead lives of leadership and service.""
What did Morehouse's president have to say?
""I think Morehouse having the courage to speak to issues of masculinity in today's environment is important,"" Morehouse College President David Thomas told the AP. ""For 152 years, the world has, in some way, seen Morehouse as the West Point of black male development.""
Controversial filmmaker Spike Lee and former Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson also are alumni of the school, the outlet said, adding that about two dozen historically black colleges have adopted transgender policies of some form.
What did an LGBT equality group have to say? A spokeswoman for the Human Rights Campaign — the largest LBGT equality group in America — told the AP it's a step in the right direction.
""Young people are incredibly supportive of LGBT equality, including transgender equality,"" Sarah McBride told the outlet. ""Schools are responding in kind. In many ways, our college campuses look like the country we'll have in 10 or 15 years. There are a lot of reasons for hope.""
More from the AP:
Morehouse has had challenges around LGBT issues, most notably the 2002 attack of a 19-year-old student accused of beating a fellow student with a baseball bat who he mistakenly thought was making a sexual advance.
Gregory Love's skull was fractured in the beating. Aaron Price was found guilty of assault and initially sentenced to 10 years in prison.
The incident was widely seen as reflective of a larger and pervasive attitude toward the LGBT community among African Americans.
Thomas acknowledged that historically black colleges and universities — mainly established after the Civil War with the help of religious institutions like the Baptist and Methodist churches — face added challenges in addressing issues of gender and sexuality because of opposition in black churches.
""I can't speak for all HBCUs, but we know in the black church there has largely been silence on this issue,"" Thomas added to the outlet. ""I can imagine there may be people who would say, 'Why would you even raise this?' I say to those people we live in an era now where silence on these issues is actually not helpful. For us, as a school for men, it's important for us to set clear expectations about what that means. That's what we're trying to do with this policy.""
The AP also said Morehouse in 2009 updated its dress code, ""in part to address a handful of students who were wearing women's clothing on campus."" The outlet said Morehouse offered its first LGBT course in 2013 and has a scholars program named for civil and gay rights icon Bayard Rustin."
Scientists create the first-ever 3D-printed heart with human tissue. Experts hope it could lead to personalized organ transplants.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/scientists-create-first-3d-printed-heart,"A team of Israeli scientists on Monday unveiled the first-ever 3D-printed human heart, the Jerusalem Post reported.
Researchers at Tel Aviv University printed the tiny vascularized heart in about three hours using cells and biological material from a patient.
""This is the first time anyone anywhere has successfully engineered and printed an entire heart replete with cells, blood vessels, ventricles and chambers,"" lead researcher Tal Dvir of the TAU School of Molecular Cell Biology and Biotechnology said in a release. ""People have managed to 3D-print the structure of a heart in the past, but not with cells or with blood vessels.
""This heart is made from human cells and patient-specific biological materials. In our process, these materials serve as the bio-inks, substances made of sugars and proteins that can be used for 3-D printing of complex tissue models,"" Dvir said. ""It's completely biocompatible and matches the patient.""
While the 2.5 centimeter-sized heart is too small for a human, the researchers believe it puts them a step closer to creating personalized organs for those in need of a transplant. Personalized organs would be more easily accepted by the body.
""The method we have developed will allow us in the future to print a heart of any size required from the human tissue of patients themselves, meaning that the body will not reject it,"" Dvir said. ""In fact, this method allows us to print any organ that is required for a transplant and we believe that this method opens the door to future technologies, which will make the need for organ donors completely unnecessary.""
How did they do it? The researchers took a fatty tissue biopsy from a patient and separated the cellular and noncellular materials, according to the study .
Then the cells were reprogrammed to become pluripotent stem cells, the extracellular matrix that was processed into a personalized hydrogel that served as the ink for the printer that printed the heart.

What's next? The hearts need to learn how to beat and pump like human hearts before they can be tested on animals and eventually in humans.
Printing a human heart would require billions of cells and could take a full day to print, Dvir said, according to the Post.
Dvir hopes that within the next decade ""there will be organ printers in the finest hospitals around the world, and these procedures will be conducted routinely."""
WATCH: Nancy Pelosi is asked about AOC's influence. Her response might ignite war within Democratic Party.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nancy-pelosi-mocks-aoc-influence,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) mocked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired over the weekend, diminishing the influence that the New York Democrat and other ultra-progressive lawmakers wield in the halls of Congress.
What did Pelosi say? In the interview, CBS News' Lesley Stahl pointed out the Democratic Party, more than ever, has waring factions within its caucus between moderates and progressives, many of whom describe themselves as ""democratic socialists.""
""You have these wings: AOC, and her group on one side—"" Stahl said.
""That's like five people,"" Pelosi interrupted.
""No, the progressive group is more than five,"" Stahl shot back.
""Well, the progressive— I'm a progressive. Yeah,"" Pelosi responded.
SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images
Just prior to the exchange, Pelosi readily dismissed the radical agenda of her party's progressive wing, which those like Ocasio-Cortez are eager to implement, and said that, in the end, Democratic lawmakers will be forced to tow the mainstream line, if for no other reason but the Democratic Party's vitality.
""By and large, whatever orientation they came to Congress with, they know that we have to hold the center,"" Pelosi said.
Later, Pelosi admitted she rejects socialism ""as an economic system,"" despite younger Democrats promoting a socialist agenda. Pelosi said socialism ""is not the view of the Democratic Party.""
Pelosi's interview aired one day after one of the Democratic Party's popular young progressives, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), criticized Democratic leadership for, in her eyes, failing to defend controversial Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) from critics upset that she referred to the 9/11 terrorists as ""some people"" who ""did something.""
Pelosi responded to Tlaib's frustration by directly condemning President Donald Trump, who controversially posted a video to social media that highlighted Omar's remarks. The video spliced together Omar's comments with dramatic scenes from 9/11."
Smiling character on CBS drama promotes punching 'Nazis' as 'enforcement' — since 'some speech is not equal',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/cbs-show-punching-nazis-speech-not-equal,"Last week's episode of ""The Good Fight"" — a CBS All Access drama frequently fueled by left-wing talking points and decided dislike of President Donald Trump — portrays a character punching a Nazi in a bathroom, which was followed by an all-out brawl in the street between Nazis and Nazi-haters .
Amid the melee, the character who threw the bathroom punch — Jay Dispersia, a law firm investigator — speaks directly at the camera and pushes the Antifa -like view that violence is an acceptable way to deal with abhorrent speech. ( Content warning: Profanity ):
Is it alright to hit a Nazi unprovoked? I was always taught to never throw the first punch, never instigate. Defend, but don't attack. But then I saw a video of the white nationalist Richard Spencer being punched in the face during an interview, and I realized Spencer was in a pressed suit, wearing a tie, being interviewed like his opinion mattered — like it should be considered part of the conversation, like neo-Nazism was just one political point of view. And then I realized there's no better way to show some speech is not equal. Some speech requires a more visceral response. It's like Overton's window — that's the term from which ideas are tolerated in public discourse. Well, Overton's window doesn't mean s**t unless it comes with some enforcement. So yeah, this is enforcement. It's time to punch a few Nazis. Interestingly, the episode portrays Democrats and Republicans teaming up to battle the Nazis in the street, which might come across as unusual, given it would seem to serve as a softball scenario for demonizing the GOP — but it seems ""The Good Fight"" doesn't go for the easy plot line in that respect.
'Always feels great to watch Nazis get punched' As you might expect, a couple of reviewers seemingly enjoyed the violence in the episode, which is aptly titled ""The One Where a Nazi Gets Punched.""
Scott Tobias of Vulture said ""sometimes it's really satisfying for a piece of art to deliver on its title, especially if it involves literally beating back the surge of white supremacists in this country"" and called the episode ""like that first deep breath of fresh mountain air — crisp and pure and totally invigorating. Always feels great to watch Nazis get punched.""
Chancellor Egard of EW suggested the episode title ""might make you hopeful"" and noted the ""cathartic, funny, theatrical, and unsettling brawl.""
Pushback
Rob Dreher of the American Conservative makes no bones about disliking neo-Nazis and the alt-right, but warned that ""a scripted network television show aired with approval a statement encouraging street violence against [Spencer], and against those who agree with him, in an effort to silence political speech.""
More from Dreher:
Having taken the position that ""some speech is not equal,"" and that there is ""no better way"" to demonstrate that than to beat up unpopular speakers, what is the limiting principle, CBS? What would you, CBS, say to some right-wing person who attacked Rep. Ilhan Omar over her words, you having promoted the point of view that violence is the best way to set the limits on free speech?
I'm old enough to remember when liberals defended the right of racist deplorables to gather peaceably , because by so doing, liberals were defending important liberal principles enshrined in the First Amendment. I do not enjoy seeing peaceful American citizens, however disgusting their words and beliefs, being physically assaulted to punish them for their words, or to deter them from speaking — and you shouldn't either. Not even Richard Spencer. CBS is not a bit player. It's a Hollywood mainstay — and for the sake of being edgy, woke, and of-the-moment, it has violated an important taboo in liberal democracy. CBS is the Antifa network. On that note A 1981 TV movie based on the real-life controversy over Nazis who wanted to march in Skokie, Illinois — to the horror of Jewish people in the area — culminated with a thought-provoking perspective from a Jewish representative of the ACLU. He argued to the angry community that the Nazis should be allowed to march as a way of protecting the rights of Jewish people to maintain the right to speak out against them. In other words, the answer to hate speech is more speech, not shutting speech down.
Ironically, CBS is the network that aired ""Skokie."" Check the scene:

"Pete Buttigieg officially announces 2020 bid in stirring speech, brings in $1 million in fundraising in the hours following announcement",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pete-buttigieg-officially-announces-2020-bid,"South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg formally announced his presidential bid Sunday night in South Bend, Indiana.
What are the details?
In a highly attended and stirring speech, Buttigieg — who initially appeared alongside his husband, Chasten — told the crowd that the ""horror show"" in Washington, D.C., has to end.
""My name is Pete Buttigieg,"" he told the gathered crowd. ""They call me 'Mayor Pete.' I am a proud son of South Bend, Indiana, and I am running for president of the United States.""
""The horror show in Washington,"" the 37-year-old added, ""is mesmerizing, all-consuming. But starting today, we are going to change the channel.""
Buttigieg touted his experience as South Bend's mayor as well as his time as a combat soldier in Afghanistan during the announcement and delivered the remarks at Studebaker Building 84.
""I ran for mayor in 2011 knowing that nothing like Studebaker would ever come back,"" he admitted. ""But believing that we would, our city would, if we had the courage to reimagine our future. And now, I can confidently say that South Bend is back.""
""That's why I'm here today,"" he added. ""To tell a different story than 'make America great again,' because there is a myth being sold to industrial and rural communities: the myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back.""
""It comes from people who think the only way to reach communities like ours is through resentment and nostalgia, selling an impossible promise of returning to a bygone era that was never as great as advertised to begin with,"" Buttigieg explained. ""The problem is, they're telling us to look for greatness in all the wrong places.""
The 37-year-old told the audience that he is aware of the ""audacity"" of running as a ""Midwestern millennial mayor.""
""More than a little bold ... to seek the highest office in the land,"" he added, arguing that America is ripe for a chance.
""If America today feels like a confusing place to be, it's because we're on one of those blank pages in between chapters,"" he explained. ""Change is coming, ready or not. The question of our time is whether families and workers will be defeated by the changes beneath us, or whether we will master them and make them work toward a better everyday life for us all.""
Buttigieg pointed to climate change, immigration, and freedom as some of his primary concerns as a presidential candidate. He also suggested that the Electoral College be abolished.
""We can't say it's much of a democracy when twice in my lifetime, the Electoral College has overruled the American people,"" he said, pointing to the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections.
""Let's make it easier to register and to vote,"" Buttigieg said. ""Let's make our districts fairer, our courts less political, our structurer more inclusive, and yes — let's pick our president by counting up all the ballots and giving it to the woman or man who got the most votes.""
What else do we know about him? Buttigieg's husband of one year, Chasten, is a school teacher and has joined him on the campaign trail across the country.
Buttigieg is a Rhodes Scholar and a graduate of Harvard and Oxford universities, and speaks seven foreign languages including Arabic, Dari, French, Italian, Maltese, Norwegian, and Spanish. He was raised Catholic, but is now Episcopalian.
If elected, Buttigieg would be the first U.S. mayor to ascend straight to the presidency, and would be the youngest man to ever be president at the age of 39.
Buttigieg's campaign has brought in more than $7 million in January, February, and March — which is more than his fellow Democratic contenders Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) — and raised over $1 million in the hours following his Sunday announcement.
In April, Buttigieg polled third in Iowa and New Hampshire, behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced a bid for presidency.

President Trump's plan to ship migrants to sanctuary cities could backfire. Here's how.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-immigration-plan-sanctuary-cities-backfire,"The Trump administration was heavily criticized last week after the Washington Post revealed top White House aides have floated a policy that would ship illegal immigrants to so-called ""sanctuary cities"" while U.S. authorities process their asylum requests.
On Friday, President Donald Trump confirmed he is considering enacting the policy, saying over the weekend he has the ""absolute right"" to do so . Meanwhile, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley revealed on Fox News Saturday the White House is actively discussing the policy with officials at Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
But the policy could have unintended blowback for the Trump administration, working against its immigration agenda instead of advancing it.
 Though details about the policy are scarce, a new report from the Associated Press highlights how the policy would likely backfire on the White House by helping more illegal immigrants receive the resources they need to remain in the U.S. longer and legally.
In fact, if the president were to enact the policy, most migrants shipped to sanctuary cities, which are overwhelmingly progressive metropolises, would not fear deportation or law enforcement. Instead, their biggest concern would likely be the high cost-of-living associated with most cities.
The AP spoke to immigrant Wilson Romero, who came to the U.S. illegally from Honduras last year. He lives with his mother in San Jose, California, and his 7-year-old daughter attends public school.
More from the AP:
Romero says he goes about daily errands in public without worry of discrimination. His daughter has made friends and has playdates with the children of Mexican American families. It's a far cry from his hometown in the violence-plagued outskirts of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, that he fled after his brother-in-law was killed.
To him, the biggest problem with being in the Bay Area is the high cost of living. The former textile factory worker relies on his mother's income from waitressing for food and clothing, and he's started thinking about asking legal permission to move to North Carolina, where an uncle resides and says it's cheaper to live and work. Indeed, most often, the best resources for immigrants, including non-profit organizations that provide effective legal services, are located in ""sanctuary cities,"" where large populations of illegal immigrants already live.
Will the president implement the policy? Although White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reiterated Sunday the policy is one of many the administration is currently considering to alleviate stress at the border, she said the plan is not the administration's ""first option.""
Meanwhile, many logistical concerns surround the policy. Who will pay to transport the migrants to sanctuary cities? How would the migrants be stopped from leaving the cities and settling in other areas? As the AP noted, migrants are conditionally required to provide authorities with an address before they are released from custody, but what, then, is the point of sending them to sanctuary cities if they will remain in custody?
It's clear the policy, at least right now, is more about politicking than providing a genuine solution to the border crisis."
New Jersey legalizes physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/nj-approves-assisted-suicide-for-terminally-ill-patients,"New Jersey has now legalized physician assisted suicide for terminally ill patients.
Here's what we know The bill will go into effect on August 1. It requires a psychiatrist or psychologist to verify that the patient is of sound enough mind to know what they are agreeing to do before the procedure can be carried out. Two separate doctors will also have to confirm that the patient has less than six months to live, and will have to discuss other options with the patient. Ultimately, patients who choose to end their own lives will have to administer the drugs on their own after getting a prescription.
In a statement from a Friday press release , New Jersey governor Phil Murphy (D) said ""Allowing residents with terminal illnesses to make end-of-life choices for themselves is the right thing to do. By signing this bill today, we are providing terminally ill patients and their families with the humanity, dignity, and respect that they so richly deserve at the most difficult times any of us will face. I commend Assemblyman Burzichelli for steering us down this long, difficult road, and thank the Legislature for its courage in tackling this challenging issue.""
But some worry that the bill, which only passed each chamber of the New Jersey state legislature by a single vote , will have serious and negative repercussions.
""The bill has lasting ramifications and lots of loopholes,"" Republican Sen. Robert Singer said, according to CNN . ""We are so concerned about opioids, and not trusting doctors with opioids. But now we are willing to trust them with this.""
California, Colorado, Hawaii, Montana, Oregon, Vermont, Washington state, and Washington D.C. already allow physician assisted suicide.
Murphy acknowledged that his support for this bill runs contrary to his faith Murphy also noted in a longer statement from Friday that this law would allow something directly forbidden by the faith he espouses.
As a lifelong, practicing Catholic, I acknowledge that I have personally grappled with my position on this issue. My faith has informed and enhanced many of my most deeply held progressive values. Indeed, it has influenced my perspectives on issues involving social justice, social welfare, and even those topics traditionally regarded as strictly economic, such as the minimum wage. On this issue, I am torn between certain principles of my faith and my compassion for those who suffer unnecessary, and often intolerable, pain at the end of their lives. The Catholic Church considers it a mortal sin to participate in assisted suicide, either as a patient or as a medical professional. According to the church's Second Vatican Council , ""whatever is opposed to life itself, such as any type of murder, genocide, abortion, euthanasia or wilful self-destruction....poison human society, but they do more harm to those who practice them than those who suffer from the injury. Moreover, they are supreme dishonor to the Creator.""
Murphy justified this disparity between the black and white guidelines of the church he professes and the law he signed by saying ""[a]fter careful consideration, internal reflection, and prayer, I have concluded that, while my faith may lead me to a particular decision for myself, as a public official I cannot deny this alternative to those who may reach a different conclusion."""

What are the details? On Sunday, the singer tweeted, ""I Understand Helping struggling Immigrants, but MY CITY (Los Angeles) ISNT TAKING CARE OF ITS OWN. WHAT ABOUT THE 50,000+ Citizens WHO LIVE ON THE STREETS. PPL WHO LIVE BELOW POVERTY LINE, & HUNGRY? If My State Can't Take Care of Its Own (Many Are VETS) How Can it Take Care of More""
According to Fox News , Los Angeles has the second-highest homeless population in the country, next to New York City, and California has more homeless veterans than any other state.
Cher's argument came as a follow-up to a fit she threw Friday over President Donald Trump's confirmation that his administration was ""giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only.""
President Trump accused sanctuary cities — particularly in California, where there is a state law protecting such policies — of balking at the prospect of having illegal immigrants released into their safe harbors by the administration.
Anything else? Several Twitter users pointed out Cher's apparent change in heart from 2017, when she urged Americans to provide sanctuary to illegal immigrants ""in their home and protect them,"" promising she ""will do the same.""
Others took the opportunity to joke about Cher's new-found conservative stance on the issue of immigration, with Donald Trump Jr. saying on Instagram, ""Welcome to the Republican Party Cher!"""
75-year-old Florida man attacked and killed by a dangerous bird he kept as a pet,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/75-year-old-man-attacked-and-killed-by-giant-bird-in-florida,"A 75-year-old Florida man was attacked and killed by a giant exotic bird called a cassowary that the man kept on his property in Alachua.
The bird reportedly attacked its victim, Marvin Hajos, after he tripped and fell Friday at about 10 a.m., the Gainesville Sun reported. Cassowaries are considered by some to be the world's most dangerous bird.
""My understanding is that the gentleman was in the vicinity of the bird and at some point fell. When he fell, he was attacked,"" Deputy Chief Jeff Taylor of the Alachua County Fire Rescue Department told the newspaper.
First responders transported Hajos to a local hospital where he died.
Authorities believe the man was possibly breeding the flightless birds on his farm, WOFL-TV reported. At least two cassowaries were found on the property.
What is a cassowary? Cassowaries typically live in the rainforest in New Guinea and some parts of Australia. The bird can grow up to 5.6 feet tall and weighs as much as 167 pounds, according to the San Diego Zoo website .
Each 3-toed foot on a cassowary features a dagger-like claw that is about 4 inches long. It can slice open its predators with a swift kick, according to the San Diego Zoo website.
Mike Taylor of the Jacksonville Zoo told WOFL the birds are also territorial and protective of their young.
""They are definitely capable of doing some damage,"" Taylor added.
Cassowaries have powerful legs and can run up to 31 mph through dense underbrush in the rainforest. The birds also have the ability to jump nearly 7 feet straight up in the air and they are excellent swimmers.

Breaking: The Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris is engulfed in flames (VIDEO),www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-breaking-the-notre-dame-cathedral-in-paris-is-engulfed-in-flames-video,"The Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France caught on fire Monday. The extent of the damage is not known at this point, but videos taken from bystanders show substantial flames and large plumes of smoke rising from the roof of the building.
Here's what we know Construction on the historic Catholic church started in 1163 and the edifice was slowly completed over the next couple centuries. Recently, it had been undergoing some much-needed restoration work. Just a few days prior to this, 16 bronze statues from the roof of the cathedral were removed and transported to be restored.
The BBC reported that fire fighters in Paris believe that the fire could be somehow linked to this work. Reuters , citing France 2 television, reported that authorities believe it was an accident.
The spire of the cathedral has fallen, and France 24 reported that the ""roof has entirely collapsed"" as well.
Reuters reported that no one has been injured in the blaze. This is Holy Week for Catholics, so Catholic churches would typically have more activity than usual, particularly iconic ones like Notre Dame, in addition to the usual tourist activity.
According to Axios, Notre Dame spokesperson Andrew Finot has told the media ""Everything is burning, nothing will remain from the frame.""
The fire has also spread to one of the cathedral's square towers .

High school boys raid girls' bathroom during protest of transgender's use of boys' room. Girl gets expelled for fighting back.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/boys-raid-girls-bathroom-girl-fights-back-gets-expelled,"A group of boys at North Pole High School in Alaska allegedly tried to enter the girls' bathroom earlier this month out of protest after a transgender male used the boys' room. Eight students were disciplined in connection with the incident, including a girl who was reportedly expelled for kicking one of the young men in the crotch during the dust-up.
 According to the school's investigation, a transgender student who was transitioning from female to male took a selfie from the boys' bathroom and uploaded it to Snapchat, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported. Fairbanks North Star Borough School District Superintendent Karen Gaborik said a group of boys ""were upset about the public nature of the post and how that played out.""
A social media post purportedly from one of the boys rallied, ""tomorrow identify as a women [sic] and use the women's bathroom if you want this s**t to end, my foster dad called the school and they said they [can't] do anything because she identify as men [sic].""
In response, seven boys decided to ""identify as female"" and enter the girls' bathroom to take a selfie of their own. But when they entered, a female student in the restroom reacted by giving one of the protestors a knee to the groin. The boy on the receiving end of the kick was encouraged to seek medical treatment, but the extent of his injuries — if any — is unclear.
The girl's family told the Washington Post she has been expelled from school for using ""excessive force,"" while her sister claimed on Twitter that the boy ""was blocking her in the womens [sic] bathroom.""
Meanwhile, Gaborik confirmed that all the boys who took part were also disciplined for ""attempting to enter the girls' bathroom.""
The transgender student was not present during the incident.
How are people responding? Alaska state Rep. Tammie Wilson (R) spoke out in defense of the girl, saying the student was merely defending herself. ""Was she supposed to not protect herself?"" the lawmaker asked the Daily News-Miner . ""She was where she belonged. They were not.""
The Post noted that feminist writer Mikki Kendall also questioned why the girl was disciplined, saying ""after all the bulls**t bathroom panic bills about trans kids, when a group of cis boys actually harass girls in a bathroom the girls are punished for defending themselves?"""
Pelosi: Socialism 'is not the view of the Democratic Party',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-socialism-and-the-democratic-party,"Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Sunday that ""socialism as an economic system"" was ""not the view of the Democratic Party.""
What happened? During an interview on CBS's "" 60 Minutes ,"" correspondent Leslie Stahl asked Pelosi about some of the ideas promoted by the ""self-described socialists"" on the ""left flank"" of the party. Pelosi said that despite the ""orientation they came to Congress with"" even the socialist members know that the party has to ""hold the center"" and ""go down the mainstream.""
Pelosi also defended the Affordable Care Act — a.k.a. Obamacare — saying that it was better than the 'Medicare for All' plan promoted by some of the more left-leaning members of her own party.
""Well, Medicare for All, it's not only being pushed by some members of your caucus,"" Stahl noted, ""but also by some of the presidential candidates, and it is allowing the president to say you're all socialists.""
Stahl was referring to Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Sen. Kamala Harris (Calif.), Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), and former-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, who have all come out in support of Medicare for All. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), and former-Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) have all supported expanding Medicare beyond the Affordable Care Act, but haven't fully embraced Medicare for All.
Pelosi responded:
Do you know that when we did — when Medicare was done by the Congress at the time, under Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan, said, 'Medicare will lead us to a socialist dictatorship.' This is an ongoing theme of the Republicans. However, I do reject socialism as an economic system. If people have that view, that's their view. That is not the view of the Democratic Party. "
40-year-old man sues parents after they trashed his nearly $30K porn collection,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-sues-parent-for-destroying-porn-collection,"A Grand Haven, Michigan, man is suing his mother and father for throwing away his prized pornography collection valued at approximately $29,000.
What are the details? In his lawsuit, 40-year-old ""Charlie"" said that the collection was no ordinary collection.
His parents, however, have responded to the suit and said that they threw away the collection for a very good reason.
Charlie moved back to his parents' home in Grand Haven in 2016 after a divorce. His parents didn't make him pay rent — he did chores to chip in at the household instead.
Charlie was asked to leave the residence just 10 months later after police visited the house for what Fox News referred to as a ""domestic situation."" In 2017, his parents purportedly delivered some of his personal effects to his new residence. According to Charlie, 14 boxes full of pornography and sex toys were absent from his inventory of personal belongings.
When asked about the boxes, Charlie's said they'd disposed of the lurid collection. Angered, Charlie phoned the sheriff's department and said that his parents destroyed the collection worth approximately $29,000. The prosecutor's office, however, declined to press charges in the matter.
According to WXMI-TV , Charlie sent his father an email about the matter. Charlie wrote, ""If you had a problem with my belongings, you should have stated that at the time and I would have gone elsewhere. Instead, you choose to keep quiet and behave vindictively.""
Charlie's father responded in a kind manner.
""Believe it or not, one reason for why I destroyed your porn was for your own mental and emotional heath [sic]. I would have done the same if I had found a kilo of crack cocaine,"" his father wrote. ""Someday, I hope you will understand.""
""I did you a big favor by getting rid of all this stuff,"" Charlie's father added .
In April, Charlie filed a suit against his parents, seeking nearly $87,000 in damages.
Anything else? Fox News reported that Charlie's problem goes decades.
Fox's David Aaro wrote, ""According to his father, Charlie's addiction turned into a small porn business during his high school and college days.""
""He was reportedly kicked out of high school and college for selling pornography to other students,"" Aaro wrote. ""His son was warned that if he ever found porn in his house again, he would destroy it."""
Prosecutors drop all charges against woman who reportedly assaulted Kellyanne Conway - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/prosecutors-drop-all-charges-against-woman-who-reportedly-assaulted-kellyanne-conway,"A Maryland state attorney's office announced on Monday that it dropped all charges against a woman who reportedly attacked Kellyanne Conway.
According to CNN , a spokesperson for the county said that the woman apologized for her behavior.
What's a brief history on the attack? The woman — later identified as 63-year-old Mary Elizabeth Inabinett — purportedly attacked Conway when the White House aide was visiting a restaurant in 2018 with her daughter.
In an interview with CNN , Conway revealed that she and her daughter were visiting a restaurant when a woman approached her.
Conway, 63, said that the woman approached Conway and her daughter and began ""screaming her head off."" According to Conway, Inabinett placed her hands on Conway and began shaking her.
""Somebody was grabbing me from behind, grabbing my arms, and was shaking me to the point where I felt maybe somebody was hugging me,"" Conway told the outlet, noting that Inabinett was simply ""out of control.""
However, investigators reviewed video of the incident and spoke with 10 eyewitnesses at the scene, and determined that the only physical contact that occurred was that Inabinett grabbed Conway's elbow ""to get attention,"" which they described as ""de minimis touching.""
According to Conway, ""her whole face was terror and anger. She was right here, and my daughter was right there. She ought to pay for that.""
William Alden McDaniel Jr., an attorney for Inabinett, said that his client would not plead guilty.
""Ms. Inabinett saw Kellyanne Conway, a public figure, in a public place, and exercised her First Amendment rights to express her personal opinions,"" McDaniel said. ""She did not assault Ms. Conway. The facts at the trial will show this to be true, and show Ms. Conway's account to be false.""
You can read more about the incident here .
So what's happening now? Ramon Korionoff, a spokesperson for the Montgomery County state's attorney's office revealed that charges were dropped.
""It is the best resolution for all parties concerned,"" Korionoff said in a statement. ""The defendant in this matter did apologize to the victim in this matter and did so in a recent letter.""
According to CNN, ""a person familiar with the case said it was not uncommon for the state's attorney to act as a mediator.""
""The defendant realizes she was wrong to interrupt a little girl's birthday party,"" the person told the outlet.
The unnamed person added, ""Everybody realized let's just not waste the court's resources on case like this.""
The unnamed source called the action ""de minimis touching,"" which the source said means that the incident was minor.
Conway herself has not issued a statement on the matter at the time of this writing."
"BBC poll: Fewer than half of UK Christians believe Jesus died, rose again for forgiveness of their sins",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/bbc-poll-less-than-half-of-christians-believe-easter-story,"With Holy Week upon us, a new BBC poll found that fewer than half of Christians in the U.K. — 46 percent — believe Jesus died and rose again for the forgiveness of their sins .
A BBC Radio program that aired Sunday said the online poll was taken in early March and surveyed more than 2,000 British adults. The host said the results raise the question: ""How much of the traditional Easter story is actually optional for Christians?""
'It just doesn't make sense' The program aired commentary from Dave Tomlinson — an Anglican priest and author of ""How to Be a Bad Christian ... and a Better Human Being"" — who said the reason why it appears fewer people believe the traditional Easter story as the Bible presents it is because ""it just doesn't make sense.""
""I think it makes God out to be some kind of weird monster, really,"" Tomlinson said, adding that he sees some Evangelicals also questioning the Easter story and Christ's atonement for our sins.
But wait The program added that, according to poll, 82 percent of Christians who attend worship services at least once a month overwhelmingly agree that the Easter story is true.
So it would seem the numbers depend greatly on how individuals define themselves: Respondents can say they identify as Christians, insist they don't believe Christ died and rose from the dead for the forgiveness of their sins — but it appears most of them don't identify as Christians enough to attend church at least once a month.
The BBC program also featured a pair of guests who debated the issue. The bulk of the content can be heard after the 34-minute mark .
Pushback
Among the replies to the BBC tweet about the new poll's findings were those who questioned the Christian faith of those who don't believe the traditional Easter story:
""Um.... then they are not Christians."" ""How can they say they're Christian if they don't believe in the main part of the story?"" ""This makes them not Christians."" But one commenter countered, ""What do you call someone who lives their life in the way Jesus did (loving everyone, fighting injustice, following the Sermon on the Mount), but who doesn't think Jesus was/is God and didn't rise again after his death?""
That was met with following reply: ""Tragic. Because if you're living the way Jesus did, it's impossible that He wouldn't have inspired your soul to search for Him and understand that being holy is infinitely more than just being nice and good. That means you've turned down His invite for you to really follow Him.""
Anything else?
A similar poll was taken two years ago , and a quarter of survey respondents who identify as Christians said they don't believe in Christ's resurrection — but 57% of ""active Christians"" (again, those who attend church at least once a month) believe the resurrection took place.
And believe it not, that 2017 BBC poll said 9% of non-religious people believe in the Resurrection — and 1% of them say they believe it literally."
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez quit Facebook because she says social media is a ‘public health risk’,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-quits-facebook-because-social-media-is-a-public-health-risk,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) says that she's done with Facebook for the sake of her own mental health.
Calling the platform and other social media ""a public health risk,"" the freshman congresswoman advises that everybody else follow suit and be mindful of how social media impacts them.
What are the details? During a Sunday appearance on Yahoo podcast ""Skullduggery,"" Ocasio-Cortez, 29, said that too much time spent on social media can be damaging to one's psyche.
""I personally gave up Facebook, which was kind of a big deal because I started my campaign on Facebook,"" she admitted. ""And Facebook was my primary digital organizing tool for a very long time. I gave up on it.""
She added, ""Social media poses a public health risk to everybody.""
Ocasio-Cortez went on to point out the myriad effects of social media on people young and old.
""There are amplified impacts for young people, particularly children under the age of 3, with screen time,"" she said. ""But I think it has a lot of effects on older people. I think it has effects on everybody. Increased isolation, depression, anxiety, addiction, escapism.""
""I've started to kind of impose little rules on myself,"" she admitted. ""Like, every once in awhile, you'll see me hop on Twitter on the weekends, but for the most part, I take consumption of content, when it comes to consumption and reading, I take the weekends off. And so I'm not, like, scrolling through trying to read everything online that journalists are writing on weekends. I try to do that during the workweek.""
Elsewhere in the podcast, Ocasio-Cortez said that she does still compose her own tweets and Instagram and attempts to engage on social media ""both as a person with a larger audience, but also as an individual user of these platforms.""
The Washington Post points out that Ocasio-Cortez no longer uses the platform personally, but notes that her campaign still uses the platform for ad purposes.

Cory Booker harassed by 'Justice for Palestine' protestors during campaign tour kickoff,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/justice-for-palestine-protestors-harass-cory-booker,"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) launched what he calls a ""Justice for All"" campaign tour over the weekend, but his kickoff speech was interrupted by protestors shouting ""Justice for Palestine.""
What are the details? Booker was speaking to a crowd in his adopted hometown of Newark on Saturday, when activists began shouting ""Justice for Palestine"" and ""from Palestine to Mexico, borders have to go."" The 2020 hopeful ignored the distraction while supporters began a counter-chant of ""Cor-y, Cor-y.""
Most of the approximately one dozen interlopers were shuffled out of the venue after their initial disruption, but a few stayed behind and continued to antagonize Booker while he met with supporters after the rally, Yahoo News reported.
One protestor, Wajeeh Abushawish, mocked Booker's tour slogan speaking with Yahoo, telling the outlet, ""You say 'Justice for All' and he named, you know, clean water, housing, affordable health care, freedom but he doesn't ... talk about Palestine. They're struggling just as much as us here — even more.""
Another activist claimed, ""Booker actively supports the oppression of Palestine.""
Yahoo reported all three of the protestors who spoke with the outlet declared their support for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, with Abushawish yelling, ""Bernie 2020!""
Anything else? According to NJ.com , Booker is the only Democratic presidential candidate to co-sponsor new legislation called the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, which would oppose the ""Palestinian-led boycott, divestiture and sanctions movement, better known as BDS, which does not support Israel's right to exist.""
Booker also attended the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's conference last month, Fox News reported, in spite of a warning from liberal group MoveOn.org calling on Democrats to boycott the AIPAC event entirely."
Alyssa Milano asks social media users to share their 'personal abortion' stories to show 'importance of bodily autonomy',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/alyssa-milano-asks-social-media-users-to-share-their-personal-abortion-stories-to-show-importance-of-bodily-autonomy,"Actress and activist Alyssa Milano is asking women to share their ""personal abortion"" stories for her to broadcast on her new weekly podcast, ""Sorry Not Sorry.""
What are the details? In a Friday tweet, Milano wrote, ""If you'd like to share your personal abortion story on my podcast to help shine a light on the importance of bodily autonomy, please record story on your voice memo app and email it to below address.""
""If you'd like to remain anonymous please say so in your email,"" she added.
According to Deadline , Milano's latest project is set for a spring release.
The outlet reported that Milano's podcast will address ""social, political, and cultural issues from the perspective of unapologetic guests.""
""The podcast will focus on shaping narratives and changing hearts and minds to bridge the ideologies of a divided nation,"" the Deadline's report added.
Some of those ""unapologetic guests"" include former Vice President Joe Biden, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, and more.
""I'm not sorry for using my voice. I'm not sorry for making people uncomfortable while being the voice for those who have been silenced,"" Milano said. ""I am grateful for this opportunity to instigate empathy and conversation while highlighting the people leading change by service throughout our great country.""
What else? In March, Milano was one of the celebrities instrumental in trying to strongarm Virginia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp into vetoing a bill on abortion.
The ""heartbeat bill,"" Georgia H.B. 481, would prohibit the majority of abortions as early as six weeks from conception. Current Georgia state law permits abortions up to 20 weeks. Abortions after six weeks would be permitted in cases such as incest, physical emergency, rape, and any pregnancies considered ""medically futile.""
Earlier in April, the Georgia House of Representatives approved the bill by a vote of 92 to 78. The bill awaits Republican Gov. Brian Kemp's signature. The governor has said that he will sign the bill into law.
""Georgia values life,"" Kemp said of the bill. ""We stand up for the innocent and speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. The Legislature's bold action reaffirms our priorities and who we are as a state.""
Milano and her Hollywood cronies promised to withdraw production work from the state if Kemp signed the bill into law, and circulated an open letter to that effect.

Embattled Kim Foxx asks Cook County inspector general to review how her office handled Jussie Smollett case,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/chicago-mayor-elect-on-jussie-smollett-case-this-doesnt-rank-as-a-matter-of-any-importance-to-me,"Embattled Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx asked the county's inspector general to review how her office handled the case against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett case, WLS-TV reported .
Foxx's office last month dropped all 16 of Smollett's charges imposed by a grand jury after police accused him of staging a racist, homophobic attack against himself in January.
Image source: Chicago Police Department
Mayor Rahm Emanuel last month angrily blasted the decision to drop all charges against Smollett and called it ""not on the level."" In addition, associations from every police department in Cook County announced "" no confidence "" in Foxx, and the Illinois Prosecutors Bar Association accused her of making ""repeated misleading and deceptive statements to the public"" and having ""failed in her most fundamental ethical obligations to the public.""
It was widely reported that Foxx recused herself from the Smollett case after rumblings that she interfered in the investigation — but then it came to light that she never actually recused herself at all .
'Full cooperation'
Foxx in a statement Friday said she pledges her ""full cooperation,"" welcomes Inspector General Patrick Blanchard's investigation, and added that ""ensuring that I and my office have the community's trust and confidence is paramount to me,"" WLS reported.
Former prosecutor Bob Milan — who once supervised Blanchard when they worked at the State's Attorney's Office — added to the station that the review ""could prevent a special prosecutor from being appointed.""
""He's a career Cook County prosecutor before he became the inspector general,"" Milan also told WLS. ""Very well respected, very smart, and he's a man of integrity.""
Anything else? Foxx wondered whether racism and sexism is behind criticism she's been receiving.
""As someone who has lived in this city, who came up in the projects of this city to serve as the first African American woman in this role, it is disheartening to me, that when we get in these positions somehow the goalposts change,"" she said during an event hosted by the Rev. Jesse Jackson two weekends ago.
Prosecutors cited Smollett's community service for Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH coalition , as well as his $10,000 bond forfeiture, as factors in the dropped-charges decision.
In stark contrast to Emanuel, Chicago Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot — the first black woman and openly gay candidate elected to the city's office — said the Smollett case ""doesn't rank as a matter of any importance to me.""
""We've got a lot of things on our plate, a lot of pressing issues that are truly affecting people's lives,"" she told WLS.
Emanuel promised to send a bill to Smollett for what it cost Chicago to investigate his claims — and now the city is suing him after he missed a deadline earlier this month to pay the $130,000 charge.
Smollett also claimed his attackers yelled ""this is MAGA country"" — a reference to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" 2016 campaign slogan — put a noose around his neck, and poured a substance that smelled like bleach on him while beating him in the street around 2 a.m. in near zero temperatures. Smollett denied that he orchestrated a hoax.

Desperate to save as much of the building as they could, firefighters in Paris reportedly climbed up the scaffolding surrounding the cathedral while the fire was still burning.
Here's what we know In an image tweeted by British journalist Henry Jones, firefighters can be seen climbing up the scaffolding next to the building. This scaffolding was put in place as part of a $6.8 million restoration project that was ongoing at the time. French authorities suspect that the fire was somehow started due to this restoration work.
Both the spire and roof of the cathedral have completely collapsed, and the fire has spread to one of the building's square towers.
Construction on the cathedral began more than eight centuries ago.
Video from the fire shows firefighters spraying a hose from halfway up the scaffolding.
Canada's CBC News reported that firefighters were also trying to salvage some of the cathedral's priceless works of art. According to CNN , 400 firefighters are involved in trying to combat this disaster."
California just took a big step toward banning hotel toiletries,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/natural-resources-committee-advances-california-bill-that-would-ban-tiny-toiletries-from-hotels,"In a few years, those tiny bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and other toiletries provided by hotels could become a thing of the past in the state of California.
The Natural Resources committee recently advanced Assembly Bill 1162 , which would ban ""lodging establishments"" from offering small plastic bottles of ""personal care products"" to guests. The committee voted 6-3, with two members abstaining, to move the measure forward.
Democratic Assemblymen Ash Kalra and Mark Stone introduced the bill aimed at reducing the amount of plastic in the environment.
""The amount of plastic produced is increasing exponentially, and we must consider all options to reduce this pollution from entering our waste streams,"" Kalra said, according to KSWB-TV . ""While it may not appear to be a problem on an individual level, small plastic bottles that are less than 12-ounces represent a sizeable amount of waste collectively that the state must address.""
What are the details? The ban would prohibit hotels, motels, vacation rentals, and resorts from distributing toiletries in plastic containers 12-ounces or smaller in guest rooms.
Local agencies would inspect properties for compliance.
Violators would receive a written warning for the first violation. After that, the property could face a $500 fine for each subsequent offense, not to exceed $2,000 a year, according to the bill's text.
Hospitals, nursing homes, jails, homeless shelters, and hosted rentals, among others, would not be subject to the ban.
If passed, the ban would take effect Jan. 1, 2023.
What else? Last year, the Santa Cruz Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance that banned lodging establishments from providing toiletries in small plastic bottles. The measure will go into effect Dec. 31, 2020."

On Monday's radio program, Glenn Beck, Pat Gray, and Stu Burguiere discussed President Trump's plan to place illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities, and whether he could actually carry it out. They also talked about the glaring double standards of those on the left, as former sanctuary state advocates are suddenly walking back their welcoming attitudes toward illegal immigrants.
""Here's the thing, this sounds like a bit. This sounds like something we would have said 15 years ago and there was no chance of it happening. I think this president will do it,"" Glenn said.

"White House reportedly considering travel restrictions for more countries, based on visa overstays",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-house-travel-restrictions-visa-overstays,"The Trump administration is reportedly considering restricting travel from countries whose citizens have a high rate of overstaying their visas while in the United States.
Here's what we know This potential move was first reported by the Wall Street Journal , and later confirmed by Politico , which spoke to an official from the Department of Homeland Security. Politico's source said that a final decision and announcement could come as soon as this week.
According to a report from the Department of Homeland Security , 701,900 non-immigrants from other countries overstayed their visas in the United States during fiscal year 2017.
The countries with the highest overstay rates include several in Africa, namely Angola (10.06 percent), Burkina Faso (14.51 percent), Burundi (13.09 percent), Chad (24.39 percent), Djibouti (42.30 percent), Eritrea (26.54 percent), the Gambia (12.36 percent), Liberia (20.74 percent), Sierra Leone (12.66 percent), South Sudan (14.01 percent), and Sudan (13.70 percent), as well as some non-African countries including Bhutan (14.21 percent), Laos (11.28 percent), and the Solomon Islands (30.12 percent). Politico suggested that these countries could be targeted for immigration restrictions because of President Donald Trump's reported description of African nations as ""s**thole countries.""
Notably, some of these countries have a high rate, but a comparatively low number of total visa holders entering the United States. For example at 30.12 percent the Solomon Islands (which are near Papua New Guinea) have one of the highest rates of people overstaying their visas, but that percentage represents only 103 people.
A White House spokesman told the Wall Street Journal that the administration was prioritizing visa overstays. During the 2016 campaign , Trump had promised to address this issue, saying that if the U.S. didn't ""enforce visa expiration dates, then we have an open border — it's as simple as that.""
Politico , citing a 2006 Pew Research Center study , noted that as many as 45 percent of all illegal immigrants in the United States are believed to have entered legally on a visa and then never left, a number ranging from 4.5 million to 6 million."

Retired Master Sgt. Cedric King said that he hopes his story inspires others who face challenges in their lives.
""I want people in Boston to understand that if I can do this, then they can do any challenge they have in front of them,"" he told WBZ over the weekend.
What's the story? In 2012, King lost both of his legs after he stepped on an improvised explosive device during his deployment to Afghanistan.
Less than two years later, he competed for the first time in the Boston Marathon.
""Even though I was in a position where I lost my legs, it did not give me an excuse not to keep fighting,"" King said.
He's competed in the 26.2-mile race on his prosthetic legs and he's done it in a wheelchair.
This year, King competed in the handcycle race.
""The preparation for this year has been a little tough,"" King said. ""Finishing it on all three platforms is fantastic. It gives me the ability to know that if I can do this on three different platforms — prosthetics, a wheelchair, and a handcycle — then I can do anything.""
What else? King spends much of his time traveling around the country and sharing his story through the Penfed Credit Union Foundation Speaker's Bureau.
""Corporations and businesses in this country, they need to hear the stories coming out of Afghanistan and Iraq,"" he told the news station.
The motivational speaker has also written a book, ""The Making Point,"" which he hopes encourages others to be their best.
""I just want somebody to have a better today than they had yesterday,"" King said.

Bill Weld went on CNN with Jake Tapper to explain why he was mounting an unlikely attempt to unseat the president from his re-election in 2020.
""I really think if we have six more years of the same stuff we've had out of the White House the last two years, that would be a political tragedy and I would fear for the Republic,"" said the 74 year-old Weld, ""so I would be ashamed of myself if I didn't raise my hand and run.""
Tapper challenged Weld by listing off polling numbers that show Trump is highly popular within the Republican party, including his latest financial campaign statement that showed he had already raised historic donations for his re-election.
""What we have now is a president that mocks the rule of law, I spent seven years in the Justice Department trying to keep the politics out of law enforcement - he's trying to put it in,"" Weld said.
""A president who says we don't need a free press, who says climate change is a complete hoax,"" he added, ""he's not paying attention, I doubt very much that he's made a study of any of those issues.""
Weld said that he is a very fiscally economic conservative and criticized Trump for not even pretending to be fiscally conservative.
Weld was the governor of Massachusetts for two terms and worked as the head of the criminal division at the U.S. States Attorney office under Ronald Reagan's administration. He had said in February that he was thinking about running against Trump.

""The Democrats don't just want illegal immigrants being limited to [sanctuary cities.] They want them everywhere,"" said Jon. ""After all, you can't transform a country with those cities alone.

"WATCH: Onlookers kneel, sing 'Ave Maria' as they watch the Notre Dame Cathedral burn - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/watch-parisians-kneel-sing-ave-maria-as-they-watch-the-notre-dame-cathedral-burn,"As the iconic and historic Notre Dame Cathedral burned into Monday night, Parisians and tourists helplessly watching the inferno knelt and sang ""Ave Maria,"" the famous Catholic prayer to the Virgin Mary.
Their chorus created a hauntingly sad and beautiful backdrop to the scene they were witnessing; a centuries-old Christian landmark slowly being destroyed by flames despite the efforts of hundreds of firefighters to control it.
What's going on?
Notre Dame Cathedral caught fire Monday afternoon , presumably due to an accident related to renovations that were being made to the landmark.
The roof and spire of the cathedral collapsed, and officials initially believed that the entire structure would burn to the ground. However, as of Monday evening, fire officials said that the building would be partially saved .
""We now believe that the two towers of Notre Dame have been saved,"" Paris fire chief Jean-Claude Gallet told Reuters. ""We now consider that the main structure of Notre Dame has been saved and preserved
Officials also said that at least some of the most precious art contained within the cathedral had been saved, although it will be some time before the total scope of the damage and loss is known for sure.
One fireman has been reported as seriously injured while fighting the fire. As many as 400 firefighters were working to control the fire throughout the day.
French President Emmanuel Macron is already looking ahead to efforts to rebuild the cathedral.
""I'm telling you all tonight—we will rebuild this cathedral together,"" Macron said, according to CBS News . ""This is probably part of the French destiny. And we will do it in the next years. Starting tomorrow, a national donation scheme will be started that will extend beyond our borders.""
About Notre Dame Cathedral
The building of Notre Dame cathedral began in 1163, during the reign of King Louis VII, and was completed in 1345. It has become a rich symbol of French and Catholic history over the centuries, as well as a tourist attraction that draws millions of tourists each year."

According to numbers obtained by the Associated Press, the campaign will report raising $30.3 million for the first quarter of 2019.
Harris reported raising $12 million, while Sanders reported raising $18 million in the same period. Beto O'Rourke reported $9.4 million.
The vast majority of Trump's reelection fundraising (99 percent) came from donations that were less than $200 each, according to the campaign.
In a CNN interview with Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, he said they were developing a digital voter list that would dwarf the efforts that first got Trump into the Oval Office.
""It now has hundreds of millions of records in voter history, consumer data, and when we put polling data in that machine and we say this is what's happening,"" Parscale explained to Dana Bash, ""it can spit out models saying these are the people you need to talk to, and these are the messages you should talk to them about.""
The campaign now has $40.8 million on hand — an unprecedented sum for so early in a reelection campaign.

Nancy Pelosi hurls yet another insult at Ocasio-Cortez and the district that elected her,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/pelosi-versus-ocasio-cortez,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) launched another insult at progressive upstart Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) during an interview Monday.
""When we won this election it wasn't in districts like mine,"" Pelosi explained, ""or Alexandria's, however, she's a wonderful member of Congress I think all of our colleagues will attest.""
Pelosi was speaking at the London School of Economics and Political Science when she was asked about the popularity of Democratic Socialist Ocasio-Cortez.
""But those are districts that are solidly democratic. This glass of water would win with a 'd' next to its name in those districts,"" she said to laughter from the audience.
""And not to diminish the exuberance and the personality and the rest of Alexandria and the other members,"" she continued, ""but when I said three, they were talking about three that were getting a good deal of press on it.""
""But the 43 districts, we won 43 net gain of 40, were right down the middle,"" she concluded.
This follows upon another jab that made headlines when Pelosi dismissively said that the progressive wing that Ocasio-Cortez led was comprised of about five people.
While the far left progressive policies of Ocasio-Cortez and her dexterity with social media have catapulted her to the forefront of Democratic media coverage, more establishment Democrats have criticized her for trying to remake the party in her radical image.
Here's the video of the latest jab from Pelosi: "
Bernie Sanders' 1-percenter status confirmed with release of tax returns,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/bernie-sanders-one-percenter-status-confirmed-with-release-of-tax-returns,"Just minutes before going on Fox News to advocate for higher taxes, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) released the past 10 years of his own tax returns , confirming that the Democratic Socialist has benefitted significantly from the economic system he so often rails against.
According to the New York Times, Sanders' income puts him in the top 1 percent of taxpayers.
""These tax returns show that our family has been fortunate,"" Sanders said via statement. ""I am very grateful for that, as I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck and I know the stress of economic insecurity.""
What do the numbers show? In 2018, Sanders and his wife earned $561,293 in gross income. Approximately $393,000 of that came from his book sales. They paid a federal effective tax rate of 26 percent ($145,840).
The Sanders family's income multiplied significantly when they started selling books. In 2014, he and his wife earned an adjusted gross income of about $200,000, while in 2016 and 2017 they earned more than $800,000 each year just in book revenue, not even counting his six-figure congressional salary.
Isn't profiting from book sales capitalism? During his Fox News town hall Monday, host Bret Baier asked Sanders if he would credit his wealth to a capitalist economy.
""When you wrote the book and made the money, isn't that the definition of capitalism and the American dream?"" Baier asked. Sanders paused for a moment, then simply answered ""no.""
""This year, we had $560,000 in income,"" Sanders said. ""In my and my wife's case, I wrote a pretty good book. It was a bestseller, sold all over the world, and we made money. If anyone thinks I should apologize for writing a bestselling book, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna do it.""
Sanders was also asked why he wouldn't voluntarily pay more in taxes since he believes the wealthy should pay much more than they do right now. He brushed that suggestion off and pivoted the conversation to President Donald Trump.
""Pfft, come on. I paid the taxes that I owe,"" Sanders said, according to Fox News. ""And by the way, why don't you get Donald Trump up here and ask him how much he pays in taxes? President Trump watches your network a little bit, right? Hey President Trump, my wife and I just released 10 years. Please do the same."""

Alyssa Milano mangles the truth in tweet rant against Trump on tax day,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/milano-tweets-against-trump,"Hollywood actress and outspoken liberal Alyssa Milano attempted to bash President Donald Trump in a Twitter rant about tax day, but instead managed to mangle key facts about Republican tax cuts.
""Now that Tax Day is almost here, and Americans are seeing for themselves who the Republican Party really cares about,"" Milano tweeted, adding a list of points about the federal tax filing deadline.
2/ Already this April, we've learned that tax refunds are down this year by $6 BILLION.
— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 14, 2019 3/ According to a recent NBC/WSJ poll, only 17 percent of Americans think their taxes went down, and a majority don't think they got any tax cut at all. And this isn't partisan. Only 33 percent of Republicans think they got a tax cut.
— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 14, 2019 But, as the New York Times reports, Americans' perceptions of whether they got a tax cut does not match with the reality of whether they got a tax cut. While 64.8 percent of Americans actually received a tax cut, only about 40 percent believe they got a tax cut.
4/ And we just learned from the Center for Public Integrity that the number of big companies that pay zero taxes—that's right, zero—have gone from 30 to 60.
— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 14, 2019 5/ But here's the thing—Americans aren't dumb. We knew from the beginning what Republicans were doing. As of March, the GOP tax scam only had a 36 percent approval rating. That's worse than Trump's.
— Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 14, 2019 The New York Times report also explains why Americans have such a low opinion about the Republican tax plan - propaganda from liberals like Milano.
""To a large degree, the gap between perception and reality on the tax cuts appears to flow from a sustained — and misleading — effort by liberal opponents of the law to brand it as a broad middle-class tax increase,"" the report states.
Milano drew her anti-Republican and anti-Trump conclusions from opinion divorced from reality.
""We knew the @GOP was just doing a giant favor for their corporate donors and friends,"" Milano said in the last tweet of her rant. ""We knew it would add to an already unsustainable deficit. And we knew the middle class were an afterthought.""
In 2017, Milano blamed a Trump aide for a store's holiday arrangement that she said was pro-Nazi."
ICE deported the husband of a U.S. soldier killed in Afghanistan—then brought him back a week later,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ice-deported-the-husband-of-a-u-s-soldier-killed-in-afghanistan-then-brought-him-back-a-week-later,"An illegal immigrant who had been married to a soldier killed in Afghanistan was deported back to Mexico last week, forcing him to leave his daughter behind in Arizona.
Monday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement brought the man back to the U.S. to be released, according to the Arizona Republic .
How did this happen? Jose Gonzalez Carranza, 30, first came to the U.S. illegally in 2004 as a teenager. In 2007 he married Barbara Vieyra.
In 2010, Army Pfc. Vieyra was killed in Afghanistan when her unit was attacked by insurgents with an IED and grenade launchers. They have a daughter, Evelyn, who is now 12.
Carranza was granted a ""parole in place"" after his wife's death, which allowed him to remain in the U.S. without fear that he would be deported.
However, in 2018, ICE refiled his case, and he was ordered to be deported by a judge in December 2018 after not showing up for a hearing. Gonzalez said he never received notice of the hearing. His attorney said ICE sent notification to the wrong address.
Carranza said he found out about the deportation order last Monday when he was arrested by ICE agents on the way to his welding job. He was deported to Nogales, Mexico, a few days later and had been living in a shelter there while his daughter stayed in Arizona with her grandparents.
How did he get back to the U.S.? Carranza's attorney, Ezequiel Hernandez, sent out a press release after his client was deported, hoping to draw attention to what he believed was an injustice.
""There are plenty of people you can go after but not a guy whose wife died in Afghanistan,"" Hernandez told the Arizona Republic.
Hernandez said that not long after he spoke to the Republic about the case, an ICE official called him and said the agency was bringing Carranza back to the U.S.
Customs and Border Patrol brought Carranza back into the U.S. and to their Tucson, Arizona, offices, where he would be picked up by ICE agents, brought back to his home in Phoenix, and released.
As of Monday night, ICE had not commented on the specifics of the situation or why the agency opted to bring Carranza back. A spokesperson for Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) told the Republic that Sinema's office reached out to assist Carranza."

The professor, Talia Lavin, who teaches journalism at the university, also took aim at Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) in profane tweets.
According to her university bio , Lavin teaches a class titled ""Reporting on the Far-Right"" and focuses on ""far-right extremism and social justice.""
What are the details? In a Saturday tweet, Lavin wrote, ""[W]hen did the memory of 9/11 become 'sacred'? [I]n what way? [A]nd to whom?""
""[I] meant this as a genuine question,"" she continued. ""[I]t was indisputably tragic, world-changing, evil and despicable, and a turning point of history. [B]ut 'sacred' is a particular word with its own religious meanings, and [I] wanted to pinpoint what it means to call such a day 'sacred' specifically.""
Lavin tweeted her thoughts in response to recent controversy sparked by remarks that Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) made about the 9/11 attacks. Omar made the remarks in March while speaking at a CAIR fundraiser. During her remarks, Omar appeared to minimize the attacks as ""some people did something.""
What else? Lavin later took aim at Crenshaw, who previously criticized Omar for the remarks she made during the CAIR fundraiser.
Addressing Omar's remarks on his Twitter page, the Texas congressman wrote, ""First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as 'some people who did something.'""
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was just one person who jumped to Omar's defense .
""You refuse to cosponsor the 9/11 Victim's Compensation Fund, yet have the audacity to drum resentment towards Ilhan w/completely out-of-context quotes,"" she wrote. ""In 2018, right-wing extremists were behind almost ALL US domestic terrorist killings. Why don't you go do something about that?""
Lavin later tweeted a video of Crenshaw defending his criticism of Omar's CAIR fundraiser remarks.
Lavin captioned the video, ""[T]he real victim, captain s**thead, speaks.""
Criticism poured in, but Lavin stuck to her guns and doubled down on her insults of Crenshaw.
""[A]ctually, ur [sic] right, I should respect his rank,"" she added . ""[H]is name is Lieutenant Commander s**thead.""

WATCH: Fox News hosts corner Bernie Sanders' hypocrisy on taxes. His response says it all.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/bernie-sanders-taxes-fox-news-town-hall,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, was cornered over his hypocrisy on taxes during a Fox News town hall Monday, dodging tough questions from two Fox News hosts.
What happened? Sanders — who is now officially confirmed as a member of the infamous ""one percent"" after he released his past 10 years of tax returns — was asked why he accepts the lower tax rate afforded to him by Republican-passed tax reform when he advocates the wealthiest Americans pay their ""fair share.""
""Your taxes do show you're a millionaire,"" Fox News host Bret Baier said. ""But your marginal tax rate [in 2018] was 26 percent because of President Trump's tax cuts. So why not say: 'I'm leading this revolution, I'm going to take those.'?""
Sanders responded: ""Pffttt...come on...I am— I paid the taxes that I owe.""
Without directly answering Baier's question, Sanders launched into a broadside against President Donald Trump.
""And by the way, why don't you get Donald Trump up here and ask him how much he pays in taxes,"" Sanders said angrily. ""I am eagerly awaiting you doing that.""
But Baier was not satisfied, and pushed the line of questioning further asking Sanders why he is ""vilifying"" millionaires and billionaires for being wealthy. Sanders denied that he vilifies wealthy Americans, repeating his oft-cited talking point that wealthy Americans should pay their ""fair share.""
What happened next? Then it was Fox News host Martha MacCallum's turn. Noting that Sanders does not advocate taxing the wealthiest Americans at 70 percent — like some of his Democratic colleagues — Sanders said he believes the rate should be 52 percent, which he advocated for during his 2016 presidential campaign.
""Alright, so 52 percent. So, would you be willing to pay 52 percent on the money that you made?"" MacCallum asked. ""You can volunteer, you can send it back.""
""You can volunteer, too,"" Sanders interrupted.
""But that's what you suggested everybody in your [tax] bracket should do,"" MacCallum shot back.
""Martha, why don't you— you make more money than I do! Why don't you give—"" Sanders replied.
""I didn't suggest a wealth tax,"" MacCallum said back. Baier added that MacCallum also is not running for president.
Sanders later said he's going to ""fight for a wealth tax."" He went on to bash Trump once again, vilifying the tax reform bill by highlighting the savings it provided for billionaires and massive corporations."
Man accused of throwing young boy off Mall of America balcony makes chilling admission to police,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/man-mall-of-america-attack-chilling-admission,"The man accused of throwing a 5-year-old boy off the third-story balcony at the Mall of America last week, nearly killing the child, admitted to police he went to the mall in search of someone to kill — and was upset that his plan did not ""work out.""
What are the details? According to KMSP-TV , 24-year-old Emmanuel Aranda, who was formally charged with first-degree attempted premeditated murder on Monday, told police he went to the mall last Friday with the intention of killing someone.
He even went to the mall last Thursday with the same intentions — but for some reason did not follow through with his plan. His plan was to throw an adult over the balcony, but he admitted he chose the young boy instead. Why he chose the child remains a mystery.
The Mall of America Image source: KMSP-TV screenshot
Aranda told police he lashed out in anger because multiple attempts to pick up women at the mall had ended in rejection.
""This crime has shocked the community. That a child, with his mother, at a safe public area like a mall, could be violently attacked for no reason is chilling for everyone,"" Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a statement, KMSP reported.
What is the background? Court documents say the victim's mother and her son were standing outside a mall restaurant with another parent and child. That's when Aranda approached them and threw the young child over the third-story balcony, immediately fleeing the scene afterward.
According to KMSP, police estimate the child fell 39 feet before hitting the ground below, suffering numerous broken bones and severe head trauma.
Witnesses attempted to stop Aranda from fleeing, but he got away. Police later caught him waiting for the light rail.
One positive development has been the outpouring of support from Americans across the country. Donations for the family have poured in and amounted to more than $685,000 as of Tuesday morning, blowing past the GoFundMe campaign goal of $500,000.
""The family cannot express how grateful they are for all of the prayers, love and support that they are receiving. There truly aren't enough words!"" the latest GoFundMe update reads. ""His condition has very little change at this point, but we are hoping to get some good news back from some upcoming tests in the next few days. The family is continuing to request privacy during this time."""

Just days earlier, 16 bronze statues were removed from the cathedral's roof and placed into storage as the structure was undergoing a massive restoration.

The move saved the statues from destruction when cathedral's spire collapsed.
What else? It's sill unclear whether or not a piece of the True Cross and one of the Holy Nails have survived.
Much of the cathedral's Great Organ, which dates back to the 19th century and contains more than 8,000 pipes from the 1200s appears to have survived.

Organ builder Bertrand Cattiaux told the Times that there would be no guarantees until he visits the cathedral to asses the damage.
""We can just cross our fingers and wait,"" he said."
'Submit to God thru Islam': Church vandalized with graffiti; 125-year-old windows apparently broken,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/submit-to-god-thru-islam-church-vandalized-with-graffiti-125-year-old-windows-apparently-broken,"A South Carolina church was vandalized with apparently spray-painted graffiti that read, ""Submit to God thru Islam"" and ""Muhammed [sic] is his prophet.""
Anderson Police on Sunday posted a Facebook photo of the vandalism at Midway Presbyterian Church. The photo shows three covered-over windows that are 125 years old, police said. They appear to have been broken.
The post added that a reward will be offered ""for information that leads to the arrest of the individual(s) who vandalized this church.""
The Facebook post has garnered over 750 comments, with some blaming Muslims for the graffiti. It's worth noting, however, that following the election of President Donald Trump in 2016, a gay choir director admitted to spray-painting his Indiana church with anti-gay slurs, the phrase ""Heil Trump,"" and a swastika . That incident was among a number of similar hoaxes made to look like Trump supporters perpetrated hateful acts .
And coupled with the botching of the commonly recognized spelling of Muhammad, it's quite possible the Midway Presbyterian Church vandalism was not committed by a Muslim or Muslims."
Billionaires pledge more than $450 million to rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral after devastating fire,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/billionairs-pledge-more-than-450-million-to-rebuild-notre-dame,"French billionaires and large companies have been offering hundreds of millions of dollars to repair the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, France, after a fire caused severe damage to the iconic church on Monday.
Here's what we know On Monday , a fire destroyed the roof and spire of the cathedral. Firefighters managed to put out the blaze before it destroyed the building's two towers. Artifacts inside, including what is believed by Catholics to be Jesus' Crown of Thorns, a piece of the True Cross, and a nail from the Crucifixion, were all saved . Pieces of artwork from inside the building were also rescued. No one was injured in the fire.
While the exact cause of the fire is still unknown, French authorities have speculated that it may have been related to the restoration work that had been going on at the time. It is not yet clear what the cost of repairs will be. The interior of the building had largely been saved due to a stone vault ceiling underneath the now-destroyed wooden roof.
""We will rebuild. All together,"" French President Emmanuel Macron promised in a tweet from Monday. ""It's part of the fate, the destiny of France, and our common project over the coming years. And I am committed to it.""
Those committed to helping pay for the restoration include actress Salma Hayek's husband, François-Henri Pinault, the head of luxury conglomerate Kering, and his father who together pledged 100 million euros, or $113 million . In a statement posted on Twitter, Pinault said, ""Faced with this tragedy, my father and I have decided to contribute to the funds needed to fully rebuild Notre Dame de Paris, in order to bring this jewel of our heritage back to life as soon as possible.""
Bernard Arnault, the head of the LVMH group (Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Sephora, Marc Jacobs, and Givenchy) announced a 200 million euro ($226 million) donation of his own, French oil and gas company Total promised 100 million euros ($113 million), and consulting and technology firm Capgemini offered 1 million euros ($1.13 million)."
"The 2020 Democrats want to take more of your money to help the less fortunate, but how much have they given to charity?",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-how-much-have-2020-dems-given-to-charity,"2020 Democrats have floated plenty of ideas involving the use of government force to take taxpayer money for the less-fortunate, but how much have they given to charity personally?
Not a whole lot, according to analysis of released tax returns from the Washington Post's James Hohmann.
The analysis contained in one of the newspaper's daily email newsletter shows that, out of the current crop of candidates, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and her husband have been the most fiscally charitable, giving 5.5 percent of their income last year to charity.
The rest of the candidates follow in descending order by percentage of total income:
Washington governor Jay Inslee and his wife gave 4.1 percent.
Freshly-outed one-percenter Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and his wife gave 3.4 percent.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and her husband gave just south of 2 percent. So did Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) gave 1.4 percent of her income to charity last year, but didn't report a cent of giving during her first three years as California's attorney general.
Robert Francis ""Beto"" O'Rourke and his wife gave .3 percent.
The email notes that American voters still haven't seen tax returns from candidates Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
While the numbers are certain to generate criticism from Republican candidates, it won't be the first time that Democrats have have taken heat for how much they give to charity.
Prospective frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden hasn't yet said whether or not he'll run for president this time around, but he too has been criticized for his lower rates of charitable giving, both in 2008 and 2012 .
2018 New York Times analysis of voting and IRS data found that Republicans tend to give more to charity than Democrats across the country. A 2013 study from the Chronicle of Philanthropy saw similar finding in contrasting the giving levels of blue and red states.
President Donald Trump has not yet released his tax returns, though they have been demanded by House Democrats ."
Fox News anchors silence guests who connected Notre Dame fire to recent attacks on French churches,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/fox-news-hosts-shut-down-guests-connect-notre-dame-fires-to-recent-attacks-in-france,"Fox News hosts Shepard Smith and Neil Cavuto on Monday cut off interviews with guests who speculated the fire that engulfed the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris was connected to recent church attacks in the French city and around the country.
What happened in the Smith interview? Smith's guest was Philippe Karsenty — a French media analyst and former elected official, the Hill said — and he characterized the Notre Dame fire as a 9/11-like event for the people of France.
""It's a French 9/11, you know? And it's a big shock,"" he told Smith. ""The church was there for more than 850 years. Even the Nazis didn't dare to destroy it.""
But then Karsenty noted in past years churches have been ""desecrated each and every week in France, all over France. So, of course, you will hear the story of ... political correctness which will tell you that it's probably an accident—""
Smith immediately stopped Karsenty: ""Sir, sir, sir, we're not going to speculate here of the cause of something which we don't know. If you have observations, or you know something, we would love to hear it.""
But Karsenty added a warning that people ""need to be ready,"" and Smith shut him down for good.
""No, sir, we're not doing that here, not now, not on my watch,"" Smith said before ending the interview. ""Philippe Karsenty, it's very good of you to be here.""
Here's the clip:
According to NewsBusters , Smith said 20 minutes later that ""there have been a number of attacks on Catholic churches in the Paris area. But [the Notre Dame fire and past incidents] we are not connecting at this moment.""
What happened in the Cavuto interview? Cavuto's guest was Catholic League President Bill Donohue who said if the Notre Dame fire ""is an accident, it's a monumental tragedy. But forgive me for being suspicious. Just last month, a 17th-century church was set on fire in Paris. We've seen tabernacles knocked down, crosses have been torn down, statues have been smashed.""
At that point Cavuto cut off Donohue: ""We don't know that. So if we can avoid what your suspicions might be. I do want to look at what happens now."" The host then asked Donohue if he believed the Catholic Church will want to determine the cause of the Notre Dame fire before it commits more money to what he said was a fully funded renovation project.
""Well, first, they have to get to the bottom of it, and they will rebuild it,"" Donohue replied. ""There's no question about that."" But then he switched gears: ""I'm sorry, I mean, when I find out that the Eucharist is being destroyed and excrement is being smeared on crosses. This is going on now!""
Then Cavuto cut off Donohue permanently.
""I love you, Bill, but we cannot make conjectures about this,"" Cavuto said before ending the phone call amid Donohue's protests. ""So, thank you. Bill, I'm sorry. Thank you very, very much. I do want to let people know — and again we're not trying to be rude to our guests here — there is so much here we don't know about what happened here. We do know that about four hours ago something started here."" Cavuto added that while there have been attacks in Paris, it's ""another leap"" to say an attack caused the Notre Dame fire.
Here's the clip:
What about the spate of church attacks? Newsweek last month reported that vandalism, including arson and desecration, have been hitting Catholic churches across France since the start of the year.
More from the magazine:
Vandals have smashed statues, knocked down tabernacles, scattered or destroyed the Eucharist and torn down crosses, sparking fears of a rise in anti-Catholic sentiment in the country.
Last Sunday, the historic Church of St. Sulpice in Paris was set on fire just after midday mass on Sunday, Le Parisien reported, although no one was injured. Police are still investigating the attack, which firefighters have confidently attributed to arson.
In addition, a statue of the Virgin Mary was found smashed and the altar cross was thrown on the ground at the St. Nicholas Catholic Church in Houilles in February, Newsweek said, citing Catholic publication La Croix International.
An altar cloth was burned and crosses and statues of saints were smashed in February at Saint-Alain Cathedral in Lavaur, the magazine added.
And the altar was looted and a cross was smeared with human excrement at Notre-Dame des Enfants church in Nimes, Newsweek said."
"West Africa immigrant says two men assaulted, robbed him because of his MAGA hat",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/west-africa-immigrant-attacked-maga-hat,"Police arrested 27-year-old Jovan Crawford and 25-year-old Scott Duncan Roberson after they reportedly assaulted and robbed a West African immigrant for wearing his ""Make America Great Again"" hat in public.
Authorities charged the two men with assault and robbery for the incident, which took place in Germantown, Maryland, over the weekend.
What are the details? Atsu Nable, who emigrated from West Africa in 2007 and became an American citizen, said that he supported the Republican Party since he moved to the U.S., and became a fan of President Donald Trump when he announced his presidential campaign.
Nable told WTTG-TV that he was walking on a city street when Crawford and Roberson approached him and began berating him for wearing the trademark red cap. He added that one of the suspects hit him from behind.
""I was like, 'Why are you doing that?' You know? We don't have to do this,"" Nable explained. He said the two men responded by telling him that the hat is ""not any good.""
""And then they started punching me on my head,"" Nable added. Unafraid, Nable said he told the suspects that he was permitted to have his own opinions and express them in a manner in which he sees fit. Nable explained that he attempted to walk away from the suspects but that they wouldn't let up on him until he fell to the ground.
Nable said that in addition to berating him, following him, and striking him, they also destroyed his headphones and attempted to grab his cell phone.
According to the outlet, eyewitnesses to the attack phoned authorities. Two police officers discovered the suspects at a nearby basketball court attempting to hide.
WJZ-TV reported that authorities charged Crawford with robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery, attempt theft $100 to under $1,500, second-degree assault, and malicious destruction of property with a value less than $1,000.
Authorities charged Roberson with robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery, attempt theft $100 to under $1,500, and second-degree assault.
Despite the scare, Nable remains firm in his beliefs, and told the station that he attended Trump's campaign events and offered to help when the president was inaugurated in Jan. 2017. He said that he wears his hat all the time.
""I came [to the U.S.] for freedom,"" he told WTTG."
Three more veterans commit suicide at VA facilities in five-day span,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/3-vets-commit-suicide-at-va-facilities,"Three veterans took their own lives at separate Veterans Affairs facilities within a five-day span earlier this month, putting a renewed spotlight on the high suicide rates among former service members.
What are the details? On April 5, 29-year-old Gary Pressley fatally shot himself in the chest while in a vehicle parked outside the Carl Vinson VA Medical Center in Dublin, Georgia, WMAZ-TV reported. Pressley's mother said her son was tormented by all of the devastation he saw while helping with search and rescue in Haiti, after a 2010 earthquake killed roughly 250,000 people.
Pressley was medically discharged from the Navy in 2012 following a bad car accident, and thereafter, his mother said, ""It was just a battle with the medication, the doctors, and just, I watched him cry, because he couldn't get the help he needed.""
Pressley reportedly told his girlfriend he planned to take his own life in the parking lot of the Dublin VA ""so somebody can pay attention to what's happening, so other vets do not have to go through this."" But by the time his sister found out his intentions and alerted authorities, it was too late.
The next day, just 140 miles away, 68-year-old Olen Hancock shot himself outside the main entrance of Atlanta VA Medical Center in Decatur, Georgia. According to WSB-TV , Hancock had been seen pacing in the lobby of the facility right before he walked out and took his own life.
A third veteran committed suicide at a clinic in Austin, Texas, on April 9. The unidentified victim shot himself in front of hundreds of people in the first-floor waiting room, KXAN-TV reported.
Anything else? Chairman of the House Committee on Veteran's Affairs Mark Takano (D-Calif.) released a statement in response to the recent deaths, saying in part, ""Every new instance of veteran suicide showcases a barrier to access, but with three incidents on VA property in just five days, and six this year alone, it's critical we do more to stop this epidemic.""
Takano added, ""All Americans have a role to play in reducing veteran suicide, and the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs is going to make this issue a top priority.""
According to Fox News , the rate of suicide among veterans is 1.5 times higher than Americans who have not served. We lose roughly 20 veterans each day to self-inflicted death."
Beagles once force-fed pesticides are now going to new homes,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/beagles-once-force-fed-pesticides-are-now-going-to-new-homes,"Thirty-two beagles will be adopted out to new homes after being rescued from a laboratory where they were being fed pesticides.
Wait...what happened? Charles River Laboratories in Michigan admitted to force feeding a new fungicide to three dozen beagles. The fungicide was being developed by Dow DuPont's Corteva Agriscience division. The lab planned to euthanize the dogs at the end of the test.
In March, the Humane Society of the United States posted a video exposing the testing. According to the Humane Society, half a million people protested the treatment of the beagles. A few days later, Corteva announced that it would be turning the beagles over to the Humane Society.
In a statement, Corteva said that the ""dogs are healthy, under the care of veterinarians,"" and that the company would ""work as quickly as possible with the Michigan Humane Society to find safe and caring homes.""
The Humane Society has since received 32 beagles from Corteva. The Humane Society said that it is currently accepting applications to get each of these dogs adopted and will make a decision on the best home for each beagle after 8 p.m. on Sunday.
The dogs will undergo training before they can go to their new homes, and the Humane Society warned that since the dogs had experienced trauma, ""activities enjoyed by other dogs may not be options for them.""
It is not clear at this point why only 32 dogs were available for adoption when 36 were used for the study.
""And, of course, we want to see all 36 beagles who were assigned to this study released to the Michigan Humane Society,"" Vice President of animal research issues at the Humane Society Kathleen Conlee told CNN . ""It is up to Dow/Corteva to explain why there are only 32 dogs being released."" Conlee said that in her organization's discussions regarding the dogs, the laboratory repeatedly agreed that there were 36.
The original video from the Human Society that led to the release of the beagles is posted below. The content may be disturbing for some viewers."
Principal apologizes to student after telling her to cover up her pro-Trump T-shirt,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/principal-apologizes-for-making-student-cover-trump-shirt,"A New Hampshire principal has apologized to a female student after first telling her to cover up her pro-President Donald Trump T-shirt.
What's a brief history on the issue? The student, high school freshman Ciretta MacKenzie, wore the shirt last week for the school's America pride day. Principal Brian Ernest, however, took issue with the pro-Trump gear and told her that she would have to cover it up because it violated dress code.
Ciretta revealed that Ernest told her Trump is a controversial president, and Ernest didn't want to alienate students throughout the day or make it a political point of contention.
Ciretta said that she asked the principal what would happen if she couldn't find a different shirt to put on, and he purportedly told her that she would have to be separated from the rest of the students. The teen was able to borrow a sweatshirt from a friend, and ended up taking off her hat, but felt that Ernest's request violated her First Amendment rights.
Epping School District Superintendent Valerie McKenney said that an investigation into the incident was ongoing, noting that the district ""will take steps to remedy this situation for all parties involved and ensure that this type of situation never happens again.""
You can read more on the story's background here .
So what is Ernest saying now?
Ernest issued an apology in letter Friday, according to WBZ-TV .
A portion of the letter stated, ""I want our students to be free thinkers and be able to express their opinions in a respectful manner.""
He also explained that he'd met with the teen and her family to issue a formal apology.
""We have begun to draft a plan to move forward to promote civil discourse and diversity in our schools,"" the letter continued. ""In retrospect, I want to fully acknowledge my error in judgment and sincerely apologize if my actions were misinterpreted and offended anyone. That was never my intention.""
McKenney issued a follow-up letter of her own on the incident.
She wrote, ""The Epping School Board and Epping District's position is that this event should not have ever taken place, and we are committed to the creation of a school environment that promotes open and free thought and dialogue.""
The outlet also reported that the MacKenzie family believes Ernest's apology is genuine, and they bear no hard feelings toward the principal."
A white man tried to have his black neighbor killed. The 'hit man' he called was actually an FBI agent. - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/white-man-tried-to-have-black-neighbor-killed,"A South Carolina man has pled guilty to trying to hire a hitman to kill his black neighbor. Luckily for the neighbor, the hit man turned out to be an undercover FBI agent.
Here's what we know According to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Carolina, 26-year-old Brandon Cory Lecroy reached out to a white supremacist organization in order to murder his black neighbor, who has not been identified. The FBI found out what Lecroy had planned and intercepted with an agent who posed as a hitman.
On March 28, 2018, Lecroy reportedly offered the undercover FBI $500 to make his neighbor ""a ghost."" He also asked the agent to put a ""flaming cross"" in his neighbor's front yard and requested that his neighbor be hung from a tree.
The entire conversation was recorded. According to the New York Times , Lecroy sent pictures of the man he wanted killed and a second unidentified potential target to the agent. He also wanted an untraceable 9-millimeter gun. It is not clear what he was going to use the gun for if he intended to have the FBI agent commit the murders.
In addition to his racist motivations, Lecroy also said that he hoped to take his neighbor's property.
After this, Lecroy met with the agent in person and talked about additional targets he wanted killed. He also gave the agent $100 in cash as a down payment for the first murder. As soon as the money changed hands, the FBI had all it needed to arrest him.
Lecroy was sentenced to 10 years in prison, with three additional years of court-ordered supervision. He pled guilty to one count of murder for hire."

Even CNN hits Michelle Obama for this 'un-woke' criticism of President Trump - TheBlaze,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/michelle-obama-mocks-divorced-dads,"CNN anchor Dana Bash and her guest criticized former first lady Michelle Obama for a criticism she lobbed against President Donald Trump that also appeared to mock divorced fathers.
Obama was speaking in London, England, when she told the audience that the United States was comparable to a teenager who was from a broken home.
""We come from a broken family we're a teenager, where you know, we're a little unsettled, you know, having good parents you know, is tough, you know,"" Obama said.
""Sometimes you spend weekends with divorced dad and that feels like it's fun, but then you get sick,"" she explained. ""That's what America is going through, we're kinda living with a divorced dad.""
Bash and her guest CNN White House reporter Kate Bennett heavily criticized the former first lady for mocking divorced fathers as unserious parental figures.
""To make the analogy to divorced dads for someone like Michelle Obama is terrible unwoke to use a term that the kids use,"" Bash said.
""It's not the 1950s,"" she added. ""There are a lot of divorced dads.""
Bennett agreed and called it a ""really big misstep"" on the part of the former first lady.

"California teacher reveals ‘far, hard left’ abortion, sex ed policies of unions: ‘We are being used by very powerful organizations’ - TheBlaze",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/california-teacher-reveals-far-hard-left-policies-of-unions-we-are-being-used-by-very-powerful-organizations,"Teachers' unions are attempting to indoctrinate young children into thinking that far-left ideals are the norm, according to a California school teacher.
Rebecca Friedrichs, a 28-year veteran of California public schools, also penned an op-ed for Fox News titled "" Pro-life teachers, your union dues fund abortion .""
What are the details? Speaking with co-host Ainsley Earhardt, Friedrichs explained how teacher unions are bringing liberal ideas in to the classroom.
Addressing Friedrichs' column, Earhardt said, ""You start off talking about a very touchy issue that people have a lot of opinions about. And you talk about abortion and then you talk about how, as a California teacher, these left-leaning groups are pushing their agendas on our kids. Tell us what's happening in California.""
Friedrichs said that the agenda isn't even left-leaning — they are ""far, hard left groups"" advocating for their causes.
""What's going on right now in California specifically is we passed a law requiring some very offensive sex-ed,"" Friedrichs said. ""You've had another guest on whose told you a little bit about that sex-ed: forcing teachers to tell little children that at age 12 they have the right to go get an abortion without their parents' knowledge or permission.""
""And the schools will help them get there and help them fund it,"" she added.
Earhardt asked, ""How is this getting into our schools? Who is funding this?""
Friedrichs explained that the teachers' unions are pushing the agenda into the schools.
""What's shocking is teachers have no idea,"" she revealed. ""People think teachers are these far-left people pushing this stuff. That is a lie. Teachers are these — most teachers are good, loving people and many of them are against abortion and are against sexualizing little children. But we are being used by very powerful organizations.""
""The teachers' unions collect about $5 billion a year tax-free from teachers, and they use that money to push their personal social, sexual, and political agenda into our schools,"" Friedrichs added.
She also asked that her fellow educators start a boycott against the unions and stop making payments to the unions.
""All teachers across the country, in fact, all government employees are now free to pay unions nothing,"" Friedrichs said. ""We are still unionized. We're still forced to accept their representation. They're still bullying us and steamrolling us, but we don't have to pay them any longer. And I hope and pray that teachers will stand together and stop paying them. And I'm hoping we can eventually get them out of our schools."" ""
What else? In her Sunday column, which was adapted from her 2018 book, ""Standing Up to Goliath,"" Friedrichs also explained that teachers' unions subsidize abortions and finance Planned Parenthood.
Friedrichs, who was the lead plaintiff in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association — a 2016 Supreme Court case on forced union dues — wrote, ""Years ago, as a California teacher, I was shocked to learn that state and national teachers' unions collude with Planned Parenthood. They use teacher dues money and resources — behind our backs and against our wills — to bring the abortion industry into our schools.""
""Many of our nation's public schools require teachers to instruct children as young as 12 on how and where to obtain birth control — including the morning-after pill and abortions — without parental knowledge or permission,"" she added. ""If teachers refuse to teach this, the law mandates 'experts' like Planned Parenthood take over the classroom.""
In her column, Friedrichs also points to the California Teachers' Association and the National Educational Association as examples of unions that donate to leftist causes and work with leftist groups such as the Women's March, the SPLC, and more.

Breaking: President Trump just issued the second veto of his presidency to block Congress,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-vetos-congress-on-yemen-war,"President Donald Trump issued the second veto of his administration to block a vote from Congress to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen.
The Senate voted 54-46 in favor for the resolution while the House of Representatives voted 247-175.
The administration issued a scathing statement rejecting the resolution and accusing the Congress of trying to undermine his executive authority.
The statement described the congressional action as ""a joint resolution that purports to direct the President to remove United States Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of Yemen, with certain exceptions.""
""This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities,"" the statement continued, ""endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.""
The president issued his first veto of legislation out of Congress in March when they voted to block his declaration of a national emergency on the border.
Congress is not likely to have the votes to override the president's veto, which would require 2/3rds support of each of the Senate and the House of Representatives.

Democrats fume over White House threat to send illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/democrats-fume-over-white-house-threat-to-send-illegal-immigrants-to-sanctuary-cities,"Democrats are speaking out about President Donald Trump's threat to bus illegal immigrants to sanctuary cities, and many are none too pleased. Still, some leaders insist they'll welcome anyone with open arms.
What are the details? Last week, the president announced on Twitter, ""Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong consideration to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only. The radical left always seems to have an open borders, open arms policy — so this should make them very happy!""
Yet several Democrats are not, in fact, happy. Particularly in California — home to many longtime ""sanctuary cities"" — which has statewide laws in place to protect illegal immigrants from deportation.
Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) called the Trump administration's policy idea an ""outrageous abuse of power"" and characterized it as un-American. The president called Schaaf out on Twitter , saying it was ""so interesting to see the Mayor of Oakland and other sanctuary cities do not want our currently 'detained immigrants.'"" She responded by insisting her city ""welcomes all, no matter where you came from or how you got here.""
California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) also pushed back against the Trump threat. According to the Los Angeles Times , Newsom ""insisted the federal government is already 'dumping people' in California by processing migrants legally seeking asylum at the border and releasing them into California before they have time to connect with their sponsors in the U.S.""
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D) office also weighed in, with spokeswoman Ashley Etienne saying in a statement, ""The extent of this Administration's cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated. Using human beings — including little children — as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable, and in some cases, criminal,"" USA Today reported.
Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) accused Trump of ""trying to pit Americans against each other and make us less safe,"" with the proposal.
House Democrats are now formally investigating the administration's plan, with the chairmen of the Judiciary, Oversight, and Homeland Security Committees requesting pertinent documents and communications from the White House and Department of Homeland Security, ABC News reported.
House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) told CNN Sunday, ""The president has no right to spend money appropriated by Congress for other purposes to ship immigrants all over the country.""
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) vowed to sue President Trump over the threat to ship illegal immigrants to his city, calling the administration's plan itself, ""just plain illegal.""
Anything else? In spite of the pushback, some sanctuary city leaders have appeared to call the president's bluff, insisting they're unfazed by the prospect of his proposal. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan (D) responded to the plan on "" Hardball with Chris Matthews "" Monday, saying, ""It's not a threat to us,"" and explained that her city and others across the country are ""ready to stand up"" and take folks in.
Durkan explained, ""Just over this weekend, I've received hundreds of emails from people in our area offering places of refuge and saying 'I'll take some in my own home; I'll take some in our church. I think people will step up.""
When pressed by Matthews as to whether her city could take in 50,000 of the approximately 1 million people seeking asylum in the U.S., Durkan responded, ""I don't think we'd take 50,000 in one go, but we've taken thousands of people in Seattle."""

Thing is, the owner of the Riverdale residence was armed, too — and WTOP-FM reported that just seconds after the door came down Wednesday afternoon, the homeowner shot the intruder.
What happened next? While the suspect ran off, the homeowner called 911 about 5:30 p.m. saying he shot a man who broke into his house, Prince George's County Police told WRC.
About 20 minutes later, Victory Mbeng entered a Lanham hospital with a gunshot wound and died of his injuries a short time later, the station added.
WRC also said friends of Mbeng dropped him off at the hospital and told his aunt, Bridget Manka, that he was the victim of a random drive-by shooting.

Here's what we know Micah Herndon is a 31-year-old Marine veteran who served in Afghanistan. While he was deployed there, two Marines he was serving with and a British journalist were killed by an improvised explosive device. One of these men was his best friend, Matthew Ballard.
""Survivor's guilt, it's real,"" he told the Washington Post . ""I definitely have it because I was the lead machine-gunner on that convoy and I didn't see that bomb that was buried. I live with that every day.""
Herndon said that he wanted to run the marathon to honor their memories.
But around mile 20 out of 26.2, Herndon's Achilles tendon began to hurt. He tried to power through and keep running, but by the time he reached mile 22, he was reduced to a ""low crawl.""
Volunteers at the race ran over to him, but he refused their help. He insisted on dragging himself down the homestretch and crossing the finish line before he would allow them to help him into a wheelchair.
""The pain that I was going through is nothing compared to the pain that they went through,"" he told WBZ-TV . He said that he kept saying the names of the three men who died over and over again to keep pushing himself. ""I just repeat: 'Ballard, Hamer, Juarez. Ballard, Hamer, Juarez.'""
Later that day, the Post reported, Herndon said that hoped to use his fleeting fame to raise awareness of the difficulties that veterans can face at home.
""If we can do something about it, that's all I care about,"" he said.

"Elderly female pro-life counselor allegedly attacked outside abortion clinic — and left with broken leg, bleeding head",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/elderly-female-pro-life-counselor-allegedly-attacked-outside-abortion-clinic,"An elderly female pro-life counselor allegedly was attacked last week by a younger woman outside the only remaining abortion clinic in Kentucky, leaving the victim with a broken leg that required surgery and a bleeding head, LifeSite News reported .
The outlet said Donna Durning — an almost daily sidewalk counselor for over 20 years — was outside the E.M.W. Women's Surgical Center in Louisville when a younger woman who'd been inside the clinic crossed Durning's path.
Durning told LifeSiteNews the younger woman, who appeared to be in her early twenties, was heading toward a waiting car when ""she turned and looked at me, and I gave her a sweet little card ... I said, 'Honey, this is for you; if you want to talk to somebody there's a phone number there.' She grabbed me by both shoulders and literally threw me to the ground.""
Witnesses recorded the license plate of the vehicle that drove away with the young woman inside, and other pro-life activists attended to Durning prior to an ambulance's arrival, the outlet reported.
Adele Darnowski, a friend of victim, told LifeSiteNews ""police who were in a car across the street immediately entered the [clinic]"" and allegedly acquired surveillance tapes.
Darnowski posted a photograph on Facebook of what she said was Durning's blood still on the sidewalk the following day, noting that ""seventeen mothers walked over it today to go in to have their abortions. Poor dears.""
&lt;br&gt; What did a pro-life attorney have to say? Local pro-life attorney Vince Heuser added to the outlet that he'll make sure Durning's attacker is prosecuted: ""Pro-lifers do try to turn the other cheek, but beating up an old lady is not to be tolerated in anyone.""
'Hotbed' of protests As the sole remaining abortion clinic in Kentucky, E.M.W. Women's Surgical Center is a ""hotbed of both pro-life witness and pro-abortion demonstrations,"" LifeSite News said, adding that BSideU for Life Pregnancy Center is next door to the abortion clinic.
Durning added to LifeSiteNews she's usually outside the abortion clinic from 6:30 a.m. to 9:15 a.m., but on Friday she stayed the whole day to help less-experienced pro-life activists from her parish participating in 40 Days for Life.
Darnowski told the outlet that the day after the alleged attack on Durning ""there was a huge amount of activity"" outside the clinic: ""Operation Save America was there but not getting arrested that day. Two [police] cars [were] across the street. One hundred and ten of us pro-lifers including the group from Helpers of God's Precious Infants [were] across the street, and the Catholics praying the rosary, three different Protestant pastors with their megaphones, 10 or so pro-aborts taking turns playing carnival music on a boombox. ... By 8:30 p.m., 17 women had gone in.""
Durning is expected to make a full recovery and is undergoing five days of rehabilitation at Louisville's Nazareth Home, LifeSite News said.
Here's a report on E.M.W. Women's Surgical Center that aired in 2017:
Far from the first time Pro-life activists have been getting physically attacked outside abortion clinics with what appears to be a greater degree of frequency of late.
A pro-life activist in January had blood dripping down his face after getting punched by a man outside a Texas abortion clinic. What was the victim's crime? Telling the attacker that ""Jesus loves you.""

Toronto police arrested a 26-year-old man last fall for assault after a pro-life woman was ""roundhouse-kicked"" on a street corner during a silent protest .

A younger man was caught on video tossing an elderly pro-life demonstrator to the sidewalk in front of a San Francisco Planned Parenthood in March after the victim apparently tried to take back his banner. As the attacker kicked the victim, he's heard saying, ""Old man, stay on the ground!""

The next day, freelance journalist Yashar Ali noted on Twitter that ""Notre Dame will be well funded,"" and asked followers to join him in contributing to help rebuild the three black churches torched by an arsonist in Louisiana in recent weeks.
What are the details? Ali noted, ""In the past month, three historically black churches in Louisiana were destroyed by a racist arsonist. He has been charged with hate crimes, but these churches need your help.""
He then attached a link to a GoFundMe page supporting the reconstruction of the Baptist churches' ""sanctuaries, [and] for the purchase of all necessities lost in the fires, including pews, sound system, musical instruments, etc.""
Twitter followers from across the political spectrum jumped on board, with pledges coming from conservative pundit Ben Shapiro to CNN's Jake Tapper — raising hundreds of thousands of dollars in a matter of hours as Ali kept up the momentum.
Anything else? Over a span of 10 days, the St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, the Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas, and the nearby Mount Pleasant Baptist Church were all torched. A suspect was arrested last week, initially charged with arson; hate crime charges were tacked on the same suspect this week."

Snoop Dogg and other rappers are outraged at Laura Ingraham and want her fired — here's why,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/rappers-outraged-at-laura-ingraham,"Popular rapper Snoop Dogg and other black entertainers expressed outrage over comments Fox News host Laura Ingraham made about the funeral of Nipsey Hussle, a beloved rapper and community leader in Los Angeles, California.
Ingraham pointed out that Hussle recorded an expletive-ridden protest song against President Donald Trump, and went on to ridicule at the lyrics of the song.
Hussle, whose real name is Ermias Joseph Asghedom, was shot and killed outside of his store in South Los Angeles in March. His massive funeral was attended by many celebrities and leaders of the African-American community in celebration of his artistic contributions and political activism.
Rapper ""The Game"" called Ingraham a ""disrespectful c***"" and called on his 10.3 million followers on Instagram to demand she be fired by putting pressure on her advertisers.
""I'm asking all of my followers, fans, friends & family to spread this video with demands of #LauraIngrahams termination immediately "" he commented.
Snoop Dogg added simply, ""I'm in.""
Video of Ingraham's comments were also circulated on Twitter.
Rapper T.I. posted a video of Ingraham's comments and excoriated her reaction on his Instagram account.
""This is Disgusting! You both are vile despicable, poor excuses for people,"" he commented . ""Neither of you WILL EVER know or experience the level of love, appreciation and respect that Nip has... EVEN IN DEATH!!! So let that sizzle in ya lil hateful,demonic spirits.""
Actress Nia Long commented on his post, saying, ""Both need to be fired. PERIOD!!""
A petition with more than 40,000 signatures is being circulated for the purpose of terminating Ingraham from Fox News over the comments she made.
Four people were shot during the funeral procession for Hussle through Watts, and one later died.

"Christian university says it will not cave to backlash from outraged students, still plans to host Vice President Pence for commencement",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-university-will-not-cave-to-students-outraged-over-pence-address,"Taylor University in Indiana will still host Vice President Mike Pence as its keynote speaker at the Christian university's commencement ceremony despite opposition from angry students and former students.
What happened? Last week, dueling petitions emerged concerning Pence's scheduled appearance: One demanded that the school revoke its invitation for the vice president to speak during the commencement ceremony, and the other was a counter-petition.
Alex Hoekstra, an alumnus of the university, created the initial petition demanding that Pence be removed as a commencement speaker and insisted that by allowing Pence to speak at the school would make the university ""complicit in the Trump-Pence administration's policies.""
Another former student added that she was so shaken by the announcement that she felt ""physically ill.""
""I have never been made to feel so physically ill by an email before. Taylor University, you should be ashamed of yourselves,"" Claire Hadley wrote in a Facebook post . ""I am physically shaking. The fact that the school who claims to love and support me, and each of it's [sic] students and alum, would invite such a vile individual to speak on the most important day of the year??""
A portion of the counter-petition read , ""By Pence speaking at this upcoming graduation, Taylor is by no means aligning themselves with the alleged controversial views of the Trump administration, they are simply giving a voice to all opinions and planes of thought.""
So what's the school saying now? In a statement, university spokesperson James Garringer said that Pence would still be slated to speak at the college despite the petitions and negative feedback.
Garringer told the Independent Journal Review , ""Since making the announcement of Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming commencement speech, we have received feedback from people on either side of the issue. Taylor University is an intentional Christian community that strives to encourage positive, respectful, and meaningful dialogue.""
""We look forward to hosting the vice president next month,"" Garringer added."
Child traffickers are using our southern border and immigration laws to smuggle kids into the US for the sex trade. Here's what Congress can do to address it.,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/child-traffickers-are-using-our-southern-border-and-immigration-laws-to-smuggle-kids-into-the-us,"A few weeks ago I was called to testify before a subcommittee of the House Homeland Security Committee. As a former Homeland Security Special Agent/Undercover Operator that worked child-trafficking cases for over a decade along the southern border with Mexico, I was there to testify about the sex-trafficking threat that awaits vulnerable migrant children being illegally brought into the United States. Shortly after I began my testimony, the chairwoman of the committee politely, but firmly, stated on the record that my testimony was irrelevant for this particular hearing, as, she opined, this hearing was about the U.S. government's policy of separating undocumented families at the border — not about child trafficking.
As it is against hearing procedure for witnesses to provide unsolicited comments to members of the committee, I had to sit there in silence, yet with full knowledge, that the chairwoman was wrong. Any discussion of migrant family separation and/or reunification policies at our southern border is wholly incomplete without discussing the reality — an increasing number of children are being trafficked across the border. Not only is it real, but it thrives within the very policies intended to keep migrant children safe and with their families. And yet, nobody seems to acknowledge this reality, as it grows and grows right under our very noses.
To understand this reality and ongoing threat, we must first acknowledge certain trends accompanying the massive, record-breaking influx of undocumented migrants seeking entry into the United States at our southern borders. No longer are we seeing mostly single adult males coming to find work (as we did in the 90's and 2000's), rather we are now finding adults bringing thousands and thousands of children.
Since 2017, ther e has been a 136 percent increase in the number of children being brought illegally into the country through our southern border . The sheer number of children identified is shocking. But the real disturbing part is this: thousands of these children end up not belonging in any way to the adult migrants claiming them. Since 2017, there has been a whopping 314 percent increase in adults coming illegally through our southern border bringing children they claim to be theirs, but are not . In the last 10 months alone, there have been more than 1,700 documented cases of this stranger fraud .
So, what is going on? To identify the cause, you first should know that human smuggling organizations control the routes leading up to and through the southern border. Simply put, nobody is getting through the southern border without paying these smugglers. So, it is the smugglers who are taking children and pairing them with undocumented migrants and instructing the migrants to pretend they are the parents as they cross into the United States. And the reason is simple: if a migrant attempts to enter the United States through the port of entry with a child, U.S. policy dictates that child and ""parent"" must be released from custody within 20 days of their apprehension. The policy, backed by court precedent, is intended to quickly reunite children with their families. But, there is a hidden evil in this good intentioned policy. For this policy incentivizes smugglers and traffickers to use and abuse child victims.
Let me take you into the criminal mind of sex traffickers. They know the United States represents perhaps the highest demand for child sex in the world. (The U.S. regularly ranks as the highest consumer of child rape videos in the world.) Naturally, traffickers would like to get these children into the lucrative, illicit American sex markets. They also know it is easier to kidnap children in developing countries, such as those in Central America, as the likelihood of being caught is low.
But how do these criminals smuggle them in? Unfortunately, U.S. policy has provided the answer. Simply walk the child into the United States, with an illegal adult claiming the child is their child, and both will be released into the United States within 20 days. Or, if you prefer, send the child alone or unaccompanied, and then send somebody (perhaps your trafficking partner already in the U.S.) to show up at the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) offices and claim the child.
""Hello, I'm Uncle George and 6-year-old Isabel, who is in your custody, is my niece.""
That's all the trafficker needs to say, and CBP has no choice but to turn the child over; for the laws of the land, backed by court precedent, have forced their hand. Sure, the sponsor must sign for the child (like you would for a library book), promise to care for the child, and promise to bring the child back on the assigned court date before an immigration judge for either a deportation or asylum hearing. But guess what? Sixty-six percent of the children are never brought back for court. They are gone. Vanished forever. And nobody ever knows who ""Uncle George"" really was. And they likely never will.
And that's how you use U.S. laws to complete a child trafficking event.
The best case for these children (which is still abhorrent) is that they will be recycled back into Mexico and used as pawns in the hands of smugglers to get their illegal migrant clients into the United States. These kids become a ""get-out-of-jail-free"" card for the migrants being smuggled in. The other option, while absolutely unthinkable, is also a real possibility. Trends confirm that these children could easily end up being sold for sex, and raped thousands and thousands of times in the United States. I have personally been a part of the liberation and rehabilitation of these migrant child sex slaves in America.
Compare the above story with this: My wife and I recently adopted two children from another country. It took the United States, along with my children's home country, well over a year to vet me and my wife to ensure we were safe and would provide a good home for our children. And yet, Congress does nothing to protect these migrant children. They sit idly by and allow those who stake claim on these vulnerable migrant children to have the upper hand over CBP, who only has 20 days or less to vet sponsors coming to take the children away forever. Why should my children be any different from these migrant children? Why should we protect one child any more than another? This policy is absurd, inhumane, and completely unacceptable.
I call on Congress to drop the politics and come together (both parties!) for the children and solve this crisis. I don't have all the long-term answers, but I plead with Congress to make two immediate changes to mitigate this grave threat to children:
No. 1: Congress should pass legislation that provides CBP with the tools to develop protocols to only release children over to the custody of their families or designated, responsible adults and properly vetted adults. This may include international investigations and judicial identity hearings to find the real families of the children; for the separation of child and parent may have occurred long before the child ever crossed into the United States. To be clear, I'm not suggesting children be separated at any time from their families, only that unaccompanied minors not be systematically delivered to unverified strangers. Congress should also mandate and fund the use of rapid DNA technology (technology I have personally utilized) which can confirm genetic connections in a couple of hours.
No. 2: Congress should immediately pass legislation to mandate and fund the transfer of immigration and asylum courts to our U.S. embassies in foreign countries, starting with those in Central America. Immigrants and asylum seekers from those countries will no longer need to enter the United States to be heard, rather they will use the local, and more convenient, courts in their own countries to do their legitimate business with the United States. Migrants will be granted more rapid access and passage to the United States without having to drag themselves and their children across thousands of miles of unforgiving dessert, through multiple, dangerous countries, where they have to wait in precarious border towns to have their petitions adjudicated. If imminent and credible threats are chasing these applicants in their own countries, Congress could consider taking measures for their protection during adjudication.
Most importantly, this policy would crush the incentive for smugglers and traffickers to kidnap children and use them as pawns for smuggling schemes, or worse, to be used as sex slaves. For these criminals will not have their “20-day"" loophole. If they bring a child to the Port of Entry they will be told to return to the embassy in their country and take their legitimate petition to the immigration official there. Since they have no legitimate claim, they will stop their scheme; they will leave the children alone.
Currently, there is a mass immigration crisis at the border and it is getting worse. While the problems and the solutions in their entirety are not simple, one part is simple, we must do everything we can to stop children from being harmed. If we are willing to sit back, take a deep breath, drop the politics, and focus on one thing—doing right by the children, we are well on our way to providing a comprehensive solution to this problem. We must have the courage to take this important first step to address this crisis. Certainly, the protection of children is something that everyone can agree on.

Report: Twitter no longer uses the Southern Poverty Law Center to police hate speech on the site,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/twitter-no-longer-uses-the-southern-poverty-law-center-to-police-hate-speech-on-the-site,"Twitter has apparently severed its relationship with the Southern Poverty Law Center, which the social media site previously partnered with to police hate speech, The Daily Caller reported.
The SPLC has been dealing with several significant scandals in recent months, including the firing of co-founder Morris Dees for unspecified misconduct and allegations of racial bias and harassment within the organization.
What happened? The SPLC was listed by Twitter as a ""safety partner"" to fight ""hateful conduct and harassment"" on the social media site. However, an anonymous Twitter source told The Daily Caller that Twitter quietly ended that collaboration.
""The SPLC is not a member of Twitter's Trust and Safety Council or a partner the company has worked with recently,"" the source said.
What about other major tech companies? The Daily Caller reached out to Facebook, Amazon and Google to ask about the status of those companies' relationships with the SPLC, but has not received clear responses from them. All three of those companies partnered with the SPLC in some capacity in recent years.
What's wrong with the SPLC? Despite it's notoriety within the social justice and media contexts, the SPLC has developed a reputation for classifying Christian organizations as hate groups no different than neo-Nazi or white supremacist groups.
And, while the SPLC purports to fight for justice in public, the SPLC has been revealed to harbor a culture of harassment, racial bias, and hostile work conditions, according to some current and former employees.
After firing co-founder Dees, the SPLC announced that it would hire a firm to conduct an audit of the organization's operating procedures and culture.
Internal emails from SPLC workers point out ""problems — which employees said spanned from sexual harassment to gender- and race-based discrimination"" that appear to be ""systemic and widespread."""

"Newly released messages show Kim Foxx bashed Jussie Smollett, discussed case despite public recusal",www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/kim-foxx-text-messages-jussie,"Was Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx actually recused from the Jussie Smollett criminal case after she publicly declared she was?
That's the question many are asking after her office released a trove of emails and text messages related to the case.
What are the details? The messages, released Tuesday, show that after Foxx announced her recusal from the case on Feb. 19 because she said she had been in contact with a relative of Smollett, Foxx continued to internally discuss the case with her top aides, according to WBBM-TV .
Text messages reveal what Foxx really thought of Smollett and showed that she was concerned how the optics of the case reflected on her office.
""Sooo…...I'm recused, but when people accuse us of overcharging cases...16 counts on a class 4 [felony] becomes exhibit A,"" she wrote to Joe Magats, her top deputy, on March 8. ""Pedophile with 4 victims 10 counts. Washed up celeb who lied to cops, 16 [counts].""
The ""pedophile"" Foxx referred to is rapper R. Kelly, who has been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse.
""On a case eligible for deferred prosecution I think it's indicative of something we should be looking at generally. Just because we can charge something doesn't mean we should,"" Foxx went on to tell Magats.
WBBM obtained the messages through a Freedom of Information Act request.
Foxx's office shockingly announced last month that it was dropping all charges against Smollett. He had been charged with 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct for lying to police about being the victim of a hate crime. Instead, law enforcement said Smollett orchestrated a hoax.
In exchange for having his record cleaned, Smollett agreed to forfeit his $10,000 bail — which he posted after pleading not guilty to all charges — and perform a few hours of community service.
Still, the city of Chicago sued Smollett for an additional $130,000 last week to recoup the costs of the investigation into his alleged attack.
How did Foxx respond? Despite claiming last month that she did not officially, legally recuse herself from Smollet's case, instead only distancing herself from it out of an ""abundance of caution,"" Foxx on Tuesday defended her communications.
""After the indictment became public, I reached out to Joe to discuss reviewing office policies to assure consistencies in our charging and our use of appropriate charging authority,"" she said in a statement. ""I was elected to bring criminal justice reform and that includes intentionality, consistency, and discretion. I will continue to uphold these guiding principle."""
Christian school fires pastoral assistant for petitioning against transgender lessons at her young son's school,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/christian-school-fires-employee-for-petitioning-against-transgender-lessons,"A Christian school in Britain fired a pastoral assistant who posted online her objections to the transgender lessons being taught at her son's Church of England school.
The Farmor's School in Fairford, Gloucestershire, fired Kristie Higgs after she urged her Facebook followers to sign a petition against the government's relationships and sex education, which goes into effect in September 2020. The United Kingdom Department of Education's new guidelines dubbed ""No Outsiders"" would require children as young as 5 to receive LGBT lessons about relationships and gender reassignment.
On Tuesday, a disciplinary panel dismissed the 43-year-old mother, who worked at a separate school from the primary school her young son attended, after it found her guilty of ""gross misconduct"" and ""illegal discrimination,"" the Christian Legal Centre said in a press release .
What did she write on Facebook? Higgs wrote on her personal Facebook page that children are being brainwashed by educators. She asked other parents to sign the petition that she shared.
""Please sign this petition, they have already started to brainwash our innocent wonderfully created children and its [sic] happening in our local primary school now,"" she wrote, according to a press release the Christian Legal Centre sent to TheBlaze.
""Which means, for example, that children will be taught that all relationships are valid and 'normal,' so that same sex marriage is exactly the same as traditional marriage, and that gender is a matter of choice, not biology, so that it's up to them what sex they are,"" Higgs wrote.
""At the same time it means that expressing and teaching fundamental Christian beliefs, relating to the creation of men and women and marriage, will in practice become forbidden — because they conflict with the new morality and are seen as indoctrination into unacceptable religious bigotry,"" Higgs added.
In a separate post, the mother of two also voiced her objections to a pair of children's books at her son's school which feature LGBT stories. One story is about a boy who wants to wear a dress and the other is about a red crayon that learns it's really a blue crayon.
The panel determined Tuesday that Higgs' comments ""could bring the school into disrepute and damage the reputation of the school,"" according to the press release.
Higgs had worked at the secondary school for six years before her firing. Her employee record was unblemished up to her firing.
Was she fired because of her Christian beliefs? Higgs, who is challenging her firing, said she believes she was fired because of her Christian faith and beliefs. She is represented by the Christian Legal Centre.
""I have been punished for sharing concerns about Relationships and Sex Education. I hold these views because of my Christian beliefs, beliefs and views which are shared by hundreds of thousands of parents across the UK,"" she said in a statement via Christian Legal Centre. ""My number one concern has always been the effect that learning about sex and gender in school will have on children at such a young age.""
""As soon as the investigation into the posts began I was repeatedly told: 'this is nothing to do with your religion.' That was clearly a legal tactic and of course it has everything to do with my religion,"" she continued. ""I am determined to fight this case and to stand for Christians and all parents across the country who are being silenced for sharing and holding these views.""
The school claims it received a single email complaint about Higgs' comments. The complainant accused the woman of ""posting homophobic and prejudiced views.""
""We concluded that no action was taken because of your religion,"" the disciplinary panel said, according to the Christian Legal Centre. ""The disciplinary occurred for reasons other than your religion.""
""As an inclusive employer, Farmor's school recognizes and protects the statutory rights of its staff,"" the panel said. ""Such rights however are not absolute and we are concerned that you did not demonstrate an appropriate understanding of the school's requirement to respect and tolerate the views of others and to role model such behavior.""
The panel admitted that no damage had occurred to the school because of Higgs' Facebook posts.
""Regarding bringing the school into disrepute … we agree that there is no direct evidence that as a matter of fact that the reputation of the school has been damaged to date,"" the panel said in its decision.
What else? Muslim parents at a Birmingham school have also protested against the ""No Outsiders"" program, which some have called indoctrination.
""This is nothing but indoctrination of our children,"" Razina Mahmood, 40, told the Sun in an earlier interview. ""You are using our children as an experiment."""
Americans need to 'disagree better': Arthur Brooks on changing our 'culture of contempt',www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/glenn-beck-podcast/arthur-brooks-contempt,"In this episode of ""The Glenn Beck Podcast,"" Glenn sat down with Arthur Brooks , a New York Times bestselling author, professional French Horn player, and professor of economics and social entrepreneurship at Syracuse University. Brooks serves as the president of the American Enterprise Institute, a nationally recognized think-tank based in Washington, D.C., where he leads a community of scholars and supporters that are committed to expanding liberty, increasing individual opportunity, and strengthening free enterprise for all Americans.
He and Glenn discussed the ""culture of contempt"" that is so prevalent in today's political climate. Brooks pointed out how both liberals and conservatives in America seem ""unable to separate today's contemptuous ideas from the person promoting them,"" and he stressed the importance of learning to ""disagree better.""
""It's healthy to disagree because it leads to new and better solutions,"" Brooks said. ""But the contempt we so often include in those disagreements isn't necessary at all. In fact, it's dangerous and it makes progress for our nation nearly impossible. People are not defined by the political values they endorse.""

Mom pulls over to breastfeed her 3-week-old baby — then nearly gets towed before being slapped with parking ticket,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/mom-pulls-over-to-breastfeed-baby-gets-ticket,"Guillermina Rodriguez, a mother of four, was driving Thursday morning in congested midtown Manhattan traffic when her hungry 3-week-old baby began crying, WCBS-TV reported .
Image source: WCBS-TV video screenshot
""It was immense amount of traffic,"" she told the station. ""It took me 45 minutes to an hour just to get from 42nd to 30th Street.""
Her first order of business was getting her baby fed — which in Rodriquez's case means breastfeeding.
And when she finally found an open spot, Rodriquez nabbed it. That it was for commercial vehicles only didn't seem like an earth shattering deal.
""Even though I saw it was a commercial area, I'm like, 'I'm not obstructing the traffic. I'm not blocking anybody. Let me just stay there, and I'll breastfeed the baby there,'"" Rodriquez told WCBS.
So she got into the back seat and began breastfeeding her baby — but the relative quiet didn't last long.
What happened next?
A few minutes after she began to breastfeed, she said a NYPD tow truck pulled in front of her vehicle.
Image source: WCBS-TV video screenshot
""He's backing up to tow my truck, so as I am in this position breastfeeding now, I jump over to the front seat to honk so he can see, 'Don't tow my truck!'"" Rodriquez told the station.
Image source: WCBS-TV video screenshot
Then a ticket agent emerged, walked to Rodriguez's vehicle, WCBS said — and likely wasn't prepared for what he saw.
""I'm actually breastfeeding on one side and pumping on the other, so both my breasts are out, and I turn, and I'm like, 'I'm breastfeeding the baby!'"" she recounted to the station with a laugh. ""He turned and looks, and he's like, 'Oh OK.'""
Except it wasn't completely ""OK"" — the official slapped a $115 ticket on Rodriquez's windshield before leaving, she told WCBS.
Image source: WCBS-TV video screenshot
""I'm here breastfeeding,"" she's heard saying on video she recorded of the incident. ""He just gave me a ticket.""
What did police have to say?
The NYPD told the station that the traffic agent wrote the ticket before he saw Rodriguez breastfeeding and that his hands were tied since agents can't void tickets. WCBS added that authorities didn't offer a reason why the agent didn't first check the vehicle before readying to tow it.
'More sensitive' and 'more educated' ""I think they should've been more sensitive,"" Rodriquez told the station, adding that breastfeeding mothers should be exempted from fines.
""I think getting them a little more educated on that area would be helpful,"" she also told WCBS.
Rodriguez also told the station she plans on disputing her ticket — and hopes the judge is a parent.

Image source: KMSP-TV video screenshot
What happened? Officers tried to stop a stolen vehicle that was being driven recklessly and fleeing cops, speeding down side streets and alleyways, St. Paul Police Department spokesperson Mike Ernster told the station, adding that officers soon lost sight of the vehicle.
But police then learned of a crash involving the stolen vehicle, KMSP noted, and several vehicle occupants reportedly fled into the neighborhood.
As police were searching for vehicle's occupants, they heard gunfire — and soon found the driver of the stolen vehicle lying in the yard of a house, the station said. He'd been wounded by multiple gunshots, KMSP said.
Image source: KMSP-TV video screenshot
A man armed with a handgun identified himself as the homeowner and was found with the driver, the station said.
The 36-year-old homeowner cooperated with police and surrendered the gun, Ernster told KMSP, adding that the driver of the stolen vehicle was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
'No trespassing. Violators will be shot. Survivors will be shot again!' A sign in the window of the home where the shooting occurred reads, ""No trespassing. Violators will be shot. Survivors will be shot again!"" the station reported.
The stolen vehicle's other occupants haven't been located, KMSP said, adding that the driver was wanted in St. Paul for a separate auto theft.
In its video report of the incident, KMSP said it's not known if the homeowner has a permit for the gun, if the driver of the stolen vehicle was armed, or if the shooting was justified.
A woman claiming to be the mother of the stolen vehicle's driver said her son was ordered off the property, turned to comply, but was shot three times in the arm, rear end, and leg, the station added in its video report.
The below report aired prior to the homeowner's arrest:"
Campus police chief put on leave for 'liking' pro-Trump tweets,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/campus-police-chief-put-on-leave-for-liking-pro-trump-tweets,"The campus police chief for Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges was placed on administrative leave last week after school administrators caved to students protesting his recent appointment because he previously ""liked"" tweets supportive of President Donald Trump.
What are the details? Chief Daniel Hect was hired for the post at the all-women colleges in January, after serving in the same position at two Ohio universities during his 30 years in law enforcement. Following the hiring announcement, Mount Holyoke students dug into Hect's Twitter feed and discovered he had ""liked"" tweets that were ""almost exclusively in response to President Trump's tweets and included anti-immigration, pro-gun rights and racist sentiments,"" Smith College's newspaper, The Sophian , reported.
The chief's Twitter account has since been deleted, but according to The Sophian, he had the audacity to endorse messages from other users that stated, ""Stay the course Pres. Trump,"" and ""BUILD THAT WALL!!"" Hect reportedly also liked a few tweets from the NRA, one of which read, ""The National Rifle Association wishes you and your family a very Merry Christmas!"" and another stated, ""If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.""
According to The Daily Wire 's Kassy Dillon — whose alma mater is Mount Holyoke — ""other tweets were from President Trump discussing the border wall and the government shutdown."" The specific contents of those messages were not available.
Students were horrified. Hect agreed to a number of community forums and listening sessions to hear their concerns. During one discussion covered by the Mount Holyoke newspaper , Hect repeatedly expressed his ""sincere regret"" over his behavior on social media and denounced the president, saying:
Donald Trump's viewpoints do not represent our country very well. When [Trump] did something that I thought he did well, I wanted to like [his tweets in reference to those successes] in hopes to lead to more good behavior. I do not support President Trump. The hate that comes out of the White House is not okay. Hect's explanations and apologies fell flat.
After students continued to protest his appointment, Mount Holyoke President Sonya Stephens emailed students last Wednesday night to say, ""Over the past few weeks, members of our community have expressed concerns about the ability of Chief Daniel Hect to develop the level of trust required to engage in community policing. In light of this, Chief Hect, who leads campus police at Mount Holyoke and Smith Colleges, has been placed on administrative leave,"" the Washington Examiner reported.
Anything else? Michelle Dang, president of the Mount Holyoke College Republicans, responded to news of Hect's punishment by telling Campus Reform , ""I reckon this unfair treatment toward Chief Daniel, a well-respected military veteran who has never allowed his viewpoints to affect his service. I'm fearful for my own well-being here in Mount Holyoke. What if the same instance happens to me, will the college then pressure me to leave or put me on expulsion?"""
Beto O’Rourke was asked why he doesn’t donate much to charity. He responds that his ‘sacrifice’ is running for office,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/beto-orourke-sacrifices-by-running-for-office,"Robert Francis ""Beto"" O'Rourke and his wife don't give that much of their income to charity, but he says that's OK since he's spent so much of his life running for and holding public office.
Here's the background: Recent analysis of tax documents from 2020 Democratic presidential candidates puts O'Rourke at the bottom of the list of Democratic donors to charity. In fact, the O'Rourkes reported donating only $1,166 out of $370,412 in 2017. That's 0.3 percent .
When asked about the paltry percentage at a recent campaign event in Virginia, the Texas Democrat countered by saying that he gives in ways that can't be quantified on a tax return, like running for president.
""I've served in public office since 2005. I do my best to contribute to the success of my community, of my state and, now, of my country,"" the candidate said. ""There are ways that I do this that are measurable and there are ways that I do this are immeasurable.""
O'Rourke went on to add that ""There are charities that we donate to that we've recorded and itemized, others that we have donated to that we have not.""
But here's the kicker quote: ""But I will tell you, I'm doing everything that I can right now, spending this time with you — not with our kiddos, not back home in El Paso — because I want to sacrifice everything to make sure that we meet this moment of truth with everything we've got.""
This answer could very easily backfire on O'Rourke.
Just for reference, the idea of ""sacrificing everything"" is typically invoked when someone gives their life for a cause such as dying in combat or the line of duty as a first responder or when they've been made a martyr for their faith. It's not a phrase typically heard or expected when discussing the various inconveniences of going around the United States to campaign stops in a bid to take over the Oval Office."
William Barr declares that asylum seekers who enter the US illegally do not have to be released if they post bond,www.theblaze.com,https://www.facebook.com/140738092630206,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www.theblaze.com/news/ready-william-barr-rules-that-asylum-seekers-who-enter-the-u-s-illegally-do-not-have-to-be-released-if-they-post-bond,"Attorney General WIlliam Barr has ordered U.S. immigration officials to stop releasing asylum seekers on bond who crossed into the United States illegally before they requested asylum.
Here's what we know This new rule applies only to asylum seekers who have been determined to have a ""credible fear of prosecution or torture"" and are also facing expedited removal (which, Barr explained, happens when an applicant ""lack[s] entry documentation or seek[s] admission through fraud or misrepresentation"").
Formerly, according to the Department of Justice, asylum seekers who otherwise would have been subject to expedited removal would be be eligible for bond if they can prove that they have a ""credible fear."" In his reasoning for the new rule , Barr wrote ""I conclude that such aliens remain ineligible for bond, whether they are arriving at the border or are apprehended in the United States."" Without the ability to post bond (which Barr stated costs ""at least $1,500""), these illegal immigrants would have to wait in detention centers until their requests are processed. According to NBC News , this could take months or as much as a year.
There is an exception for immigrants with ""serious medical conditions,"" and asylum seekers who are being detained can still be granted parole. It will now be up to the Department of Homeland Security to decide whether or not to release these asylum seekers on a case by case basis.
It does not affect anyone who has claimed asylum at legal ports of entry and did not cross the border illegally.
Barr wrote that this new rule would not go into effect ""for 90 days so that DHS may conduct the necessary operation planning"" since it would require the department to house a ""sizable population of aliens"" who are currently ""eligible for bond.""
Approximately, 161,000 people claimed asylum last year."

Local law enforcement say that 5-foot, 6-inch, 300-pound Antonio Mosely was trying to break into the vehicle of 65-year-old Clarese Gainey early Sunday morning. When she saw that, she says she took a stand against the alleged burglar.
""I grab my bat, I brace myself, and I ease the door open,"" Gainey told WGFL-TV . After that, she says Mosely charged her. But she was ready for him.
""I took that bat and hit him upside the head like, 'Piyah!'"" Ganey said. ""He said, 'Ow!'""
Police said that Mosely then ran away to a mobile home park, where they apprehended him in a new pair of pants that had a bag of cocaine in the pocket. He's being held on charges of burglary and drug possession.
""He better be glad I didn't have a gun,"" Ganey said. ""Because I would have shot him!"""
