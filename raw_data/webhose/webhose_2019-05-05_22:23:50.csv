Madrid, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Zinedine Zidane expressed his admiration for Eden Hazard on Friday ahead of an expected move for the Chelsea forward from Real Madrid this summer.
Hazard's contract expires in June 2020 and he is yet to sign a new deal, leaving Chelsea in a difficult position if they want to avoid losing the Belgian for free.
After last year's World Cup, he admitted ""it might be time for something different"" while in October , he said it would be a ""dream"" to play for Real Madrid , ""the best club in the world "".
Asked about Hazard at a press conference before Madrid 's La Liga game against Eibar on Saturday, Zidane said: ""He is a player I have always rated, as everyone knows.
""He is a player that has played in France , that I have watched a lot and that I know personally. There's nothing new about what I think of him as a player. He's a fantastic player."" Real Madrid have certainly struggled for goals this season.
They have scored 26 fewer than Barcelona in the league and rarely threatened Valencia on Tuesday, when they were beaten 2-1 at Mestalla.
""I know the numbers and it has cost us,"" Zidane said. ""This year we have had difficulty scoring. Will we change things? Yes."" Barcelona play at home to second-placed Atletico Madrid on Saturday, meaning Real can close the gap on the top two if they overcome Eibar at the Santiago Bernabeu.
But they are five points behind Atleti and 13 adrift of Barca while the loss to Valencia in midweek exposed their weaknesses both in attack and defence.
""I'm not worried,"" Zidane said. ""This season has been difficult and I cannot say in two minutes what has happened but there are things that you have to accept.
""We know what all these players have won, not just in my time, but in the last five, six, seven years. We are going to try to turn it around, the club needs change, to win again, to do great things and that's what I'm here for.
""Our problems on the pitch? We accept them. Fewer people in the stadium? We accept it. But we must not forget what these players have done either. I'm not worried at all .""Dani Carvajal returned to training on Friday after recovering from a thigh injury but Thibaut Courtois is unlikely to be available after missing the session, along with Vinicius Junior and Marcos Llorente.

""We are more than confident when it comes to our pilots and our training academy . .. To have this proven in a supportive report means a lot. It is reaffirming the confidence that we have in our pilots. This report, even though it is preliminary, it supports our reality,"" Nema said.
The full report will be available within a year.

""We have the most technologically-advanced aircraft, the 787 Dreamliner, both the 800 and the 900 � we have 24 of them. They are efficient, effective, and technologically-advanced. They are reliable, they are safe � so this [737 MAX 8] is a single case. I would doubt if it affects our relationship, which has lasted for decades,"" Nema said.
When asked about the possibility of the airline launching legal action against Boeing, Nema stressed that this matter fell under the attorney general's jurisdiction.

PARIS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt on Friday said that Russia had a ""thought through"" strategy of meddling in political processes in Western countries in order to spark domestic discord.
""We know that states like Russia have got a very active, planned, thought-through strategy to interfere in democratic process in Western countries and sow dissension and chaos whenever they can. We now this has happened in the United States , we now it's happened in Ukraine ,"" Hunt said a press conference ahead of the G7 Foreign Ministers' meeting .

LAHORE, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Pakistan Olympic Association Friday said that it has not made any interaction with media regarding preparations plans of Pakistan contigent for South Asian Games and a meeting with Federal Minister Fehmida Mirza.
This is regarding PSB's email about preparation plans of South Asian Games wherein PSB has made reference to an article published in section of press on March 18th incorrectly attributing it to a ""leak"" of POA's letter of March 08th, that too after almost a month. The reason and timing of PSB's statement are unknown and would not be helpful for the cause of sports in any manner. Who would it benefit? Definitely not POA and neither the IPC, said Secretary,POA,Mohammad Khalid Mahmood here.
""As far meeting requested by President, POA, Lt Gen retd Syed Arif Hasan with the Federal IPC Minister ,it could not be held due to commitments of both. It will be held in near future where we will take up this matter as well,""he said.
""It would have been best for mutual interest and cooperation if PSB had directly contacted and confirmed POA's version and that would have definitely avoided speculations. We are working for a national cause, therefore POA will not indulge itself further into these non-productive and elusive misstatements by PSB, in order to safeguard the interests of athletes and Pakistani sports ,"" said POA official.
He made it clear that POA, is an autonomous entity, that has not requested any assistance for itself but for one of most cherished segment of society i.e. athletes who must be given due priority.
""Not only in Pakistan but governments across the world facilitate the development and training of sportsmen and encourage participation in international events and the same is enshrined in PSB rules. Similarly conduct of international events require infrastructural development as well as sovereign guarantee for participants apart from various other security, administrative and financial requirements which PSB is aware of and was also briefed by POA in wake of recent visa refusal to the Pakistani athletes by India . UN has also passed resolutions on these very grounds urging governmental support for holding events in their countries,""he asserted.
The continuous efforts of Government of Pakistan and state institutions who are doing utmost to bring international teams to Pakistan are known to all and in this context POA had forwarded a request to Ministry of IPC to lead the way in region through sports , which unfortunately has been used in a context it was not meant for, said Khalid Mehmood.
However PSB's remark over 'no significant performance' is an admission in itself by PSB for PSB. Who is responsible for development of sports comparable to International standards is best known to PSB. Also known to them is the process of bidding and the sovereign guarantees required for holding any International event . If they didn't they should have learnt in the recent events in which strict actions have been taken against countries for violation of the same . "" We are hopeful that the Government of Pakistan will take necessary measures for the preparations of forthcoming South Asian Games as well as conduct of next Chapter of South Asian Games in Pakistan which will go long way towards the national development,""he concluded.

.:Prime Minister Imran Khan, wearing tribal turban, lauded the patriotism and bravery of tribal people, who he said always stood with the government and country's armed forces in the hour of need.
He said the people of tribal areas fought alongside the armed forces during the war with India in 1948, when the people of Kashmir were being subjugated to tyranny by the Indian forces, as well as in the 1965 war.
The prime minister, who has been a critic of sending army in tribal areas on the desire of the United States, said the people of tribal areas had to face many hardships during the war against terrorism including displacement, loss of business and agriculture, destruction of houses and so on.
He assured the tribal people that his government would make every effort to compensate their losses by creating job opportunities for youth, offering them interest-free loans for establishing or reviving their businesses, adding, it was the government's responsibility which it would fulfill.
The prime minister said he had directed the federal and provincial Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments to make necessary arrangements for 24-hour opening of Torkhum Border so as to promote unhindered trade in the area.
He announced the construction of Jabba and Bara dams in district Khyber, which would ensure the provision of potable water to one million people and irrigate 17,000 hectares of land in the area, respectively.
He also announced the construction of Bara By-Pass to ease the flow of traffic in the area.
The prime minister said he would try to ensure increased supply of electricity and gas utilities in the area.
He referred to the unprecedented economic challenges facing the country and said those comparing the PTI government with the PML-N and PPP should better compare the situation after the PTI completed its five-year term.
The prime minister said the PPP and PML-N took the country's debt to Rs30,000 billion in ten years of their rule from Rs6,000 billion and Rs15,000 billion in 2008 and 2013, respectively.
He said the PTI government was paying Rs6.5 billion per day in debt-servicing for the huge loans taken by the PPP and PML-N governments.
Giving an overview of the country's economic condition, the prime minister said Pakistan , which collected Rs4,500 billion per annum in revenue, had to spend Rs 2,000 billion for debt repayment.
He, however, expressed his confidence that with the present government taking effective cost-cutting measures and attracting foreign investment, the country would come out of this hard economic phase within the next few months. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

WASHINGTON (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The United States , United Kingdom and France said in a joint statement on Friday that they are committed to holding the perpetrators of chemical attacks in the Syrian towns of Duma and Khan Sheikhoun responsible for their actions.
""The OPCW's [Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons] Investigation and Identification Team will now work to identify the perpetrators of chemical weapons use in Syria , an important step in ensuring accountability,"" the statement said. ""The United States , the United Kingdom and France reaffirm their strong resolve to work jointly in achieving this practical goal.""
The United States and its allies have repeatedly accused the Syrian government of President Bashar Assad developing toxic agents and applying them as weapons against the Syrian population. Washington has accused Damascus for the April 7, 2018 reported chemical attack on Duma and the April 4, 2017 suspected use of chemical weapons in Khan Sheikhoun.
The Syrian government has denied the allegations and Syrian - as well as Russian - officials have said the incidents were likely staged to justify Western military intervention. Following the reports of the attack in Duma, the United States and its allies fired more than 100 missiles on what they claimed were Syrian government chemical weapons sites.
The joint statement said the Syrian government was shielded from being held immediately accountable for using chemical weapons, in particular in the UN Security Council, with the dismantling of the independent investigative mechanism designed to attribute responsibility for chemical weapons attacks in Syria .
""Responsible states have remained committed to upholding the prohibition against chemical weapons and ensuring that there will be no impunity for those who use, seek to use, or protect those who use these weapons, in particular by strengthening the OPCW,"" the statement said.
On March 1, the OPCW published a report on the results of its investigation of the Duma incident in which it claims that a toxic chemical, most likely chlorine, was used in the attack .
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted by saying the OPCW had ignored the evidence provided by Russia and Syria , which confirmed that the attack had been staged by the White Helmets and expressed concern the document sought to justify foreign strikes against Syria .
Residents of Duma, interviewed by Sputnik, were unable to confirm that a chemical attack had taken place there. The residents said they knew nothing about such an attack and were not aware of anybody having been affected by toxic chemicals. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

House Democrats sue Trump administration over border wall,www.conservativeinstitute.org,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.conservativeinstitute.org/conservative-news/pelosi-lawsuit-trump-border.htm,"House Democrats sue Trump administration over border wall April 5, 2019 Image Source: Screenshot
After failing to stop President Donald Trump’s wall at the U.S.-Mexico border through legislative action, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is taking the president to court. Lawfare
In a Thursday press release announcing the House lawsuit, Pelosi accused Trump of “stealing from appropriated funds” to pay for the planned border wall project. The president vetoed Congress last month after lawmakers voted to block Trump from redirecting military funds to the wall.
“The president’s action clearly violates the Appropriations Clause by stealing from appropriated funds, an action that was not authorized by constitutional or statutory authority,” Pelosi said in a statement.
After experiencing a 35-day government shutdown over wall funding, where Democrats agreed to pay just $1.4 billion of the nearly $6 billion requested by the president, Trump circumvented Congress by invoking the National Emergencies Act . Title 10 of the US Code states clearly that “the Secretary of Defense, without regard to any other provision of law, may undertake military construction projects, and may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to undertake military construction projects, not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.”
Although the White House plans to use at least $3 billion in Pentagon civil works funds for the wall, Trump also has access to revenue that doesn’t require a national emergency to spend, including $2 billion in counter-narcotics funds, $681 million from Treasury forfeiture funds, and $200 million from the Department of Homeland Security. However, the president was forced to use his veto powers in March after both the House and the Senate voted on a resolution to block the president’s plan.
“I know the president has the votes to pursue his approach,” Ohio Sen. Rob Portman said before the vote. “But I continue to hope the president uses the funds he has available to him without creating a bad precedent, having some of the needed funds tied up in the courts and taking money from important military projects.”
For his part, Trump responded with a one-word tweet which set up the current legal battle: “Veto!” he wrote. Litigious liberals
As predicted, a coalition of 16 states sued the federal government in February to halt the defense appropriations, while four more states initiated lawsuits of their own a month later. Democrats point to an example established by Republican lawmakers during the Obama administration, when the GOP sued the president for moving unallocated funds to pay for the Affordable Care Act.
However, Obama didn’t make use of the National Emergencies Act when he abused his executive authority by diverting funds to his socialist health care program. Therefore, the two lawsuits are hardly the same, and Trump has a legitimate justification for moving forward with his military spending plan.
Federal judges eventually ruled in favor of Republicans in the Obamacare case, but a showdown at the Supreme Court never occurred due to Trump’s election. Legal analysts who spoke to the Washington Times said that Democrats are at a legal disadvantage since they already tried to stop the military wall spending through traditional legislative action.
Since Trump has already used the military to assist the border patrol at the southern border, White House lawyers should have no problem convincing federal courts that a genuine emergency exists at the southern border. Last year, over 400,000 illegal aliens were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border, and thousands of immigrants are being released out into American neighborhoods due to a shortage of beds in detention centers.
Democrats have become the party of open borders and obstruction, and American citizens are paying the price. It’s time to end the political grandstanding, once and for all. JOIN THE MOVEMENT. Add your best email address below to start receiving news alerts. Sign Up Privacy Policy Benjamin Baird

TOKYO (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The South Korean government will give humanitarian aid worth $3 million to crisis-hit Venezuela , as well as Colombia , Peru and Ecuador , all three of which have been facing rising numbers of Venezuelan migrant arrivals, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said on Friday.
""The government decided to provide $3 million Dollars in humanitarian aid to Venezuela , which is suffering from unprecedented economic difficulties, as well as to Colombia , Peru and Ecuador , which have accepted a great number of Venezuelan refuges,"" the ministry said.
Seoul plans to offer Venezuela $1 million for medical supplies and food . The remaining $2 million is supposed to help Colombia , Ecuador and Peru house Venezuelan refugees .
According to the UN International Organization for Migration, there are currently 3.4 million Venezuelan refugees worldwide. Ecuador , Peru , Chile , the United States , Panama , Mexico , Spain , Argentina , Brazil and Costa Rica remain the main destinations for Venezuelan migrants. Colombia tops the list with over one million refugees , followed by Peru with over 500,000 people, and Ecuador and Chile with over 200,000 people in each.
The out-migration rates in Venezuela rose dramatically between 2017 and 2018 , according to the UN Refugee and Migrant Response Plan. The document says that over 5,000 Venezuelans are leaving their country every day, and, if the current trend continues, the number of Venezuelan refugees is expected to reach 5.3 million people by the end of 2019 .
The Venezuelan migration crisis has been ongoing for months against the backdrop of an acute economic crisis and political turmoil. The situation in Venezuela escalated in January when Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido illegally proclaimed himself interim president, contesting last year's re-election of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Guaido has received support from the United States and a number of other countries. China , Cuba , Russia and and other states have endorsed Maduro as Venezuela 's only legitimate president.

ISLAMABAD, Apr 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :Health experts on Friday advised parents to improve the immune system of their children to fight invading bacteria and viruses.
According to them, Zinc had beneficial health effects for all ages, especially in children to improve their immune system's capacity and supplementary zinc is beneficial for children with diarrhea.
They said Zinc supplementary was a vital micronutrient essential for protein synthesis, cell growth and differentiation, immune function, and intestinal transport of water and electrolytes.
Zinc was also used proteins and DNA synthesis as it improves growth and development in children during pregnancy, infancy, and childhood, National Programme Manager, Child Survival and Development, Shehzad Afzal said.
He said with the support of Nutrition International, the Government of Sindh has trained Lady Health Workers (LHW) and their supervisors (LHS) in this regard.
He added messages related to zinc supplementation dosage, frequency of zinc supplementation, water , sanitation and hygiene (WASH), exclusive breastfeeding were also disseminated to LHWs, LHSs and district Coordinators in Sindh .
They have been provided with zinc dispersible tablets supplements and ORS by the government . The LHWs are capable of treating uncomplicated diarrhea however, for severe cases they have to refer the child to the nearest health facility, he added.
He said there were multiple reasons for a child to get in the under-nutrition trap, and diarrhea was one of the major causes. Diarrhea leads to excessive loss of nutrients from body even though a child may have consumed sufficient quantity of calories or nutrients.
""When a child gets intestinal infection due to a bacteria or other micro-organism, he or she develops diarrhoea. These bugs attach themselves to the lining of the intestine, and interfere with the absorption of water and other essential nutrients,"" Dr Wasim Khawaja, a medical practitioner at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) said.
He added there are many reasons of happening of diarrhea like most of the times, the body's natural protective mechanism helps recover the disease and overcomes the micro-organisms. Other times, the bug may be strong enough to be overcome by the body's natural protective mechanism, or is in too large of a quantity for the body's defense mechanism to clear it.
""In that case the child needs to see a doctor , and appropriate treatment need to be started,"" Dr Khawaja said.
He said the diarrhea is a very common condition, but treatment is very simple. If there is no blood in diarrhea, the child may not need to be given antibiotic and only a qualified health care provider may prescribe antibiotic for a diarrhoeal episode.

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) The possible meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Estonian counterpart, Kersti Kaljulaid, in Moscow is being prepared, Russian presidential Aide Yury Ushakov said on Friday.
In late March , the Estonian presidential office said that Kaljulaid would visit Moscow on April 18 to attend the opening of the renovated Estonian embassy building in the Russian capital. On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had received a request for the meeting between the two leaders during Kaljulaid's visit , and the talks were being prepared.
""The issue is being worked on,"" Ushakov told reporters.

Never a dull moment with Sara Foster‘s daughters!
The actress, 38, shared a slew of vacation photos on Friday from a family trip to Aspen, Colorado, with her husband Tommy Haas and their two daughters — including a hilarious photo that showed her youngest daughter, Josephine Lena, 3, flipping off the camera.
“Feels like I’m really nailing this parenting thing,” Foster jokingly captioned the image.
In the silly photo, Josephine wears a matching grey sweatsuit with colorful stripes on the side as her big sister Valentina Evelyn, 8, watches from the side.
Sara’s sister, Erin Foster, left a sassy message in the comments section, writing, “You’re not really with her enough to be a bad influence.”
Sharing the same photo on her Instagram Story, Sara continued to poke fun at the situation, writing, “That’s what I get after taking her to Aspen for 10 days…”

“I like tubing in Aspen and I can’t believe it… I just really love Aspen,” she said in the clip. “But sometimes I hate Aspen… but sometimes I don’t.”
Although Josephine hasn’t quite made up her mind about Aspen, she’s already a master on the slopes!
In a video that showed her youngest daughter in action, Foster joked that Josephine was “3 and skiing blues” while she was “100 and barely getting on the lift.”

Not long after Susan Orfanos returned from identifying her son as a victim of last November’s Thousand Oaks, Calif., shooting, a news crew pulled up to her home.
Her first thought was to ask them to leave, but her anger at what happened to her 27-year-old son — one of 12 victims fatally shot inside the Borderline Bar & Grill — took over.
“I don’t want prayers,” she told reporters on Nov. 8. “I don’t want thoughts. I want gun control.”
Orfanos’ emotional plea for gun-control legislation went viral and she became an unintentional activist.
“I’ve never been so angry in my life — ever,” Orfanos, 59, recalls in this week’s issue of PEOPLE. “I just couldn’t control my rage. We loved our son. He was supposed to come home that night and he didn’t.”
Tel, an inventory manager at a car dealership and a part-time bouncer at Borderline, had gone to the bar that night to hang out with friends. It had become a sanctuary of sorts after he survived another mass shooting: the 2017 rampage in Las Vegas that killed more than 50 concertgoers at a country music festival.
“Tel mattered and all those other people matter,” Orfanos says “I can’t stay silent.”

Since that fateful November day, Orfanos, her husband Marc and their youngest son have lobbied for stronger gun laws. They are pushing for federally mandated background checks for all gun sales.
Orfanos, who works as a project manager for an insurance company, wrote an op-ed just weeks after her son’s death, pleading for an end to the bloodshed.
“I woke up this morning realizing that Tel was one of approximately 35,000 victims of gun violence for 2018,” she wrote. “The violence must stop. We need to stop the money that FUNDS this violence. Tell your senators, your congresspeople, that this MUST stop. Go to your local Moms Demand Action meeting. DO SOMETHING. ANYTHING. NO ONE is exempt. And lightning strikes twice.”

TALLINN (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 05th April, 2019) Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid said Friday she supported sanctions against Russia and wanted to discuss them with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their upcoming meeting.
Kaljulaid will arrive in Moscow on April 18 to attend the opening of the renovated Estonian Embassy. Tallinn has reported that Kaljulaid wants to meet with Putin during her stay. According to the Russian president's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, Moscow did get the request from Estonia , and is now getting ready for negotiations.
""We will definitely discuss complicated topics such as the implementation of the Minsk agreements or sanctions against Russia that are usually considered by the leaders of the other EU states. Estonia is a state that supports the prolongation of the sanctions,"" the president said, adding that the agenda of her visit was still being prepared and would be approved next week.
The Estonian leader also said that she was also going to discuss the situations in Georgia and Ukraine with the Russian president.
A member of the Estonian Conservative People's Party and new Estonian Parliament speaker, Henn Polluaas, who was denied entry to Russia in 2018 , has condemned the president's intention to visit Russia . So did the former Estonian foreign minister, Marina Kaljurand, and other Estonian politicians.
However, the president said that she saw no reasons not to meet with Vladimir Putin .
""Many leading EU politicians meet with Putin ,"" she said.
According to Russian Ambassador to Estonia Aleksander Petrov, Kersti Kaljulaid's upcoming visit to Moscow will open a new chapter in relations between the neighboring nations, which lacked a dialogue at the highest level.
Relations between Russia and a number of Western countries, including Estonia , have deteriorated due to the situations in Ukraine and around Crimea. After the peninsula joined Russia , the West imposed sanctions on Moscow . Russia retaliated with a trade embargo."

Why are suicides in Azerbaijan increasing?,ednews.net,,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/specialist-view/361397-why-are-suicides-in-azerbaijan-increasing,"1 2 3 4 5 Why are suicides in Azerbaijan increasing? A- A A+
8th-grade pupil attempted suicide
Today, in the morning, another teenager tried suicide. According to Eurasia Diary, the 8th grade student at secondary school No. 162 in Sabail district took the floor from the 3rd floor. A student receiving various degrees of physical exertion (for relevant reasons, the student's name is not mentioned) is hospitalized, his condition remains severe at the moment. During the incident, the teenager had a cutting tool in his hand. According to preliminary information, there are certain problems in the student's family. Apparently, the number of suicides in Azerbaijan is increasing every year. There is an idea that their number has not increased and that suicidal events are broadcasted in mass media. Elmir Akbar, psychotherapist-psychoanalyst of the ""Logos"" Center for Psychological and Speech Development, told Eurasia Daily that was idea wrong.
What is the cause of suicides in Azerbaijan ?
It’s clear from the appeals that there is a real increase in the number of suicides. Let us note that attempting suicide does not depend on whether the character is weak or strong. One reason for the increase in suicides is that society has developed and the form of communication between people has changed dramatically. First, it was the tension that existed between people. A second reason is that people in the family do not care much about each other, and the increase of indifference and indifference in society and in the family. During Soviet times the borders were closed. When the boundary of a large system is bound, the boundaries of smaller systems are opened. According to him, the video about the three girls in recent days shows that there is no sincerity between the parents in the family, They don`t report when leaving the house and so on.
""Communication fractures also play a role in the occurrence of suicides. Along with the transition from one structure to another in Azerbaijan, the Karabakh problem also acts as a side effect. But with the development of psychotherapy in progress countries this was eliminated. The number of Appeals currently falls below the number of suicides in Azerbaijan. People still want to prevent suicide by going to the side of the wizard. It is a pity that many specialists also do not have proper education and experience. Instead of paying more attention to psychotherapy in Azerbaijan, the specialty of a psychotherapist was abolished. All over the world, specialists on branches such as psychotherapist analyst, psychotherapist, neurologist are already trained. We can’t prevent suicide with such an approach. One of the greatest ways to commit suicide is depression. If a person says that the world has changed, lost its color, I can’t enjoy what I enjoyed before, and if he finally says that I have already lost the meaning of life, it should cause serious concern. At this time, only the reception of medicines will lead to the emergence of dependence,"" the expert said.
""The death of a psychologist was not a suicide, but a conspiracy""
What does a psychologist do when he was in a difficult psychological situation? It can also be a problem in the life of a psychologist. Two years ago, everyone was shocked by the news that the psychologist Deyanat Rzayev, who spoke with expert opinions on suicides in the local media, tried to stop people from suicides. The expert believes that the murder of a famous psychologist is a conspiracy. “He had ideas about various wealthy, businessman. The relatives of Dayanat and people in close contact with him all said that this death was a murder. The conditions in which he found his corpse caused him to say this. In addition, psychologists themselves sustain the procedure every week, at least one supervisor and one therapy. Therefore, it is impossible for Deyanat Rzayev to die by suicide,” said Elmir Akbar. At the same time, the news of suicide in the media also manifests itself as a psychological effect, when a person with a weak or difficult psychological state of a teenager or other person reads this news, the psychological effect is felt. In the event of suicide, along with other studies, a pchisological examination should be performed. For example, in 1968, when Prague launched Soviet tanks, the 21-year-old Czech burned himself as a protest. After that, 15-20 more people took an example of this.
Painful statistics
Suicides lead to more human casualties than wars and murders. Experts of the World Health Organization said this. Every year more than 800 000 people around the world commit suicide. At present, 7 out of every 100,000 people die as a result of their own conspiracy. Every 40 seconds someone commits suicide. According to information, the number of suicides in the world since 2000 alone has reached 1 million, and it has its own reasons. According to World Statistics, the highest cases of suicide are observed among drug addicts, people with disabilities, mental patients, as well as those suffering from chronic alcoholism. The motive of suicide can be both spiritual and material impossibility. But the statistics of suicides are almost the same in both developed and small states. For example, Somalia occupies one of the last places for suicides. The investigative journalist Maia Szalavitz comes to this conclusion that in prosperous countries, as a rule, property inequality becomes greater. He consider that inequality itself is a relative concept, and the main factor here is the question of social status. The banker, who lost his job in other words, understands since will not be able to drive such cars and eat in certain restaurants. This is why, in the period of the last economic crisis, there were more cases of suicide among the bank and some of its employees. In addition, the level of suicide can be associated with climatic conditions. The idea of suicide in every person's life goes through his mind, but the realization of it is a sudden decision. It is said that when they look at the neck of the easel themselves, traces of scratches appear, which means that they regret, but can’t save themselves. In order to avoid such an undesirable situation, as the expert noted, there must be a timely and professional approach to the problems."

Million marches threats cannot blackmail me as I have come in power to hold corrupt accountable: PM,www.urdupoint.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/million-marches-threats-cannot-blackmail-me-a-586950.html,"Million Marches Threats Cannot Blackmail Me As I Have Come In Power To Hold Corrupt Accountable: PM Muhammad Irfan 1 day ago Fri 05th April 2019 | 07:05 PM
JAMRUD, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) : Prime Minister Imran Khan Friday categorically said he would not be blackmailed by threats of million marches and sit-ins by opposition leaders, to escape from the accountability process for looting billions of rupees of public funds.
"" Imran Khan will not be blackmailed, as I have come into power only with a motive to hold the corrupt accountable,"" he said while addressing a huge public gathering here wherein he also announced a mega development package for district Khyber.
The prime minister referred to the April 4, speeches of Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari at Naudero public meeting and offered the PPP leaders with a container and even food if they wanted to stage a sit-in in Islamabad .
He, however, challenged them to hold even a week-long sit-in in the Federal capital as against the PTI 's four and half months' sit-in, adding, sit-ins only succeed when the leaders raise the issues of masses and share their grievances.
He said the people who became leaders by showing a piece of paper [death will] were not the true leaders. ""Leaders emerge through struggle and political hardships"", he added.
Similarly, he said, Maulana Fazalur Reham who was clean-bold in the General election 2018 was talking of million march .
The prime minister termed Maulana as 12th player and said, ""It is like a whinging boy [in the game of cricket] who continues with fielding the whole day, then gets out on the very first ball at crease, and later starts crying foul to disturb the whole match."" ""He (Maulana Fazalur Rehman) is a 12th player and wants to push the government down. You will not get the turn"", he remarked.
The prime minister further said, "" Zardari Sahib! This government is not going. You are going to jail ."" He regretted that the opposition parties ( PML-N and PPP ) who had completed their five-year terms each during the past 10 years were raising questions about the performance of PTI government over the last 7 months.
He criticized the PPP leaders for questioning PTI about its performance of seven months in power from the first week of government .
He referred to a Joint Investigation Team report and said these people had laundered the public money worth Rs100 billion abroad through fake accounts.
""They are telling us to push the government down and pressurizing us so as to get an NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance)"", the prime minister said and added the people like Ishaq Dar , an absconder, were telling the government how to improve economy.
He also mentioned the sons of Nawaz Sharif residing in London and said, ""One of his son is living in a house worth Rs6 billion ."" Similarly, he said, a son and son-in-law of Shehbaz Sharif had gone to London . ""If you have not done anything wrong, why you have run out of the country,"" he remarked.
Imran Khan said when he was called by the court he had presented his 40-year record before it and did not make any hue and cry about democracy getting in danger. ""When these people are questioned, democracy comes under danger"", he said.
The prime minister made it clear that those involved in loot and plundering of public money would have to be answerable before the courts as well as before the nation.
""If you have to avoid from going into jails, you will have to give back the public money , which was to be used on health, education and poverty elimination"", he said.

Excellence of marketing
The purpose of shopper marketing is to turn the store client into a product buyer. In the markets this job is done by category manager, the marketing of products in the market is carried out by commercial marketing manager and merchandisers. For instance, the sold products are placed so that there is compatibility between them i.e. if the buyer buys tea, he/she will also want to buy a sweets to drink tea. The most demanding and definitely bought products as bread, milk, cheese etc. are placed at utmost for people entered market to see more products. In any supermarket, hot colors dominate, smells beautiful, sounds of classical music. This approach allows to create comfort and keep buyer more in space. Prices in deficit and others - each of them is the excellence of marketing art.
On the topic marketing specialist, Rafiq Hunaltay spoke to Eurasia Diary.
According to the expert, there are some products that are placed on the right side of the buyer. On the basis of buyer psychology, people are looking at the right side more. They do not like to bend when they walk in the market. Therefore, the products are sheltered from the shelves at the height of the buyer. The shelves in the markets, as well as the cashbox are more attractive. Because there are some products that we only remember when we see them, ""says Rafiq Huntalay.
The main thing the client is educating himself
But sometimes, for example, a litre of milk is packed so that it is 1 liter in order to show a wide range of volumes, but its product is about 800 grams. In addition, it is important to note price of pre-discount and post-discount. However, it is incorrect to raise the price of the product and then make a discount. Today's clients are more educated in comparison with the previous ones. Near the end of the products, campaigns are done. The second one is a gift for whom buy one of the discount products. But this does not mean that such goods are of poor quality. It can be used fully if it is two months before the expiry date of a product. Also, in the summer, winter clothes are on the sale. Profit on the discounted winter costume in the spring is important for the seller when buying new goods in the winter. In smaller businesses, such as in neighborhood markets, in the regions, the main job is on buyers. Primarily it is to educate the customer himself/herself. In some cases, the buyer doesn’t look at consumption date of the old goods. Or in our regions fruit juice is sold, but there is no fruit in it. With people take and drink it, they are endangering themselves and their children, ""said the expert.
It would be good if people do not use the products, they do not know or recognized few. Well-known companies do not deceive their customers; they do not want to lose their image acquired over the years for goods. Unfortunately, our people do not read the product they buy, whether it is food or medicine. Any of product sold must be addressed to the first company and then to the place where they are purchased. The store cannot fully control the quality of goods received from a large number of companies. Also, it can be applied to government agencies that protect consumers' rights, ""said Rafig Hunting.."

London, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 5th Apr, 2019 ) :The British pound crumbled Friday after London requested another extension in the long-running Brexit saga, while global stocks were having a humdrum day enlivened only by hopes over China-US trade talks.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has asked the European Union to delay Britain's departure until June 30, while the bloc itself suggested that it might be best to postpone the split for up to a year.
As so often before, sheer uncertainty over Britain's future weighed on sterling, but the currency's downside was limited by expectations that the exit from the EU will be softened by some kind of agreement with the bloc.
""As far as most Currency traders are concerned the chances of a no-deal remain remote -- but at the same time a satisfactory outcome anytime soon also seems highly unlikely,"" said XTB analyst David Cheetham.
May also told EU Council president Donald Tusk in a formal letter that Britain would start preparing for its participation in European Parliament elections in case it is still a member of the bloc when they begin on May 23.
- Race against the clock - The embattled premier is racing against the clock in a desperate bid to get her deal approved in time for an EU leaders' summit in Brussels on Wednesday, when a formal decision on any extension will be made.
She is also holding a third day of talks with opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to find a way to avert a messy no-deal divorce .
The Brexit current deadline is April 12, which has already been pushed back once from March 29.
""The idea of a longer delay was something of a relief to sterling, given that currently the UK is set to leave the EU next Friday,"" noted Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell.
In stock market deals London gained as the pound weakened, while neither Paris and Frankfurt had much to show for the day's trading.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index rose after the government reported jobs numbers for March well above expectations, a sign of a robust economy that was greeted with much relief after weak numbers a month earlier.
""After disappointment in February , job creation bounced back nicely in March ,"" ING chief international economist James Knightley said.
Asian equity indices mostly rose in holiday-thinned trade on hopes that China and the United States will hammer out a trade deal after both sides sounded notes of optimism.
With top negotiators from the world 's top two economies huddled down in Washington for three days of talks, there has been a growing sense they are close to an agreement to end a stand-off that battered global equities last year.
- 'Looking good' - US President Donald Trump added to the sense of hope on Thursday when he said the two sides were nearing a successful conclusion.
""We will probably know over the next four weeks. It may take two weeks after that,"" he told reporters after a meeting with Beijing 's top trade envoy and Vice Premier Liu He.
""It's looking very good."" Later Liu said they had ""reached a new consensus on important issues"", according to China 's Xinhua. The news agency also reported that President Xi Jinping had called for the ""early conclusion of negotiations"".
Both camps have been cautiously optimistic for months, but the last mile is proving to be the hardest as they tussle over whether and when Washington should remove the painful tariffs it imposed on Chinese goods last year.
