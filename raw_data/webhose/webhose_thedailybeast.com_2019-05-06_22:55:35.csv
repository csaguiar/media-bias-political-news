Sean Hannity: ‘Hillary Clinton’s Email Server Is a Real Threat to Our Safety and Security’,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/sean-hannity-fox-news-host-says-hillary-clintons-email-server-is-a-real-threat-to-our-safety-and-security,"OBSESSED Sean Hannity: ‘Hillary Clinton’s Email Server Is a Real Threat to Our Safety and Security’ Since Trump’s election Hannity has called for renewed investigations into Clinton's email server, her campaign’s funding of the so-called Steele dossier and Uranium One. Justin Baragona 04.22.19 11:03 PM ET
Two-and-a-half years after the 2016 presidential election and nearly three years after the FBI closed the investigation into the former Secretary of State’s private email server without criminal charges , Fox News host Sean Hannity declared: “Hillary Clinton's email server is a real threat to our safety and security.”
During the opening monologue of Hannity on Monday night, the Trump-boosting host called for an investigation into the Russia probe investigators, something he and other conservative media figures have pushed hard for recently, especially after the release of the redacted Mueller report.
After railing against the the previous administration and his belief that it engaged in the “biggest abuse of corruption in our history” and calling on House Intelligence Committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) to come on his show and provide evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, Hannity eventually shifted his focus to the hacking of emails during the 2016 election.
Claiming that Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA)—the previous House Intel chair and a Trump ally— warned the Obama administration about Russian election interference back in 2014, Hannity then demanded that we “please build the defenses to be unhackable.”
“We should all be concerned about the integrity of our elections and the fact that this government has been hacked repeatedly for decades by hostile regimes,” Hannity exclaimed. “We need a top-to-bottom killer defense procedure against these hackers.”
And then we got this.
“That is why Hillary Clinton's email server is a real threat to our safety and security,” he bellowed, adding: “And we do believe that place was hacked by at least six different foreign entities.”
Following his claim that the former first lady’s email server is endangering America’s security, Hannity went on to say that it was time to “investigate the investigators” because Clinton’s email investigation was “rigged” and that they “tried to rig a presidential election to undo a duly elected president.”
Following Trump’s election, Hannity has remained obsessed with Hillary Clinton, calling for renewed investigations into her email server, the Clinton campaign’s funding of the so-called Steele dossier and Uranium One . READ THIS LIST"
"‘Let Them Knock Themselves Out’: Team Trump Scoffs at Tax Return Deadline, Dares Dems to Take Legal Action",www.thedailybeast.com,asawin.suebsaeng@thedailybeast.com (Asawin Suebsaeng),04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/team-trump-to-tell-democrats-get-lost-on-tax-returns,"Travel SORRY NOT SORRY ‘Let Them Knock Themselves Out’: Team Trump Scoffs at Tax Return Deadline, Dares Dems to Take Legal Action According to two administration sources with knowledge of the matter, the Treasury Department is not going to comply with the April 23 deadline. 04.22.19 10:22 PM ET Win McNamee/Getty
The Trump administration, along with the president’s personal lawyers, are preparing to formally tell Democratic lawmakers seeking years of Donald Trump’s tax returns to get lost, The Daily Beast has confirmed.
On Tuesday, the administration will hit the deadline imposed early this month by Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who has demanded six years’ worth of President Trump’s long-hidden tax returns. Neal had also asked for returns for the president’s trust and seven entities in the Trump business empire, arguing that Congress has the authority to obtain the president’s tax returns under existing law.
According to two administration sources with knowledge of the matter, the U.S. Department of the Treasury is not going to comply with the deadline to hand over the returns, and officials plan to formally convey this decision to the committee in a letter. It is unclear if this letter will be transmitted on Tuesday.
The decision to buck Congress is not surprising, as Trump has steadfastly refused to turn over his tax returns in the past. But it moves the two branches of government even closer to a vicious legal fight that could take months or years to resolve. Earlier this month, Trump attorney William Consovoy wrote a letter to the Treasury Department’s general counsel Brent McIntosh, arguing “why Chairman Neal cannot legally request—and the IRS cannot legally divulge—this information.” (The IRS is a bureau of Treasury, which is headed by Steve Mnuchin, who is copied on Consovoy’s original letter.)
When asked by The Daily Beast if the Treasury Department would adhere to the Democrats’ demands by the Tuesday deadline, one administration source simply laughed and said, “Hell no, are you kidding?” Mnuchin himself said his department wouldn’t meet a previous deadline set by congressional Democrats.
Democrats on the committee have said that if the Trump administration continues to fight their formal demand for Trump tax returns, they are prepared to issue subpoenas for the relevant material. When asked for comment on the likelihood that Democrat lawmakers will now resort to legal action, Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani replied: “Let them knock themselves out.”
The battle over Trump’s tax documents is hardly the only one the president’s armada of personal lawyers are busy fighting . In a filing revealed on Monday morning, the president and his outside counsel took the extraordinary step of suing Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, in an effort to thwart a congressional subpoena of separate Trump financial records. This month, Cummings subpoenaed Mazars, an accounting firm used by Trump and his business. In court documents, the lawyers for the Trump Organization argued that this kind of oversight of the president is illegitimate since it did not to advance a legislative agenda.
“We will not allow congressional presidential harassment to go unanswered,” Jay Sekulow, another one of President Trump’s personal lawyers, who defended him during Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe, said in a statement on Monday. Sekulow is overseeing Consovoy’s work for the president.
When asked by The Daily Beast if Trump is also going to sue any other Democratic lawmakers on other committees looking into his finances or taxes, Sekulow indicated such legal action would be weighed if a committee chair sent a related subpoena, noting, “Each will be reviewed when issued.”"
Annette Bening in ‘All My Sons’: Arthur Miller’s Postwar Tragedy Lands Too Quietly on Broadway,www.thedailybeast.com,tim.teeman@thedailybeast.com (Tim Teeman),04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/annette-bening-in-all-my-sons-arthur-millers-postwar-tragedy-lands-too-quietly-on-broadway,"AFTER THE WAR Annette Bening in ‘All My Sons’: Arthur Miller’s Postwar Tragedy Lands Too Quietly on Broadway Annette Bening contains her grief, and Tracy Letts conceals the truth in Arthur Miller’s ‘All My Sons.’ But this Broadway revival is too quiet when landing its hardest punches. 04.22.19 9:09 PM ET Joan Marcus
There is the pleasure, for the first half anyway, of Arthur Miller ’s All My Sons— which opened Monday night on Broadway ( at the American Airlines Theatre, to June 23 )—of well-executed theatrical convention; the reassurance of a revival done traditionally and done right.
First, lights begin to flash and thunderclaps ring out; we see a projection of a fighter plane going down.
The curtain rises on the aftermath of an August 1947 storm in Midwestern suburbia: Douglas W. Schmidt’s gorgeously designed bucolic backyard of grass and chairs and flower-covered arbor. We can hear the distant noise of cars and chatter; we can see the comings and goings in and out of the Keller family’s back door. There is nothing off-the-wall, no pushing of envelopes, or headline-making outrages. Directed by Jack O’Brien, this is a steady ship, entirely respectful of its source text.
In this garden it is Sunday morning, and newspapers are being perused by the play's men. The tree planted in memory of Larry Keller has been shorn in two by the storm. Matriarch Kate ( Annette Bening ) refuses to grieve for her son, presumed dead during World War II, because she refuses to believe he is dead.
The excellent Bening (stripped of any vestige of Hollywood glamor) plays Kate with a careworn stubbornness; she is not lost in misery, she lives in her own purgatory determinedly and will not be moved from it. She speaks in a controlled inscrutable tone—everything about her is controlled—and she is bolstered by the horoscopes of cheery neighbor Frank (Nehal Joshi), which also posit Larry is still alive.
Tracy Letts ’ performance as patriarch Joe is, as you would expect from an actor who never lets you see the joins , brilliant and commanding. He has his own shame and secrets, his own desperation; the friendly chat with neighbors conceals a scandal. Joe was exonerated, while his neighbor Steve Deever was sent to jail, for knowingly shipping damaged aircraft engine cylinder heads.
Ann (Francesca Carpanini), Steve’s daughter, was Larry’s girlfriend and has now fallen in love with Larry’s brother (Benjamin Walker). Naturally, Kate is not thrilled about this.
The shadow of Larry and the war hangs over everything. “I had two sons, now I got one,” says Joe. “[The war] changed all the tallies. In my day when you had sons it was an honor. Today a doctor could make a million dollars if he could figure out a way to bring a boy into the world without a trigger finger.”
Chris wonders if they shouldn’t rouse Kate from her denial. “Do we contradict her? Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore? That we haven’t had any hope for years now?”
Joe tells him: “She thinks he’s coming back, Chris. You marry that girl and you’re pronouncing him dead.”
Chris himself felt ashamed coming back from the war. “Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys. I felt wrong to be alive, to open the bank-book, to drive the new car, to see the new refrigerator.”
For Joe, his only accomplishment, he feels, is Chris and all he does in service of that. His cheeriness is a cover, and the apparent folksiness of the neighborhood is deceptive too; next-door neighbor Sue Bayliss (Chinasa Ogbuagu) lets Ann know exactly what she thinks of the fallen Kellers. Her husband Jim (a wry Michael Hayden) has his own scratchy disillusion with the world.
There is something that melds the storylines—of Frank’s absence, Joe’s wartime secrets, and Chris and Ann’s intention to marry—for the first half. Walker and Carpanini are quietly charming as the would-be lovers, with Ann refusing to budge despite Kate’s animosity. But then Ann’s brother George (Hamilton Fluker) arrives, and so it is that everyone must face the truth of what really happened with those aircraft parts.
It is in this second half that the play starts to creak, and all that seemed grand and luxuriant in the first part begins to feel heavy-handed and rushed. Letts continues to ensure that Joe, the father who loved and screwed up too much, connects with the audience. It is Joe, with his self-sabotaged ambition for family stability, who now must face the meaning of being responsible for what happened to “all my sons.”
Walker’s horrified disillusion on discovering the many truths is the family‘s personal thunderstorm, but there is something too contained about his and the cascading reactions to the play’s set of secrets and truths. Some big lines and moments are galloped at, others don’t hit. The play’s central tragedy feels telegraphed. It's an uneven and unrevealing race to Miller's big messages.
Throughout, you sense the actors reaching for the grander scheme of Miller’s words—and what they say about family, justice, war, truth, morality, loyalty, profit, the American Dream—rather than simply living within their characters and letting those themes echo outwards. The moral and familial chaos Miller aimed to evoke feels too tidy, too beautifully lit, too just-so.
Letts stands out, going from folksy geniality to explosive anger, from reflective regret to defensive self-justification. He is a wonderful to both watch and also listen to. But with its tentativeness and restraint this extremely decorous All My Sons doesn’t shatter us enough, when it should have the same impact as the storm had on Larry Keller's tree. READ THIS LIST"

Scouted: I Would Never Guess Eco-Friendly Headphones Could Sound Like This — And Include Killer Techie Features,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.grudo@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Grudo),04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/house-of-marley-the-exodus-headphones-are-the-best-eco-friendly-headphones-ive-ever-used,"Scouted By The Beast
I’ve been using House of Marley ’s over-ear wireless Exodus headphones on a daily basis since I got them. And of all the features they pack, I would never, ever guess they were also sustainably made. If you’re trying to marry eco-friendliness into your tech buying , I highly recommend you check out the Exodus .
They’re styled uniquely with an exposed non-tangled braided wire connecting the large, powerful headphones in a flexible and versatile crescent that lets you find the perfect fit . And these headphones deliver incredible, hi-fi sound . The Exodus’s 50mm high definition drivers are designed for strong output and that’s been a shining feature for me — whether I’m increasing my speed with some 80s synthwave or slowing down with a classical playlist.
On top of that, I barely charge these headphones. A full battery lasts 30 hours and the unit charges fast with a USB-C (my first to come across in the wireless headphone space and I’m glad to see fast charging is spreading). In fact, House of Marley designed them to be charged less. The longer you wait to charge, the more playtime you get between charges. Memory-foam ear cushions cup your ears, leaving you immersed in whatever you’re listening to.
When I learned about the materials, I was floored — guess I just hadn’t ever considered that sound technology could afford itself to sustainable manufacturing. These headphones that sound great are also constructed responsibly and the company behind them cares (a lot) about reforestation . As you can see in the photos above, the Exodus headphones are crafted with sustainable bamboo (an easily renewable resource). The fabric on the inside of the earpieces is weaved from recycled materials : 30% reclaimed and organic cotton, 30% reclaimed hemp, and 40% recycled polyethylene terephthalate, which is fully recyclable. The headphone housing itself is made of recyclable aluminum . The silicone in the unit is created from reclaimed and upstyled waste product. The package you’ll be getting your headphones in is made of recycled paper. When it uses wood, House of Marley relies on materials that are certified by the Forest Stewardship Council , a nonprofit that manages forests for environmental impact and advocates for their preservation. The cork, leather, stainless steel, and other materials House of Marley uses in these headphones and its other products are r emarkably eco-friendly .
If you want your purchasing power to have an impact, House of Marley’s Exodus headphones are your best option for over-ear, wireless sound .

The Psychic Who Made Bank off the Satanic Panic,www.thedailybeast.com,Shannon Carrier,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/amityville-haunting-psychic-lorraine-warren-has-died,"R.I.P. The Psychic Who Made Bank off the Satanic Panic Together with her husband, Lorraine Warren injected herself into numerous high-profile cases of house hauntings and demonic possession. Hollywood was never far behind. 04.22.19 2:05 PM ET Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/Getty
Paranormal investigator and self-proclaimed clairvoyant Lorraine Warren, one of the psychics most closely associated with what was known as the Amityville haunting, died Thursday, April 18 at the age of 92. Warren and her husband, Ed, who died in 2006, achieved their greatest fame for their research and writing about the events in Amityville, New York. From there, their probes into rampant hauntings and demonic possessions mostly along the eastern seaboard inspired a series of novels and movies including The Amityville Horror, The Conjuring, The Conjuring 2 , the Annabelle trilogy, and The Haunting in Connecticut .
The purported haunting of a house in the Long Island town of Amityville was the Warrens’ most high profile case, thanks to the subsequent books and movies based (loosely in most versions) on the events. After a family moved into the house where a multiple murder had previously occurred, they reported several inexplicable occurrences and sensations. The Warrens were among the paranormal investigators called in to inspect the property, and duly reported having found evidence of psychic trouble, some of it predating the multiple murder. Lorraine would say years later that the Amityville case even haunted her.
Early pioneers in the ’70s Satanic Panic era, a time when cults performing satanic rituals were supposedly, although without much evidence, thought to be a widespread problem. Lorraine and Ed capitalized on the trend and made a killing—not by charging clients (their services were free) but through book and movie deals. The couple collected enough satanic paraphernalia to fill a museum at their small Monroe, Connecticut home.
Satanic Panic and the hauntings and possessions that the Warrens dealt with (all conveniently located in their own New England backyard) mostly occurred in the ’70s and ’80s, when fears of the occult and devil worship bubbled onto the national scene as never before. The Warrens, devout Catholics, decided to hop on the pentagram bandwagon (the Catholic church does, after all, acknowledge demonic possession). Where there was a knock, a smell, a draft, or a person possessed, the Warrens stood as consultants to predominantly Catholic families who were suffering from household demons. Sometimes they only had to show up and talk into empty rooms where angry spirits dwelled, dust off their hands, and leave. Other times, they had to be more hands-on.
In March 1981, The New York Times published an article with a pretty absurd headline: “Defendant in a Murder Puts the Devil on Trial.” The story began by recounting the Bible story of Jesus encountering two possessed men. He drives the demons out, and they enter a herd of pigs who flee to the water and die. It’s an odd start to a news story, but not nearly so nutty as what follows.
According to the Times story, David Glatzel, a 12-year-old boy who was afraid of the household waterbed, was pushed onto it by an apparition in the shape of an old man. The old man appeared again. So, at the urging of a Catholic pastor, the boy’s mother reached out to Mrs. Warren.
''Nine years ago,” she said referring to the priest she had worked with, “we were involved in a very bad case. He was the exorcist.'' Altogether, four priests, along with the Warrens and—stay with me—David’s sister’s boyfriend, Arne Johnson, worked to free David from demonic possession. Arne made the mistake of telling whatever possessed the boy to take him instead. And that supposedly happened exactly as it had with the pigs in the biblical story. David’s demon(s) jumped into Arne. Six months later he fatally stabbed his landlord, Alan Bono.
The Catholic Church silenced the priests, only acknowledging they had been present to handle the demons but that no formal exorcism had taken place, since for a sanctioned exorcism, approval by a bishop was required but had not been sought. Ed Warren refuted that claim saying, ''The two younger priests went directly to the bishop. We have it on tape.'' The church wouldn’t speak with the police detectives investigating the murder. But the Warrens did. Four months before the stabbing, according to the Times , Ed and Lorraine warned law enforcement ''that they were working with clergy in a house they claimed to be a demonic lair, and that there was some potential, they thought, for some violent act.''
The story was front-page news for about a week, until John Hinckley shot Ronald Reagan in late March 1981, and then the exorcism was forgotten—at least temporarily, only to be resurrected several months later. In September, the Washington Post wasted about 10,000 words on this garbage. At his trial, Johnson pleaded not guilty by reason of demonic possession. The judge rejected the defense, because there’s no such thing, and Johnson was convicted of first degree manslaughter. Nevertheless, throughout his trial and sentencing, Johnson stood by his devil-made-me-do-it plea and refused to apologize. He served just under five years for the murder of Alan Bono.
In the Washington Post article, Lorraine seemed to have already cashed the checks that she anticipated from the family tragedy. “Will we have a book written about this?” Lorraine Warren asks rhetorically. “ Yes, we will . Will we lecture about it? Yes, we will.” Are they talking to writers and movie producers? “No, we're not,” she says. “Our agents at the William Morris Agency are.""
The Warrens hit the lecture circuit, wrote books, consulted on films, sold stories to studios and showed up for all the paranormal reality shows. They were rolling in dough, so if you had a haunting, they wouldn’t charge you to look at it. And they were, if nothing else, good story tellers. In a YouTube video , Lorraine said a spirit came home with them and when they walked through the front door, their pets were walking backwards.
Ed Warren died in 2006, and Lorraine had mostly retired from investigation, although she continued consulting on supernatural phenomena. In the last few years, reports of Ed’s relationship with a 15-year-old girl, Judith Penney, have surfaced. With Lorraine’s consent, Penney moved into their home when she was 18 to oversee the house and claims that she was Ed's lover for four decades. Everything about these people seems sinister and exploitative—down to the admission they charged to see the haunted doll in their basement museum.
Born Lorraine Rita Moran in Bridgeport, Connecticut on January 31, 1927, she claimed to have been a paranormal conduit since early childhood. She met Ed Warren when she was a teenager, and they were married in 1945. The Warrens shared an interest in hauntings and used Ed’s artistic ability to get them in the doors of what they believed to be haunted houses: He would offer to paint portraits of the houses they suspected of being haunted, and with that as their foot in the door, the Warrens would gain access to the house and permission to snoop. In 1952, the couple founded New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR). Her death was announced on the NESPR Facebook page.
At best, Lorraine Warren, was a pop culture fixture of the horror genre. At worst, a con. A moderate stance would be, well, the Warrens got rich off some crazy make believe bwahaha, but at least they did no great harm to the families they purported to help. READ THIS LIST"
"NYU Feminist Professor Avital Ronell, Accused of Harassing Student, Returning to Classroom",www.thedailybeast.com,Emily.Shugerman@thedailybeast.com (Emily Shugerman),04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/nyus-avital-ronell-accused-of-harassing-student-nimrod-reitman-returning-to-classroom,"NYU Feminist Professor Avital Ronell, Accused of Harassing Student, Returning to Classroom She will be teaching a course on ‘boundary troubles.’ 04.22.19 1:44 PM ET Wikipedia Commons
A feminist New York University professor who was suspended for allegedly harassing a former graduate student last year—setting off a debate about the authenticity of the #MeToo movement—will return to the school this fall with a course on “boundary troubles.”
Avital Ronell, 67, was removed from the classroom last year after an internal NYU investigation found she “engaged in sexual harassment” of her doctoral advisee over a three-year period. The report quotes emails in which she called him pet names and sent him messages like, “You looked gorgeous; Couldn’t keep my eyes off you!” Ronell has denied all allegations of harassment.
The professor’s first course upon returning to the school will be titled “Unsettled Scores: Theories of Grievance, Stuckness, and Boundary Troubles,” according to a description first obtained by NYU Local . The course will explore how students are “confined within a grievance culture” and to what extent boundaries “protect or limit the possibility of experience.” Featured texts include a book on a terrorist whose “demise in the face of inequity drives him to political despair.”
The professor told The Daily Beast her course was inspired by lectures and teachings she had given in Europe over the past year, and would focus on the “alarming and racist evolution of penitentiary culture.”
“Our class will study the formation of the ‘carcel subject,’ a term coined by Michel Foucault to indicate ways through which institutions like the university or the state or media conglomerates confine, isolate, and alienate individuals and whole communities,” Ronell said via email. “I will also show how one tends to internalize and personalize the very phenomena that one disavows—in this case structures of incarceration.”
But commenters were quick to point out the irony of Ronell teaching a class on boundaries.
“Can someone explain to me why NYU is letting Avital Ronell teach a class that is basically trolling grad students who wanted senior scholars not to be a bunch of boundary abusing jerks?” tweeted University of Texas at Austin Prof. Marisol LeBrón.
Andrea Long Chu, an NYU doctoral candidate and one of the first people to notice Ronell’s new course offering, added : “The funny thing is it’s just the same damn texts she ALWAYS teaches, she really has to go out of her way to own herself this bad.” The message was retweeted by NYU’s graduate student union.
An NYU spokesperson said the university does not discuss personnel issues concerning individual employees.
News of Ronell’s suspension last year set off a firestorm in the academic community. While some spoke out on Reitman’s behalf, a number of prominent feminist scholars signed on to a letter defending the professor and calling the allegations “malicious.” The signatories praised Ronell’s “keen wit” and “intellectual commitment” and added that if she were to be terminated, “the injustice would be widely recognized and opposed.”
The letter was widely condemned as hypocritical, given many of the signatories’ support for female survivors. At least one—feminist scholar Judith Butler—later issued an apology .
Ronell previously told the New York Times that the communications cited in Reitman’s Title IX complaint were the result of a shared “penchant for florid and campy communications” stemming from their identities as a gay man and lesbian woman with Israeli heritage. A statement issued on her behalf quoted a number of emails in which Reitman allegedly expressed affection for the professor.
Reitman is currently suing Ronell and NYU for sexual harassment, retaliation, and infliction of emotional distress, among other things. The lawsuit, which is pending in New York State Supreme Court, claims that Ronell “would touch, grab, fondle and kiss Reitman (over his objections), and often demanded that he act in kind,” and that she “burst into a jealous rage when his attention was... not fully devoted to her.”
“Reitman reported Ronell’s unwelcome sexual contact, including sexual comments, unwanted touching, stalking, and unwanted sexual advances, to responsible school officials at NYU, including an NYU Vice Provost who had the authority and obligation to address the wrongful conduct and to institute corrective measures, but failed to take any action,” the lawsuit states .
An NYU spokesperson told the Times the university was “sympathetic” to what Reitman went through, but that “given the promptness, seriousness and thoroughness with which we responded to his charges, we do not believe that his filing a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the university would be warranted or just.” READ THIS LIST"
Meghan McCain Blows Up Over Mueller Report; Whoopi Goldberg Cuts Her Off,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-views-meghan-mccain-blows-up-over-mueller-report-whoopi-goldberg-cuts-her-off,"WE’RE BACK Meghan McCain Blows Up Over Mueller Report; Whoopi Goldberg Cuts Her Off McCain called her co-hosts ‘irrational’ and suggested liberals are as much to blame for Trump as the Republicans who refuse to hold him accountable. 04.22.19 1:37 PM ET The View/ABC
Returning from a week-long break, The View began Monday’s broadcast reacting to the recently released Mueller report. Naturally, that segment ended with Whoopi Goldberg cutting off conservative co-host Meghan McCain during a tirade claiming Democrats are going to get President Trump re-elected by “demonizing” all Republicans.
In response to Sen. Mitt Romney’s (R-UT) highly critical statement of Trump following the report—which found Trump repeatedly tried to obstruct the Russia probe—co-host Sunny Hostin said the Utah senator would still likely not vote for impeachment if it reached the Senate. Romney and other Republicans, he said, will ultimately refuse to hold Trump accountable.
Former Fox News host Abby Huntsman jumped in to debate both Hostin and co-host Joy Behar, noting that Trump’s base feels like he “got a big win” from the report because the media set an expectation that “he was going to be booted out.” Behar and Hostin, meanwhile, pointed out that Trump’s overall approval rating went down to 37 percent —and that’s where McCain jumped in for her take.
“Then what's the problem?” McCain asked. “So he’s the worst president in history. According to our legal analyst, there's so much in this report that is damning and whatever. Then what’s the problem? Why is everyone so nervous about 2020? If this is the nail in the coffin...”
Behar snapped back that she is “afraid the Russians will steal the election again,” which prompted McCain to call her “irrational.”
“What’s the rational answer?!” Behar, McCain’s regular sparring partner , exclaimed.
“Unfortunately for Democrats, you got to get out there and win over the voters you lost in the middle of the country,” McCain replied with one of her most recurring talking points. When one woman in the audience applauded, McCain turned and thanked her.
“I always took Trump seriously,” she continued. “You can go back and check the receipts when I worked at Fox and on my radio show. I always took Trump seriously. This mess that we all got ourselves into, I blame the left as much as the right, and the demonizing of all conservatives in this country, all Trump supporters in every way. You’re getting him re-elected.”
When Hostin pressed once more, “But what about his behavior?” McCain replied, “It came out that there was nothing that collude—that he didn’t collude.” (The report actually doesn’t make a determination on “collusion , which has no legal definition.)
As McCain continued to shout, she then invoked her late father, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). “I accepted the Magnitsky Award in London on behalf of my father,” she exclaimed. “I’m someone who has been speaking out against Russia, by the way—let me finish!”
As she continued to shout at her colleagues, Goldberg calmly mouthed to the camera that the segment had to wrap. McCain, meanwhile, continued to rant."

Authorities released new audio and video footage Monday in the yet-unsolved 2017 case of two teenage girls who were murdered while hiking on a trail near Delphi, Indiana, warning residents that the killer likely lives or works in the small town.
Although the police have not yet made any arrests in connection with the murder, Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter told residents in a Monday press conference that “We believe the person is from Delphi, currently or has previously lived here, visits on a regular basis or works here.”
Carter addressed the killer directly, close to tears throughout his prepared statement: “We believe you are hiding in plain sight,” he said. “We likely have interviewed you, or someone close to you. We know that this is about power to you, and you want to know what we know. And one day, you will.”
“What will those closest to you think of you, that you murdered two little girls,” he added. “Only a coward will do such a thing.”
The girls, 13-year-old Abigail Williams and 14-year-old Liberty German, were dropped off on a local hiking trail by family members at about 1 p.m. on Feb. 13, 2017. At 2:07 p.m., German posted a snapchat photo of Williams crossing the Monon High Bridge.
The girls were supposed to meet German’s father at about 3:15 p.m., but they never showed up. Police quickly launched a manhunt—and the following morning, cops found the Delphi Community middle schoolers’ bodies near Deer Creek, about half a mile from their last known location. It’s not yet clear how the girls died.
“To the murderer: I believe you have just a little bit of a conscience left,” Carter said Monday. And I can assure you, that how you left them in that woods is not, is not what they’re experiencing today.”
In the aftermath of the murders, officials released a low-quality, grainy photo of a man in jeans and a thick blue jacket, as well as audio footage from German’s phone in which a man can be heard saying “down the hill.” It’s not clear if the man in the footage is the same person who ordered the girls down the hill.
“This person’s evil. This person is a monster,” lead investigator Sergeant Jerry Holeman said in a TV interview . “This could happen again. So if you’re holding that information for whatever reason, you need to think of that. This could happen to your niece, daughter, cousin, sister.”
On July 17, officials released a sketch of the suspect , who was described as 5 feet 6 inches to 5 feet 10 inches, weighing 180 to 220 pounds, with reddish brown hair.
During the Monday press conference, authorities released new evidence from German’s phone: an 11-second audio clip, in which “down the hill” is repeated a few times, and a video clip of the suspect taking two steps forward on the bridge. Carter asked residents to carefully scrutinize the suspect’s voice and gait for leads.
Authorities also released a markedly different sketch of the suspect, asking residents to consider the old version “secondary.” Carter said that the suspect is likely between the ages of 18 and 40, although he may appear to be younger.
In September 2017, police arrested 31-year-old Daniel Nations as a potential suspect, after he was arrested in Colorado for threatening people on a hiking trail with a hatchet. But Indiana authorities later downplayed the arrest, stating that Nations was not someone “they care a whole lot about.”
Despite tens of thousands of tips and a $230,000 reward, the case remains a mystery.
“We’re all frustrated,” Williams’ mother Anna told ABC News just before the second anniversary of her child’s death. “It might still feel like we’re in the same place, but I think of how many tips we’ve gone through, how many are still out there, still coming in, and I have hope that we are on the right track.”
Carter addressed the victims’ families directly during his statement. “When I take my last breath on this earth, I’ll be thinking of them,” he said. “Never in my career have I stood in front of something like this.”
“We are just beginning,” he said in conclusion. “We will not stop.”"
Supreme Court to Decide If Anti-LGBT Discrimination Is Already Illegal,www.thedailybeast.com,Jay Michaelson,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/supreme-court-to-decide-if-anti-lgbt-discrimination-is-already-illegal,"YOU’RE FIRED Supreme Court to Decide If Anti-LGBT Discrimination Is Already Illegal Three cases to be heard next term will be the Trump-era Court’s most significant statement on LGBT equality. It probably won’t go well. REUTERS
Is anti-LGBT discrimination a form of sex discrimination?
That is what the Supreme Court said Monday it will decide next fall , when it hears three cases on anti-LGBT discrimination in the workplace. And with Justice Kavanaugh having replaced Justice Kennedy, the outcome is totally unknown.
First, let’s remember what these cases are not about. They are not about whether it’s a good thing to fire someone for being gay or trans. In fact, a whopping 69% of Americans say it should be against the law to do so.
The trouble is, it isn’t. In fact, under federal law, and in 14 states, it is perfectly legal for my boss to say “Wait a minute—you’re gay?! You’re fired.”
That is exactly what happened to Don Zarda, the plaintiff in one of the cases ( Zarda v. Altitude Express ) and Gerald Lynn Bostock, the plaintiff in another ( Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia ). Zarda was a skydiving instructor, Bostock a county child welfare services coordinator. Both were fired when their employers learned they were gay.
A similar thing happened to Aimee Stephens, a transgender woman working as a funeral director. When she announced her transition from male to female, and informed her employer that she would be coming to work in women’s clothing, she was fired on the spot. She’s the plaintiff in the third case, EEOC v. R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes .
Once again, under federal law and in 14 states, all this is perfectly legal.
Unless it isn’t.
Over the last two decades, law professors, activists, and some government officials have developed the theory that anti-LGBT discrimination is actually a subset of sex discrimination, which is banned by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.
The theory is straightforward. When a gay man is fired for being gay, they’re really being fired for being a man. If I were a woman married to a man, then the bosses at Altitude Express wouldn’t fire me. But because I’m a man married to a man, they would. “They have chosen not to protect LGBT people, year after year.”
Likewise, if Aimee Stephens had been assigned female at birth (i.e. born a woman, under current law), then her coming to work in a dress would not have gotten her fired. But because she was assigned male at birth, it did.
The Obama administration adopted this position for transgender people, saying that gender identity discrimination was a form of sex discrimination. It took no position on sexual identity discrimination.
The Trump administration reversed course , undoing Obama-era protections and taking the official position that sexual identity discrimination was not covered by Title VII.
The question now is whether that interpretation is correct – or, more precisely, whether it’s the only correct interpretation of the law. Remember, the Trump administration has abandoned this interpretation, and LGBT people are getting fired for being trans or gay all the time. So these three cases aren’t about whether the pro-LGBT interpretation is permissible – it’s whether it’s necessary .
That is actually a very hard argument to make.
It’s hard enough even to make the lighter argument: that Title VII could be read as covering LGBT people. That’s because, in the case of an ambiguous statute, one of the things that courts look toward is legislative history. And in this case, Congress has again and again (and again) failed to pass LGBT-inclusive employment non-discrimination laws.
It’s not like they’re unaware of the issue. They are painfully aware of it. They’ve debated it. And they have chosen not to protect LGBT people, year after year.
What are all those debates about, if Title VII already protects gay and trans people? By expressly rejecting LGBT non-discrimination laws, Congress has clearly indicated that it does not think LGBT people should be protected, and that they aren’t protected under existing law.
Moreover, there isn’t a shred of evidence from when Title VII was passed in 1964 that anyone thought it was protecting gays and lesbians (let alone trans people, who were not identified as such at the time). Quite the contrary; a vast majority of Americans were prejudiced against gays and lesbians.
So for the Supreme Court to find for the plaintiffs in these three cases, it has to go against decades of legislative history, starting with Title VII itself.
And now, not only must the Court ignore clear legislative intent, it must also overrule the executive branch, which has said loud and clear that it is perfectly acceptable to fire people for being gay and trans. Not only has the Trump administration abandoned the pro-LGBT interpretation of Title VII, but it has rescinded Obama-era executive orders requiring government contractors not to discriminate , and has, itself, fired thousands of transgender soldiers for no reason other than their being trans .
In other words, these three cases are a very heavy lift. Some have even questioned whether the cases should have been brought at all, since already they’ve been misunderstood and misconstrued. Like the Masterpiece Cakeshop decision , which was actually a very narrow opinion limited to its specific facts but was interpreted as a broad license for businesses to discriminate against gay customers, a loss in these three cases could be understood as being a similar license to discriminate against gay employees. Supreme Court cases are symbolic as much as substantive, and a loss in these cases could be yet another bad omen for LGBT (in)equality.
Finally, the result will most likely come down to Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
The combination of the conservative justices’ past votes on LGBT cases (including those of Justice Gorsuch, who has gone out of his way to take anti-gay positions whenever possible) and the challenging nature of these three strongly suggest four votes for the anti-LGBT position. Justice Breyer is perhaps questionable, while Justices Ginsburg, Kagan, and Sotomayor are likely to take the pro-LGBT interpretation.
That makes Justice Kavanaugh the swing vote.
Tempting though it may be, it’s not fair to Justice Kavanaugh to assume how he’d vote as an ideological matter. There’s not enough of a record, and, remember, the Republican-appointed Justice Kennedy—whose vote in favor of gay marriage was decisive—was Kavanaugh’s mentor as well as predecessor. It’s really an unknown.
But as a jurisprudential one, it’s hard to see him expanding the scope of a federal law over the objections of the executive and legislative branches, especially in the original legislative record. In his years on the D.C. Circuit, Kavanaugh showed himself to be a judicial as well as ideological conservative. It would be a remarkable reversal for him to expand the scope of Title VII over its plainest reading, its historic understanding, its legislative intent, and executive branch interpretation of it.
Anything could happen, but for the LGBT community, it’s hard to see this going well.
If there is a silver lining here, it’s that a loss in these cases could motivate Congress to finally get with 69% of Americans and explicitly ban employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The bill known as the “ Equality Act ” would do exactly that, and it is almost certain to pass the House this year.
That would be a much more honest, democratic, and clear result than stretching Title VII. Let the Senate debate the Equality Act. And if the supposed moderate Republicans in that body choose to abandon LGBT Americans, let them pay for it at the polls. READ THIS LIST"

"Scouted: Bearaby Launches the Tree Napper, a Weighted Blanket Made from Wood Pulp-Derived Fabric",www.thedailybeast.com,jillian.lucas@thedailybeast.com (Jillian Lucas),04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/weighted-blanket-brand-bearaby-launches-the-tree-napper,"Scouted By The Beast
Just when you thought you hit peak weighted blanket, Bearaby comes and changes everything. In honor of Earth Day, the weighted blanket brand has debuted the Tree Napper , a weighted blanket made exclusively from TENCEL Lycocell, a fabric derived from the wood pulp of eucalyptus trees.
While the original Bearaby Napper was made from naturally weighted vegan cotton yarn (unlike the synthetic or glass beads like weighted blankets), the Tree Napper takes things one step further. The wide-looped woven design is “produced through an environmentally responsible closed-loop process that uses ten times less water than traditional fabrics” according to the brand’s press release. Now, the Bearaby Napper is not only the best-looking weighted blanket on the market, but it’s also environmentally-friendly.
The Tree Napper will come in three weights: 15 pounds, 20 pounds, and 25 pounds (it’s recommended you use one that’s 10% of your body weight) and will come in four gorgeous summer hues: Hibiscus , Lavender , Sunflower , and May Lily . Priced between $249 and $279 depending on weight, the Tree Napper is a statement piece not just for its looks but also for its eco-conscious design. The modern pattern isn’t just for aesthetic either—the woven design and lightweight eucalyptus fabric make the blanket breathable.
Plus, Bearaby partnered with One Tree Planted so that a tree is planted for every Tree Napper purchase made.

"Elizabeth Warren Calls for Wiping Out Student-Loan Debt, Making College Free",www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elizabeth-warren-calls-for-large-scale-student-debt-cancellation,"FREE AND CLEAR Elizabeth Warren Calls for Wiping Out Student-Loan Debt, Making College Free Her policy would allow for the cancellation of as much as $50,000 in student-loan debt for those with household incomes under $100,000. 04.22.19 7:59 AM ET BRendan Smialowski/Getty
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is rolling out a comprehensive higher-education plan that includes a broad proposal to cancel student-loan debt.
The plan, which would cancel $50,000 in student-loan debt for every person with a household income under $100,000, is the latest in the presidential candidate’s list of ambitious policy proposals, including breaking up large tech companies , a new corporate profits tax and universal child-care coverage.
According to a Medium post detailing the policy , the debt cancellation would also apply for every person with a household income between $100,000 and $250,000, with the cancellation amount declining a dollar for every three dollars in income above $100,000, so that a person earning $130,000 would have $40,000 in cancellation. It would not cancel debts for people earning more than $250,000.
The cancellation would take place in most cases, through data the federal government already has on income and student-loan debts. The canceled debt wouldn’t be taxed as income, according to her plan.
“The enormous student debt burden weighing down our economy isn’t the result of laziness or irresponsibility,” writes Warren, whose first bill as a senator sought to provide relief to student borrowers. “It’s the result of a government that has consistently put the interests of the wealthy and well-connected over the interests of working families.”
An analysis of the plan from experts at Brandeis University estimates that Warren’s policy would provide total debt cancellation to more than 75 percent of Americans with student-loan debt and some form of relief to more than 95 percent.
Warren also has a plan for universal free college, a platform that has become a hallmark of many 2020 presidential contenders since it was a staple of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) 2016 run.
The estimated cost for the debt cancellation and the universal free college program is around $1.25 trillion over 10 years, a figure Warren wants to pay for with her ultra-millionaire tax, which would apply a 2 percent annual tax on households with $50 million or more.
The Massachusetts Democrat also wants to address how the higher-education system can better serve low-income families and students of color, with a planned investment of an additional $100 billion in Pell Grants, a $50 billion fund for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority- Serving Institutions (MSIs), and “after an appropriate transition period,” a ban on for-profit colleges receiving federal dollars. Warren suggests instituting an annual audit for public colleges “that identifies issues creating shortfalls in enrollment and graduation rates for lower-income students and students of color,” and prohibiting them from considering citizenship status or criminal history in their decisions on admissions.
Other 2020 candidates have frequently talked about the student-loan debt crisis in less specific terms, with Florida mayor Wayne Messam standing alone in calling for complete cancellation .
“We got into this crisis because state governments and the federal government decided that instead of treating higher education like our public school system—free and accessible to all Americans—they’d rather cut taxes for billionaires and giant corporations and offload the cost of higher education onto students and their families,” Warren writes. “The student debt crisis is the direct result of this failed experiment.” READ THIS LIST"

[Warning: Spoilers] Melissa Leon 04.22.19 7:10 AM ET
G ame of Thrones ’ final hour with characters whose stories we know will soon end is one of the series’ best in years. “Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” is as romantic, reflective, intimate and, yes, as horny as the end of the world should be. It delivers merciful moments of connection and closure, each pitched to a satisfying note of catharsis, not sappiness. Little of it advances the show’s endgame in any major way—we learn Winterfell’s plan of attack against the Night King, and Jon confesses his Targaryen lineage to Dany—but the episode isn’t a swan song either. Instead, “Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” is a kind of victory lap, a muted celebration of what this show does best and the finely-shaded relationships and shared histories of its characters.
The hour delivers on promises I consider more urgent than revealing who’ll sit in a chair or die in the next battle, closing a few of the emotional arcs the series needs for a satisfying end. It gives Arya the room to act on her first crush (and boy does she), grants Brienne the external validation she’d learned to stop craving, allows the Hound a gruff moment to express paternal affection for Arya, and brings Sansa and Theon together, a meaningful reunion between the only two people who come close to understanding the other’s trauma . The episode walks a fine line between gratification and wish fulfillment, and wobbles at points along the way. But in its best moments, it’s electric, underscoring why we care what happens to these people at all. Jaime Faces a Hostile Winterfell
Most of the episode unfolds in small conversational pairings of two or three—except for Jaime’s entrance to the Great Hall of Winterfell. He faces a tough crowd there of people he’s either personally maimed or plotted with his family to kill. On top of that, he brings news that Cersei’s army isn’t marching anywhere. But it isn’t his interactions with former enemies that make this scene crackle with such fascinating tension—it’s Daenerys’ fraught, ever-shifting relationships with everyone in the room. (Even so, shout-out to how instantly Bran’s callback to what Jaime said just before he pushed him out a window seven seasons ago—“The things we do for love”—smothers the room into silence. With apologies to Tormund, Bran is the funniest character on this show.)
Dany sits front and center as she questions Jaime, positioning herself as a buffer between Sansa and Jon. The gesture is useless, though—Jon is barely present (until he spoke, I’d forgotten he was even in the room), has no idea his girlfriend expects him to agree with her, and finally mumbles approval of Sansa’s decision to let Jaime stay after Brienne vouches for him. It’s one of two consecutive hits to the Mother of Dragons’ pride; Tyrion’s failure to detect that Cersei is playing them prompts a white-hot look of fury, too. Though to be fair, it’s hard to blame her. She lost Highgarden and Olenna Tyrell to Jaime, along with the Sand Snakes and Yara’s ships to Euron and Cersei, because of Tyrion’s miscalculations.
Jaime’s presence at Winterfell recalls the Starks walking into the viper’s nest of King’s Landing in season one, an irony Tyrion can’t help but point out: “I wish father were here,” he tells Jaime. “I would love to see the look on his face when he realized his two sons were about to die defending Winterfell.” It’s one of many instances in this episode of characters reminiscing and inviting us to do the same—to marvel at the dense tapestry of relationships and histories that brought everyone here. Tyrion quotes one of his own lines, the one about how he’d like to die , which he first delivered in season one. Former Night’s Watch brothers Sam, Dolorous Edd, and Jon Snow ask us to “think back on where we started.” Brienne recounts how Jaime lost his hand defending her. Bran reflects on how that day in the tower changed both him and Jaime. Theon vows to redeem himself for betraying Winterfell when Bran and Rickon were the only Starks in it. The Hound remembers how much Arya used to talk.
And Daenerys brings up the Lannisters’ sins against her family, and her own history of surviving a brutally sexist world, in an attempt to bond with Sansa. That trip down memory lane doesn’t go as planned. Sansa Sees Through Daenerys’ Sister Act
With Jon essentially ghosting Dany after learning she’s his aunt, the Targaryen queen pulls out every stop to create a mirage of sisterhood with Sansa in an attempt to exert influence over her. She prompts Sansa to sit with her, leans in conspiratorially, rests a hand on her arm, and draws parallels between them both as leaders among people who don’t trust women to rule. Inconveniently for Dany, though, Sansa has a better eye than anyone for power-hungry queens manipulating the bonds of femininity. (Remember Cersei’s many confessions to her “little dove” in season two about the miseries of being a woman at court.)
Sansa has survived dozens of confrontations with tyrants in part by mirroring what they want to see and telling them what they want to hear. Dany, meanwhile, believes herself an underdog even now; it’s a crucial part of the myth she’s constructed about her destiny. It’s why she suggests that she, not Jon, is the one being manipulated by love—she calls this his war and reframes her support as some love-addled act of kindness.
Sansa’s response to that carries a recognizable echo of her megalomaniac-defusing instincts: “I should have thanked you the moment you arrived,” she tells her. “That was a mistake.” But this isn’t like facing Cersei in the Red Keep as an 11-year-old. Dany carries herself like a queen trying to reason with an unruly subject, but at Winterfell, Sansa’s word carries more weight and she can afford to be direct. When Daenerys tells her (so matter-of-factly!) that after the battle she’ll “take the Iron Throne,” Sansa puts the North’s M.O. in stronger terms than Jon ever has: “We said we’d never bow to anyone else ever again. What about the North?”
Dany recoils with suppressed rage but doesn’t answer. She doesn’t have to—we know she wants absolute power, or none at all. Ser Brienne of Tarth, Knight of the Seven Kingdoms
This episode is dedicated to small moments that remind us of what every character still fights for (and, as with Sansa and Dany, the tensions still driving them apart). But the hour’s most gratifying scenes belong to Arya and Brienne, as each indulges a side of herself that life as a warrior never left room for.
The warmth of a fireplace in a hall at Winterfell attracts a motley group including Davos, Tormund, Jaime, Tyrion, Brienne and her squire Pod (whose many mysterious gifts include a beautiful singing voice, it turns out). Tyrion accidentally calls Brienne “Ser,” the honorific for a knight, then remembers she is only a “lady” since women can’t be knighted. It’s a thin excuse for what’s about to happen, but a welcome one; what follows brims with more genuine emotion than any scene in at least a season.
Brienne’s time on the road with Jaime in Season 3 revealed a side of the Kingslayer that no one less honorable than the Lady of Tarth could have inspired. Brienne proved herself Jaime’s equal in their first sword fight on a bridge, and held his begrudging respect from then on. He lost his hand to Bolton men for tricking them into leaving her alone when they intended to rape her—the first act of heroism we ever saw from Jaime. And the more time he spent with her, the more inclined he became to emulate her.
It was to her that Jaime confessed he’d killed the Mad King not as a betrayal, but to protect the people of King’s Landing. It was her commitment to her oath to protect Catelyn Stark’s children that inspired him to keep his own promise, and moved him to give her new armor and his Valyrian steel sword. Even her words to him at the Dragonpit last season, “fuck loyalty,” seem to have helped him cast off the bonds to his family, leave Cersei, and fight for the living. Brienne was always the catalyst for Jaime’s redemption—so it’s especially meaningful when he offers to knight Brienne himself.
Brienne hardly needs the title; she’s acted according to a code of honor more faithfully than any actual knight. That she’s been denied it for so long is just one more injustice she’s had to endure because she’s a woman—one more luxury she’s taught herself never to expect. “I don’t even want to be a knight,” she tells Tormund, a line she’s likely repeated to herself a thousand times. She scoffs when Jaime proposes knighting her then and there, but only for a moment before a glimmer of uncertain hope crosses her face. As with Tormund’s affections (which seem to have become his entire reason to exist), she doesn’t quite know what to do with the offer. She’s not used to being offered anything.
When she kneels before Jaime then, it’s significant as her own acknowledgement that she is owed this. When Jaime recites the knights’ vows, it’s external validation that she may not have needed, but deserves more than most. Jaime and Brienne’s complicated feelings for each other might have culminated in a kiss or a kind word at some point. But a scene dedicated to validating her talent and declaring her an equal in front of a room of supportive, clapping friends? That’s far more satisfying—and hotter, too. Arya Gets Her Man
Being holed up in a firelit castle hours before the Night King descends would have an understandably erotic effect on its inhabitants, though few probably expected Arya to be the one to act on it. She spends the episode eyeing Gendry’s sweaty biceps as he pounds out dragonglass weapons, then throws questions about his sexual history at him faster than she can nail daggers into the wall behind him. It’s their usual, specific type of flirtatious banter at first—until she straight-up just tells him she’d like to find out what sex is like before the end of the world.
Arya, as HBO helpfully pointed out in a tweet before the episode aired, is 18 years old by this point in the show. She’s in control of the situation from beginning to end, making it a surprisingly healthy anomaly in a show once known for gratuitous, outlandish, often degrading sex. That she handles it all with the same confidence and curious detachment she regards everything with these days adds an endearing note. Gendry never stood a chance.
He also gifts her the custom weapon she asked for in the last episode: a dragonglass spear with a detachable handle that looks like a projectile. She’ll need it now that the Night King’s army stands just outside Winterfell—and the last hour of peace before war is upon them. Bran Reveals What the Night King Wants
All we’ve been able to parse about the Night King’s intentions until now is that he plans to plunge the world into darkness and destroy everything in his way. In this episode, thanks to Bran, we get a little more clarity about why.
Bran tells the leaders of Winterfell’s resistance that he is the Night King’s real target. Their foe’s real goal is not only to destroy humanity, but to “erase the world” and all memory of its past and present. As the Three-Eyed Raven, Bran is the world’s memory—a living record of history more vivid and comprehensive than books or stories. (As Sam tells him, “If I wanted to erase the world, I’d start with you.”) Knowing what the Night King wants doesn’t give Winterfell much of an advantage, but it does grant some strategic direction. Bran plans to sit in the Godswood and wait for the Night King to find him through the mark he left on Bran’s arm when the two met in a vision.
If it works and Team Winterfell kills the Night King, every wight he’s ever turned will fall in battle, too. But if Bran dies, more will be lost to the world than just the youngest Stark."

Going 10 Rounds With Top Sommelier Zwann Grays,www.thedailybeast.com,noah.rothbaum@thedailybeast.com (Noah Rothbaum),04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/going-10-rounds-with-zwann-grays-the-wine-director-at-brooklyn-restaurant-olmsted,"Going 10 Rounds With Top Sommelier Zwann Grays The wine director at Brooklyn restaurant Olmsted tackles our speed round of questions. 04.22.19 4:46 AM ET Courtesy Ken Goodman
What do you like to drink after a shift? “A Gin & Tonic at a dive-y spot that happens to be open, or a hard-shaken Daiquiri at a cocktail spot that happens to be open. Either will right all wrongs after a long shift.”
What is the all-time best dive bar jukebox song? “I don’t know if this is the all-time best, but every time I find myself in a dive bar “Sultans of Swing” by Dire Straits comes on. Really though, I like anything from the Back to Black album from Amy Winehouse in a dive.”
Name the first good drink you ever drank and where you had it. “Somehow we had Domaine de Bellivière Chenin Blanc by the glass at Terroir Tribeca back in the day. I don’t remember the cuvée, but it was from Jasnières and I could never say it right. Either way, it was one of the most beautiful sips on day two of being open, when we un-pumped the bottles and checked them before service.”
What book on wine is your go-to resource? “My old American Sommelier Association book and the World Atlas of Wine for in-depth, cold hard facts. For deeper exploration, I still will break out Authentic Wine by Jamie Goode and Sam Harrop. Otherwise, it’s online these days.”
Name the wine region that took you the longest to truly understand. “I’ll probably never understand Burgundy. But the good news is, I don’t have to!”
What’s your favorite wine and food pairing? “Every time I’m home in Houston we go to Pappadeaux as a family. The crawfish étouffée and a bottle of off dry Riesling or Chenin Blanc is nostalgic heaven. It totally connects my Houston roots and my family with where I am now and how I eat and drink today.”
What’s the most common wine myth you have to debunk? “The myth I debunk most often is that rosé with more color extraction is sweeter. Daily guests will tell me a wine is sweet when there is actually zero residual sugar in it. I don’t correct people anymore, I just get them something else they might like better.”
What’s your favorite bottle of wine under $20? “Julie Benau Picpoul de Pinet. It has all the things I need in an inexpensive white: fruit, acid and great body.”
What’s your favorite bottle of wine over $1,000? “I can’t say I’ve savored a bottle at this price properly, but I did get a taste of Jacques Selosse, ‘Les Carelles’ Extra-Brut Blanc de Blancs Champagne and that gave me an absolute thrill!”
What tool do you use to open a bottle? “ Rabbit’s Zippity 2-Step Corkscrew in red. The worm snaps back in place like a champ.”

This Week’s Supreme Court Case Could Decide the 2024 Election,www.thedailybeast.com,Jay Michaelson,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/department-of-commerce-v-new-york-supreme-court-case-could-decide-2024-election-9,"HIGH STAKES Supreme Court Census Case Could Decide the 2024 Election It’s no exaggeration to say the census question could decide the 2024 election, and that’s what’s at stake as the Supreme Court takes up Department of Commerce v. New York. 04.23.19 12:00 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photo Getty
Update: At oral arguments Tuesday, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, the two potential swing votes in the census case, both indicated that they were inclined to accept the administration's proffered rationale: that the citizenship question is necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act. If that holds, the citizenship question will almost certainly be retained.
If the Trump administration succeeds in adding the question “Are you a U.S. Citizen?” to the 2020 census, the Census Bureau estimates that 6.5 million people won’t respond to the census at all.
Most of those will be Hispanics or people with immigrants in their families who are fearful of exposing themselves or their family members to deportation, investigation, or worse. According to a Harvard University study , between 7.7 and 9.1 percent of Hispanics will skip the census entirely.
And that, in turn, will lead to fewer representatives in the House from states with large Hispanic populations—like California, New York, Illinois, Arizona, and Texas—and, accordingly, fewer electors in the electoral college to choose a president.
It’s no exaggeration to say that the 2024 election could be decided on the basis of this census question.
That’s what’s at stake Tuesday as the Supreme Court takes up the case of Department of Commerce v. New York , representing four challenges to the citizenship question.
As we’ve learned over the course of those lawsuits, these anti-democratic effects of the question aren’t unintended consequences: they’re the whole reason it’s in there. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose department oversees the census, lied about the reasons for the change, failed to follow the law on making it, and illegally ignored the opinion of the Census Bureau itself, which urged him against it.
If true (as several lower courts have found), these are violations both of administrative law and of Article I, Sections 1 and 2 of the Constitution, which provides that for the purposes of determining congressional representation, “The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.""
The “Enumeration Clause,” as it is known, has been held to require the government to get the best count possible. Here, however, Ross and his minions went against the advice of their own department, their own experts, and five previous directors of the census bureau (Republicans and Democrats alike), who said that the citizenship question would lead to an inaccurate count of how many people reside in the United States.
“The Census Bureau’s own analysis showed lower response rates, but Ross ignored them,” said Professor Jennifer Nou on a briefing call held by the American Constitution Society. “He either refused to consider evidence in the record, or actually falsified the record.”
As Ohio State University law professor Daniel Tokaji put it on the same call, “The record shows that he decided what he wanted to do first, and then came up with a pretext later.” “The Constitution requires that all people be counted.”
Ross has also baldly lied about the process by which the question was added. In March, 2018, he testified that the Department of Justice asked him to make the change so that they could better enforce the Voting Rights Act.
Turns out, that was false . In fact, Ross had asked DOJ send the letter to justify the policy change, and the real sources of the proposal were White House advisers Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach. (Ross also lied under oath about meeting Bannon and Kobach at all.) It was politics, in other words, engineered by two of the most ardent ethno-nationalists in the Trump White House.
The claims about the Voting Rights Act were just a pretext—a ruse. Which makes sense, because, as amicus briefs filed in Department of Commerce v. New York discuss in detail, there is absolutely no rational connection between a citizenship question and the Voting Rights Act.
In fact, the flimsiness of the pretext may be dispositive in the case. The Department of Commerce, like other administrative agencies, enjoys wide discretion under the Census Act—in which Congress delegated its constitutional responsibilities to the executive branch. Courts will not overturn an agency’s action simply because they think there’s a better way.
But if there is simply no conceivable relationship between the decision and its reason, that would fail even a deferential standard of review.
Professor Tokaji said the Voting Rights Act reason is “totally not true, which is why all three lower courts found that to be the case.”
In other words, even if it can’t be proven that Ross added the question for a discriminatory reason, if the reason he offers makes no sense whatsoever, and he blatantly ignored administrative law requirements in making it, that is enough for the question to be removed.
Again, the Constitution requires that all people be counted. If the Commerce Department changes the form in a way that leads to a worse count, that’s a violation of its statutory and constitutional mission.
Ironically, the Trump administration and conservative amicus groups are making the opposite argument in the census case from the one they made just a few weeks ago, in a case about deference to agency decisions. In Kisor v. Wilkie ,they argued that agency decisions don’t deserve much deference—part of their overall effort to “roll back the administrative state.” Now, however, they argue that Secretary Ross deserves all kinds of deference, even if he failed to follow the law and clearly acted against his constitutional mandate.
The outcome of this case—congressional representation for ten years, electoral votes in the 2024 presidential election, and over $900 billion of federal aid that’s disbursed according to population—may come down, as many recent Supreme Court cases have, to that very question.
And recent cases have been all over the place.
Most infamously, in Trump v. Hawaii , Chief Justice Roberts allowed the so-called “travel ban” to stand, notwithstanding Trump’s countless promises to ban Muslims from entering the country , because the State Department came up with other reasons for the ban that didn’t discriminate on the basis of religion.
And more recently, the Supreme Court took the government at its word that transgender soldiers are a danger to the military, even though a yearlong Defense Department study showed that they weren’t, because a much shorter study slapped together by the Trump administration said so.
On the other hand, just two years ago, the Court struck down a Texas law requiring abortion clinics to have all sorts of unnecessary equipment and certifications, finding that Texas’s proffered reasons had no relationship to reality.
Interestingly, Professor Nou noted that the Trump administration has a far worse record in such cases than usual. Normally, Nou said, the government wins about 60% of cases reviewing agency decisions. “This administration is winning about six percent.”
That order of magnitude difference is a shocking statistic, but one that suggests that courts are doing their jobs. When it’s taken to court, suddenly the anti-science and anti-truth Trump administration bangs into reality. One can only hope, for the sake of the integrity of the electoral process, that reality wins this week."
Russia’s Filthy Rich Have a Thing for Miami—but the Good Times May Be Ending,www.thedailybeast.com,Anna Nemtsova,04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/russias-filthy-rich-have-a-thing-for-miamibut-the-good-times-may-be-ending,"SUNNY ISLES FOR SHADY PEOPLE Russia’s Filthy Rich Have a Thing for Miami—but the Good Times May Be Ending Though Trump wanted to build a tower in Moscow and failed, many Russians have bought into Miami’s Trump condos. Now, some of them can’t get there. Getty Russia’s Millionaire ‘Refugees’
Russian elites fear they’ll be locked behind the new iron curtain: punished by Western sanctions on one side, by Russian courts on the other.
MOSCOW—Here in the Russian capital, even though black snow has finally melted after the endless freezing winter, many people still feel a lack of vitamin D. But not everybody.
Thousands of rich Russian citizens—those not under U.S. sanctions—have been working on their tans around Biscayne Bay in the United States. Many spend their winters relaxing at Sunny Isles Beach in North Miami, enjoying the multi-bedroom condos they call their “distant dachas.” But there’s been notable tension wafting in on the sea breezes.
There are signs the good times are ending.
Yelena Berdichevskaya, an event manager, organizes concerts by famous Russian musicians in Miami. “This is the first time at least in a decade when we see half-empty Moscow-Miami airplanes,” Berdichevskaya told The Daily Beast.
In 2014 after Moscow took the Crimean Peninsula and backed a war in eastern Ukraine, Washington and the European Union imposed sanctions and the Kremlin banned tens of thousands of rich Russians, employees of law enforcement agencies, from traveling abroad. The U.S. sanctions were tightened further after extensive revelations about Moscow’s interference in the U.S. elections that put Donald Trump in the White House. “The most recent talk of the town was of a Russian family who due to politics had to sell their condo in the Porsche Design tower—everybody in the family was crying.”
As a result, many rich Russian residents of Miami have had to rent out or sell their condos in the extravagant high-rises at Sunny Isles Beach, including one of the towers named Porsche Design, and another three of them bearing the label “Trump.”
To give you a sense of the extravagance: Porsche Design is famous for glass elevators allowing you to drive your car into your apartment up to 60 stories above the sea.
“The most recent talk of the town,” says Berdichevskaya, “was of a Russian family who due to politics had to sell their condo in the Porsche Design tower—everybody in the family was crying.”
They were not shedding tears about millions of their countrymen trying to deal with horrifying state hospitals who have no money to take their children or old parents to private clinics, much less the 20 percent of Russian families who don’t have indoor plumbing.
What makes the Russian elite in their little “Moscow by the Sea” worry about their Miami investments these days is fear of prison.
In 2017, Reuters published an extensive investigation into Trump properties in Florida, most of them at Sunny Isles Beach, and found that “at least 63 individuals with Russian passports or addresses” had bought “at least $98.4 million worth of property in seven Trump-branded luxury towers in southern Florida.”
Those numbers do not include those who successfully mask ownership through front companies, or go to Miami to rent and have their children born as Americans. Like many big-ticket real estate developments, there are always suspicions that the Miami properties serve not only as luxury getaways, but also as money laundries.
“I don’t think that corrupt Russian bureaucrats on sanctions are going to travel to their Miami homes any time soon,” says Gennady Gudkov, a former KGB officer who is now an opposition politician. “I hope they will be punished.”
The Anti-Corruption Foundation run by opposition leader Aleksey Navalny reported, for instance, that Nizhny Novgorod mayor Ivan Karnilin invested first $824,000 and then $1.1 million in Miami apartments in December 2013 and July 2014. This on a civil servant’s salary. The mayor allegedly registered the property in the names of his wife, Albina Karnilina and his daughter, Irina Ovchinnikova. Soon after Navalny published his reports, the mayor retired.
The Moscow team of Transparency International has conducted a series of investigative projects about “Russian Miami” or, as some call it, “Little Moscow.” “I know several FSB [security service] and army generals who have huge properties in Miami but cannot travel outside of Russia.”
“Russian corrupt bureaucrats continue to see Miami as an attractive place for investment,” the deputy head of Transparency International here, Ilya Shumanov, told The Daily Beast. “Our project ‘Miami is Ours’ covered estates that belonged to businessmen, bandits, bureaucrats, politicians and even law enforcement officers, including former Interior Minister Gen. Anatoly Petukhov, who had invested over $30 million in Florida; even people responsible for the security system invested their money in Miami.”
Due to sanctions and to independent investigations conducted by corruption fighters, some hypocritical Russian state servants who invest and pay taxes in the United States have lost their jobs at home or had to sell their Miami residences, while others are banned from traveling to the U.S. altogether.
Russian legislators in Moscow may condemn the “Russophobic U.S. State Department,” but in Miami or in New York they seem to admire “the air of freedom,” as Member of Parliament Igor Lebedev said last fall. (Lebedev, take note, is the son of the controversial nationalist MP Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a big fan of Donald Trump. )
“I know several FSB [security service] and army generals who have huge properties in Miami but cannot travel outside of Russia,” Gudkov, the former KGB man, told The Daily Beast. “I don’t think that anything can change that now, after Mueller’s report comes out, since the sanctions are not the punishment for ‘collusion’ but for Russia’s bandit-like behavior all over Europe, Ukraine and the United States.” “This is the first time at least in a decade when we see half-empty Moscow-Miami airplanes.”
Russians who can still travel stay in Miami during the winter months when it is dark and miserable here, returning back home mainly to make money. Russian business and real-estate deals are often discussed at the restaurants in the Bal Harbor mall.
That is where Lana Bell, a broker of luxury properties at Sotheby’s International Realty, tells Russian clients about attractive condos with spectacular sea views, and it appears, from what she says, that the election of Trump on Nov. 8, 2016, prompted an instant era of good feelings as well as high rolling for Russians in Miami.
Trump may have failed that year to seal a deal for a Moscow tower, but Muscovites made their way to his branded condos in Miami. Almost instantly their numbers and luxury investments surpassed those of traditional buyers from Colombia, Venezuela and Argentina.
The starting price for the condos Bell sells begins at about $3 million, she told The Daily Beast in a telephone interview. “My Russian clients have been buying condos in the most expensive towers, including the Trump Towers.” She noted that those are are right next to the “Kalinka” and “Matryoshka” stores specializing in Russian cuisine. “Our baby boy had Hollywood, Florida, as a place of birth in his passport.”
Bell, who has been in this highly competitive business for more than a decade, says that unlike American elites, who tend not to make their money so extremely obvious, Russian men show off their wealth as much as possible: “Russians can be easily recognized by their Bentleys and Rolls-Royces,” Bell says. “But this year the sales have gone down. It is becoming problematic for the Russian elite to take their money out of the country; and here the rules demand full disclosure, the name of the buyer and the source of money.”
Do Russian buyers, especially those loyal to President Vladimir Putin, feel bad about their secret estates in the nation the Kremlin constantly accuses of “Russophobia”? Hardly.
“Look, Russian patriots are happy here; Sunny Isles is a happy place. Russian men make money at home, they visit their Miami property just for a few months in winter.” Bell laughs. “Some of these rich daddies are in their fifties or older, while their women are in their twenties; the beach is packed with really young pregnant Russian girls, girls with babies. I sometimes wonder about their age—and life.”
Then there’s the question of what President Trump likes to call “anchor babies,” infants born in the United States and thus entitled to U.S. citizenship, thus making it easier for their parents eventually to apply for citizenship as well.
Natalia Borisova, a former manager at a Moscow state agency responsible for regional investments and Vasily Zubakin, a leading manager at Lukoil, one of Russia’s gas and oil giants, had their baby boy in Miami in September 2014. They followed the same agenda pursued by many rich Russians: rented a condo in the third Trump tower, spent a couple of nice months on the ocean, and got their newly born baby a U.S. passport.
“We were in Miami, where everybody around us spoke Russian,” Borsonova recalled in a recent interview with The Daily Beast, noting the irony that at that time, “Moscow was banning Western products in a move against the sanctions.”
“The medical service cost us around $4,000, the rent was around $6,000 a month; we had the nicest doctor, everything was easy, comfortable and pleasant,” Borisova said. “Our baby boy had Hollywood, Florida, as a place of birth in his passport.”
On a recent afternoon Tatiana Voloshin, a New York entrepreneur, was watching a loud group near her table on the veranda of Mira 5 Stars, a restaurant popular with rich Russians because its chef, Mirko Cldino, previously worked at Putin’s dacha outside Moscow. There were, as Voloshin recalls, six men and nine women with high heels and cosmetically-enhanced lips. “Some of the men were from Chechnya, I realized when one of the Russians said that their Chechen sober friends should drive.” Presumably the Muslims were not drinking.
The guests hopped into three Bentleys and one Maserati and took off. Voloshin said that she felt frustrated. She came to Miami to look for an apartment but the prices for real estate close to the beach turned out to be unaffordable. “I did not find a nice place, thanks to rich Russians who have spoiled the real estate market with their crazy bottomless budgets.”
Voloshin’s real-estate agent, Mikhail Shilt, says that his clients are both Russian and Chechen. “Some of my Chechen clients lived in Moscow before they came here; my buyers are businessmen and government officials, fifty-fifty,” Shilt said.
When the agent asked his Russian clients how their passion for investing in Miami condos went along with their loyalty to the Kremlin’s politics, they usually said that “their own happiness is their priority,” the agent said."
Trump’s Gay Allies Join Fight Against ‘Opportunist’ Pete Buttigieg,www.thedailybeast.com,Scott.Bixby@thedailybeast.com (Scott Bixby),04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-gay-allies-join-fight-against-opportunist-pete-buttigieg,"THE UPSIDE DOWN Trump’s Gay Allies Join Fight Against ‘Opportunist’ Pete Buttigieg ‘It’s a little sad to me that somebody has to do that for a job,’ a current Log Cabin staffer told The Daily Beast. 04.22.19 4:43 AM ET Scott Eisen/Getty
As South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s profile, poll numbers, and fundraising prowess have risen in recent months, conservatives have generally left attacks against the young Democratic presidential candidate to creepy monologues by late-night political commentators.
But now, the gay Midwestern mayor’s rise to prominence has Republicans worried enough to enlist the Trump administration’s gay allies to provide cover for its anti-LGBT policies —and to rewrite Vice President Mike Pence’s long history as the gay community’s Public Enemy No. 1.
In a Fox News op-ed , Gregory T. Angelo, a former director of the gay Republican group Log Cabin Republicans, argued that many of the harshest critiques against Pence—among them, that he has supported so-called “conversion therapy” in the past—are inaccurate. In an appearance on the network, Ambassador Ric Grennell compared Buttigieg’s characterizations of Pence’s record to a “hate hoax along the lines of Jussie Smollett.”
“I think this is a total hate hoax and I think it's outrageous,” Grennell said on Thursday. “The gay community used to be the community pushing tolerance and diversity. We were the ones that were saying everyone should be able to love and accept each other. Now suddenly there’s a whole community of people demanding that we all think alike.”
For six years, Angelo served as the president and executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, which seeks to advance LGBT causes and candidates within the Republican Party. But since leaving the organization six months ago, Angelo’s advocacy has shifted from encouraging support for LGBT issues amongst Republicans to running defense for an administration with a hostile record on gay and trans rights.
In a conversation with The Daily Beast, Angelo said that Pence has been “elevated to demonic status” by left-wing LGBT advocates, based on characterizations of his record that Angelo called “patently and categorically false.”
“I looked around and saw that no one else was being especially vocal in defense of the vice president, and certainly debunking a lot of the myths and disinformation that have been put out against him, and I decided to take a stand,” Angelo told The Daily Beast, adding that attempts to depict Pence “as anything but a vice president who’s acting in the best interests of all Americans are absolutely false.”
“The vice president is not driven by any element of anti-gay animus,” Angelo said.
While President Donald Trump has no evident personal animus towards a certain kind of wealthy, white gay man —during the 2016 campaign, he pledge “to do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens” from Islamic terrorism—his administration has been far more aggressive in rolling back protections for queer people, particularly transgender Americans .
But the main target in Buttigieg’s critiques has been Pence, whose résumé is as studded with anti-LGBT policies as Buttigieg’s is with academic plaudits.
From opposing gays in the military to warning that same-sex marriage would lead to “societal collapse,” Pence’s stance on LGBT issues is so aggressive that Trump reportedly once joked in a conversation about gay rights that Pence “ wants to hang them all! ” Pence’s signing of a so-called “religious freedom” bill when he was governor of Indiana, which critics said would allow for businesses to discriminate against LGBT people, has been a particular point of contention between the two Hoosiers.
“That whole episode… propelled him to his current position in the Republican Party,” Buttigieg told The Daily Beast last month. “At best, it kind of enables these things, because it gives some sort of tacit blessing from the highest office in the land. There are really consequences to this.”
The vice president’s response to Buttigieg’s critiques have been relatively muted: In an interview on CNBC earlier this month, Pence said that Buttigieg “ knows better ” than to think his political and religious positions on LGBT rights amount to a personal animosity.
But the Trump administration’s gay defenders are much less restrained in their attacks on Buttigieg. Angelo implied that Buttigieg only came out of the closet in the midst of a reelection campaign for political reasons.
“When it benefited his political career, Pete Buttigieg remained in the closet. When it benefited his political career, Pete Buttigieg came out as gay,” Angelo said. “When it benefited his political career, Buttigieg was more than happy to stand shoulder to shoulder with Mike Pence as allies, and when it benefited his political career, Pete Buttigieg was more than happy to throw his longtime friendship with Mike Pence under the bus and criticize him.”
“I can’t fault him for using a strategy that works, but it does seem like a mix of opportunism and cynicism rolled into one,” Angelo said.
Asked about Angelo’s comments, the Buttigieg campaign referred The Daily Beast to comments the mayor made about his coming-out journey on MSNBC, in which he said that his seven-month deployment to Afghanistan put him “over the top.”
“I realize that you only get to be one person,” Buttigieg said. “You don’t know how long you have on this earth, and by the time I came back, I realized, ‘I’ve got to do something.’”
Some gay conservatives told The Daily Beast that feel that Trump allies like Angelo and Grennell are “pandering” to the administration, using their status as gay men to give Pence cover in hopes of ingratiating themselves for political or career advancement.
“Log Cabin Republicans didn’t endorse Trump when [Angelo] was head of that organization, and now he’s trying to be relevant after a completely ineffective attempt at leading an organization to support LGBTQ issues and candidates,” a gay Republican former candidate for office told The Daily Beast. “With an administration, and a vice president, wanting to add some window-dressing of LGBTQ support while they advance policies that harm LGBTQ Americans, Gregory sees his chance to gain real access—for business or a job—not for making a difference in people’s lives. This is about him.”
“It’s a little sad to me that somebody has to do that for a job,” a current Log Cabin staffer told The Daily Beast, after reading Angelo’s accusation that Buttigieg prolonged his time in the closet for political benefit.
There is some evidence that the gay conservative defense of Pence comes from a political, rather than principled, place.
In the aftermath of Pence’s signing of the 2015 Religious Freedom Restoration Act , which gave legal cover to individuals and businesses who wished to discriminate against LGBT people due to their personal religious beliefs, Angelo said in an appearance on Hardball with Chris Matthews that his organization opposed the RFRA “because it’s too broad.” But in his Fox News op-ed, Angelo called the bill, which sparked nationwide protests and cost the state of Indiana an estimated $60 million in economic damages, “a rather specific law with narrow applications.”
As head of the Log Cabin Republicans, Angelo argued in 2013 that Republicans needed to pass LGBT non-discrimination legislation, “making the workplace about merit and productivity, not discrimination and prejudice.” But in a piece published last month in the Washington Examiner, Angelo said that the proposed Equality Act, a bill that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, would “ compromise American civil rights ,” and called on LGBT people to oppose it.
When the Trump administration issued a directive that effectively barred most transgender people from serving in the U.S. military, Angelo accused the administration of “ stoking culture wars ” in defiance of the Pentagon’s stance on the fitness of trans people to serve. But speaking to The Daily Beast, Angelo said that the Trump administration has achieved a “détente” with LGBT people, and said that the ban is “a more nuanced issue than I would argue is being reported.”
“I’m not an expert on transgender and I’m not an expert on the military—I defer to the Pentagon when questions like this come up,” Angelo, who led an LGBT organization for six years, said. “The Pentagon has the policy that the Pentagon has. That’s really all I can say about that. I’m not an expert in transgender issues, I’m not an expert in the military.”
Angelo denied allegations from within gay conservative circles that his surrogacy on behalf of the Trump administration is being done in hopes of a job.
“Right now, I am working with the Trump campaign as a surrogate. That work, however is volunteer,” Angelo said. “There’s lots of conversations I’ve been having with lots of folks within the administration, outside of the administration... I don’t know who those people are and I don’t know what they’ve told you, but I’ve just been doing my own thing.”"
CNN Town Halls Highlight Impeachment as New Litmus Test for 2020 Dems,www.thedailybeast.com,Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey),04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnn-town-halls-highlight-trump-impeachment-as-the-new-litmus-test-for-2020-democratic-candidates,"STAY OR GO? CNN Town Halls Highlight Impeachment as New Litmus Test for 2020 Dems With another top Democratic candidate coming out in favor of impeachment, removing Trump is the new question to answer or dodge in the 2020 field. 04.23.19 12:37 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photos Getty
Whether or not to impeach President Trump has become the new litmus test for the 2020 Democratic presidential field, with two high-profile progressive candidates coming out in favor of launching impeachment proceedings in the five days since Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report became public.
The growing prominence of the impeachment issue was abundantly clear during a marathon night of CNN town halls from New Hampshire on Monday, during which each of the five candidates who appeared was peppered with questions about his or her stance soon after taking the stage.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Kamala Harris (D-CA) cited Mueller’s findings, most notably the special counsel’s explicit refusal to clear Trump of obstruction of justice, as grounds enough to impeach him. But rivals like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) raised the possibility that the effort to remove Trump could backfire politically.
The divide apparent on the presidential town hall stage Monday reflects the divide in Congress, where Democrats are pulled in opposite directions by a progressive wing—which believes impeachment is a must-pass integrity test for its leaders—and a moderate wing that worries a push to remove the president could cost them Congress and keep Trump in the White House another four years .
During her appearance, Harris made news by announcing that she supports initiating impeachment proceedings. “I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment,” she said. “I think we have very good reason to believe that there is an investigation that has been conducted which has produced evidence that tells us that this president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice.”
Harris hedged a bit by stating she is a “realist,” noting that impeachment is dead on arrival in the Republican-held Senate. “We have to be realistic about what might be the end result, but that doesn’t mean the process should not take hold.”
But the first candidate to come out in favor of impeachment, Warren, forcefully reiterated her call for Democrats to pursue it no matter what the political realities are. If lawmakers want to be on record upholding the president’s conduct, said Warren, “then they should have to take that vote and live with it for the rest of their lives.”
“There is no political inconvenience exception to the United States Constitution,” said Warren to applause. “This is not about politics. This is about principle. This is about what kind of a democracy we have.”
Other candidates acknowledged the gravity of Mueller’s findings but tossed varying degrees of cold water on Warren’s heated impeachment pitch—most notably Sanders.
“If for the next year, year and a half, going right into the heart of the election, all that the Congress is talking about is impeaching Trump and Trump, Trump, Trump, and Mueller, Mueller, Mueller, and we’re not talking about health care, we’re not talking about raising the minimum wage to a living wage, we’re not talking about combating climate change, we’re not talking about sexism and racism and homophobia, and all of the issues that concern ordinary Americans, what I worry about is that works to Trump’s advantage,” said Sanders.
“At the end of the day, what is most important to me is to see that Donald Trump is not re-elected president, and I intend to do everything I can to make sure that doesn’t happen,” he added.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) argued Trump should be held accountable for what Mueller found but said the Senate is the jury for impeachment, “so I am not going to predispose things.”
Pete Buttigieg, who filled the final town hall slot, tried to offer a middle ground. “He’s made it pretty clear that he deserves impeachment,” said the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, of Trump. But Buttigieg said he views his task in 2020 as sending Trumpism to the “dustbin of history” and argued “there’s no more decisive way to do that… than to have just an absolute thumping at the ballot box for what that represents.”
Earlier on Monday, Democrats’ impeachment dilemma played out among lawmakers during a conference call convened by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) for House members to debate the post-Mueller path forward.
On Friday, Pelosi’s deputy, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-MD), drew criticism for saying Democrats shouldn’t pursue impeachment , while progressive upstarts like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) took the Mueller report as reason to sign onto impeachment efforts.
Those divisions persisted on the phone call, with some Democrats favoring moving toward impeachment, purple-district freshmen raising concerns about the political ramifications, and others pushing the new middle ground of a resolution to formally censure the president, reported The New York Times .
One Democratic lawmaker told The Daily Beast that most of the caucus was in favor of the wait-and-see approach. “The loudest voices in the caucus,” they said, “don’t reflect where most of us are.”"
Trevor Noah Reveals Trump’s Mueller Report Hypocrisy: You Mocked Christine Blasey Ford for Not Remembering,www.thedailybeast.com,marlow.stern@thedailybeast.com (Marlow Stern),04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-daily-shows-trevor-noah-reveals-trump-mueller-report-hypocrisy-you-mocked-christine-blasey-ford-for-not-remembering,"PROJECTION Trevor Noah Reveals Trump’s Mueller Report Hypocrisy: You Mocked Christine Blasey Ford for Not Remembering The ‘Daily Show’ host dedicated the majority of his sit-down monologue Monday night to the most shocking details of the 448-page Mueller report. 04.23.19 12:09 AM ET Comedy Central
On Monday night, The Daily Show ’s Trevor Noah dug into the damning 448-page Mueller report, which dropped Thursday.
And right off the bat, he criticized Attorney General William Barr for leaving out “a lot of juicy details” in his four-page summary of the report. Some of these include how, on the day Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel, President Trump “slumped back in his chair and said, ‘Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I’m fucked.’”
Noah laughed. “OK, I’m sorry, that is hilarious. When Trump found out Mueller was investigating, he slumped in his chair and said, ‘I’m fucked.’ You know why I like that? Because he always acts like nothing always fazes him… but it turns out Trump panics about his presidency as much as the rest of us,” Noah said. “It’s a good feeling to know. It’s almost like we’re on a plane with crazy turbulence and we all think we’re in this alone, and the pilot is also in the cockpit like, ‘I’m F-ed!’” ( Editor’s Note : I’m not sure how that’s the least bit comforting.)
“In addition to that, [Barr’s] summary absolved Trump of obstruction of justice,” Noah explained. “What it didn’t mention is that, for two years, Trump was constantly trying to stop the investigation. The only thing that prevented him from doing that is that the White House is baby-proof.”
Yes, the Mueller report gave instances of at least 10 former or current Trump administration officials or associates either ignoring or failing to follow through with the president’s orders to impede the investigation—including White House Counsel Don McGahn, who ignored Trump’s repeated requests to fire Mueller, ultimately quitting instead after telling then-chief of staff Reince Priebus that the president had asked him to do “crazy shit.”
“Oh yes, he asked them to do crazy shit ,” offered Noah. “That’s right—Trump was constantly telling his aides to do obstruction-y things, and they just ignored him. So that was basically obstruction of obstruction of justice. And in a way, this is almost comforting, because you realize that yes, Trump is corrupt enough to want to abuse his powers, but he’s also too lazy to follow through. That’s a nice thing to know.”
Noah saved the bulk of his ire, however, for Barr. “This gummy-bear lawyer over here conveniently left out all the details that make Trump look not good,” said Noah. “Right before he released the report—don’t forget—Barr gave a press conference where he said Trump was fully cooperative with the Mueller probe.”
This was clearly baloney, since Trump refused to sit down for an interview with Mueller’s team and then gave a variation of “I don’t recall” 37 times in his written responses to Mueller’s questions.
“It’s also funny that Trump can’t remember what happened a year ago, but when Christine Blasey Ford couldn’t remember any detail from 30 years ago [at the Kavanaugh hearing], he judged her like this.”
The Comedy Central host then threw to a clip of Trump at a rally last year mocking Dr. Ford: “How did you get home? I don’t remember. How’d you get there? I don’t remember. Where is the place? I don’t remember. How many years ago was it? I don’t know.”
“See? This just proves my theory: Everything Trump says about women is actually true about himself,” said Noah. “ He ’s always making things up, he ’s overly emotional, and most of all, he ’s the one with the great boobs.”"

About four years ago, Josh Harris received an envelope of cash from his father for Christmas. This came in lieu of the traditional gift-in-a-box-with-a-bow—and Harris immediately knew how he wanted to put it to use.
The owner of acclaimed San Francisco bars Trick Dog and Bon Voyage , and co-founder of the cocktail and spirit consulting company The Bon Vivants, had gotten married a few months prior, shortly after undergoing what he felt was a significant style update. He’d long wore a collection of sterling silver and turquoise rings, but he knew that he’d soon be wearing a gold wedding band that would clash with his jewelry—and that wouldn’t do.
“I took off five [silver] rings and put on one gold ring and one watch,” he says, adding that both were pieces he already owned, but had felt they were too “adult,” so he’d never really worn them before. “It worked. I didn’t have a gaping hole making this transition, which is the honest way I thought about it.”
So when he received the gift from his father, Harris decided right away that he’d begin the search for a new watch.
“I went out and started scouring the four corners of the internet trying to determine what styles and eras I was excited about, the different looks, the vocabulary, the functionality, trying to make myself as quickly a novice expert about it as possible,” says Harris. “That’s a thread that runs through a lot of other things that I collect as well, where it becomes a conduit to learning histories about things and places and people.”
Harris eventually landed on a Valgine Swiss dive watch that checked all of his boxes: “It’s obscure, it’s one of a kind, it had a look that I liked at that time, and it was what I considered a good entry level watch price.”
The watch also has a day-of-the-week dial in French, which set it apart for Harris, who has an affinity for the country, after living there, getting married there and regularly visiting.
After that, Harris was hooked on vintage watches and willingly jumped down the rabbit hole. Not long after, he purchased a Hamilton watch—the company stopped manufacturing watches in America in 1969. Four years later and Harris has amassed a collection of about 40 antique watches, ranging from mid-century Italian dive watches with two-tone bezels to World War II-era military watches to one of his most prized and most worn watches, a 1978 Rolex GMT.
At this point, Harris has gotten deep enough into vintage timepieces to have a very good idea of the designs and options that he likes. For one, he’s really into strange color combinations like on the aforementioned Italian dive watches from a brand called Squale, which he refers to as “Italian disco-y dad watches.”
“I also wear a lot of vintage clothes and I like things that look a bit tattered, and I like watches that sort of have that look about them—they show that they’ve got life stories in them,” he says. “There are a lot of expressions used to describe certain types of features; one that’s been coined by watch nerds is ‘tropical.’”
The term refers to a watch dial that’s been, essentially, aged or discolored by exposure to the sun. For example, a black dial might turn a bit brown or spotted. He says that “tropical” was likely coined by those buying and selling vintage watches as a way to “manifest value out of something that looked like it was trashed.”
Either way, it’s a look that he often finds in well-worn military type watches and in one of his most recent acquisitions, an Omega with a coppery dial that looks like it’s seen some things.
Harris has long harbored an affinity for collecting vintage items, particularly those that have already proven that they’re built to last.
“I really like the idea of the permanence of things,” says Harris. “I think it’s the coolest thing ever to find something that’s incredible in a pile that has tremendous value, whether that value be emotional for you or financial in the case of people who sell professionally.”
During his weekly visits to estate sales (“my wife and I do it most Saturdays and plan a route”) and vintage markets (“on Sundays”) around the San Francisco area, he keeps an eye out for sculptures (like his three-foot-long carved wood shark), bizarre ceramics that “look like they were made by a famous artist, but maybe were also made by a five-year-old” and mid-century Gainey planters to add to his existing collection of nearly 20.
On these outings he also picks up items that could potentially be used in his many “half-baked” bar and restaurant concepts.
“The way that I like to go through the world is, ‘Where is the antique and vintage?’” he says. “When we travel, I want to go to all these places, but then I’m only interested in if they have a flea market. If they don’t it’s probably not a place that I want to go to.”
His most recent opening, Bon Voyage, showcases items he picked up at countless yard sales and design inspiration taken from old postcards with, naturally, the phrase bon voyage! The Packard Pla-Mor Mirror Ball, which doubles as a speaker, hangs in the center of the bar and was one of his pivotal finds when designing the space.
“Sometimes it’s the collection of the things that helps bring the concept to life rather than the opposite,” he says. “With Bon Voyage, for example, there were a lot of moments like that where things that we were finding were continuing to define design decisions about the space rather than having to go formulaically find the things.”
He admits, however, that his obsession sometimes gives his home the feel of a vintage shop—appropriate considering he’s turned his treasure hunting into a side hustle: His Instagram account @BVintageSF regularly offers items he’s looking to sell, including everything from watches and barware to textiles and home decor.

But take heed: His obsession might be contagious.
“Now my wife has a couple, too!” he says. “It’s been a very fun hobby and in very stark contrast to some of the other things I collect that take up a lot of space—my wife is always like, “What the fuck?’ [The watches] totally work for us.” READ THIS LIST"
Artificial Intelligence Tool Can Detect PTSD in a Voice,www.thedailybeast.com,Thor Benson,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/artificial-intelligence-tool-can-detect-ptsd-in-a-voice,"TALK TO ME Artificial Intelligence Tool Can Detect PTSD in a Voice Post-traumatic stress disorder notoriously takes a long time to diagnose. But a machine listening to patients talk could help combat that. Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Getty
What if artificial intelligence could diagnose post-traumatic stress disorder better and faster than a human?
A study published in the journal Depression and Anxiety on Monday claims just that: a new artificial intelligence program listens to patients talk to detect if someone has PTSD.
It nailed diagnosis rates 89 percent of the time.
“Our findings suggest that speech-based characteristics can be used to diagnose this disease, and with further refinement and validation, may be employed in the clinic in the near future,” Charles R. Marmar, a psychiatrist at New York University’s Langone Health, said in a statement.
Researchers had 131 veterans with PTSD and veterans who do not have PTSD complete diagnostic interviews while the program listened, and the program could usually tell if they were suffering from PTSD by analyzing their speech patterns.
The program associates certain ways of speaking with PTSD symptoms. Those who spoke in a less clear and less energetic manner were found to be more likely to suffer from PTSD. The researchers claim that traumatic events may harm sections of the brain that help someone process emotion, which affects how they speak.
PTSD is a prevalent concern among veterans, contributing to what’s been seen as a suicide epidemic in the veteran community. Around 20 veterans die by suicide daily; PTSD is often to blame.
PTSD doesn’t just come from a war setting. According to the Sidran Institute, 70 percent of Americans face a traumatic event in their lives; 20 percent of them will deal with PTSD. At any given moment, 13 million Americans struggle with PTSD.
Gale Lucas, a research assistant professor at the University of Southern California who studies human-computer interaction, told The Daily Beast that being able to quickly identify if someone is suffering from PTSD is crucial.
She said the sooner it’s diagnosed, the sooner a doctor can help the person suffering from the disorder—which means the voice can be a key tool in diagnosing and treating PTSD.
“One of the things that happens is people aren’t very aware of their likelihood of having PTSD,” Lucas said. “There are individuals outside of the warfighters of this country who don’t really know much about PTSD and think it’s for people who have seen a war or been abused or things like that and don’t realize events like car accidents can actually cause PTSD.”
Lucas said it could be extremely helpful if this program was put into an app so people could tell if they’re likely suffering from PTSD while they’re at home. She said many people don’t go to the doctor in the first place because they’re not aware they’re showing symptoms of having PTSD.
“If someone is having trouble and struggling, they may not realize it’s a mental health issue,” Lucas said. “They may think they’re stressed or they’re tired.”
That said, Lucas warned that this kind of technology could be used in more nefarious ways. She said a company like Apple could use Siri to analyze speech and sell that data to advertisers or health insurance companies. An app that uses this technology “could be done in a good way that’s very safe,” but it would have to be created by people who mean well and know how to keep this data safe so it doesn’t end up in the wrong hands.
As with any promising new technology, it comes with benefits and risks. All in all, Lucas said any new piece of technology that can help people get the help they need sooner is a potentially life-saving development.
“People that go undiagnosed are at greater risk than those who have a diagnosis and are seeking treatment,” Lucas said. READ THIS LIST"
Pete Buttigieg Is a National Hero ... in Malta,www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/pete-buttigieg-is-a-national-hero-in-malta,"ISLAND PRIDE Pete Buttigieg Is a National Hero ... in Malta The Maltese are already making plans for what they will do if their favorite son’s son, Pete Buttigieg, is elected as the next U.S. president. 04.23.19 5:08 AM ET Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/The Daily Beast/Getty
There is a popular saying in Maltese that goes something like this: Tixtrix hut fil-bahar , or “don’t pay for the fish while they are still in the sea.”
But on the tiny European island, the Maltese are already making plans for what they will do if their favorite son’s son, Pete Buttigieg, is elected as the next U.S. president. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has even officially endorsed Buttigieg’s candidacy and has said he is proud to call him a friend.
“We will hold a parade for sure,” Maria Cutajar, a local florist, told The Daily Beast when asked what it would mean if he won. “It would be amazing to have a Maltese in the White House.”
Malta, which has an area of just 122 square miles, has been the site of numerous summits—it’s where U.S. President George H.W. Bush met Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to end the Cold War—and Franklin D. Roosevelt visited the island in December 1943.
The fact that Buttigieg is gay is the last thing on most Maltese people's minds. The island nation is leap years ahead of the rest of Europe in terms of gay marriage rights and same sex adoption rights, which has been especially slow to become law in Catholic countries in southern Europe. Locals are more concerned that his biggest problem is the country’s reputation for lawlessness.
Malta tends to be tied to corruption, whether for the sale of E.U. passports to wealthy Russians or to crime for the yet unsolved murder of muckraker journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. “It would be nice to be known for something good for a change,” Cutajar said.
But they won’t be renaming a Maltese street after the top Democrat—it would just be too confusing. You see, while Buttigieg has become somewhat of a comical challenge for Americans to pronounce, it is one of the most common last names on the tiny island state.
‘Mayor Pete’ as most people call the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, because his last name is too unpronounceable, is the son of a well known Maltese immigrant Joseph Buttigieg, who taught at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana until his death in January 2019. The professor studied in London and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1979, but he also left a strong legacy in Malta. He was an external PhD examiner who often visited the university to lecture. He also continued until his illness to be an expert lecturer across Europe on Antonio Gramsci, the Italian Marxist philosopher whose ideology is still embraced in many left-leaning circles.
The elder Buttigieg, who translated Gramsci’s Prison Notebooks , studied at the University of Malta, where he has a lecture hall and a small coffee room dedicated to him. The elder Buttigieg traveled to Moscow to meet Gramsci’s son Delio as part of his research, and quotes him in his research notes.
Five of the eight aunts and uncles of ‘Mayor Pete’ still live on the island of Malta, where locals say the famous nephew has visited many times. There are numerous tourism websites that now show pictures of the Democratic hopeful on sunny beaches and superimposed in restaurants.
The ending ‘tigieg,’ which is Semitic in origin, oddly actually translates to the word ‘poultry’ and is part of countless last names. The first instances of the surname Buttigieg go back to the middle ages, and the Times of Malta reports that it is the most popular last name on the small island of Gozo off the Maltese coast, made famous in the movie By the Sea , in which Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt played a warring couple.
Writing in the Journal of the Maltese Diaspora , the editors have vowed to honor their American presidential hopeful whether he wins or not. “He has put Malta on the map,” they say.
And that isn’t always easy for such a tiny speck of land."
Democratic Ad Firm Accused of Fake News Retools for 2020,www.thedailybeast.com,Lachlan.Markay@thedailybeast.com (Lachlan Markay),04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/motiveai-a-democratic-ad-firm-accused-of-fake-news-retools-for-2020,"TAKE TWO Democratic Ad Firm Accused of Fake News Retools for 2020 Dan Fletcher, who runs MotiveAI, says the company is retrofitting its approach to campaign news after its much-criticized 2018 operation. 04.23.19 5:08 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast
A digital advertising company that came under intense scrutiny last year for its deceptive political ads on social media is gearing up to get involved in some crucial 2020 battleground states. But it’s retooling its approach to avoid the backlash that befell it in 2018.
MotiveAI, a Denver-based startup with backing from billionaire LinkedIn chairman Reid Hoffman, has built a new social media-based news agency called Versa, and it’s already dipping its toes into key 2020 U.S. Senate races.
That involvement caught the eye of a nonprofit ethics group, which alleged deceptive ad practices, and Facebook, which has tried to add layers of transparency to political ads like the ones MotiveAI backed last cycle. The firm insists that its tactics have changed and Versa says it is aiming to be upfront and trusted this go around. But while MotiveAI says its work this cycle will be purely nonpartisan, it’s also weighing in on some high-profile elections, providing yet another illustration of how digital politicking can often intersect with straightforward political news.
It’s a growing phenomenon on both sides of the political aisle. Joe Pounder, the co-founder of Republican research firm America Rising, told Politico on Monday that “the surface blurring of lines between reporting and opposition research” is a major trend in contemporary politics. “All information is now democratized so everyone can act like a researcher and reporter.”
Versa appears to create little stand-alone reporting. Instead it relies mostly on short, slickly-produced videos analyzing stories already in the news, which it posts through its pages on Facebook and Instagram, and paid ads that promote reporting by other outlets that aligns with its progressive politics. Versa has already set up three state-focused Facebook pages devoted to Colorado, Arizona, and Kentucky, and is currently developing plans for five or six more, according to MotiveAI chief executive Dan Fletcher. And while Fletcher insists that the aim is to fill a perceived digital news gap in those states, he also acknowledges that those states were picked precisely for their importance in the 2020 cycle.
“We’re taking a look at where we think the political conversation is going to be be over the next few years,” Fletcher told The Daily Beast in an interview on Saturday. “Arizona obviously has a senate race in 2020, there’s going to be a lot of conversation going on around that. Kentucky, I mean, Mitch McConnell is at the center of every national conversation.”
“I don’t think we’re positioning Versa as the vehicle to deliver Democratic wins,” he added. “But I do think there’s going to be a lot of media misinformation that happens within these states because of this cycle, and standing up a trusted, transparent media property in the two years before the cycle, and before all that activity starts to happen, is a good defensive mechanism.”
Versa is not a project of any MotiveAI client. Fletcher said the company is funding “internally” from “venture dollars.” It was incorporated in Colorado in January, and has since brought on a number of senior staff members from pioneering progressive digital media property Upworthy, including that company’s head of standards.
The ads Versa is running on its state-specific Facebook pages include generic local news content and short, catchy videos on current events. But they also include more politically-themed posts about candidates running in 2020 Senate races. Versa Arizona has placed ads attacking newly elected Arizona Republican Party chair Kelly Ward and boosting Democratic senate challenger Mark Kelly. Its Colorado page has recently boosted stories going after incumbent Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) and promoted two of his potential Democratic challengers—one of whom, former state senator Mike Johnston, has received significant financial backing from Hoffman, the MotiveAI investor.
“Versa wants to be public facing in having a progressive point of view. No one’s hiding that,” Fletcher acknowledges. “But at the same time, I don’t think we’re solely in one camp or the other.” Asked what, in his mind, differentiates ideologically-aligned news media from political advocacy, Fletcher said: “The factualness and making sure that we’re not taking cheap shots... makes it more on the side of political news for me than political advertising.”
Some prior MotiveAI’s advertising campaigns came down on the other end of that divide. Its 2018 social media strategy involved a number of stand-alone Facebook pages that didn’t disclose their relationship to MotiveAI. Fletcher says his company acted as a vendor for those pages and the “partners” responsible for the ad campaigns. Some of those pages wooed followers with apolitical organic content before bombarding them with paid political ads, and trafficked in conspiracy theories and outlandish, occasionally sexist content.
Four Colorado-based limited liability companies associated with MotiveAI used nearly 50 seemingly independent Facebook pages to purchase ads in 2018. The goal was to target specific demographics with paid ads that promoted progressive and Democratic messages. Many of its Facebook pages were named to sound like news organizations, such as Empire News and Pacific Sun Chronicle. Others tried to appeal to specific groups, including seniors, veterans, Christians, and gun owners.
The messaging of some of those pages’ ads ranged from the offensive to the downright bizarre . A page called Drain The Swamp, which appeared to target Republicans, promoted conspiracy theories that Brett Kavanaugh—then facing a bitter Supreme Court confirmation fight—had helped Bill and Hillary Clinton cover up the murder of a White House aide. Another page, called The Keg Bros, dubbed Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) a “C.W.I.L.F.,” or “congresswoman I’d like to fuck,” and made sexist comments about Republican mega-donor Rebekah Mercer.
After the 2018 election, MotiveAI took some credit for Democratic gains in the House of Representatives. “We produced over 260 videos and over 5,000 individual ads,” the company said in a sizzle reel promoting its work, “which led to 28 districts flipped and the highest Democratic margin since 1972 [and the] first time in eight years the Democrats took control of the House.”
The video concluded by proclaiming, “We can do more in 2020,” with the logos of prominent social media companies pointing to an image of the White House seal.
After The Daily Beast asked Fletcher about that video and its claims, it was removed from the web. (The Daily Beast downloaded a copy of the video before it was taken down.)
The apparently political nature of MotiveAI’s ad campaign last year led the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a right-leaning watchdog group, to lodge a complaint with the Federal Election Commission. The group alleged that News for Democracy, one of the LLCs that MotiveAI had used to pay for political ads on Facebook, had failed to disclose what amounted to outright political advocacy, as required by law.
FACT’s complaint identified a number of ads on pages geared towards states with competitive 2018 Senate contests, including North Dakota, Florida, and Tennessee. Most of them appeared to be what the FEC considers “electioneering communications,” or ads mentioning a candidate for office, but that don’t explicitly advocate for the election or defeat of that candidate. Some of them, though, seemed to cross that line into “express advocacy,” or explicit calls for a vote for a particular candidate or political party. One ad on the page Sounds like Tennessee, for instance, declared, “I’ll be voting Democrat in the midterm elections on November 6.”
But FACT’s complaint failed to grapple with a key question, according to Brendan Fischer, the director of federal and FEC reform programs at the Campaign Legal Center.
The complaint “doesn’t show that these ads would not qualify for the media exemption,” Fischer explained. “The FEC correctly gives broad latitude to media, so to argue that an organization calling itself ‘News for Democracy’ should be subject to campaign finance regulation would require showing that the entity is not a legitimate press entity, or that it is not acting in its legitimate press function when running these ads. The complaint doesn’t do that.”
In 2020, Versa is not taking chances that groups like FACT may tighten their FEC complaints. It's recasting its approach to make it closer to that of a news organization, which should, in turn, make arguments that it is engaged in surreptitious politicking more difficult to mount.
That divide between news and political content is one with which Facebook itself has been forced to grapple as it attempts to make its role as a political advertising platform more transparent. The company rolled out a searchable database of political ads last spring, and quickly faced criticism over its classification of some news content as political advertising.
MotiveAI has already faced some scrutiny from Facebook over how it delivers its advertising. In January, the Washington Post reported that the company was investigating News for Democracy and other MotiveAI-affiliated pages over allegations that their ad campaigns misrepresented the interests behind them.
At the same time, Hoffman, the main MotiveAI investor, has come under intense scrutiny over his backing of separate Facebook ad campaigns that sought to falsely tie the 2017 Senate candidacy of Roy Moore (R-AL) to nonexistent Russian government actors.
MotiveAI’s history last cycle, and the controversy that has bedeviled a number of Facebook advertisers since last year, including MotiveAI itself, has prompted the company’s new political advertising property to put a premium on transparency.
Versa, Fletcher noted, will be operating parallel to—though, he insists, completely separate from—MotiveAI’s more explicitly partisan work as a political vendor. There will be a “strict firewall,” he said, between Versa’s news operation and MotiveAI’s work for its clients.
“What I learned from the experience in the fall was that people on Facebook have an expectation of more transparency from where their political info or news is coming from,” Fletcher said. “We’re not trying to hide who’s behind it, and the positioning of it is we’re going to put out all the information about what we believe and what we want to see happen and you’ll either trust us or you won’t.”"

When President Donald Trump is railing against a Christmas rerun of Saturday Night Live —as he did last month to unintentionally comic effect—it’s sometimes easy to forget that he actually hosted the show less than four years ago.
That episode, which aired almost one year to the day before he won the 2016 election, came months after Trump rode down that golden escalator and announced his presidential campaign by calling Mexican immigrants “rapists.” That alone should have disqualified him from the comedy gig, my guest on this week’s episode of The Last Laugh podcast says.
“Shame on them,” former Obama speechwriter Jon Lovett tells me when I ask about Saturday Night Live ’s decision during our recent taping in his Crooked Media studio . “He came down that escalator and he said Mexicans are rapists. He came down that escalator and he began one of the most despicable campaigns in modern American history. It wasn’t a joke, it wasn’t funny then.”
For the host of the popular podcasts Pod Save America and Lovett or Leave It , it is just one example of “what we allow when you talk about the right people or the wrong people.”
“Look, if Donald Trump said the same types of things about gay people that he said about Mexicans, if he said the same kind of thing about Jews that he said about Muslims, there would be no chance that he could host Saturday Night Live ,” Lovett says. “Of course not. I think it was a mistake.”
In one sense, Lovett “understands” why the show booked Trump. The fall of 2015 was still a time when most of America considered the idea of a Donald Trump presidency a far-fetched joke. Four years earlier, it had been the basis for many of the punchlines Lovett wrote for President Obama to deliver at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner when Trump was in the audience , something else we talk about at length in our podcast conversation.
“It was a moment when we were grappling with something, which is, what do you do when America—one of its two political parties—embraces someone who is morally unacceptable?” Lovett asks. “What do you do? I don’t know the answer, but you definitely don’t let them host Saturday Night Live. ” “Look, if Donald Trump said the same types of things about gay people that he said about Mexicans, there would be no chance that he could host Saturday Night Live.” — Jon Lovett
The fact that S NL helped legitimize Trump during his primary campaign makes the president’s relentless outrage at the show’s current portrayal of him all the more baffling.
“As a rule, Saturday Night Live reruns should not have this much power in our politics,” Lovett jokes. But at the same time he warns against dismissing as “idle threats” Trump’s tweets about taking away NBC’s license or having the FCC investigate the comedy show’s content.
“You know, the thing with Donald Trump is, it’s fascism for the cameras,” he says. “So he says he’s going to shut the border down, he says he’s going to go after their licenses, he says he’s going to get the post office to go after the Washington Post . And usually, he’s just saying it. But once in a while, he means it. Once in a while he shuts down the border for a couple of hours.”
“So you have to take him quite seriously while at the same time recognizing that he wasn’t thinking, he wasn’t planning, he wasn’t imagining the policy,” Lovett continues. “He was spouting off because he’s an angry old man who’s slowing down and can’t believe that after his entire life of seeking the respect of people in Manhattan, his whole life of trying to get these people to like him—though unwilling to do the work or show the discipline required to get it—he is the president of the United States and he still doesn’t have people’s respect.”
“And deep down, I think he knows he doesn’t deserve it and that’s what he’s mad at,” he concludes, wrapping up this particular rant. “He’s mad at Donald Trump.”

How Mitch McConnell Became King of the Internet Trolls,www.thedailybeast.com,Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey) William.Sommer@thedailybeast.com (Will Sommer),04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/mitch-mcconnell-2020-how-the-senate-majority-leader-embraced-his-role-as-the-king-of-the-memes,"04.23.19 5:06 AM ET Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/The Daily Beast/Photo by Win McNamee/Getty
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) kicked off his 2020 reelection bid last Wednesday with a dose of high-octane trolling.
In addition to touting his record “defending conservatism” and “delivering for the commonwealth,” his fresh new website included a 404 error page featuring perhaps his signature achievement: a photo of Merrick Garland, the Obama Supreme Court nominee whom McConnell blocked.
The page quickly went viral, with establishment GOP figures tweeting their approval and amusement.
Later in the day, McConnell’s campaign team posted a short video, set to DJ Khaled’s triumphant “All I Do Is Win,” of the senator posing with a blank smile as highlights from the last two years rolled.
Hoping to win his seventh term in office, McConnell is trying a new tactic this time around. In addition to touting his powerful perch in the Senate and the good it does for his home state of Kentucky, the majority leader and his very online advisers are also attempting to cement his unlikely status as a right-wing internet folk hero. Rubbing the Garland failure in the faces of liberals is just part of it.
“If you spend more than two seconds online you will encounter some left-wing troll invoking Merrick Garland as justification for all brands of hate towards McConnell,” said Josh Holmes, a longtime former aide to McConnell. “He knows this is a partisan viewpoint, and frankly it doesn’t bother him, so he chooses to have a sense of humor about it rather than wring his hands and be a scold like so many in politics.”
A buttoned-up 77-year-old Kentuckian might not seem like the ideal template for the role of King of the Internet Troll. But that’s the role he is quickly beginning to master. McConnell’s path toward social media stardom kicked into high gear in 2018. That year, disgraced West Virginia coal baron Don Blankenship, then running in the state’s GOP primary for U.S. Senate, cited the discovery years ago of cocaine packages on a ship owned by the father of Elaine Chao, McConnell’s wife, to dub McConnell “Cocaine Mitch.”
McConnell found the nickname hilarious, according to Holmes, and wanted to embrace it as his online “alter ego.” When Blankenship lost the primary, McConnell’s team tweeted an edited promotional picture from Narcos , the Netflix show about drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. In the tweet, McConnell was superimposed over Escobar and surrounded by plumes of cocaine.
In some conservative internet circles, McConnell GIF’s have become common additions to tweets and posts. Images of the majority leader smirking have become synonymous with “owning the libs.” And McConnell, in turn, has embraced the idea that his most significant achievements, like blocking Garland and pushing Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination through the Senate, continue to gin up outrage on the left.
“A lot of those brand pieces for McConnell came from attacks his team flipped into positive attributes, and it works that they have a member who relishes in being the strongman when it comes to Senate accomplishments,” said a Republican strategist, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about McConnell’s strategy.”
“For years, he’s been the left’s foil,” the strategist added. “He didn’t always get appreciated for it on the right until it came to fights like Merrick Garland. The way the left attacked him on Merrick Garland was what the right needed to hear to turn him into that folk hero.”
Team McConnell's meme acumen has been so impressive that it’s been noticed by others in the conservative social media universe. “CarpeDonktum,” a Trump meme-maker whose video edits have been reposted by the president, called McConnell “extremely memeable” based on the contrast between the wild “Cocaine Mitch” persona and his reserved nature.
“It's become endearing,” CarpeDonktum wrote in a Twitter direct message with The Daily Beast. “The interplay of the two competing ideas... Drug Kingpin Mitch McConnell. The right is very good at embracing ludicrous branding and turning it on its head.”
On Reddit’s pro-Trump “The_Donald” forum, Trump fans gush over the majority leader they call “The Turtle”—in honor of his reptilian resemblance— festooning posts about him with turtle emojis .
“Let’s show this hero-turtle some love!” read one highly upvoted post about McConnell from October.
“THAT’S OUR TURTLE,” cheered another after the Senate confirmed Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
But the pro-Trump internet posters who have embraced McConnell because he infuriates liberals have also turned their meming abilities against McConnell when he’s fallen out of line with the president. That’s never more true when it comes to the inability of Congress to pass money to fund the border wall.
“Generally he has been supportive of Trump's agenda, but you never know where he will fall,” CarpeDonktum said.
Observers of the McConnell meme phenomenon acknowledge that there is some separation between hardcore pro-Trump people on social media and those who get their kicks by posting triumphant McConnell GIFs. But the expectation is that those universes will continue to overlap and that McConnell’s Garland troll will simply be the opening salvo for 2020.
“If history is your guide,” said Holmes, “my guess is that you’ll see a lot more ‘Cocaine Mitch’ this cycle.”"
The 2020 Election Is Going to Make 2016 Look Like a Student Council Election,www.thedailybeast.com,Matt.Lewis@thedailybeast.com (Matt Lewis),04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-2020-election-is-going-to-make-2016-look-like-a-student-council-election,"BUCKLE UP The 2020 Election Is Going to Make 2016 Look Like a Student Council Election Rudy says taking info from our adversaries is fine, and Trump thinks so, too. Look out—the 2020 election is going to be a sewer. opinion Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/The Daily Beast/Getty
It’s time we face facts about 2020. It will be so dirty, brimming with disinformation, and packed with hackers that it'll make 2016 look like a student council election.
On Sunday, Rudy Giuliani went on CNN’s State of the Union and declared , “There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians.”
“You're assuming that the giving of information is a campaign contribution,” Rudy averred to CNN’s Jake Tapper. “Read the report carefully. The report says we can't conclude that because the law is pretty much against that. People get information from this person, that person.”
Talk about defining deviancy down.
Of course, Rudy’s interpretation is open to debate . My read of the Mueller report suggests that opposition research may constitute a “thing of value,” which is tantamount to a contribution. The question, though, is whether anyone on Trump’s team “knowingly and willfully” violated the law. Intent is hard to prove.
But let’s assume that Rudy is correct about the legality (he’s a lawyer—I’m not). As the president’s personal attorney, his words have weight. And taking Rudy at his word, why wouldn’t a 2020 campaign be willing to avail itself of information from Russia, Turkey, or China? And why wouldn’t Russia, Turkey, or China oblige?
Back in February, The Daily Beast asked every presidential campaign running or exploring a run “whether they would commit to not knowingly using or referencing hacked material that appears online on grounds that it may have been obtained illegally.”
The only campaign that refused to make such a commitment was Donald Trump’s.
Of course, unilateral disarmament rarely lasts more than one election cycle. It didn’t take long for Michelle Obama’s “When they go low, we go high” line to morph into, “When they go low, we kick them.”
There’s a real danger in normalizing this behavior.
I’m not suggesting Trump should have been indicted, or that he should be impeached. What I am suggesting is that a lack of consequences creates the impression that you can take information from a foreign national with impunity.
In the wake of Watergate, a generation of American politicians and operatives were chastened. Being a straight arrow (or pretending to be) became a selling point. What lessons are being derived from the narrative Rudy is spinning about the Mueller report?
And if American politicians and political operatives are learning the wrong lessons, what are we then teaching our foreign adversaries?
In response to the hacking, the United States imposed sanctions on Russian individuals and organizations. But Russian efforts to undermine our elections worked beyond their wildest dreams.
Prior to the midterms, U.S. intel chief Dan Coats warned ,""We assess that Russia is likely to continue to pursue even more aggressive cyberattacks with the intent of degrading our democratic values and weakening our alliances.""And as the Beast noted in February: “ Russian hackers did target candidates in the midterm cycle and the fear among operatives and cybersecurity experts is that the same pattern will hold true in [the 2020] election.”
Even if campaigns vow to steer clear of hacked material—and Team Trump hasn’t done that—there’s still a serious danger that information will be disseminated via the media and/or social media. What complicates matters is that disinformation could be just as dangerous as hacked information.
This isn’t just the kind of scam that your mom might fall for on Facebook (though that’s still a problem). Disinformation is getting increasingly sophisticated. As The New York Times reported last year , “Artificial intelligence video tools make it relatively easy to put one person’s face on another person’s body with few traces of manipulation.” “We are entering an era where we can expect our campaigns to play dirty and our adversaries to interfere in our elections.”
The potential for foul play is sobering. “It’s not hard to imagine this technology’s being used to smear politicians, create counterfeit revenge porn or frame people for crimes. Lawmakers have already begun to worry about how deepfakes could be used for political sabotage and propaganda,” the Times continued.
We are entering an era where we can expect our campaigns to play dirty and our adversaries to interfere in our elections. And technology is outpacing our ability to filter out propaganda. Why don’t these issues rank on a top-20 list of things we need to worry about?
In a serious world, every campaign would have to vow not to use hacked data or information. Media outlets and social media platforms would craft policies that reflect both the law and ethical concerns. And our government would aggressively prioritize cybersecurity and election integrity.
Why aren’t we doing any of those things? The 2020 election is right around the corner. Few people appreciate how destabilizing things could be if we don’t get serious about keeping the trains from careening off the rails. READ THIS LIST"
The Bizarre Cult of Meghan Markle Pregnancy Truthers,www.thedailybeast.com,Jasmin Malik Chua,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-bizarre-cult-of-meghan-markle-pregnancy-truthers,"The Bizarre Cult of Meghan Markle Pregnancy Truthers Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photo by Getty Like Beyoncé before her, the Duchess of Sussex has been targeted by online conspiracy theorists over her pregnancy, with those questioning it calling themselves ‘Megxiteers.’
M eghan Markle isn’t pregnant and never has been .
The ever-expanding bump? Bogus. The visibly popped navel? Phony. The rapturous glow? Fabricated. The beatific belly-cradling? A complete con job. #WakeUpSheeple.
Thus speak the conspiracy theorists, who riddle Twitter and Instagram with hashtags like #Megxit, #DuchessofDeception, #charlatanduchess and the helpfully descriptive #meghanmarkleisnotpregnant. They claim that Meghan has been strapping on a pillow or a bespoke prosthetic called a Moonbump for the past eight months to hide the “truth” of her pregnancy—which is to say, there isn’t one. She and her husband, Prince Harry, have hired a surrogate, who is either Talia Brown Thall , Meghan’s erstwhile stylist, or a woman who was spotted leaning against a wall outside Westminster Abbey in March. As evidence they cite the shifting position of her belly button, her superhuman ability to bend over , and the way her stomach jiggles like a molded aspic at a community potluck .
“I don’t think Meghan Markle is actually pregnant. I think they are using a #surrogate and lying to the public. #moonbump,” one observer wrote on Twitter . “Meghan’s pregnancy is a fake pregnancy, she is wearing a bump that keeps enlarging or shrinking in size, she is able to bend over and even run in her supposed 8th month of pregnancy. She’s using a surrogate. Research it,” another sniffed . “God I never thought she was so cunning. Like pulling a fake pregnancy in front of the whole world?? Not even telling her own family?? How did she think she will pull it off??” a third clucked .
Whipping Megxiteers into a particular state of frenzy is the mysterious case of the disappearing and reappearing “magic bump.” On YouTube, a vlogger by the nom de guerre of DanjA zonE posted a video that supposedly captures a “bump-free” Duchess of Sussex ducking into a waiting car during her five-day girls’ trip to New York City in February. Framed as “absolute proof” of Meghan’s subterfuge, it is presented in the manner of the Zapruder film. “I cannot believe that they are showing this,” DanjA zonE drawls over the slowed-down footage, which has racked up more than 226,000 views. “I cannot believe that this hasn’t [been] stripped from this planet somehow. Unbelievable!” Even her dog, she adds, is shaken by what she caught, which you can kind of, sort of see if you squint at the screen with your head half-cocked like you’re staring at one of those Magic Eye pictures. You’re more likely to give yourself a headache.
Brandwatch , a social-media monitoring firm from England, estimates that 1.5 million people saw discussions about Meghan and her “Moonbump” on their timelines from January to February. The number must be quadruple that by now. To be sure, the number of people who believe Meghan’s pregnancy is genuine still overshadows those who don’t, but the seeds of doubt have been sown. Per Brandwatch, 16 percent of mentions of Meghan’s pregnancy now include “terms related to it being fake.” The #Megxit hashtag has caught on the fastest, growing at a rate of roughly 1,500 mentions per week. It’s “primarily driven” by women, with around 75 percent of gender-categorized authors using it registering as female.
“There’s a lot of nasty stuff when you click through the mentions and read them individually,” Gemma Joyce, a social-media journalist for the company, wrote in a blog post in February. “It’s reminiscent of some of the similar criticism Beyoncé received during her pregnancy, which were never actually substantiated.”
This degree of investment in Britain’s longest-running reality show isn’t the surprising part. It’s the unalloyed hostility that Katie Nicholl, royal correspondent for Vanity Fair , The Mail on Sunday , and author of Harry and Meghan: Life, Loss, and Love , finds so befuddling.
“As a high-profile celebrity and member of the royal family, [Meghan will experience] highs and lows in the media” she said. “However, I have been surprised by the level of bile and vitriol thrown her way. Suggestions that she has faked her own pregnancy are ludicrous. I do think the online trolling has got out of hand and has been unacceptable.”
Indeed Kate Middleton, who is married to Harry’s older brother, William, didn’t encounter the same degree of rancor during her three pregnancies. “There have been points where she has had a difficult time in the media,” Nicholl said. “She’s been accused of being boring, she was labelled ‘Waity Katie’ in the media because she waited for so long for William to propose, but I don’t think she’s been subjected to the same backlash as Meghan.”
Harry and Meghan’s reluctance to broadcast the plans surrounding the birth of their first child has only dialed up the furor, especially after Buckingham Palace announced Thursday that “their Royal Highnesses have taken a personal decision to keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private.”
Also not helping? Rumors that the couple is snubbing the Queen’s household doctors (the “men in suits,” Meghan reportedly called them) and the Lindo Wing of West London’s St. Mary’s Hospital, which has served as the site of several royal births—including all of Kate’s and Harry and William’s own. A home birth in the secluded grounds of the Frogmore Estate, away from the klieg lights of Kensington Palace, Meghan’s critics say , provides the perfect cover for sneaking a surrogate in and out. Meghan herself hasn’t been seen in public since March 19, when she visited New Zealand House with Prince Harry to offer their condolences in the wake of the Christchurch mosque shootings .
In another break from modern royal tradition, the Sussexes have also expressed the desire to shield their newborn from the popping camera flashes that typify such occasions. Courtiers say the couple will issue an alert once the blessed event occurs, but Harry and Meghan will share their bliss “once they have had an opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family” and not a moment before. If they do pose for a photograph for media distribution, it will be on their terms, timeline and locale of their own choosing. Baby Sussex might even make his or her debut on Instagram, which would be very millennial of them. There will be no press pens, photocalls, or immaculately made-up post-labor shots on the hospital steps à la the Duchess of Cambridge. “ That is exactly what trolls aim to do: incite negative emotions. There is probably another more malevolent agenda as well, which is to taint or corrupt this special time for Meghan. ”
“Meghan and Harry have made their own choices about the birth and they’re not going to be influenced by what people think,” Nicholl said. “They are going to do what’s right for them.”
So why won’t the pregnancy truthers let them?
Erin Buckels, a postdoctoral researcher in psychology at the University of British Columbia in Canada, says that women in the spotlight are often magnets for negative comments online, although the behavior often says more about the people fanning the flames than it does their victims.
“There is so much media attention on her pregnancy and trolls gravitate toward attention—the more sensational and bizarre the claim, the more it will arouse strong emotions, like anger and disgust, in Meghan’s supporters,” she said. “That is exactly what trolls aim to do: incite negative emotions. There is probably another more malevolent agenda as well, which is to taint or corrupt this special time for Meghan.”
Buckels’ research suggests that online trolling is fueled by “an appetite for cruelty.” While not all trolls are sadists, she found that people who delight in trolling others online also derive pleasure from viewing images of people in physical and emotional pain, which they frequently downplay or attempt to rationalize away.
“They enjoy cruelty, but like most people, they want to view themselves as decent human beings,” she said. “I also found that trolls think that harm is morally acceptable if it is funny. You find the exact same pattern for people with sadistic and psychopathic personality traits. Trolling is just another fun game for people with sadistic tendencies.”
The specificity of the charges against Meghan isn’t unusual, according to Daniel Jolley , a senior lecturer in social psychology who specializes in conspiracy theories at Staffordshire University. Take, for instance, the people who insist that the September 11 terror attacks were an “inside job” by shadowy elements of the U.S. government who collaborated with—or framed—al Qaeda operatives.
“The detail of conspiracy theories can be wide-ranging,” Jolley said. “A conspiracy theory needs to appear coherent where there is a clear conspiracy—with having something very specific in essence, makes the theory more believable.”
Conspiracy theories are more than a spot of harmless farm. They can shape the worldviews of people who are already suspicious of people in power. “We know that conspiracy theories are influential—they can change the way we think and potentially behave; they are also resistant to correction,” he said. “Potentially being exposed to these conspiracy theories, for a person who has mistrust towards others, could fuel their belief that this is actually true.”
Celebrity culture is just more chum for conspiracy nuts. And royalty is just inherited celebrity. “I think that in general, we're all conspiracy theorists in a way,” said Elaine Lui , Canada’s gossip maven. “People perceive celebrity in Hollywood to be smoke and mirrors—that they do one thing but they say another thing, and publicists are constantly covering up things for celebrities. It’s only natural that it would spill over to royals.”
Meghan isn’t the first member of the royal family to find herself mired in conspiracy theories—nor will she be the last. More than two decades after William and Harry’s mother, the late Princess Diana, and her lover, Dodi Al-Fayed, perished in a Paris car crash , armchair detectives persist in allegations that the two were murdered at the behest of the Mountbatten-Windsors. It’s not just the usual tin-foil crowd that believes this, either. One of the leading champions of this theory is Mohamed Al-Fayed, Dodi’s father and former owner of Britain’s hallowed Harrods department store.
“So even in royal family recent history there’s been conspiracy theories,” Lui said. “I think this is just part of our culture.”
Celebrity tabloids flog their own brand of conspiracy theory. The glossy covers that flank supermarket checkout lines promise an unrelenting succession of pregnancy speculations, “bump watches,” and post-baby bodies. Spared no quarter, women are endlessly scrutinized, dissected and objectified in these pages.
“I always say that celebrity is just a reflection of our own social values, and even without the tabloids leading us there, we are always looking at women and wondering if they’re pregnant,” Lui said. “There is an obsession within us about women’s bodies and that is, for sure, a symptom of a greater social discussion we can have about women’s bodies, how they’re policed, and how we have been conditioned by those systems to behave this way.”
Casting aspersions on a celebrity’s pregnancy isn’t a new thing. Besides Meghan and Beyoncé (see: Bumpgate ), similar rumors have hounded Khloé Kardashian , Katie Holmes , Nicole Kidman and Danielle Jonas , wife of eldest JoBro, Kevin. (On the flip side, Jennifer Aniston’s uterus has been carrying triplets for the past two decades.) There are two types of celebrity who attract conspiracy theories, Lui said: reality stars and the ultra-private. “With the Kardashians, we don’t know what’s real, versus what’s scripted, versus what’s scripted but then becomes real. It just becomes a snake eating its own head,” she said. “But then, there’s another branch of celebrity that’s so elusive, so mysterious.”
Beyoncé falls into the latter category. “She’s not as accessible. In fact she may be one of the most inaccessible celebrities,” Lui said. “She’s also one of the biggest celebrities in the world if not the biggest. So when you factor in her level of fame, plus her inaccessibility, then in that gap, people have questions. What is she doing? How does she get from A to B? People are constantly speculating about what she’s up to and what’s going on with her.”
And what is the royal family if not a deliberately cultivated cipher? Their public appearances are painstakingly choreographed affairs full of pomp, pageantry and masked emotions. It isn’t for nothing, after all, that Richard Cawston’s fly-on-the-wall documentary about the Mountbatten-Windsors has been kept tightly under lid since 1969. Its sins include “letting daylight in on royal magic,” “destroying the mystique” and, most egregious of all, showing the royals to be ordinary mortals.
“The royal family is not walking red carpets every night. They’re not going to Hollywood parties. They’re not going to the opening of a restaurant,” Lui said. “When we see them, it’s usually at a charitable event. And they’re royal—they live in even more secure circumstances than regular celebrities, so there’s all kinds of mystery about their protocol and how they act and operate.”
Still, the animosity directed at Meghan makes little sense, considering the glowing plaudits she received in the beginning for mixing modernity with the monarchy. Was it her American “Hollywoodness” (complete with A-list chums like the Clooneys and Oprah) that first put people’s noses out of joint? Her penchant for pricey designer duds, 5 a.m. emails, and extravagant transatlantic baby showers? Her messy father and blabbermouth sister? Or was it her so-called “bridezilla” antics, gleefully recounted in exacting detail by the tabloids, and Harry’s purported pronouncement that “whatever Meghan wants, Meghan gets” that did her in? Certainly Meghan’s pride in her mixed-race heritage hasn’t endeared her to a particular segment of highly nativist, Brexit-era Britain.
“Western culture, whether or not we want to admit it, is still rooted in white supremacy,” Lui said. “And I think a lot of the shit she’s been taking definitely has to do with the fact that she’s a biracial woman and there are certain people who think she’s not good enough or she’s going to contaminate the royal bloodline. And that’s really, really gross.”
For Nicholl, Meghan’s arrival has shaken the foundations of a centuries-old institution that is stodigly resistant to change. That depth of visceral discomfort can manifest itself in several ways, including lashing out.
“I personally don’t think the criticism of Meghan has anything to do with her being biracial or American, but I do think that as a strong and opinionated woman who has married into one of the oldest institutions on the planet, she is going to come up against some traditionalists who don’t like the way she is doing things so differently,” Nicholl said. “Whether it’s not wearing a hat in the company of the Queen, or not wearing tights or writing to sex workers on bananas, there will be some people looking to find fault in this ‘new’ way of being royal.”
Likewise, for all of the “dubious ‘proof’” of Meghan’s “fake pregnancy,” Joyce from Brandwatch can’t find just cause for why people dislike her so much. The acrimony comes from a place of primordial emotion, not rationality.
“Perhaps that’s because the underlying reasons go unsaid publicly—Meghan Markle has joined the royal family, the epitome of the establishment, as a non-white divorcee with a passion for supporting demonized communities,” she said. “She’s different, and maybe it’s that and not the way her clothing folds around her belly that’s given way to the disgusting vitriol around her.”
Joyce concluded: “Truly depressing stuff.”

"Scouted: Introducing The Breeze, The Lightweight, 100% Plant-Based Comforter Made from Eucalyptus",www.thedailybeast.com,jillian.lucas@thedailybeast.com (Jillian Lucas),04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/a-lightweight-sustainable-comforter-from-buffy-is-here,"Scouted By The Beast
One of the best things I own is my Buffy Cloud Comforter . It’s the softest comforter (even without a duvet cover) that I’ve ever used. It’s heavy enough to use in the winter but breathable enough to be used into the beginning of summer. But what about the warm summer nights when you still want another layer? That's where Buffy’s newest comforter, the Breeze , comes in. It’s made from100% eucalyptus fiber, meaning it’s breathable and eco-friendly.
The Cloud was launched as an eco-friendly, luxurious comforter made from eucalyptus fiber shell and fill made from recycled plastic bottles. According to the brand’s press release, the Breeze is the first time a comforter has been made from 100% plant-based fibers and the first to be made entirely from eucalyptus. Most other eco-friendly brands have “bamboo viscose, straw, milkweed, and other materials.” It’s also fully compostable.
Unlike the traditional grid design of comforters, the Breeze’s unique wave pattern lends strength to its structural integrity and supports the fill, meaning it won’t shift around and clump up as you use it.
The Breeze starts at $170 for a Twin/Twin XL, $210 for a Full/Queen, and $250 for a King/Cal King. I’ve talked before about investing in a larger comforter so you’re not fighting with your partner at night, and this is as good of a time as any to upgrade.

NBA Coach Luke Walton Sued for Sexual Assault by Sports Reporter Kelli Tennant,www.thedailybeast.com,Robert Silverman,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/luke-walton-nba-coach-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-sports-reporter-kelli-tennant,"SHOCKING NBA Coach Luke Walton Sued for Sexual Assault by Sports Reporter Kelli Tennant The alleged incident occurred while Walton was an assistant with the Golden State Warriors, with Tennant claiming in a lawsuit that she ‘was afraid she was about to be raped.’ 04.23.19 1:29 AM ET Yong Teck Lim/Getty
Current Sacramento Kings and former Los Angeles Lakers Head Coach Luke Walton allegedly sexually assaulted a female reporter while he was an assistant with the Golden State Warriors, according to a lawsuit first reported by TMZ .
In the lawsuit, Kelli Tennant, who was working as a reporter with SportsNet LA, claims she met Walton at the Hotel Casa Del Mar in Santa Monica, California, per the Los Angeles Times . The purpose of the meeting was to present him with a copy of her 2014 book, The Transition: Every Athlete’s Guide to Life After Sports , for which Walton penned the foreword. (Tennant was a star volleyball player at the University of Southern California before starting a career in sports media.)
The two had maintained a working relationship and according to the lawsuit, Tennant viewed Walton as a “trusted mentor and colleague.” The lawsuit doesn’t specify a date when the incident allegedly took place, but Tennant does claim that after arriving at the hotel, Walton, who married his current wife in 2013 , suggested they return to his hotel room. There, he “pinned Ms. Tennant on the bed, placing his hips and legs over her body,” the lawsuit, which was filed on Monday, claims, and “began forcing kisses on her neck, face, and chest.”
Despite Tennant’s attempts to physically extricate herself, Walton allegedly restrained her and continued to molest her, touching her breasts and groin, despite her loud, vocal protests demanding he stop. According to the lawsuit: “[Tennant] was afraid she was about to be raped.” After Walton finally let her go and just as she reached the hotel door, Tennant recalled hearing him say: “Good to see you.”
In a statement, the Sacramento Kings said : “We are aware of the report and are gathering additional information. We have no further comment at this time.” Similarly, the Warriors said in a statement : “We became aware of the alleged incident and story this evening and are in the process of seeking more information. We’ll have no further comment at this time.” For their part, the Lakers denied having any knowledge of alleged assault:
Garo Mardirossian, the attorney representing Tennant, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Daily Beast. He told the Los Angeles Times that further information would be provided at an upcoming press conference, though he did not say whether Tennant had reported the incident to the police prior to filing suit. Luke Walton’s attorney, Mark Baute, released the following statement to ESPN regarding Tennant’s lawsuit: “Luke Walton retained me to defend him against these baseless allegations. The accuser is an opportunist, not a victim, and her claim is not credible. We intend to prove this in a courtroom.”
Tennant continued to encounter Walton professionally following the alleged assault. At a charity event in May 2017, Walton “uttered vulgar, guttural sounds at her in a lewd manner,” then said, “Mmmm… you’re killing me in that dress!” and embraced her in an aggressive and unwanted manner, the suit claims . (Tennant left SportsNet LA in 2017. She now is working on multiple ventures, including covering the Association of Volleyball Professionals tour for Amazon Prime.)
The son of NBA Hall of Famer Bill Walton, Walton graduated from the University of Arizona in 2003, where he won a national championship in 2001. He was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in the second round, and proved to be a journeyman if cerebral player and deft passer, neatly slotting into then-Head Coach Phil Jackson’s triangle offense and winning two titles over the course of his pro career.
After retiring in 2013, he was hired as an assistant coach by the Lakers D-League affiliate, the Los Angeles D-Fenders. He quickly moved up the ranks, joining the Golden State Warriors staff in 2014, and serving as the team’s head coach in 2015 while Steve Kerr was sidelined by a botched spinal surgery. Though none of the wins were officially credited to his record, he was named coach of the month when the Warriors zoomed out to a 19-0 start on the way to winning a league-record 73 games.
In April 2016, he left the Bay Area to take the reins of the Lakers. Initially, Walton was credited with helping to nurture the development of the Lakers’ young core, but the arrival of LeBron James in the summer of 2018 dramatically altered management’s expectations, and led to a tumultuous and ultimately dysfunctional season. Though newly hired team president Magic Johnson appeared to give Walton a long leash in September should the team struggle to integrate a band of mismatched veteran free-agent signings , his tolerance with losing didn’t last.
By November, ESPN had reported that Johnson had berated his young coach in an “aggressive tone” after they lost three of their first eight. Still, Walton was able to right the ship, sporting a record of 20-14, when LeBron went down with a groin injury at the end of December. The team struggled in his absence and Walton began airing his frustrations .
By the end of the month, whispers began to circulate that LeBron once again had soured on his head coach, per ESPN’s Jackie MacMullan . At the end of the regular season, with the Lakers mired in the lottery, it seemed likely that his three-year tenure in Los Angeles had come to an end. Walton might have been canned sooner, had Johnson not shockingly announced that he was quitting during an impromptu press conference on April 9.
Amidst Johnson’s at times jarringly cheery proclamations that the job wasn’t fun anymore, he added that he couldn’t bring himself to tell owner Jeanie Buss, whom Johnson called his “sister,” that Walton needed to go.
Three days later, Walton was relieved of his head coaching duties. The Lakers described it as a mutual decision, but he didn’t have to wait long to find work. The Sacramento Kings hired Walton as head coach on April 15 .
At the time, Warriors Head Coach Steve Kerr seemed dismayed by the Lakers’ decision to part ways with Walton. “They’re losing one of the best human beings in the NBA,” he said. READ THIS LIST"
ISIS Claims the Easter Sunday Bombings in Sri Lanka. Here’s Why We Should Have Seen Them Coming.,www.thedailybeast.com,Anne Speckhard Ardian Shajkovci,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/isis-claims-the-easter-sunday-bombings-in-sri-lanka-heres-why-we-should-have-seen-them-coming,"Travel MARTYR MADNESS ISIS Claims the Easter Sunday Bombings in Sri Lanka. Here’s Why We Should Have Seen Them Coming. Whatever the actual extent of ISIS involvement in the carnage, it knows the images of and ideology of martyrdom they demonstrate will serve its cause. 04.23.19 10:07 AM ET Dinuka Liyanawatte/Reuters
The so-called Islamic State has claimed involvement in the horrific Easter Sunday bombings that killed more than 320 people at Catholic church services and in luxury hotels in Sri Lanka. In a brief statement from its Amaq “news agency,” ISIS declared that the attackers “were ISIS” and targeted “citizens of states” in the anti-ISIS coalition.
Sri Lanka is not part of the coalition, and while some Europeans and Americans, including children, died in the attacks, most of the victims were Sri Lankan, and all those arrested in connection with the bombings so far reportedly have been from Sri Lanka.
The Amaq statement offered no further proof of ISIS involvement, and Sri Lankan officials have focused most of their attention on a little-known local group, after admitting that warnings from foreign intelligence sources that attacks on churches were imminent were largely ignored.
Sri Lanka’s state minister for defense said on Tuesday that the attacks were carried out as revenge for the slaughter at mosques by a white nationalist terrorist in Christchurch, New Zealand, last month.
ISIS has encouraged such acts of vengeance for Christchurch, as has al Qaeda, although the latter terror organization has told its followers specifically not to attack places of worship. The Amaq statement on Tuesday did not mention the New Zealand atrocity.
Whatever the ISIS role, direct or indirect, one thing is certain, ISIS will exploit the carnage in Sri Lanka to great effect, and the killers on Easter Sunday took advantage of a situation where too many people had grown too complacent about the threat posed in countries never before seen on jihadist hit lists, and far from the usual front lines in the fight against their specific brand of terrorism.
Successes in past fights against terror are no guarantee of safety now in a world where instant communications are universal. A huge part of the problem is incitement and recruitment over the internet, which the International Center for the Study of Violent Extremism (ICSVE) and other organizations work to address. But the terror challenge is constantly evolving. Law enforcement officials in the United States are concerned that ISIS no longer works to inspires so-called “lone wolves,” but whole packs of wolves. And cell phone communications, including encrypted messaging apps, have made it easier than ever for them to coordinate their suicidal attacks, as happened across Sri Lanka on Sunday.
Complacency should be considered a real and growing part of the threat. Counter-Terror Complacency?
In February we spent a week in Colombo at a regional United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime conference looking at ways to prevent violent extremism and reintegrate former and imprisoned terrorists into society.
We were aware that Indonesia and Bangladesh, both represented at the conference, recently experienced ISIS-inspired attacks. In Indonesia one such attack involved an entire family driving motorbikes to carry out suicide attacks at multiple churches.
But we also knew that Sri Lanka did not have such a history. There the history of terrorism has been tied to the history of the largely Hindu “Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,” defeated militarily in 2009 after years of separatist war waged against the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese majority.
It was the Tamil Tigers, after all, who first developed the suicide vest and sent women into crowds of people to blow themselves up long before the tactic spread like wildfire across the Middle East. They also developed techniques for attacking by sea with explosive-laden speedboats.
No one at the conference doubted that the Sri Lankans had developed a serious counterterrorism and intelligence capability in the face of the formidable foe they had faced over decades. Likewise, our hosts were very proud that they had defeated the Tamil Tigers and did not expect them to make a comeback given the huge deradicalization program that they had put so many of their former foes through. We even interviewed satisfied graduates of the program.
Thus, when a Sri Lankan female intelligence officer asked about one of the militant jihadi groups that were starting to form in Sri Lanka, which she was following, the general view was that that they were small and ineffective. We told her that such groups should be watched carefully because they could pick up so easily on the viral, virulent ideas of groups like al Qaeda and ISIS, and spring into action at any time. She told us there had been difficulties tracking the preachers who incited hate, then went underground before action could be taken against them.
Clearly the group alleged to have carried out the Easter bombings, coming from a tiny minority of the country’s Muslim minority, which is only about 9 percent of the population, figured out how to create a series of stunning and spectacular attacks—choosing a Christian holiday to attack Catholic churches and going after Western hotel targets, knowing both would garner huge press coverage. That’s the sort of media exposure that terrorist groups thrive on.
The name of the group reported out of Sri Lanka as the National Thowheeth Jama'ath, is a slightly misleading local transliteration. More conventionally, it should be called the Tawhid Jamaat. In Arabic, the language of the Quran, tawhid means the oneness of God and jamaat means brotherhood. Groups that adopt such labels often believe in suicide terrorism as a form of Islamic “martyrdom” in which the killer earns immediate entrance to Paradise and his family members also gain entrance upon their deaths.
Likewise such groups believe in the call to establish an Islamic state, to live under sharia law, to reject democratic leaders, and to fight jihad until the end times. They believe that even other Muslims who do not adhere to their violent extremist views can and should be killed in the quest to establish a “pure” Islamic state. Those are all dangerous ideas that can culminate in actions like the Easter Sunday massacre.
It’s unlikely, however that a local group would be sophisticated enough to plan a series of coordinated attacks and be savvy enough to go after targets that Western media would respond to in a feeding frenzy of reporting activity. That is right out of the ISIS and al Qaeda playbooks and signals that in today’s interconnected world there was likely not only inspiration, but some level of consultation. Remember that simultaneous coordinated attacks have been carried out many times before, starting with bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, then 9/11 in 2001, Casablanca back in 2004 and in Madrid the same year, in London on 7/7 in 2005, in Paris in 2015 and in Brussels in 2016.
In the past new groups were unlikely to mount such organized activity, but in today’s interconnected world new groups can easily be inspired by ideas and tactics that have been passed around by the big brothers of terrorism.
Such attacks as these are likely the wave of the future and as ISIS has lost its territory we must remember that this is a group that was able to establish a quasi-state of sorts which put the al Qaeda militant jihadi ideology on steroids as ISIS declared it’s Caliphate. This utopian dream then had the power to attract more than 40,000 foreign fighters to come and live under its authority and fight on its behalf. Calling for Counter-Narratives
While ISIS may currently be on its knees in the lands it once controlled, the power of the ISIS dream lives on, as do the grievances felt by many of its followers, which made leaving home for so very many not so difficult to do.
Only a small number left, or tried to leave, Sri Lanka for the Islamic State, yet even there, the call to the Caliphate found resonance. We need to be aware that while many ISIS leaders have been killed, ideas are much harder, if not impossible, to kill. These ideas keep spreading around the world infecting even small Muslim communities where, as we now see, they may be least expected to take root.
Over social media ISIS makes promises of a future, dignity, purpose and significance while living under and serving the Caliphate, even if the territory it now relies on is bandwidth rather than acreage. The power of social media enables such groups to blanket the internet with their propaganda claims, then sit back and watch who shares and retweets, “likes” or otherwise endorses their materials, after which terrorist recruiters swarm in on those who showed interest to seduce them further down the terrorist trajectory.
We need to recognize that the world has changed and small start-up terrorist groups loosely affiliated with the big terror organizations of the past, and possibly with no connection at all, can make a name for themselves on the global stage. All they really need is belief in the martyrdom ideology, a few members actually willing to blow themselves up, and, perhaps, direction from an outside patron in order to turn a seemingly safe Easter Sunday into a bloodbath reported around the world.
Sri Lanka was an unlikely target and reminds us that groups like ISIS and al Qaeda have not been defeated, because their ideology lives on and their ability to use emotionally evocative messaging allows them to resonate with individuals alienated from society. Until we get as good at counter-messaging as they are at messaging—using emotionally evocative narratives and images to delegitimize them and their ideology, they will continue to spread their poison and violent hatred among us.
At ICSVE with our Breaking the ISIS Brand Counter Narrative Project, we used formr insiders to speak out against such group, with some success. But the fight is going to be a long one, and it is very far from over.

Why would he schedule the mammoth trip against the family’s biggest news event of the year: his brother’s first baby? 04.23.19 11:06 AM ET WPA Pool
If you love The Daily Beast’s royal coverage, then we hope you’ll enjoy The Royalist, an all-new members-only series for Beast Inside. Become a member to get it in your inbox on Sunday.
If you were due to have a baby in a foreign country, and wanted your mother to be there, how long before the due date would you ask your mum to fly in?
Five days?
A week?
Ten days?
Well, Meghan Markle’s mother arrived in the U.K. on Monday evening, it is being reported.
Some saw this as evidence that Meghan’s baby could be here really, really soon, while others concluded that Doria Ragland’s arrival indicated only the beginning of the birth window, and that we may, therefore, still have a considerable number of days of waiting to go. (Still others don’t believe she is pregnant at all , of course.)
One consolation for the British press corps of Harry and Meghan’s decision to keep the details of the birth private—with no details of where the baby is to be born being released to the media—is that there is no incentive for the media to gather, exposed to the elements, outside the Lindo Wing (or any other hospital) for weeks on end before the birth.
Instead, the only thing to do is to huddle hopefully around the SussexRoyal Instagram feed for updates.
As the favored dates for the birth (April 21, the Queen’s birthday, was the previous pick) come and go, it is becoming increasingly likely that William could miss the birth as he is due to travel to New Zealand to pay his respects to the victims of the mosque shooting on Wednesday and Thursday, returning between Friday and Saturday.
Of course, no one can predict when a baby born without intervention will arrive, but it would be odd to have organized this trip to coincide with Meghan’s due date.
It may seem to some a bizarre bit of planning for William to be undertaking such a somber piece of official business in Australasia if there is a real chance that, on the other side of the world, his brother and his wife could be celebrating the arrival of their first child.
Not only would the arrival of a royal baby obliterate all other royal news, meaning William’s trip to New Zealand would not get the coverage it deserves, but such a scheduling conflict between the brothers would fuel the feud narrative, which burst back into life this weekend with reports that Harry and Meghan could be exiled to Africa to avoid overshadowing William and Kate, if it appeared William was snubbing the baby’s birth.
If one assumes that both William and Doria want to be in the country when the baby is born, then it could well be that the baby isn’t perhaps due until the very last days of April or even early May.
The latest betting from gambling website Paddy Power supports this thesis: If you bet the baby will be born this week, you’ll get four times your stake back. But if you opt for next week (April 29-May 6), it’s just three times, making that week of late April /early May the hot favorite. READ THIS LIST"

Jared Kushner, son-in-law and senior adviser to President Trump, on Tuesday claimed that the Russia investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been “way more harmful to our country” than any Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
“I thought the whole thing was nonsense to be honest,” Kushner said of the two-year investigation, which concluded with the release of a 448-page report released last week. “It’s been very, very thoroughly investigated.”
The findings, submitted to Congress by Attorney General William Barr, detailed Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election in support of Trump, in addition to at least ten potential instances of obstruction of justice by the president.
Despite the embarrassing—and potentially criminal— details plainly described in the report , Kushner said at the TIME 100 Summit in New York that he believes the investigation has “been just a big distraction for the country.”
“You look at Russia did: buying some Facebook ads to try to sow dissent. It’s a terrible thing, but I think the investigations and all of the speculation that’s happened for the last two years has had a much harsher impact on our democracy than a couple Facebook ads,” Kushner continued. “If you look at the magnitude of what they did and what they accomplished, the ensuing investigations have been way more harmful to our country.”
Of course, Russia’s interference in the U.S. election wasn’t just “a couple Facebook ads,” as Kushner dismissively characterized it. The Mueller report described how Russia’s efforts to undermine the election “demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.” And beyond using social-media platforms to sow discord, Russian operatives engaged in cyber-espionage.
TIME senior White House correspondent Brian Bennett, who interviewed Kushner at the Tuesday event, said as much: “Well, it was a lot more than Facebook ads. There were Russian operatives organizing real events during the campaign, so it had a real-world impact on their social-media campaign.”
“Not only that,” Bennett added, “but Russia was actively hacking and stealing documents that they then systematically released at certain key points during the campaign. One of the biggest things I think that doesn’t sit well with the public is: Why didn’t the trump campaign openly say ‘Russia, we don’t need your help. We don’t want your help. Please stop.’”
Kushner replied: “The one thing the Mueller report was conclusive on is that there was no coordination or collusion with the Trump campaign [and Russia]. Everything the president’s been saying and I’ve been saying for two years has been fully authenticated.”
The TIME 100 Summit, which showcases several of the magazine’s picks for its 2019 list of the most influential people in the world, will also feature an interview with Trump’s nemesis, Hillary Clinton, whose campaign emails were among those stolen by Russian operatives."
Nevada National Guard Joins California and New Mexico To Defy Trump's Trans Troops Ban,www.thedailybeast.com,samantha.allen@thedailybeast.com (Samantha Allen),04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/nevada-national-guard-joins-california-and-new-mexico-to-defy-trumps-trans-troops-ban,"PROGRESS National Guard in California, Nevada, Washington State, Oregon, and New Mexico Defy Trump’s Trans Troops Ban Nevada, Washington State, and Oregon have joined California and New Mexico in allowing trans people to continue to serve in the National Guard, defying Trump’s ban. exclusive Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty
The Nevada, Washington State, and Oregon National Guards will continue to allow transgender people to serve.
As the Trump administration’s transgender troop ban enters its second full week of being in effect, these three states have told The Daily Beast that they will join two others— California and New Mexico —who have said that transgender people will continue to be able to serve in their National Guard organizations.
“The State of Nevada does not discriminate against anyone, including and especially servicemembers, based on gender identity or expression,” Helen Kalla, communications director for Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, told The Daily Beast. “Governor Sisolak believes the only criteria to serve in the Nevada National Guard is one’s readiness to serve.”
Oregon Gov. Kate Brown told The Daily Beast that she is “appalled that the Supreme Court is delivering an intentional blow to civil rights by supporting a push from the Trump Administration to bar transgender people from serving in the military.”
“I will use every option available to ensure that every eligible Oregonian, regardless of gender identity, can serve their state and country,” Gov. Brown added.
A spokesperson for Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee told The Daily Beast that his office “stands in solidarity with transgender Americans across the country in opposing this policy and won’t stop fighting until it is defeated.”
“Until then, we will continue to welcome transgender service members to the greatest extent possible under the rules,” the spokesperson added. “It’s our understanding that is what New Mexico is doing as well.”
All 50 states—and four U.S. territories—have their own National Guard units that are primarily under gubernatorial control. That chain of command could allow individual governors to challenge—or at least test the limits of— the Trump administration’s newly-implemented policy , which disqualifies recruits with gender dysphoria while threatening most currently-serving transgender people with the risk of discharge .
As The Hill reported shortly after the transgender troop ban ban went into effect on April 12, Maj. Gen. Matthew Beavers of the California National Guard said that gender identity “is the least of our concerns.”
He added that California will not only work to “bring transgender individuals in under the current policy” but also that “every transgendered soldier or airmen currently serving in the California National Guard will remain in our ranks.”
“Further,” Maj. Gen. Beevers noted , “we will not treat any soldier or airman any differently today than we did yesterday.”
Then, on April 20, a spokesperson for New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham confirmed to local TV station KOB4 that transgender service will still be permitted within the state’s National Guard, making it the second state to buck against the intention of the Trump administration’s ban in this fashion.
Reached for comment, Gov. Lujan Grisham’s communications director Tripp Stelnicki told The Daily Beast, “We’re not interested in auditing any individual’s fitness to serve on the basis of gender identity.”
Now, the addition of Nevada, Washington and Oregon makes five. All five of these states have Democratic governors. All five also number among the minority of states that have non-discrimination protections for transgender people in the areas of employment, housing, and public accommodations. Combined, the five states boast a total of over 40,000 people serving in their National Guard organizations.
(The Daily Beast has reached out to several other governor’s offices for comment on their handling of transgender service within their respective National Guard organizations and will update this story as they respond.) “These states and the nation will benefit from retaining, and hopefully accessing, all who are qualified, regardless of gender identity.” — B Fram, SPART*A communications director
SPART*A, an organization that supports transgender service members , told The Daily Beast that they are pleased by the growing number of states who are pressing opposition to the transgender troop ban in this manner.
“SPART*A supports any and all organizations, including military organizations, that stand against discrimination and encourage the best and the brightest to serve our nation,” SPART*A communications director B Fram told The Daily Beast. “[These states] and the nation will benefit from retaining, and hopefully accessing, all who are qualified, regardless of gender identity.”
It is currently unclear how—or if—the Department of Defense will respond to individual states announcing that transgender service can continue within their respective National Guard organizations. Reached for comment, a DoD spokesperson referred The Daily Beast to spokespeople for the United States Army who, in turn, did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Also unclear is how these states—California, New Mexico, and Nevada—will skirt the Trump administration’s policy. Maj. Gen. Beevers, for example, told The Hill —a bit cryptically—that the California National Guard will “exercise every available avenue inside the policy and out, to ensure transgendered people who want to serve the California National Guard are afforded the opportunity to serve.”
(The California National Guard did not immediately provide further clarification to The Daily Beast after being reached for comment.)
Gov. Jay Inslee’s spokesperson did seem to acknowledge that the Trump administration’s policy could pose certain limitations: “As a branch of the U.S. military, the National Guard is subject to the same federal eligibility rules everywhere.""
Elsewhere, however, the impact of the transgender troop ban is continuing to make itself known: the Naval Academy will ban transgender students in 2020 , as will the Air Force Academy . The Coast Guard Academy, as the Associated Press reported , will also turn away transgender applicants.
This on top of signs that the Trump administration’s policy is already taking a human toll: Map Pesqueira , a University of Texas at Austin freshman and a transgender man, revealed last week that he had lost his military scholarship because he had undergone transition-related medical care. Pesqueira has since been able to raise over $25,000 through a GoFundMe to help cover school expenses.
As military academies fall in line with the policy, five states have now reiterated that they will continue to find ways to welcome transgender people into their National Guard organizations. Time will tell if that number grows further.

Brothers Accused of Attacking Jussie Smollett Sue for Defamation,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/jussie-smollett-attack-osundario-brothers-sue-empire-actors-attorneys-for-defamation,"AFTERSHOCKS Brothers Accused of Attacking Jussie Smollett Sue for Defamation In their defamation lawsuit, the Osundairo brothers insist ‘the attack was a hoax entirely conceived and directed by Mr. Smollett.’ 04.23.19 12:13 PM ET REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski
The Chicago brothers who were questioned by police in the alleged attack on Jussie Smollett have sued two of his attorneys for defamation, insisting the assault was “a hoax entirely conceived and directed by” the Empire actor.
Abel and Ola Osundairo filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Chicago on Tuesday morning, alleging Smollett’s attorneys, Mark Geragos and Tina Glandian, knowingly made false statements about their role in the hoax “to distract from Mr. Smollett’s farce and to promote themselves” and their law firm.
The suit alleges that Geragos and his firm continued to publicly peddle the narrative that the brothers “led a criminally homophobic, racist and violent attack against Mr. Smollett” even after the investigation had ended.
“Mr. Geragos’ statements were made after the close of Mr. Smollett’s criminal case, did not serve any legal function, and were not a requirement of his job as a defense attorney,” the complaint states, adding that the comments have caused “considerable damage to [brother’s] careers, as they have lost talent agent contracts and career opportunities.”
Smollett alleged that on Jan. 29, two men beat him up and put a rope around his neck before pouring an unknown chemical on him as he was walking home from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago around 2 a.m. The actor also alleged the two men shouted homophobic and racist slurs during the incident.
The new lawsuit alleges that four days prior to filing a police report, Smollett told the brothers he “needed a favor from them.” “They were to help him stage a social media hoax and pretend to attack him” because he “wanted his employer and the public to notice and appreciate him as a successful Black, openly gay actor,” the lawsuit states.
Chicago police immediately launched an investigation into the “possible hate crime,” but could not find video evidence of the described incident. A day after the attack, investigators released surveillance camera photos of the Osundario brothers, describing them as “potential persons of interests.” They were eventually taken into custody by police and questioned on February 15.
While being questioned, the brothers told police the actor paid them $3,500 to help stage the attack—and even reimbursed them for the rope. In a surveillance video , the brothers and Smollett appear to be seen buying a red hat and ski masks at a convenience store the day before the alleged assault.
“Mr. Smollett used his clout as a wealthy actor to influence [the brothers], who were in a subordinate relationship to him and were aspiring to ‘make it’ in Hollywood,” the lawsuit claims.
Police released the Osundairo brothers without charges “as there was verification and in-depth corroboration that the ‘attack’ was a hoax entirely conceived and directed by Mr. Smollett,” the lawsuit states.
Chicago police charged Smollett in February with one felony count of disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a fake police report. Less than a month later, a Cook County grand jury increased the charges to over a dozen felony counts after police alleged Smollett staged the hate crime.
But in a shocking move, Cook County prosecutors dropped all charges against Smollett on March 26.
Amid outrage over the charges being dropped, Glandian suggested in a March 28 Today show interview that the brothers “may have been wearing ‘whiteface’ while attacking Mr. Smollett–again stating Plaintiffs battered Mr. Smollett and adding the implication that this battery was a hate crime,” the lawsuit states.
The documents also claim that Glandian alleged in an April 6 Reasonable Doubt podcast episode that Abimbola Osundairo and Smollett “engaged, at least briefly, in homosexual acts together”—a claim both brothers vehemently deny.
“We have sat back and watched lie after lie being fabricated about us in the media only so one big lie can continue to have life,” the brothers said in a Tuesday statement obtained by The Daily Beast.“We will no longer sit back and allow these lies to continue.”
The brothers, who are both trainers, “have suffered significant emotional distress and feel unsafe and alienated in their local Chicago community,” according to the lawsuit, which adds that these two “very famous attorneys” have “falsely and publicly stated [the brothers] have committed a gruesome hate crime, lied under oath, and intentionally misled CPD.”
“We want to end these malicious attacks and ensure that those responsible for continuing to destroy the reputation of the Chicago Police Department and Abel and Ola Osundairo are held accountable,” Osundairos’ attorney, Gloria Schmidt, said in a Tuesday press conference announcing the lawsuit.
“My city, my police department and my clients deserve to have their reputations restored,” she added. “The Chicagoan brothers told the truth. They could have remained silent, but they told the truth to the police, and with their right hands in the air, they told the truth to the grand jury.”
The Geragos & Geragos Law Firm called the lawsuit a “comical legal document” in a statement to The Daily Beast Tuesday.
“At first we thought this comical legal document was a parody. Instead this so-called lawsuit by the brothers is more of their lawyer driven nonsense, and a desperate attempt for them to stay relevant and further profit from an attack they admit they perpetrated,” the statement said. “While we know this ridiculous lawsuit will soon be dismissed because it lacks any legal footing, we look forward to exposing the fraud the Osundairo brothers and their attorneys have committed on the public.”"
"‘The View’ Flies Off the Rails, Meghan McCain Accuses Whoopi of Finding Terrorism ‘Funny’",www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-view-flies-off-the-rails-over-bernie-sanders-saying-boston-bomber-should-be-allowed-to-vote,"IT NEVER ENDS ‘The View’ Flies Off the Rails, Meghan McCain Accuses Whoopi of Finding Terrorism ‘Funny’ Meghan McCain repeatedly shouted down her colleagues, invoked her family, and accused Whoopi Goldberg of laughing about terrorism. 04.23.19 1:07 PM ET The View/ABC
Reacting to Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ stance that even the convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should have the right to vote, the hosts of The View on Tuesday got into a heated and tense shouting match, with Meghan McCain invoking her siblings’ military service at one point.
During a CNN town hall event on Monday night, Sanders was pressed on his position that felons should be allowed to vote even while still incarcerated, prompting moderator Chris Cuomo to ask whether the Boston bomber or sex offenders should also be given that right.
“Yes, even for terrible people,” the Vermont senator responded. “Because once you start chipping away and you say, ‘Well, that guy committed a terrible crime, not going to let him vote. Well, that person did that. Not going to let that person vote,’ you’re running down a slippery slope.”
During The View ’s discussion on Sanders’ remarks, which the senator acknowledged would face widespread criticism, co-host Sunny Hostin said she wasn’t sure Sanders’ position is “appropriate” but that U.S. laws “are disproportionately applied to people of color and so there's real disenfranchisement of the African American vote of the Latino vote.”
“That's a different conversation, though, and I think that's a valid one,” McCain interjected before turning back to Sanders, calling his remarks “disgraceful” and suggesting Republicans “turn that into an ad.”
“I was upset about it because… if Democrats want to drag everybody this far left, this is why people like me are so upset and so disenfranchised with how extreme this is,” McCain exclaimed. “It's not hard to say the Boston terrorist was a psycho lunatic who is a threat not only to national security but shouldn't be allowed the right to vote in any election.”
As the rest of the panel weighed in on Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) saying “we should have a conversation” about the issue, McCain blew up the debate by shouting: “Does anyone think a terrorist should have a right to vote?!”
Co-host Whoopi Goldberg offered up her take that an American terrorist that serves his time in prison should have his voting rights restored, prompting McCain to grow further apoplectic at the idea of a terrorist ever being allowed to vote.
As Goldberg, co-host Joy Behar, and McCain continued to go back and forth for what felt like an eternity, McCain inevitably and eventually brought up her family.
“I'm trying to tell you, what Bernie Sanders said is going to be turned into a clip that will be—it upset me this morning,” McCain huffed. “Abby [Huntsman] and I—Abby and I didn’t have brothers that served multiple times, and I didn’t watch my brother deployed when he was 19 to fight this crap to have them come here and have the right to vote!”
“Now, wait, hold on. Let’s be realistic here,” Goldberg shot back. “The discussion here was if he got out. That was the discussion.”
“Then I’m against it,” McCain proclaimed.
McCain also declared that she “would appreciate it if Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris said there are true monsters in this world” and accused Goldberg of laughing about terrorism, scolding her: “Maybe you think terrorism is funny, I do not.”
Of course, Goldberg was laughing because she was unable to interrupt to toss the segment to a commercial break. Accordingly, she scolded her co-host for being so overwrought.
“Don’t do that, Meghan,” Goldberg snapped. “Don’t do that because what—what we are chuckling at, they see me trying to say it, and then Sunny started up again and realized I wasn’t going to get to say ‘We’ll be right back with more hot topics.’”"
U.N. Caves to Trump Administration Threat and Cuts ‘Reproductive Health’ From Anti-Rape Resolution,www.thedailybeast.com,Emily.Shugerman@thedailybeast.com (Emily Shugerman),04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/united-nations-security-council-caves-to-trump-administration-threat-and-cuts-reproductive-health-from-anti-rape-resolution,"U.N. Caves to Trump Administration Threat and Cuts ‘Reproductive Health’ From Anti-Rape Resolution The Trump administration was reportedly concerned the language implies support for abortion rights 04.23.19 1:52 PM ET Drew Angerer/Getty
The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday removed references to sexual and reproductive health from a resolution on rape as a weapon of war after the U.S. threatened to veto it—a move that one human rights advocate called a “step backwards.”
The resolution—which was an update to a 2013 document—had the support of the U.N.’s special representative on sexual violence in conflict, two Nobel Prize winners, and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney.
But the U.S. reportedly objected to a passage urging partners to provide survivors with “non-discriminatory and comprehensive health services, including sexual and reproductive health.” According to The Guardian , the administration viewed the language as code for abortion.
To save the overall measure, Germany removed the mention, to the dismay of activists.
“It’s disappointing that Germany gave into the veto threats,” said Stephanie Johanssen of the Women’s Refugee Commission, who called the resolution a “step backwards.”
She added, “Forcing women and girls who become pregnant as a result of rape [to carry the pregnancy] is despicable.”
Diplomats from the U.K., Belgium and South Africa all spoke out against removing the reference during the Security Council debate. Afterwards, both Nobel Peace Prize laureates who spoke at the meeting also condemned the decision to water down the resolution.
“There is simply no excuse for continuing to fail those who have already been victimized—as well as those who continue to be at risk of—devastating levels of sexual violence in conflict,” Dr. Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad said in a joint statement.
The resolution was originally proposed by Germany in order to address gaps in the 2013 document. Earlier in the negotiations, Russia and China successfully pushed for the removal of language establishing a U.N. monitoring body on sexual violence in conflict zones.
On Tuesday, the State Department sent a cable to U.S. diplomats saying it would continue to oppose the document until references to sexual and reproductive health were removed. The cable said that the U.S. “cannot accept unamended explicit, or implicit, references to ‘sexual and reproductive health’” because “we do not support or promote abortion” in global women’s health, according to Foreign Policy .
But Amanda Klasing, the co-director of the women's rights division at Human Rights Watch, said sexual and reproductive health isn’t limited to abortion. Life-saving services for survivors can include emergency contraception, STD prevention, and safe maternity care.
“By distancing itself from that aspect of what survivors need, [the U.S.] is really distancing itself from standing with survivors,” Klasing said.
The U.S. and 12 other countries voted in favor of the pared-back resolution on Tuesday. Russia and China abstained.
The dispute was not the first time the U.S. wanted to remove references to reproductive health from U.N. documents. At this year’s commission on the status of women, the American delegation—led by abstinence-only education advocate Valerie Huber— reportedly tried and failed to get references to reproductive rights cut from from the landmark Beijing platform on gender equality.
The administration has been more successful in reducing access to reproductive health care through domestic means—such as expanding the so-called Mexico City rule, which prohibits U.S. funding from going to international organizations that discuss abortion. The State Department has also eliminated analysis of women’s reproductive health and rights from its annual reports on human rights practices two years in a row.
Taken together, Klasing said, these actions have “a chilling effect on women’s human rights defenders around the world.”
“Women’s human rights defenders are facing threats, facing repression, even facing violence, [and] we are leaving these women alone and undefended,” she said. “It’s really giving their governments additional fodder to say that what they’re doing isn’t human rights work.” READ THIS LIST"
Ex-Lawyer Michael Cohen Headed to ‘Castle Behind Bars’,www.thedailybeast.com,Tracy.Connor@thedailybeast.com (Tracy Connor),04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/ex-lawyer-michael-cohen-headed-to-castle-behind-bars,"Ex-Lawyer Michael Cohen Headed to ‘Castle Behind Bars’ Fellow inmates will include Mike ‘The Situation’ Sorrentino and Fyre Festival fraudster Billy McFarland. 04.23.19 2:02 PM ET Win McNamee/Getty
President Trump’s disgraced former lawyer Michael Cohen will report May 6 to a federal prison that’s been called one of the “cushiest” lockups in the country, where his fellow inmates will include celebrity felons.
Jersey Shore tax evader Michael “The Situation” Sorrentino and Fyre Festival flim-flammer Billy McFarland are already doing their time at Federal Correctional Institution Otisville.
For prisoners, Otisville—just an hour outside New York City—is a coveted assignment. Forbes magazine deemed it one of America’s 10 “cushiest” prisons and the New York Post called it a “castle behind bars.” U.S. District Judge Stefan Underhill has described it as “a jewel” of the federal prison system.
Cohen, who pleaded pleaded guilty to lying to Congress , violating campaign finance law, tax fraud and lying on a bank loan application, asked to be sent to Otisville to serve his three-year sentence. CNN was the first to report that the Bureau of Prisons had approved it.
It’s not the Loews Regency Hotel, where Cohen’s room was raided a year ago, but as prisons go, Otisville has a decent reputation.
“It’s not just good. It’s sweet,” ex-inmate John Altman told the Post in 2012. “The food is right. The commissary is right. The officers don’t bother you. There are a lot of courses you can take. You had weights inside and outside, free weights and machines.”
Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff wanted to do his time in Otisville but got shipped off to a lockup in Butner, North Carolina, instead. But the facility has had its share of high-profile residents, including Crazy Eddie founder Eddie Antar and disgraced New York legislator Dean Skelos.
Three months into his eight-month stint at Otisville, reality TV star Sorrentino is “having the time of his life,” co-star Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi told E! News recently.
“It’s like he’s in a senior home. He’s playing Bingo. He’s helping people recover in jail,"" she said.
“He’s in the gym a lot, so he’s probably gonna come out ripped.”
The campus houses 800-plus male inmates in medium- and minimum-security settings.
Some convicts request to be sent to Otisville on religious grounds. It has a full-time Jewish chaplain and a kosher kitchen.
“The Bureau of Prisons kind of unofficially designated it to meet the needs of Orthodox Jews,” Rabbi Menachem Katz, director of prison programs for the Jewish-outreach Aleph Institute, once told New York magazine.
Otisville was recently in the news when the Bureau of Prisons temporarily halted visits after a child with measles visited their father there.

Flowers are blooming, the sun is shining, and noses are running. It’s officially allergy season and besides taking OTC allergy medication or nasal sprays, there’s only so much you can do to survive. But we’ve rounded up a list of a few things that you can outfit yourself with so that you can kiss those days of itchy eyes and sneezing goodbye. NEWSLETTERS Product recommendations that'll make your life better and tips to help you shop smarter. Subscribe By Clicking ""Subscribe"" you agree to have read the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy
Large Room Air Purifier , $399 from Pure Company: A great way to keep allergies at bay while you’re inside is to invest in an air purifier. When you’re outside, you’re collecting pollen, dust, and debris that you then bring inside. An air purifier can help keep the air inside your home allergen-free. This one has “a True HEPA Filter [that] removes invisible pollutants and bacteria as small as 0.3 microns,” according to the brand’s site.
EO Hand Sanitizer Spray in Organic French Lavender , $20 for a 6-pack on Amazon : If you can’t readily wash your hands, like getting off the subway or before eating lunch, having a good hand sanitizer with you can help get rid of all the lingering germs. A sanitizing spray is a travel-friendly alternative to the liquidy gels that tend to get everywhere and dry your hands.
Cariloha Ultra Plush Bamboo Bathrobe , $120 on Amazon: When allergy season is in full swing, sometimes you can’t avoid succumbing to the stuffiness. So instead of trying to compete with it, embrace it. Wrap yourself in a bathrobe that has odor- and allergy-resistant properties and will help you feel better, at least in spirit.
Sunny Health & Fitness Mini Stepper , $44 from Amazon: You won’t have to miss a day of exercise if you take a day off from working out outdoors when the pollen count is extremely high. Something like this compact mini stepper allows you to get the workout you’d normally get from running outdoors or heading to the gym but without the risk of exposing yourself to a swath of allergens in the air. Sponsored by DiscountFilters.com
The air quality in your home is one of its most important features, especially for anyone suffering from seasonal allergies. DiscountFilters is here to help: They’re offering exclusive deals for Daily Beast readers on these air purifier and filter products—just in time for allergy season.

Both discount offers expire on May 31, 2019.
Coop Home Goods Hypoallergenic Certipur Memory Foam Pillow , $60 on Amazon: Making sure your soft fabrics are allergen-free is a great start, but you should consider the surfaces you’re spending the most time on. Your pillow can be a harbinger of allergenic debris, so getting a hypoallergenic one can help cut down on waking up feeling congested.
The Breeze Comforter , $210 from Buffy: Speaking of spending time in bed, a hypoallergenic comforter is a good idea too. Fabric can soak up a ton of gunk from the air, but something that is hypoallergenic tends to be resistant to microbes and allergens. Plus, this one is made from eucalyptus so it’s breathable and will help keep you cool.
Mer-Sea & Co. Shower Bomb , $7 from Anthropologie: One of the best ways to get rid of the pollen you’re carrying around on you is to take a nice, hot shower. Go one step further and turn your shower into a congestion reliever with an effervescent shower fizz that will give you a burst of aromatherapy and help with that stuffy nose.

ISIS has claimed responsibility for the deadly attacks on churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday that killed more than 320 people. Meanwhile, a Sri Lanka government minister said they were in direct response to the mass shootings at two mosques in New Zealand last month. Sri Lankan Defense Minister Ruwan Wijewardene told the country’s parliament Tuesday that investigations had shown “this attack was carried out in retaliation for the attack against Muslims in Christchurch,” according to The Guardian . An intelligence memo handed to government officials weeks before the attack shows that one suspect in the bombings updated his social-media accounts “with extremist content” after a right-wing extremist killed 50 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch. Separately, ISIS claimed responsibility Tuesday for the attacks in Sri Lanka, saying via its own news agency that the “perpetrators of the attack... were Islamic State fighters.” The release also claimed the bombings targeted Christians as well as citizens of countries belonging to the coalition fighting ISIS.

A federal appeals court has rejected Chelsea Manning’s attempt to overturn her contempt of court order and has denied her request to be freed on bail. The brief, filed Monday morning in New York, means that Manning, who has been in jail since March for failing to testify in a WikiLeaks grand jury hearing in Virginia, will stay in custody. Manning had argued the court failed to properly address the issue of grand jury abuse and improperly sealed the courtroom during substantial parts of the hearing. The court disagreed. “Upon consideration of the memorandum briefs filed on appeal and the record of proceedings in the district court, the court finds no error in the district court’s rulings and affirms its finding of civil contempt,” the presiding judge wrote in the ruling. “The court also denies appellant’s motion for release on bail.” Prosecutors appear to want Manning to testify in order to help their case against Julian Assange, who was physically removed from London’s Ecuadorian embassy this month.

Prof. Menachem Ben-Ezra of Ariel University says it’s a form of exposure therapy—and the fact that it’s fun might explain its power to help arachnophobics and myrmecophobics overcome their fears. The movies served a positive stimulus, which means those with ophidiophobia should not seek to be cured by watching Snakes on a Plane . "

New Zealand has won plaudits from around the world for its response to the Christchurch mosque shootings that left 50 dead. Its care for the survivors went a step further Tuesday, when the country offered permanent residency to everyone who was at one of the mosques last month during the attacks, as well as the immediate relatives of people who were there. Many of them currently have temporary work or study visas and have urged the New Zealand immigration agency to give them certainty about their immigration status. The agency believes the move will cover about 190 people who will have their their applications for permanent residency rubber-stamped if they want to stay in the country. Immigration minister Iain Lees-Galloway said trauma suffered by the worshippers meant that government needed to give them a “significant” response. “These people were victims of a deliberate attack that was designed to inflict maximum level of physical harm, and maximum level of mental trauma as well,” he said.

In an Atlantic op-ed on Tuesday, a former Trump transition staffer called for Donald Trump’s impeachment, saying the Mueller report was his “tipping point.” J.W. Verret, a lifelong Republican and an associate professor of law at George Mason University’s Antonin Scalia Law School, said that after reading Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report twice, he “realized that enough was enough” from Trump. “If you think calling for the impeachment of a sitting Republican president would constitute career suicide for someone like me, you may end up being right,” he wrote. “But I did exactly that this weekend, tweeting that it’s time to begin impeachment proceedings.”
Verrett joined Trump’s pre-transition team in August 2016 as the deputy director of economic policy, one of the first 16 members to join the staff. Though he left amicably after three months, he said he never thought he would join the “Never Trump” efforts until reading the Mueller report. “I wanted to share my experience transitioning from Trump team member to pragmatist about Trump to advocate for his impeachment, because I think many other Republicans are starting a similar transition,” he wrote.

Reddit's BlackPeopleTwitter Forum Wants to Know if Its Users Are Actually White - The Daily Beast,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/reddits-blackpeopletwitter-forum-wants-to-know-if-its-users-are-actually-white,"VERIFIED RACE Reddit’s BlackPeopleTwitter Forum Wants to Know if Its Users Are Actually White Moderators for the popular subreddit had an idea to weed out the white users. But their experiment ended after just a few days—and inspired right-wing outrage. 04.24.19 5:11 AM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Photos Getty
Every day, the moderators of BlackPeopleTwitter —the Reddit forum devoted to screenshots of tweets from black people—sort through inboxes filled with jokes about cooking, dating, or watching Marvel movies. And according to moderator “DubTeeDub,” that also means dealing with a “never-ending stream of slurs.”
Being the most popular forum about black culture on an overwhelmingly white website that hosts a number of racist subreddits has brought other problems, too. There are the white people pretending to be black, and the disgruntled commenters who accuse the moderating team of posing as black themselves.
The forum’s millions of subscribers have been able to stay friendly in the comments on a post about cooking or dating, but if someone mentions a political issue like racial profiling, white people have flooded the comments to say they didn’t see what the big deal was. The problem only got worse if one of BlackPeopleTwitter’s posts was popular enough to make Reddit’s general front page.
This year, the moderators had an idea. What if they figured out who was actually black and then got rid of all the white people?
Starting on April 1, BlackPeopleTwitter’s moderators announced that only Reddit users who had verified that they were black could continue to post comments or threads on the subreddit. Black commenters could send in a photo of their forearm next to a sign with their username written on it. In return, they’d get a checkmark next to their profile verifying that they were black.
Everyone else, meanwhile, could no longer post on the forum.
The April Fool’s Day experiment outraged the right-wing internet and has shaken up how one of Reddit’s biggest forums deals with race.
With more than 3 million subscribers, BlackPeopleTwitter has become Reddit’s 59th most popular subreddit, according to Redditlist . The subreddit relies on a simple idea: screenshotting tweets, usually jokes, from black Twitter users.
“Black Twitter” has been a concept online since at least 2008, according to Mia Moody-Ramirez, a professor at Baylor University who co-authored a book studying black humor and Black Twitter. Black Twitter, Moody-Ramirez told The Daily Beast, is where black Twitter users can use humor to deal with difficult issues.
Black people are more represented in Twitter’s user base than they are in the population at large, according to Moody-Ramirez, making Black Twitter more visible. In 2010, Slate columnist Farhad Manjoo wrote about how black Twitter users “do seem to use Twitter differently from everyone else.”
“I cannot keep quiet about my obsession with Late Night Black People Twitter, an obsession I know some of you other white people share, because it is awesome,” Choire Sicha wrote for The Awl a decade ago.
That same interest in Black Twitter had pushed the subreddit to the top of Reddit. The April Fool’s Day plan to deal with the influx of non-black posters that popularity brought in went well at first. Hundreds of black posters sent in pictures of their forearms, and the moderators initially faced an “overwhelmingly positive response,” according to moderator DubTeeDub.
“Pretty much all our regular users, white, black, or whatever thought it was a great way to bring to light how POC voices are getting lost in the shuffle on a subreddit that’s ostensibly about black people and black culture,” DubTeeDub, who declined to give The Daily Beast any information about themselves, wrote in a Twitter direct message.
Eventually, non-black allies were allowed to apply for verification. A white user posted a picture of himself apologizing for “institutional racism and bland chicken.” An Asian-American guy posted a picture of his arm next to a sign praising Killmonger, the villain from Black Panther.
BlackPeopleTwitter’s moderators had initially planned to keep the experiment going for a week. By April 2, though, Reddit’s racist white subreddits—many of which have been “quarantined” off from the rest of the site for their hateful content—had heard about the new policy and flooded the moderators with even more racial slurs than usual. They also set up a new racist subreddit, “SubForWhitePeopleOnly,” which was meant to be only for white Reddit users.
“Don’t get mad when we vote back in segregation,” wrote one Reddit user.
The backlash to the BlackPeopleTwitter policy even inspired an InfoWars article from right-wing internet personality Paul Joseph Watson . Citing the non-black Reddit users who had asked to be verified to use the subreddit, Watson wrote that they were “humiliating” themselves.
“Remember folks, your white privilege entitles you to be blocked from entire Internet forums because segregation is progressive now!” Watson wrote.
Under pressure, the BlackPeopleTwitter pulled the ban on non-black users after three days, rather than keeping it place for the entire week. Still, much of the racial verification system is still in place.
Reddit didn’t respond to a request for comment.
In the past, the moderators had to close comments on politically heated threads. Now they turn those threads into “Country Club Mode,” a restricted posting system in which only verified users of any race are allowed to comment. Unverified users are still allowed to post in other threads.
The backlash from other parts of Reddit hasn’t stopped BlackPeopleTwitter users from trying to get verified. Other, non-black posters can still be verified as allies, while black posters who have verified their race still get a checkmark next to their name to “combat perceptions of digital blackface.” Faced with thousands of verification applications and a limit imposed by the Reddit system on how many people they can approve each day, the moderation team has brought on new people to deal with the flood of requests.

One of them is believed to have been “well-educated” and studied in Britain and Australia before coming back to Sri Lanka to carry out the attacks. “We believe that one of the suicide bombers studied in the U.K. and later did his postgraduate in Australia before coming back and settling in Sri Lanka,” said Ruwan Wijewardene, the state minister for defence. Eighteen suspects were arrested overnight, bringing the total number behind bars to 58. However, prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe warned that several suspects—including nine directly linked to the attack—were still at-large. President Maithripala Sirisena has called for a massive security overhaul and ordered the resignations of top officials. "

But voting isn’t one of them. It’s really just a ploy to preserve white rural power. opinion Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty
In their CNN town halls Monday night, Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg disagreed on whether current prisoners should be able to vote . Sen. Kamala Harris refused to endorse a plan for expanding the franchise to incarcerated people, but supported voting rights for former prisoners.
Sanders was specifically asked about Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and “those convicted of sexual assault.” What sane person would want them to vote? Our political system is already run by crooks. Do we want to add murderers and rapists too?
In European history dating to Roman times , criminals could be stripped of their legal personality after committing a crime. They could not sign contracts or own property. They were outlaws, banished from the city walls. John Locke and other political theorists argued that criminals broke an implicit social contract: a rule-breaker should lose the right to make rules for others.
But Locke lived in a time when only white, male, wealthy landowners could vote. Today, the right to vote is enshrined in democratic constitutions and international treaties. In American history, many states’ exclusions of those with a criminal record from voting date to the post-Civil War period and were clearly aimed at denying the franchise to African Americans .
Criminal justice reform advocates argue that suffering a Medieval-style “civil death” dehumanizes prisoners, prevents their reintegration into society , and perpetuates inequalities in our political system. We should not assume that prisoners are less knowledgeable about politics than those outside of prison—that’s a pretty low bar, after all. Encouraging prisoners to feel involved in the political process can have real benefits too. Isolating prisoners from the political process during and after their incarceration further stigmatizes and isolates them , and that can encourage reoffending.
Prisoners lose many of their rights when they go to prison. They can’t serve on a jury from a prison cell, or own guns; both of those are probably reasonable proscriptions. They probably should not own guns. But prisoners do not lose all their rights in prison. They are entitled to practice their religion and can challenge the conditions of their confinement. Taking away prisoners’ liberty is already a heavy punishment. Allowing them to cast an absentee ballot is not an unreasonable privilege.
The most important consequence of allowing prisoners to vote is that it would remove the incentives for “prison gerrymandering.” In most U.S. states, prisoners are counted by the census based on where they are incarcerated , not where they are registered to vote. Because most large prisons are in sparsely populated rural areas, prison complexes have an important effect on gerrymandering.
Many prisoners are racial minorities or people who live in urban areas, which means these places lose voting population, while more conservative areas gain nonvoting population. This advantages Republican congressmen in places like upstate New York, who benefit from inflated populations for redistricting purposes, but have nothing to fear at election time. Prisoner disenfranchisement therefore contributes to a structural disparity that causes Congress and state legislatures to be more conservative than the public at large. “Prisoner voting is already underway in some states and developed countries, so it is hardly a revolutionary position.”
While many states are in the process of revising their laws to allow ex-prisoners to vote, voting by current prisoners only exists in Maine, Puerto Rico, and Vermont —the latter represented by Sanders in the U.S. Senate. In addition, the trend across the developed world is to allow at least some prisoners to vote. The supreme courts of South Africa, Canada, and Israel have legalized voting for at least some prisoners. The European Court of Human Rights has also rejected blanket prohibitions on prisoner voting , though it has allowed exceptions.
The policy options are far broader than a single audience question would suggest. In Germany, prisoners can vote unless they were convicted of terrorism or political violence, an exception that would encompass Tsarnaev’s marathon attack. Other European countries prevent violent criminals, those serving lengthy or life sentences, or war criminals from voting. Exceptions for crimes of dishonesty or fraud might be reasonable as well. In a few countries, only those convicted of misdemeanors can vote, rather than felonies.
These are policy debates we should be willing to have. Even if we allowed only persons serving misdemeanor sentences in local jails to vote, this alone might add nearly 300,000 voters to the rolls.
Prisoner voting is already underway in some states and developed countries, so it is hardly a revolutionary position. Overbroad restrictions on voting help ensure that politicians select their own voters, rather than voters electing their own politicians.

"It’s Early, but Kamala Harris Isn’t Betting on New Hampshire",www.thedailybeast.com,Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey),04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kamala-harris-isnt-betting-on-new-hampshire-in-the-2020-democratic-primary,"JUST PASSING THROUGH It’s Early, but Kamala Harris Isn’t Betting on New Hampshire The California Democrat may be in New Hampshire this week, but she seems to have her sights set beyond the first-in-the-nation primary state—and locals aren’t sold yet, either. 04.24.19 5:21 AM ET Getty
MANCHESTER, New Hampshire—Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and New Hampshire Democratic primary voters seem to be in the same boat with each other: They might not be each other’s first choice, but they’re at least checking the requisite boxes just in case.
Granite State voters—who relish their many opportunities to hear from presidential candidates directly— are being courted by almost two dozen of them , including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who won the New Hampshire primary in 2016 and owns a commanding share of support here, according to several recent polls.
Meanwhile, of the top-tier candidates , Harris so far seems to have her sights set furthest beyond the first-in-the-nation primary state. Of course, it’s still early into the Democratic presidential primary; one high-polling candidate, Joe Biden, is only just kicking off his campaign this week . But since kicking off her bid in February, Harris has been a far more frequent presence in other early primary states, notably South Carolina, which she has visited four times. She has also hit Iowa four times and launched a “camp” for organizers in the first caucus state, scheduled for this summer.
This week, Harris made her second swing through New Hampshire. Since her last visit, Harris raised some eyebrows for suggesting during an appearance on The Daily Show that New Hampshire insiders assumed she wouldn’t make the state a priority because it is overwhelmingly white.
“The first line of questioning I got was, ‘You’re in New Hampshire, and we heard you’re not going to come to New Hampshire. We thought you weren’t going to compete in New Hampshire,’” Harris told Trevor Noah. “And what no one said, but the inference was, well, the demographic of New Hampshire is not who you are in terms of your race and who you are.”
After a town hall event at Keene State College on Tuesday, a reporter raised again the question to Harris of how important New Hampshire would be to her campaign.
“It is very important for me to be here,” Harris responded. “I intend on coming back frequently and making it a significant time when I’m here.”
The first-term California senator did meet enthusiastic and good-size crowds during her quick trip through the state, where she appeared at town hall events at Keene and Dartmouth College, and spoke to Democratic activists in downtown Manchester.
But there were few committed supporters in the crowds—at least not from New Hampshire, anyway. Mary Lou Szulborski, an attorney who stood out for her black “Kamala Harris for the People” shirt, took off work to make the 40-mile drive to the Keene town hall from Massachusetts, where she lives. “The world’s changed. Thirty years ago, this used to be the place to go. You’ve gotta know where to cut your losses.” — Mary Lou Szulborski, attorney and Harris supporter
“I think anybody can win up here if they put the time in,” she said, but noted that the New Hampshire primary might not be as central as it once was. “The world’s changed,” she said. “Thirty years ago, this used to be the place to go. You’ve gotta know where to cut your losses.” Harris, she predicted, could do very well in Massachusetts.
New Hampshire natives, meanwhile, guard their first-in-the-nation privileges—and the attention that comes with them—as jealously as ever. Barely four months into the primary, local activists are already swapping tales of hour-long lunches with Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and personal calls from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).
Keeping with state tradition, many voters came to the town halls to hear Harris out with an open mind. Joanna Jasperson, a voter from the central New Hampshire town of Lyme, said after Harris’ event at Dartmouth that she wasn’t wowed by the candidate—she prefers Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana—but felt she should show up and listen.
“I’m giving people a chance,” she said.
Jaclyn Headings, a Democrat from Keene, was wearing a big Harris button on her lapel but said she wasn’t totally committed to the candidate yet. She was impressed, however, with Harris’ town hall performance, which ran nearly an hour and covered questions on topics from health care to what she most enjoys doing outside of work—it’s cooking—to America’s standing in the world.
“She was spot on, very articulate,” Headings said. “You have to spend a lot of time here in New Hampshire to be heard,” she added. “I think she’s putting in the work. I really do have the sense she has that vision.”
Other Democrats didn’t begrudge Harris for pointing out New Hampshire’s whiteness, either. “She’s right!” exclaimed Harold Judd, a consultant in Concord, after hearing her speak at a bar in Manchester on Monday night.
But Harris, who is of Indian and Jamaican descent, clearly sees a path to the Democratic nomination that depends on winning over voters of color in the party’s coalition. South Carolina is seen as a bellwether for black voters, and Harris has invested significant resources there and rolled out fresh rounds of endorsements from state activists and politicians on a regular basis.
According to Dante Scala, a professor of politics at the University of New Hampshire, Harris’ travel log is revealing of her strategy, which seems to invest in Iowa as the earliest state prize and banks on South Carolina and her home state of California, whose primary was moved up to March 3, to propel her to the nomination.
“It’s a long way still, and campaigns have lots of time to adjust how they are allocating their resources,” Scala told The Daily Beast. “So far, at least, it appears [Harris] and her campaign aren’t devoting a lot of time to New Hampshire—the sort of time that suggests they see New Hampshire as vital to the nomination.”"
Trump Justice Department Goes After Overdose Prevention Sites as ‘Crack Houses’,www.thedailybeast.com,Zachary Siegel,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-justice-department-goes-after-seattle-philadelphia-overdose-prevention-sites-as-crack-houses,"HARSH Trump Justice Department Goes After Overdose Prevention Sites as ‘Crack Houses’ Federal prosecutors dust off an ’80s war on drug law to go after Seattle and Philly for trying to save lives. 04.24.19 5:20 AM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Photos Getty
Two major U.S. cities are trying to open facilities to save drug users’ lives, but the Trump administration is trying to stop them, arguing the facilities are no different than crack houses.
Seattle and Philadelphia plan to curb overdose deaths by opening facilities where drug users can ingest illicit substances like heroin under medical supervision. So-called overdose prevention sites are part of a strategy that seeks to reduce harm from drug use. The facilities were first popularized in Western Europe and have made their way to Canada and now potentially the U.S. While controversial and seemingly counterintuitive, over 100 such facilities currently operate in several countries, and public health experts consider them a staple of a robust strategy to prevent overdoses. Even Vice President Mike Pence, when he was Indiana’s governor during an HIV outbreak, implemented a similar program to distribute fresh syringes to prevent new infections.
President Trump campaigned on ending the overdose crisis , but federal prosecutors appointed by his administration are thwarting cities from pursuing effective strategies. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein promises “ swift and aggressive action ” if any cities follow through on their plan to implement the sites in the face of a staggering overdose death toll that has led Denver, New York, Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia to consider implementing them. In 2017, more than 72,000 people died from drug overdoses in the U.S. Among overdose deaths involving opioids, more than 28,000 were due to illicit fentanyl, an uber-potent synthetic opioid manufactured in clandestine laboratories.
While overdose prevention sites are no panacea, decades of research from Canada, Australia, and Western Europe demonstrate their effectiveness , especially in times of crisis. A review of the scientific literature finds that these facilities reduce overdose deaths, public injection, neighborhood disorder, and the transmission of blood-borne diseases like Hepatitis C and HIV in the communities they operate. People who use overdose prevention sites also see improvements in their overall health, and overtime seek out treatment and find a path toward recovery. “The only thing these sites encourage is safer drug use for people who are already using drugs and unable to or do not wish to stop.” — social worker Brooke Feldman
Last February, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against Safehouse, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit that plans on operating the country’s first ever overdose prevention site. The civil suit, also a first of its kind, is a preemptive strike that aims for the facility to be deemed illegal by a judge before it ever opens.
“What’s driving the lawsuit is our responsibility to uphold and enforce the rule of law,” the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia, William McSwain, said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “Possessing, consuming or otherwise sanctioning the use of these dangerous narcotics is clearly against the law in the United States.”
McSwain is referring to what’s known as the “crack-house statute,” a provision that penalizes anyone who manages or owns a building where drugs are being used. Violating the statute can result in hefty fines or jail time. Public health and legal experts suggest the “crack-house statute” was never intended to apply to medical settings where people are receiving services that Safehouse would provide, such as wound care, new syringes, and treatment referrals.
Seattle may soon find itself in the same legal bind as Philadelphia. When asked about a site in Seattle, U.S. Attorney there Brian Moran told city officials: “ Don’t go there .”
“As the Deputy Attorney General has made clear, the U.S. Department of Justice will not stand idly by and allow consumption sites to open in cities across the U.S.,” Moran told The Daily Beast. Though Moran has not filed a lawsuit like his Pennsylvania counterpart, he calls the plan to do so a “ logical path ” were Seattle to move forward on the proposed facility to be called Community Health Engagement Locations (CHELs).
The threat of a lawsuit looms large in the minds of Seattle officials like Mayor Jenny Durkan, whose office said she “thinks it is unfortunate that the Department of Justice would move to block a harm-reduction strategy to the opioid epidemic. However, we are not surprised and take these threats seriously. We continue to monitor the Philadelphia lawsuit while evaluating our legal options.”
Ronda Goldfein, an attorney in Philadelphia who sits on Safehouse’s board, told The Daily Beast that a court date has not been set, but that they are prepared to argue their case. “We have consistently maintained that an overdose prevention site, which includes a supervised consumption room and is operated for the purpose of saving lives, does not violate federal law,” Goldfein says. “We’re looking forward to the opportunity to present our arguments.”
Goldfein, also the executive director of the AIDS Law Project in Pennsylvania, sees many parallels between the modern day overdose emergency and the AIDS epidemic. AIDS activists put relentless pressure on the federal and local governments to fund research for treatment and invest in services like syringe-exchange programs that distribute sterile injection equipment to prevent the transmission of blood-borne diseases. The same way activists distributed syringes before it was legal, there are currently underground overdose prevention sites operating in U.S. cities.
“Among our challenges will be to address the stigma of drug use,” Goldfein says. “In HIV work, it’s clear that stigma continues to fuel that epidemic, despite medical and scientific advances in treatment and prevention.” Despite awareness around drug use as a matter of public health, drug users continue to be arrested and criminalized, she says.
The Department of Justice frequently argues that overdose prevention sites condone and therefore “normalize” injection drug use.
“Not only does the existing research on overdose prevention sites suggest that they do not encourage or increase drug use, but that argument just simply doesn't make sense,” said Brooke Feldman, a social worker in Philadelphia who has found recovery from her own substance use disorder. “The only thing these sites encourage is safer drug use for people who are already using drugs and unable to or do not wish to stop.”
A two-and-a-half-hour drive up the coast from Seattle is an overdose prevention site in Vancouver called Insite, which has been operating since 2003 on the Downtown Eastside.
“We know definitively there is a reduction in things like discarded syringes and public injecting upon the opening of these sites,” Ryan McNeil , a research scientist at the University of British Columbia who has studied the effects of overdose prevention sites. “You would think law enforcement groups would get behind that?”
“All these sites do is ensure that people who are using don’t die,” he added. READ THIS LIST"
Jon Lovett Sounds Off on Trump’s White House Correspondents’ Dinner Outrage: ‘Give Me a F*cking Break’,www.thedailybeast.com,matt.wilstein@thedailybeast.com (Matt Wilstein),04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-last-laugh-podcast-jon-lovett-sounds-off-on-trumps-white-house-correspondents-dinner-outrage,"Subscribe to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts
“This is a zombie White House Correspondents’ Dinner for a zombie institution to protect zombie norms during a zombie presidency.”
That quote more or less sums up Jon Lovett’s take on what was once Washington D.C.’s biggest night and has now become a shadow of itself, first after President Donald Trump refused to attend and even more so now after the White House Correspondents’ Association declined to hire a comedian to perform.
Lovett, who hosts the weekly Lovett or Leave It podcast for his company Crooked Media , knows more about this annual event than just about anyone. During his four years in the White House, he spearheaded the team that wrote jokes for President Obama, who could deliver a punchline just as well or better than the professional comedians who were forced to follow him.
“I was proud to get to work on those speeches,” Lovett tells me on the latest episode of The Last Laugh podcast . “President Obama, who is too good-looking and charming to be as funny as he is—it’s very frustrating, he should be worse at it.” He thinks no one did a better job following Obama than Seth Meyers, who infamously roasted Trump to his face at the 2011 dinner so brutally that some believe it drove him to finally run for president for real in 2016.
Lovett and I talked about all this and a lot more during our hour-long sit-down at the same Crooked Media studio where he, Jon Favreau and Tommy Vietor record Pod Save America every Monday. The morning after we spoke, Trump confirmed that he would be skipping the Correspondents’ Dinner for the third consecutive year, telling reporters that it’s “too negative” and he likes “positive things.”
Highlights from our conversation are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts , the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts. Why it’s impossible to ‘laugh with’ Donald Trump
“I do think it becomes a vulgar and ugly display when you are looking past monumental and evil sins on the part of the president. I think that is true when George W. Bush is joking about weapons of mass destruction and the Iraq War, I think that is true when you have someone like Donald Trump who is making a mockery of the office, destroying institutions, pursuing racist, supremacist, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim policies, lying on a daily basis, attacking the press corps on a daily basis. So before Donald Trump said he wasn’t going to this thing anymore, I thought it was hard to imagine having the dinner like they always had it. Because, how can you sit there and laugh with these people?” On Trump’s decision to bail on the dinner
“I don’t think the comedian-not comedian distinction is very important to them. They like bashing the press, so he can say, ‘All these reporters are gathered but I’m here with you.’ It’s something that has been a fantasy option for Democratic and Republican presidents for a long time, this idea that you just say, ‘I’m not going to that dinner, I’m going to the people.’ Why not make a moment of it? Don’t go to that fancy dinner, go to a rally and say you’re not going. Make an anti-elite, anti-Washington moment of it. But they finally did it. And I think it’s partly because he wants to bash the press and partly because he has thin skin.” On Michelle Wolf’s controversial set from 2018
“I think she gave these people the hard-edged humor that doesn’t come close to the level of vitriol, misinformation and hatred that they have directed at—not just powerful opponents, but powerless people. I think what she did was probably close to the line, that’s where she was supposed to be. And by the way, when you’re a comedian and your job is to try to get close to the line and really push these people, there’s a chance you may step over it. Who gives a shit? So what? It’s a joke. They’re so hurt? Give me a fucking break. These are people who work for Donald Trump, who help Donald Trump every single day, who mocks people and is not joking, who is not trying to make people laugh, who is not doing it to make light, who isn’t doing it to hold people accountable. He’s doing it to hurt people’s feelings and make people feel small and turn his supporters against them and keep his supporters from feeling compassion for some of the least among us.” On the ‘heartbreaking’ resignation of Al Franken
“It was devastating to me when that was going on, because truly I looked up to Al Franken. I really admired the way he transitioned from comedy into politics. I believed he was one of the most valuable Democratic voices in the Senate. It was heartbreaking for me how that unfolded. Not because Al Franken was railroaded, but because Al Franken put himself in a situation where he decided he had to resign. I think there are a lot of people who have unfairly attacked Senator Gillibrand about this, saying, ‘How could you do that to Al Franken?’ What did she do? She looked at the facts as we knew them at the time and as we still know them and said I think this person should resign.” Is Jon Lovett a comedian?
“You know, it’s funny, when I was a speechwriter and then a screenwriter, I always had trouble saying, ‘I’m a writer.’ There’s something about ‘I’m a writer’ where if you weren’t sitting at a typewriter writing novels, I always felt like I was posing. And I aspired to be a comic at one point in my life and was doing open mics and was doing bringer shows in New York and getting friends to come to comedy clubs so that I could have a few minutes on stage because it was something that I aspired to. And even though a lot of what I get to do on Lovett or Leave It is comedic and I look like a comedian a lot of the time, there’s something about saying ‘I’m a comedian’ that, I just don’t feel like I get to say it. I don’t know why, that may speak to more of my own Jewish anxieties.”

Inside ‘Bonding’: Netflix’s Kinky New BDSM Show,www.thedailybeast.com,Joseph.Longo@thedailybeast.com (Joseph Longo),04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-bonding-netflixs-sexy-and-sweet-new-bdsm-show,"THE TIES THAT BIND Inside ‘Bonding’: Netflix’s Kinky New BDSM Show The sex comedy, starring Zoe Levin and Brendan Scannell, centers on a dominatrix freeing the world of shame. 04.24.19 5:12 AM ET Netflix
There’s a scene in the second episode of Bonding where dominatrix Tiff (Zoe Levin) shows her best friend Pete (Brendan Scannell) the ropes. “Everyone thinks dom work is just about sex work. It’s really just liberation from shame,” Tiff says, tying the nylon rope tightly around his wrists. She promptly exits the apartment for night school, leaving Pete to free himself physically—and for the rest of the season, sexually and professionally too.
Bonding , Netflix’s latest foray into short-form content (each episode runs under 20 minutes), is one of its most impressive shows in years. Initially, it doesn’t seem so radical. Orange is the New Black and even The Crown show more skin than this BDSM tale. It’s also not as raucously funny as Grace and Frankie or Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt .
But Bonding excels at doing something different. Once the modern-day arbiter of originality, Netflix largely lost its their groove in favor of revivals and superheroes. Fortunately, Bonding (alongside fellow new short-form comedy Special ) are a welcome return to form.
Rightor Doyle, best known for bit roles on Barry and You’re the Worst , is behind the dark comedy. He loosely based the series on his early days in New York working as a dom’s assistant. (Given his former fame as young Hollywood’s gay best friend, I’m wishing for a world in which pals Carey Mulligan and Zoe Kazan once moonlighted in BDSM.)
Doyle’s script is admirably tight, with quippy one-liners and a swiftly-moving plot. Sure, most of his characters are stereotypes. Aspiring stand-up comic Pete is newly out as gay but hasn’t shaken his internalized homophobia, even exploring a friendship of “butt stuff” with his flirtatious, hyper-masculine bro of a roommate. Likewise, Tiff, for all her sex positivity, struggles to be open and honest with her endearingly aloof grad school classmate and maybe boyfriend Doug.
The surface-level similarities to shows like Comedy Central’s The Other Two or HBO’s Girls (Doyle appeared on an episode of the latter) work to the show’s advantage. What people do in the bedroom—or in Tiff’s basement office of plush carpet, wall-mounted dildos, and red lighting—is different than who they are on the street. And Bonding , another comedy about millennial New Yorkers, also sometimes acts as a noir-thriller.
The series’ message—everyone has something to hide—isn’t subtle. Tiff’s clients, who’ve acted out their shame, are the freest. “Men come to me to escape this crippling societal prison. Once the sexual patriarchy dies, then all gender will be equal,” she explains. Fred, clad in a business suit, is proudly into pee play and gets off to The Flintstones , while Joe has Happy Feet when ordered around dressed up as a penguin.
It’s people like Pete, believing he’s living his best life now that he’s out, who are in fact the ones still harboring secrets. As he tells Tiff in a tender heart-to-heart about why he stayed in the closet for so long, “It’s the only version of myself I’d ever known. And if I told everyone, who would I be?” the self-reflecting question forces Tiff to acknowledge her own secret history of “bad things” and “bad men” in order to move forward as, of course, a psychiatry student.
Thankfully, Scannell’s Pete and Levin’s Tiff keep the show from becoming an afterschool special. By just shifting the tone of her voice from commanding to hesitant and back, Levin successfully balances the series’ light and dark tones.
Though Scannell is the true breakout star. It’s a welcome success story after the false start that was his role as the genderqueer Heather Duke on the fraught Heathers TV remake . While Pete isn’t quite as proudly queer as his Heather—Pete leaves a date at a gay bar threatened by a room full of go-go boys—Scannell is a breath of fresh air when it comes to what gay male identity looks like onscreen. Plus, he’s seriously funny. While trying his best to understand a client’s penguin fetish, he mistakes March of the Penguins as the film about “the one where they, like, urban dance.” That is, of course, Happy Feet , the animated 2006 film that’s really quite bonkers upon reflection.
By the final episode, Bonding ’s harnesses start to come undone. Storylines about Tiff’s relationship with her classmates and not-so-perfect professor aren’t fully fleshed out, while The Good Place ’s D’Arcy Carden, who delivers some of the best jokes as a housewife cautiously exploring the world of BDSM, is left on edge. All could be solved with a solid second season and full 30-minute episodes.
But the explosive final scene—a nod to American Psycho —cements Bonding as so much more than an edgy comedy. It doesn’t last long (you can binge all seven episodes in under two hours), but the series will leave you oh-so satisfied and wanting more. READ THIS LIST"

Now They Want to Throw the Book at Her. The Russian agent had been hoping for a speedy deportation. But prosecutors want her to stay behind bars for doing damage they say can aid the Kremlin for ‘years to come.’ Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Getty/AP
Maria Butina is fighting for the next year and a half of her life.
The Russian national has spent most of the last 12 months in jail in Alexandria, Virginia, after being arrested on July 16 and charged with acting as a covert agent of the Russian government. She drew media attention and law enforcement scrutiny by establishing herself as a minor star in the conservative firmament, bragging about her connections to Trumpworld and the Kremlin , and building close relationships with top NRA officials—even helping them travel to Moscow .
Is she a “genuine idealist,” just looking to loosen Russian gun laws and improve relations between Washington and Moscow, as her attorneys argue? Or is she a national security threat, a vector for Russian influence, and an archetype of the Kremlin’s skill at using America’s civil society to shape its politics, as the Justice Department’s chosen expert witness on the case says in testimony they want the judge to weigh?
That’s the question Judge Tanya S. Chutkan will face when deciding whether Butina should serve another 18 months in prison, as federal prosecutors have requested, or be sentenced to time-served and then shipped back to Russia, as she asks.
A spate of recent court filings has brought a final battle about Butina into the public view. The D.C. U.S. Attorney’s office, which is handling the case, set the stage on Friday with a memo asking Chutkan to sentence her to an additional 18 months in prison. Attached to its memo was a statement from Robert Anderson, the former assistant director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division. Anderson gave a stark view of Butina’s activity in the U.S., arguing that she worked to find Americans who could provide intelligence to the Russian government in the future. According to Anderson, Butina may have passed their details to the Kremlin’s spy services so an experienced agent could swoop in and pick up where she left off. The Kremlin, he argued, “will be able to use this information for years to come in their efforts to spot and assess Americans who may be susceptible to recruitment as foreign intelligence assets.”
Then he continued:
She focused specifically on Americans with political influence and Americans who had access, or were expected to acquire access, to the incoming presidential administration. Her ability to gain meaningful access to these powerful individuals would be incredibly valuable to the Russian government. Butina compiled information about these individuals in reports that were sent back to a high-ranking Russian government official. Consistent with a spot-and-assess operation, her reports did not focus on mere biographical details. Rather, she identified the political importance of those individuals upon whom she was reporting. Such information is the essence of a spot-and-assess report. — Robert Anderson
Butina’s lawyers do not want the judge to consider Anderson’s view when deciding her sentence. They argued, in a court filing, that the late notice of his view—“in the metaphorical bottom of the ninth inning”—violated her due process rights, and that it could take months and great expense to find another expert witness to rebut his arguments.
“This is, by definition, a sandbag tactic,” her lawyers wrote.
Butina’s case has presented problems for DOJ. The prosecutors working on the case claimed she offered to have sex with conservative movement leaders in exchange for their help finding her work. The allegation drew international headlines, unsurprisingly. But the prosecutors ultimately produced no evidence to substantiate it, and earned themselves a reprimand from the judge. Last December, they settled with Butina on a plea deal: She would cop to one count of conspiracy to violate a statute that prosecutors view as “espionage-lite.” In the months since then, she cooperated extensively with the department , per the court filings, sitting for numerous meetings to discuss matters that investigators were interested in. Despite that cooperation, she asked for a prompt deportation to Russia after finishing her sentence––telling the court she does not expect torture or persecution there.
Anderson’s testimony stands in sharp contrast to the host of character endorsements Butina’s lawyers entered. The filing lays out a bio of the 30-year-old, from her childhood in Siberia to her move to Moscow to her ascent in the gun rights space and arrival in America, amplified by letters from her parents, grandmother, and sister.
A college friend weighed in, as did George O’Neil, the Rockefeller heir who put on Russian-American friendship dinners with Butina and supported some of her pursuits in the U.S. O’Neil suggested she could still play a role in future relations between the two countries.
“After this difficult time ends, I expect with the spiritual strength gained from this painful and unhappy episode in her life, she can continue working to enable peaceful answers to some of our vexing international problems,” he wrote.
The contrast with the government couldn’t be sharper—and, in fact, the DOJ attorneys said Butina claimed to have had a say in the Trump administration’s decision about Secretary of State. According to the filing, Butina sent the name of an American to Alexander Torshin (then an official in Russia’s powerful central bank) and asked for “the input of the Russian government.”
“Our opinion will be taken into consideration,” she said, according to the filing.
Butina also got to know an American who actually had significant visibility into the administration’s Russia contacts. Though the DOJ did not highlight the relationship in its sentencing papers, Butina knew Dimitri Simes, the head of the Central for the National Interest think tank–a well-connected, Russian-born denizen of K Street who took a significant role in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian influence efforts. Mueller provided significant new detail on Simes’ work with Jared Kushner to establish relationships with Russian government officials. Trumpworld representatives even checked with Simes to make sure they were communicating with the correct Russians, according to Mueller’s report.
Butina also had significant dealings with the think tank. She wrote an article for its magazine arguing that U.S.-Russia relations could flourish under a Republican administration. She also weighed in on a financial challenge facing its board chairman emeritus, billionaire Hank Greenberg; Greenberg owned a significant portion of a bank in Russia which was facing grave financial woes. Butina learned about the situation and advised that Greenberg inject more cash into the bank, as The Daily Beast reported . Simes, in turn, reached out to Torshin multiple times regarding Greenberg’s financial situation, according to private communications The Daily Beast reviewed.
“Simes is pressuring me about the interests of Greenberg,” Torshin wrote to Butina. “I really don't like that. Who knows what they will think in the Central Bank. Today I made it very clear that I am not their helper for these affairs in the Central Bank. I ask that you don't speak with anyone about banking in the Russian Federation. They may try to get you involved as well.”
Despite that friction, Simes’ star in Trumpland rose. The think tank hosted Trump’s first big—and Putin-friendly— foreign policy speech . It’s a speech that, according to Mueller, Simes had a hand in crafting.
In the years since then, the characters involved on that stage have found wildly different fates. Butina was arrested, and is now facing the judge who will decide how long she must stay there. Simes, meanwhile, is keeping a low profile. And Kushner is in the White House, telling people that the Russia investigations, not Moscow’s interference , was the real danger to America."
The Man Who Gave Birth to His Son—and Filmed It for You to See,www.thedailybeast.com,kevin.fallon@thedailybeast.com (Kevin Fallon),04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/seahorse-the-man-who-gave-birth-to-his-sonand-filmed-it-for-you-to-see,"VISIBILITY The Man Who Gave Birth to His Son—and Filmed It for You to See In the new documentary ‘Seahorse’ at the Tribeca Film Festival, trans man Freddy McConnell chronicles his journey to carry and deliver his own child. 04.24.19 5:09 AM ET Courtesy Tribeca Film Festival
It’s not an unusual occurrence: Child care needs and work commitments have forced single dad Freddy McConnell and me to shuffle our interview appointment a few times. So when we finally connect and I can hear the faint cries of a child in the background, I am surprised and delighted. Is that his son?
No, McConnell laughs, explaining that he’s taking the call from the beach in Deal, England, where he lives. “That’s another random baby. Wants an ice cream, I think.”
Though McConnell spent three years extensively documenting his journey to getting pregnant, and then his entire pregnancy and birth , he has strict boundaries about what he shares of his life with his son now, whom he asked not be named. (Other publications have referred to him with a pseudonym.) The film McConnell made was about wanting to create a family and his journey to having it, not about that family now. His infant son can’t consent.
“I can say that I’m loving being a father, though,” he does divulge. “Definitely.”
It was close to four years ago when McConnell, a writer and multimedia journalist at The Guardian , recruited trusted colleagues at the publication to help him find a filmmaker to tell his story. He’s 32 now, but then was approaching 30. It was time. He wanted to have a baby. More, he was going to carry it himself.

McConnell is trans . He was 25 when he first began taking testosterone, eventually electing to undergo top surgery. He’s fit and toned, with attractive facial hair and the pleasant English speaking voice of a schoolboy you might see in a Hollywood film. Because he knew he might one day consider having children, he never had a hysterectomy.
“I stopped giving a fuck about what anyone else thought, ultimately,” he says. “I’m going to have my own baby because it’s the simplest thing to do. It’s the most pragmatic option.”
Directed by Jeanie Finlay, Seahorse premieres Saturday at the Tribeca Film Festival . Named after the only species in which males carry and give birth to their young, the film is a deeply intimate look at something both remarkable and entirely ordinary.
Seahorse follows McConnell as he decides to stop taking testosterone, struggling as his body returns to a more zaftig shape and his vocal register changes again. As he starts to become fertile, he finds himself confronting his past self and the complicated feelings about gender all over again. “I don’t like the idea that I’ve got tampons in my bag,” he says when he starts to have his period again.
But so much of what he goes through in his pregnancy is also so recognizable, for all the extraordinary circumstances—right up to the birthing scene. Suffice it to say, there’s never been a birthing scene quite like this captured on film. McConnell is shown delivering his son in realistic detail. (You could say “graphic,” in so much as any birthing scene may be.)
It’s McConnell’s candor throughout the entire journey that makes the film valuable, but perhaps its greatest power is in that scene.
“Man Gives Birth” is a headline we’ve seen splashed across glossies and featured in newsmagazine shows on a spectrum of tawdriness over the years, ever since Thomas Beatie became “ The First Pregnant Man ” 10 years ago. But the story becomes less outrageous and the subjects cease becoming media zoo exhibits when you see the birth, not just the photos of the pregnant man or the father and child after the fact.
There’s something both normalizing and also seismic in the impact of witnessing the delivery.
“For me, it was always, how do I tell this story that is not sensationalized in the way that lots of transgender stories have been told in the past?” Finlay says. “How can I make a story that we both feel like we own at the end of this, that feels intimate and real and small and extraordinary?”
As a journalist and as a trans person whose life has been forever changed because others have documented their own stories, McConnell knew that if he was going to go through this process, he would need to film it to share with others.
But his motivation for Seahorse was also to educate.
When he signed his consent forms to begin his testosterone treatment, he remembers being told by doctors that the treatment would leave him infertile. That is a fallacy, made worse because it is repeated to trans men and those considering taking hormones by medical professionals.
“The thing that doctors aren’t clear enough about is that, yes, being on testosterone does make you infertile, but it’s reversible,” McConnell says. “When I was thinking about becoming a dad, I didn’t know the options available to me. No one told me that I could do it this way, safely, and that I could forge a path that was unusual and surprising, perhaps—but totally valid and wonderful.”
McConnell discovered that carrying and giving birth to his own child was an option through online communities and forums he began engaging with during his transition. Specifically on YouTube, he came across vlogs (video blogs) from other trans men who had pregnancies. It was after listening to Trystan Reese, whose trans pregnancy in 2017 was covered by several major media outlets, talk about his experience on the parenting podcast The Longest Shortest Time that he was galvanized to pursue the journey himself.
“I think people now, especially in the U.S., are super-frustrated about how it’s still being talked about as this unusual, revolutionary thing,” McConnell says. “It’s not if you’re in this world. I just seems that way if you’re not in this world.” “I stopped giving a fuck about what anyone else thought, ultimately. I’m going to have my own baby because it’s the simplest thing to do. It’s the most pragmatic option.” — Freddy McConnell
A major throughline of Seahorse is the unwavering support of McConnell’s mother, Esme, who is with him throughout the entire process, including coaching him through the birth. At one point in the film, she grins to the camera. “I loved being pregnant,” she says. “Everybody should experience it. Especially men.”
McConnell conceives that he was “very naive” about how hard pregnancy would be. How does he feel now about his mother’s statement? “I’m not making it up when I say I have memories of her saying stuff like that when I was very small,” he says, laughing. “The fact that she comes from that position of understanding I suppose helps her have a trans child. I assume—I don’t want to speak for her.”
He knew that by participating in the film, he would need to help bring audiences to that position of understanding, something he says was one of the most arduous parts of the experience. Even Finlay concedes that getting her subject to open up to her about not just how his body was changing, but articulate how that feels as a trans man, was difficult, especially as the pregnancy wore on.
“I totally questioned at times why am I putting myself in the situation of doing the thing that trans people dread, which is to try and explain gender dysphoria,” McConnell says. “And not just dysphoria, but dysphoria during pregnancy to someone who, through no fault of their own, is never going to know what it means and what it feels like. It’s something that in general is impossible to explain, the trans experience.”
Filming was a sensitive endeavor, conducted largely in secret with few people knowing what exactly they were working on. No official announcement about the film was made until several months after Baby McConnell was born. Helping matters was the fact that McConnell carried his weight like many women expecting a boy do, low and around the hips. Even in his third trimester, he looked like a man who had gained a bit of a beer belly.
“One of the things we were all scared of was that he would get outed when he was pregnant,” Finlay says. “Now he’s a dad who’s getting his story out there. But ‘a man who’s pregnant’ is like a tabloid scoop.”
As such, the most monumental aspect of the film, and the thing that does the greatest job of separating it from a tabloid story, is the incredible scene of McConnell giving birth. “I was unable to edit it without crying,” Finlay says.
McConnell delivered via a water birth, and Finlay was written into his birth plan, camping out in Deal for two weeks to ensure she’d be there. She filmed much of the delivery as unobtrusively as possible from the corner of the room with a long lens trained on McConnell’s face as his mother coached him through his contractions. (Without his glasses on, McConnell jokes he was completely oblivious to Finlay’s presence.)
She had also set up a camera above the pool to capture an overhead shot of McConnell delivering his son. The footage is jaw-dropping—if you ever watched The Miracle of Birth in a high school health class, you get the idea. As the baby crowns, McConnell sits up in the pool and gives the final push, receiving his son from between his legs as the pool fills with blood. He brings the baby to his chest, cradling him as he utters his first cries.
“I hope it makes it seem real, but also normal,” McConnell says of the scene.
From the project’s inception, he knew the film wouldn’t be impactful without including the birth. Besides, he figured that lots of people’s births are depicted in documentaries and various other pieces of art. Why shouldn’t he be able to do that, too?
“Just because it’s unusual doesn’t mean it’s any less of a wonderful, valid thing to share.”"
Fox News’ Sean Hannity Boasts That Cher Is a Secret Fan of His Show,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-sean-hannity-boasts-that-cher-is-a-secret-fan-of-his-show,"DO YOU BELIEVE? Fox News’ Sean Hannity Boasts That Cher Is a Secret Fan of His Show ‘Twice now—in two weeks’ the pop superstar’s views have aligned with his own, the Fox News host said, so she must be watching. Justin Baragona 04.23.19 11:48 PM ET
Fox News host Sean Hannity suggested Tuesday night that pop superstar Cher is a secret fan of his show and may be getting her ideas from his nightly talking points.
The suggestion came after the liberal singer/actress questioned Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders for arguing that prisoners should have the right to vote earlier this week.
During his CNN town hall Monday night, Sanders was asked if he supported giving people such as Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev or “those convicted of sexual assault” the right to vote even while in prison. The independent Vermont senator replied that “even for terrible people,” everyone should have the “inherent American right to participate in our democracy.”
Cher, an outspoken Trump critic and full-fledged member of the Resistance, took issue with Sanders’ stance. In a since-deleted tweet, the Oscar-winner asked: “Does Bernie Sanders really believe [people] in prison who are murderers!? Rapists!? Child Molesters!? Boston bombers… still deserve the right to vote!?”
After highlighting The View host Meghan McCain’s angry reaction to Sanders’ town hall comments during his broadcast Tuesday, Hannity spotlighted Cher’s tweet before boasting that she must watch the program.
“I think Cher is watching this show because this is twice now—in two weeks—that we have highlighted her views, being on the right side,” the pro-Trump conservative host declared.
As Hannity stated, this isn’t the first time he praised Cher this month. Last week, he mentioned her on his program several times after she seemed to side with President Trump on immigration, saying that while she understood the need to help struggling immigrants, she questioned how her city could take care of more when it “isn’t taking care of its own.”
The comments prompted Trump to proclaim on Twitter: “I finally agree with Cher!”
Donald Trump Jr. also reposted her tweet on his Instagram , along with the caption: “Welcome to the Republican Party Cher!!!” READ THIS LIST"
Lawsuit Claims Connecticut Fertility Clinic Gave Wrong Embryo to Couple Who Had Baby of Different Race,www.thedailybeast.com,Tracy.Connor@thedailybeast.com (Tracy Connor),04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/connecticut-fertility-clinic-gave-wrong-embryos-to-couple-who-had-baby-of-different-race-lawsuit,"Lawsuit Claims Connecticut Fertility Clinic Gave Wrong Embryo to Couple Who Had Baby of Different Race A lawsuit says the couple noticed their second baby had ‘much darker skin.’ 04.23.19 10:25 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photos Getty
A couple is suing a defunct Connecticut fertility clinic, claiming the staff gave them the wrong embryos and they ended up with a baby of a different race.
The saga begins in 2015 when the plaintiffs underwent in vitro fertilization at CT Fertility in Trumbull, using sperm from the husband and donor eggs to conceive their first child, according to court papers.
They returned to the clinic in 2017 hoping to have a second child, using the embryos left over from the original IVF treatment, and in August 2018 gave birth to a baby boy, the lawsuit says.
But the couple soon suspected something was amiss. The new baby did not resemble his older brother and “appeared to have much darker skin pigmentation,” according to court documents.
The suit, which was first reported by the Connecticut Post , says a few months after the birth, the couple had DNA tests performed on both children. They discovered that the husband is not the biological father of the younger baby, who is not the full sibling of their older child.
“While their second-born son is loved and healthy in every aspect, he is not in fact their biological baby,” they wrote.
The suit does not make clear how the alleged mix-up happened but says the parents have suffered emotional anguish.
“As a result of what has occurred, the plaintiffs are left with potential life-long haunting uncertainties regarding their second-born son... and unknowns about what happened to their genetic material and where their genetic material ended up.
“Is it actually their genetic material that is now in storage? Whose genetic material was transferred to plaintiff? Will someone one day attempt to make a claim to custody of their child?”
The couple—who have since moved to London—said they “are barraged daily with questions and suspicions regarding who the child’s real father is and even whether plaintiff mother had an affair... and other ignorant and cruel harassment, for which the plaintiffs did not bargain.”
Attorneys for CT Fertility, which has since closed, and Dr. Melvin Thornton, who now works for another clinic, attempted to get the malpractice lawsuit thrown out on procedural grounds—arguing an expert cited by the couple was the wrong kind of doctor and had failed to show negligence.
A staffer at Thornton’s new clinic says he was involved in the transfer of the frozen embryos but a different doctor handled the creation of them. “He came in after the embryos were created,” she said.
The couple, meanwhile, have requested that the case be sealed to protect their child. The clinic has objected, saying the use of pseudonyms would prejudice a jury against it.
If anonymity was granted, “the court would elevate the air of stigmatization in the case to something more serious than the actual allegations plead,” the defendants wrote.
The judge has yet to rule on the matter."
‘Tootsie’ on Broadway: A Cross-Dressing Classic Gets a Large Spoonful of Woke,www.thedailybeast.com,tim.teeman@thedailybeast.com (Tim Teeman),04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/tootsie-on-broadway-a-cross-dressing-classic-gets-a-large-spoonful-of-woke,"EXPERIENCE ‘Tootsie’ on Broadway: A Cross-Dressing Classic Gets a Large Spoonful of Woke ‘Tootsie’ is a strange musical, with a better script than its music, and a story which goes out of its way to emphasize its feminist credentials—as well as apologizing for itself. 04.23.19 9:00 PM ET Courtesy Matthew Murphy/Polk and Co
Tootsie as a musical is a confusing mélange, and not for the sexual and romantic attractions and farce-heavy confusions set in motion by lead character Michael Dorsey’s (Santino Fontana) cross-dressing.
The Broadway version of the 1982 movie—which starred Dustin Hoffman as Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels—is both chaotic and apologetic, with a sharper and better book than it has music.
In 2019, Tootsie — which opened tonight at the Marquis Theatre (to December 22 )—wants to telegraph how woke and aware it is. The show, directed by Scott Ellis, has speeches grafted into it about gender inequality and feminist respect that stand out like absurd sore thumbs.
These periodic speeches of “we-get-it-we-really-do” rather undermine Tootsie ’s central conceit: a male actor dresses as a woman to get work, leading to a woman falling for him as a woman, and a man falling for him as a woman. The experience teaches Michael—well, what exactly? How hard it is to be a woman, and phew, he’s ultimately very happy to be a man, albeit one who’s learned something about sexism.
While there is no overt homophobia or misogyny in either movie or stage show, note that the central “joke” in both of Tootsie ’s intimate scenarios is that Michael’s cross-dressing could lead to, with both male and female suitors—oh no—two variants of a same-sex kiss or attraction, and Michael is a straight guy in a dress! Stop the clocks!
His deception is ironic. At the start of of the show, Michael is the actor’s actor, honest about his art to the point of work-imperiling, decrying a terrible lead number for a show he is auditioning for: “This opening number is benign and dishonest, directed by an inept, derivative hack. And this musical sucks!” Fontana is a charming performer, but he can be forgiven for sometimes flailing in whether he’s performing door-slamming farce—centered around how innately hilarious you find a man masquerading as a woman—or socially conscious parable.
The book of the musical by Robert Horn is witty and sharp—much of this thanks to the get-real buckets of verbal cold water thrown by Andy Grotelueschen’s blunt-speaking flatmate Jeff.
“Michael, part of the problem is that you don’t recognize you’re all of the problem,” Jeff tells him. He rightly sums Dorothy up as “this ‘Faye Dunaway as a gym coach, glittering, clearance sale, Jack Sparrow’ character.”
It is Jeff who tells Michael: “At a time when women are literally clutching their power back from between the legs of men, you have the audacity to take a job away from one by perpetrating one?... You’re pretending to be a woman to get a job! And you know you’ll have to take a pay cut.”
If the words are mostly on point, the music, design, and choreography of Tootsie rarely rise above meh .
Why the producers have decided to change the meta-backdrop from the daffy daytime soap of the movie to a Broadway show is theirs to explain. Write what you know I guess (and a musical-within-a-musical yields more tunes), but the absurdities of a daytime soap—ageing lothario doctors, back-from-the-dead, long lost cousin plot twists—yield more guffawish humor than “Juliet’s Curse, a musical continuation of Romeo and Juliet .” A loopy update of Romeo and Juliet is not that strange.
Reg Rogers plays the convincingly sexist director (his very own Dabney Coleman), and Michael McGrath as Michael’s agent Stan milks his moment of discovering the truth about Dorothy for all its comic worth. He also tells Michael, “Be a he, be a she, be a they, use whatever bathroom you want and don’t let anybody tell you, you can’t.”
Julie Halston as producer Rita Marshall has her own riot, with one of the best lines of the show about a not-so-dead husband.
The musical also brings us John Behlmann as Max Van Horn. In the movie Van Horn is the out-of-it actor who needs the teleprompter to remember his lines and who falls for Dorothy as the actress whose character abuses his character so fulsomely on the show.
In the musical, Max is a young, vain, well-meaning, brainless hunk, forever required to take off his shirt (it just falls off when it needs to), and is bewitched by how “sturdy” Dorothy is. Behlmann hams it up perfectly. Sarah Stiles is equally wonderful as Sandy, Michael’s buddy and sometime girlfriend, whose untethered-stream-of-consciousness-made-song, ‘What’s Gonna Happen’—combining the hell of auditions, colonoscopies, and Judge Antonin Scalia —is one of the evening’s best.
‘Unstoppable,’ which closes out act one, is the musical’s version of the magazine covers sequence of the movie (which was accompanied vocally with Stephen Bishop’s ‘Tootsie’), leading to a tableau not of magazines as in the film but of names of lead female characters that Dorothy may play on flashing neon billboards. Costume designer William Ivey Long recreates Dorothy’s triumphant red glittering dress, here with a scoop neck.
Oddly, for a show that wants to prove its feminist worth, the character it serves least well is Lilli Cooper’s Julie Nichols, whose character is a little blank (and similarly her songs). The book again is sharper: in this musical version, Julie goes to kiss Dorothy, not realizing Dorothy is Michael. The musical leaves the duo in a convincing state of friendship/romance suspension at the end.
Michael’s take-home from dressing as Dorothy is that “being a woman is no job for a man.” He says it with a self-admonishing sigh, as if to renounce the revels of the previous two hours; here is a man who has only been able to empathize with or understand what women face by impersonating one. This Tootsie is slightly lost in its own cloud of sequins and cultural intent. READ THIS LIST"
What the Sri Lanka Bombings Tell Us About the State of ISIS,www.thedailybeast.com,Rita Katz,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/what-the-sri-lanka-bombings-tell-us-about-the-state-of-isis,"TERROR What the Sri Lanka Bombings Tell Us About the State of ISIS The group didn’t attribute the attack to New Zealand because it didn’t have to. Christians have long been among its targets. 04.23.19 6:40 PM ET Ishara S. Kodikara/Getty
On Tuesday, the Islamic State (also known as IS or ISIS) confirmed what the world already suspected when it claimed responsibility for Sunday’s devastating blasts across Sri Lanka , which killed over 300 and injured over 500. Breaking two days of silence on the attacks at the official level, ISIS is now outpouring with content on the matter.
A communique , released shortly after an initial report of responsibility by ISIS news agency ‘Amaq, was heavy in detail, identifying seven attackers and which locations each of them struck across churches, hotels, and housing in Sri Lanka’s Batticaloa, Colombo, Dematagoda, and Negombo areas. ‘Amaq released a video minutes afterward of the attackers pledging allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi together, led by suspected attack “ mastermind ” Moulvi Zahran Hashim.
The attacks—and ISIS’ response—provide a troubling demonstration of how ISIS’ global network is adapting to its losses in Iraq and Syria, how its media machine thrives amid those setbacks, and how the group is willing to adjust its own playbook to justify an attack. ISIS’ Network-Building Model
While ISIS’ claim may seem to contradict the Sri Lankan government’s early assessments that a radical Islamist group called National Thowheeth Jama’ath was behind the attack, it is actually fitting with the way ISIS has built its global network of military divisions and sleeper cells.
""We do not believe these attacks were carried out by a group of people who were confined to this country,"" said Sri Lanka Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne in the aftermath of the blasts. ""There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded.""
Senaratne’s assessment speaks to a critical foundation of ISIS’ recruitment game. Rather than building up membership from scratch, the group poaches members from existing hardliner groups—or oftentimes the entire groups themselves. To see how effective this has been for ISIS, one would only have to look to places like the nearby Philippines, where the group pulled from Abu Sayaaf Group and other factions to put toward its “East Asia Province,” Shabaab fighters in Somalia to form its “East Africa Province,” and Taliban fighters in Afghanistan and Pakistan to form its “Khorasan Province.”
There is a mutual benefit between ISIS and the entities it absorbs: not only does ISIS grow a new tentacle in its global network, but its newly pledged members also gain access to a wealth of financing, training, contacts, publicity, and other resources. To that point, prior to this past Sunday, National Thowheeth Jama’ath’s most noteworthy activity was vandalism of churches—never a suicide operation, let alone any deadly attack. Now, its members performed a sophisticated and well-coordinated series of bombings across Sri Lanka. These attackers almost certainly received some sort of training and assistance from ISIS—possibly from one of the group’s hubs in the Philippines or elsewhere in the region. Analyzing ISIS’ Sri Lanka Claim
ISIS’ claim for the Sri Lanka attack marks significant deviations from its claims for similar attacks, showing just how willing ISIS to bend its own target scope.
First, it is worth noting that ISIS didn’t mention the attack on Christchurch mosques in New Zealand as a motivator behind the Sri Lanka attacks. Sure, it would be hard to believe that ISIS had managed to put together such a massive attack in one month after the New Zealand massacre, but such circumstances have never stopped jihadi groups from opportunistic outreach–let alone for one like Sri Lanka, which would be easy to frame as revenge against “Crusader” Christians. “These attackers almost certainly received some sort of training and assistance from ISIS.”
But ISIS, by its own warped ideology, doesn’t need New Zealand as justification for its attack. ISIS’ résumé is already full of claimed atrocities against churches, from Indonesia and the Philippines , to Pakistan and Egypt . Issue nine of ISIS’ Rumiyah magazine even gave a religious edict for killing Christians, giving ISIS even less need to use New Zealand as reason to justify an attack like Sri Lanka.
Thus, Tuesday’s communiqué touts its victims in Sri Lanka as “Christian combatants,” echoing its past labeling of victims as “Christian Crusaders.”
The real rule-bending, though, is seen with the Sri Lanka claim’s stretched labeling of “coalition” targets. While ISIS-claimed bombings in places like Paris , Brussels , and others are framed as being against “Crusader states allied against the Islamic State,” a country like Sri Lanka, not a member of the anti-ISIS coalition, does not fit this criteria. With that, ISIS’ claim appeals to newly altered target criteria, stating that the attacks were made against “churches and hotels in which citizens of the Crusader coalition were present.” An Enduring ISIS Media Machine
Despite its losses of territory in Iraq and Syria, ISIS’ media machine thrives. The group’s media output for the Sri Lanka attacks, which has spanned detailed breakdowns of the attacks and video footage of the attackers, shows how robust of a grasp the group’s Central Media Division still holds over ISIS media work, even in far-off countries like Sri Lanka.
While Sri Lanka is not by any means a major staple of ISIS chatter and media, parts of the ISIS recruitment machine are well-fitting to Sri Lankan audiences. Tamil, one of Sri Lanka’s two official languages, is among those which ISIS media is translated to and a key component of the ISIS online apparatus. This translated content—statements, religious content, etc.—is promoted across ISIS-linked online spaces of various other languages, further connecting Tamil-speakers to the larger ISIS community. Social media and messenger applications unite these ISIS-supporters into one borderless network.
These corners of ISIS’ propaganda machine have provided further fuel to a pro-ISIS online celebration campaign launched in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Like other ISIS-linked campaigns, the one for Sri Lanka showed a robust level of coordinated outreach, with content in Tamil and a host of other languages flooding online spaces with hyped messages of celebration and characterizing the blasts as revenge for attacks on Muslims.
“Now you can't bomb us but we can bomb you,” one ISIS-linked Telegram channel posted. “Did you think that losing cities in [Syria] will make us give up?”
A user on an ISIS-linked Deep Web forum likewise exclaimed, “Just like the massacre of mosques, it is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.”
And, as terrorist attacks so often snowball into more violence, supporters are already capitalizing on the event to incite for more. An ISIS-supporting user wrote on Instagram, “Good job, Indonesia coming soon.” “An ISIS-supporting user wrote on Instagram, 'Good job, Indonesia coming soon.'”
“It is a motivation for all of us,” one ISIS supporter wrote bluntly on WhatsApp. “Death is our fate and shahid (martyrdom) is a choice.”
These messages show an ugly reality: the tragic attacks in Sri Lanka are not an ending phase of a linear process, but rather another component of larger cycle—one in which every attack feeds the same recruitment machine that inspired it. That said, we must confront the fact that while ISIS may lack the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria, the world has still not figured out how to shut down its online life force.
Even militarily, the group is far from gone. Not including Iraq and Syria, ISIS claimed attacks across 13 different countries between April 10-23. This included unprecedented attack claims from Mali, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sri Lanka; the group’s first provincial claim from Moscow Oblast, Russia; and suicide operations in Egypt, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
Thus, instead of celebrating the group’s collapse in two countries, the international community must assess its progress—or lack thereof—in countering the group everywhere it exists, be it online or on the ground. READ THIS LIST"
Cassowary That Killed Its 75-Year-Old Owner to Hit the Auction Block,www.thedailybeast.com,Audrey.McNamara@thedailybeast.com (Audrey McNamara),04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/cassowary-that-killed-its-75-year-old-owner-in-florida-to-hit-the-auction-block,"BUYER BEWARE Cassowary That Killed Its 75-Year-Old Owner to Hit the Auction Block The killer cassowary will be up for sale with dozens of exotic animals owned by Marvin Hajos, who was fatally attacked nearly two weeks ago. 04.23.19 6:09 PM ET Goh Chai Hin/AFP/Getty
The large, flightless bird that attacked and killed its 75-year-old owner in Florida earlier this month can now be yours—for the right price.
The killer cassowary, along with dozens of other dangerous and endangered animals owned by Marvin Hajos before his death, is up for auction this Saturday by Gulf Coast Livestock in Madison, Florida.
The animals are being sold in accordance with the last wishes of Hajos, whose cassowary attacked him after he took a spill on his farm in Alachua County, authorities said.
“My understanding is that the gentleman was in the vicinity of the bird and at some point fell. When he fell, he was attacked,” Deputy Chief Jeff Taylor told The Gainesville Sun at the time of the incident.
The sale’s auctioneer, Scotty Wilson, says they expect about 100 people from across the country to attend Saturday. The media, however, are not welcome.
“Anyone seen video taping in any capacity will be deemed trespassing and will be escorted out by security,” a post advertising the sale warned. “Your video equipment may or may not be confiscated until all video recordings are distroyed (sic). Please do not comprise (sic) our position.”
Well over 100 animals are up for auction, including two adult cassowaries, five ring-tailed and ruffed lemurs, 26 marmosets, an emu, and a slew of macaws. The International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List classifies lemurs as “critically endangered.”
According to the San Diego Zoo, the cassowary is “considered the most dangerous bird in the world.”
“Each 3-toed foot has a dagger-like claw on the inner toe that is up to 4 inches… long!” the zoo’s website reads. “The cassowary can slice open any predator or potential threat with a single swift kick. Powerful legs help the cassowary run up to 31 miles per hour… through the dense forest underbrush.”
Cassowaries are native to Australia and New Guinea and are most closely related to the emu. They can stand up to six feet tall and jump “nearly 7 feet straight up into the air and swim like a champ, so the bird is quite good at fending off threats or escaping danger,” according to the zoo.
At the time of his death, Hajos was breeding the birds, which are sought after by exotic animal collectors. Because he was keeping the birds for “agricultural purposes,” he did not need to have the license otherwise required by Florida law to personally house the birds.
“Mr. Hajos did not—was not required to have a license to own cassowaries because of an agricultural exemption in the captive wildlife rule which states that if the ratite is being used for breeding, or ranching, or propagation purposes for agricultural use, that a Class II permit is not required,” Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commision Law Enforcement spokesperson Robert Keppler told The Daily Beast.
Cassowaries are defined as “Class II” wildlife in Florida, as they can pose a danger to people. “Substantial experience and specific cage requirements must be met. Permits are required for public exhibition, sale or personal possession of Class II wildlife,” according to the FWC website.
According to Wilson, everyone who attends his auction is required to pre-register and possess a captive wildlife license or permit.
Keppler would not go into detail about any enforcement actions “that are, or are not, in place” for regulating the sale.
“We wouldn’t tell you… what our captive wildlife investigators plan on doing in order to make sure that Florida’s captive wildlife rules and regulations are being followed,” Keppler said. “But we do monitor the possession and ownership of captive wildlife in Florida to ensure that illegal possession does not occur.”
He added that “the sale of captive wildlife to and from properly licensed individuals is not prohibited in Florida.”
When asked if attendees would be warned one of the birds has killed a man, Wilson assured that “full disclosure” would be made."

Everybody Is Wrong. Impeachment Will Help Democrats. - Daily Beast,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/everybody-is-wrong-trump-impeachment-hearings-will-help-democrats,"opinion Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/The Daily Beast/Getty
If Attorney General Bill Barr had led his press conference last Thursday morning by saying, “The Mueller report reveals that, among other things, on multiple occasions, President Donald Trump ordered Corey Lewandowski and Don McGahn to obstruct justice,” the House of Representatives would be planning Trump’s impeachment hearings, with probably even some Republicans in the House and the Senate putting out statements in support of the hearings.
Spoiler alert: The Mueller report revealed that Donald Trump gave those orders, along with no fewer than 11 other instances of the president attempting to obstruct justice.
From dictating to then-White House Communications Director Hope Hicks a press release to lie about the Trump Tower meeting with Russians offering “dirt” on Hillary Clinton, that was accepted and attended by Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner; to twice ordering then White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller; to telling Corey Lewandowski to force Attorney General Jeff Sessions to thwart the Mueller investigation; to asking NSA chief Admiral Mike Rogers to squelch the investigation by lying to the press and more, Trump, but for Bill Barr throwing himself on a live hand grenade, would likely be tendering his resignation by now—Nixon-style. These individuals, who each were trusted Trump allies and darlings of MAGA world to varying degrees, recounting under oath on live television how the president asked them to break the law, will be even more powerful than reading the Mueller report itself, and with viewership in the stratosphere. It would make Super Bowl ratings look like basic local cable by comparison. MEMBERS ONLY"

When former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen set out to strengthen efforts to protect the 2020 election from Russian interference, Donald Trump’s chief of staff reportedly warned her to keep it a secret from the president through fear it would upset him. The New York Times reports that, before Nielsen left the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, she became increasingly concerned about Russia’s continued attempts to disrupt elections despite being caught red-handed in 2016. When she wanted to push ahead with new measures to help fight back earlier this year, chief of staff Mick Mulvaney warned her that Trump still equated discussion of Russian election interference with questions about the legitimacy of his victory. Mulvaney reportedly told her it “wasn’t a great subject and should be kept below his level.” Nielsen eventually gave up on her effort to organize a White House meeting of cabinet secretaries to discuss how to protect next year’s presidential elections.

Pro-Trump TV Channel OAN Has a Comedy Show So Terrible It Might Actually Be Funny,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/pro-trump-tv-channel-oan-has-a-comedy-show-so-terrible-it-might-actually-be-funny,"Pro-Trump TV Channel OAN Has a Comedy Show So Terrible It Might Actually Be Funny It’s unclear where the actual ‘comedy’ begins. Justin Baragona 04.24.19 1:44 PM ET
This week, far-right little-watched cable network One America News , a channel that’s positioned itself as an even Trumpier version of Fox News , announced that it will debut a new conservative comedy show next month.
The program, titled Headlines Tonight with Drew Berquist , is an obvious knockoff of The Daily Show, Last Week Tonight , and Saturday Night Live ’s “Weekend Update,” in that its focus is satirizing today’s headlines in a newscast setting.
That is, however, where the comparisons end.
OANN CEO Robert Herring claimed the show will “make fun of someone other than President Trump,” which the teaser clips released this week bear out. But none of the released clips show any “fun” or anything remotely bordering on comedy—at least not of the intentional sort.
In the first clip tweeted out by Herring on Tuesday, host Drew Berquist—a former BlazeTV host and counterterrorism officer—took aim at the right’s favorite bogeywoman as of late: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). The result, of course, is Mike Huckabee-style hokey “comedy” tailor-made for people who apparently love painfully flat humor.
Riffing on a nearly three-week-old story of Ocasio-Cortez supposedly appropriating a forced “black accent” during a speech addressing an African-American audience, Berquist’s punchline is him just imitating AOC, but with an even more stereotypical accent. The show’s laugh track loved it though!
If that short clip didn’t tickle your funny bone, the network released video of an eight-minute segment on Wednesday, and—hoo boy—it’s somehow even worse:
Where to start here? Not only does Berquist awkwardly bungle the name of his own show, but then the canned laugh track comes in early at one point, clumsily cuts off at another, and some lines we assume were jokes(?) never got the laugh-track treatment.
The entire segment is unequivocally and painfully unfunny—in fact, it’s so unfunny that it might even be funny if viewed as an elaborate anti-comedy bit. Either way, the only actual comedy to emerge from these clips has been the reactions from actual comedians and people who appreciate humor.
TV’s own Andy Levy remarked on Twitter that “this video is deadlier than the one” in The Ring , adding that “the worst thing about this isn’t that it’s painfully unfunny it’s that whoever wrote it appears to have never even watched a minute of comedy in their life.”
Daily Show producer Ryan Middleton reacted by tweeting, “my god they are starting to get better at comedy and it is indeed making me nervous,” sarcastically referencing conspiracy theorist Paul Joseph Watson’s often-mocked claim last year that the “right is starting to get better at comedy and it’s making lefties nervous.”
Comedy writer Stefan Heck got straight to the point. “Looks like shit,” he tweeted , echoing a wave of responses ranging from blunt mockery to ironic banter like “Big fan, love your network! Please post the comedy show clip, I’d love to see it!”
Many viewers posted memes mocking the videos, and more than a few noticed a similarity to the previous time a right-wing network tried its hand at comedy.
Back in 2007, Fox News ran a show called The ½ Hour News Hour , featuring actors playing lead anchors poorly attempting a Daily Show cadence and separate cameos from right-wing stars like Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, and Laura Ingraham.
The show was axed only three months after its debut. It was absolutely savaged by critics."
Top Justice Department Official Will Defy Congress,www.thedailybeast.com,betsy.woodruff@thedailybeast.com (Betsy Woodruff),04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-gore-a-top-doj-official-will-defy-congress,"BURN Top Justice Department Official Will Defy Congress An attorney for John Gore, a top official in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said to testify Gore must have an attorney present—a condition Democrats have rejected. 04.24.19 11:35 AM ET John Gore
John Gore, a top official in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, will not appear for a deposition scheduled for tomorrow with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, according to a letter the Justice Department sent the committee chairman on April 24.
Stephen Boyd, the department’s top Hill liaison, wrote in the letter, which The Daily Beast obtained, that Gore will not appear as long as Chairman Elijah Cummings blocks him from bringing along lawyers from the Justice Department.
“We are disappointed that the Committee remains unwilling to permit Department counsel to represent the interests of the Executive Branch in the deposition of a senior Department official,” Boyd wrote. “Accordingly, Attorney General Barr’s determination that Mr. Gore will not appear at the Committee’s deposition unless a Department attorney may accompany him remains in effect.”
The committee wants to question Gore about his role in the Trump administration’s effort to add a question to the 2020 Census about citizenship. The committee authorized a subpoena of Gore earlier this month. His refusal to participate in a deposition may result in an effort by the committee to hold him in contempt.
“In keeping with longstanding Department of Justice policy, neither Mr. Gore nor anyone else in the Department will be forced to testify in their capacity as a DOJ official on DOJ matters without DOJ counsel,” said Kerri Kupec, a department spokesperson.
In a statement, Cummings said Gore is still obligated to appear for the deposition.
“This is a massive, unprecedented, and growing pattern of obstruction,” he said. “Yesterday, President Trump declared to the entire country that he would obstruct Congress and order all White House officials to defy lawful subpoenas from Congress. Today, the Trump Administration went even further by expanding this policy to employees at federal agencies—even when the subpoenas are bipartisan and supported by Republican Members of Congress.”
He added that Committee staff will be available for the interview if Gore changes his mind.
“Committee investigators will gather tomorrow morning for this deposition—as scheduled—and we hope Mr. Gore will fulfill his legal and ethical responsibilities and appear as ordered,” he said.
A spokesperson for the committee’s Republicans, meanwhile, pointed out that Gore already appeared for a transcribed interview with staff and said Cummings’ subpoena is “part and parcel of his broader partisan oversight agenda.”
Gore will be the highest-profile Trump administration official to defy a congressional subpoena—so far. Earlier this week, the lawyer for Carl Kline, a career official who green-lit Jared Kushner’s security clearance, told Cummings he will not participate in a deposition about that issue unless lawyers from the White House Counsel’s Office can attend. Cummings has taken steps to hold him in contempt of Congress. If the House votes to hold him in contempt—a safe bet—then they may refer the matter to the D.C. U.S. Attorney. That attorney is Jessie Liu, a Trump appointee.
Gore will find himself in a similar situation if the House votes to hold him in contempt.
These cases will test the power of congressional committees. In the past, efforts to compel testimony have garnered mixed results; House Republicans famously voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt in 2012 while investigating the Fast and Furious scandal. Despite the contempt vote, Holder still didn’t comply with the House’s demands.
The census investigation is of paramount importance to Democrats, who argue the question about the citizenship will discourage participation. Less participation could result in millions of people not being counted, they argue; and undercounting could mean a mis-apportionment of Congressional districts and lower levels of federal funding to communities that are underrepresented. Republicans, meanwhile, argue the federal government has asked about citizenship in the past and that it won’t result in unfairness.
Democrats and other opponents of the citizenship question, including multiple civil rights groups, sued to keep it from appearing on the census. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on that litigation earlier this week. Observers have guessed that the court will lean in the direction of allowing the question. READ THIS LIST"

Larry Hogan Pitches Memoir as He Teases 2020 Trump Challenge The ‘Never Trump’ Republican politician is looking to tell his compelling life story—and take a few digs at the president he may try to primary. exclusive Scott Eisen
The most high-profile Republican politician currently weighing a challenge to President Donald Trump is shopping around a book that would raise his profile and introduce his life story to Americans.
Multiple sources with direct knowledge told The Daily Beast that Maryland’s Republican governor Larry Hogan has met with major publishers in recent weeks, pitching a book about his life and tenure as governor. All of this while he travels to more than a dozen key states to generate buzz about a possible run against Trump.
If the book is sold, it will be co-written by former Fox News liberal pundit Ellis Henican, who recently co-wrote former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s book. In a phone call on Wednesday, Henican confirmed that although nothing has been sold yet, the governor has definitely taken “initial” steps toward publishing a book.
“I think the guy’s got an amazing story and he ought to write a book, and I’m doing what I can to try and make that happen,” he said.
According to sources with direct knowledge, the book would not explicitly set the stage for a Hogan presidential campaign or zero in on his criticisms of President Trump.
Instead, Henican emphasized, the 62-year-old governor’s life story (he survived non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma), background in business and politics, and compelling family history (Hogan’s father was a notable Republican congressman) would be highlighted for the memoir.
However, he added, the book would like also include “a very sharp appraisal of the president.” Hogan’s office declined to comment.
One of the most popular governors in the country , Hogan has repeatedly said he’s considering a campaign for president, and he has taken steps that have widely been interpreted as precursors to a run against Trump
He has admonished the Republican National Committee for making it more difficult for party members to mount a 2020 primary challenge to Trump in 2020, and called on Republican lawmakers to appeal to voters beyond the party’s “ shrinking base .” In a Tuesday speech in New Hampshire, a key early primary state, the Republican governor said he has visited 10 states and plans to visit 16 more in the coming months.
“People have asked me to give this some serious thought, and I think I owe it to them to give it serious consideration,” Hogan said, referring to challenging Trump.
Hogan has been one of the most prominent Republican elected officials to criticize the president.
During Tuesday’s speech, Hogan mockingly referred to Trump as “ dear leader ,” and said many Republican members of Congress refuse to criticize the president because they’re afraid of him.
“There’s no profiles in courage here,” he said . “They’re afraid of being primaried. They’re afraid of being tweeted about.”
But he’s acknowledged the difficulties in challenging Trump, who remains overwhelmingly popular with Republicans.
“I’m not going to launch some kind of suicide mission,” he said on Tuesday , according to Politico. “I care about the future of my party, I care about the country but I would not run just to be a spoiler to the president. I’ve got a state to run.”"

Franklin Graham, one of the country’s most influential evangelical Christians, has called on Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg to “repent” for being gay. Graham, the president and CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, called homosexuality “something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized,” in a tweet Wednesday. At a recent CNN town hall, Buttigieg said to cheers, “God does not have a political party.” Graham responded to the candidate’s statement: “... [Pete Buttigieg] is right—God doesn’t have a political party. But God does have commandments, laws & standards... Mayor Buttigieg says he’s a gay Christian... The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman—not two men, not two women,” Graham tweeted.
Buttigieg addressed such religious-based criticism during the town hall. “It can be challenging to be a person of faith who’s also part of the LGBTQ community and yet, to me, the core of faith is regard for one another,” Buttigieg said. “... Part of God’s love is experienced, according to my faith tradition, is in the way that we support one another and, in particular, support the least among us.” Franklin Graham Calls for Buttigieg to Repent for Being Gay Cheat Sheet ® "

The former deputy chief of staff to ex-New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has been sentenced to 13 months in prison for her role in the 2013 “Bridgegate” scandal. Bridget Anne Kelly, a former top Christie aide, infamously wrote in an email to a Christie appointee at the Port Authority, “Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,” implicating herself in the scandal. The bizarre scheme entailed vengeful lane closures on the George Washington Bridge as political retribution against the local mayor. The intentional closing of three lanes over five days caused severe traffic jams. According to prosecutors, the plan was intended to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee for declining to endorse the governor for re-election.
Christie has never been charged in the scandal, and remains largely unscathed. Kelly has been less fortunate. Before her sentencing on Wednesday, she delivered a plea for leniency through tears. “Today marks another sad day for my children in a nightmare that has robbed our family...” Kelly said. After her sentencing, Kelly called Christie a “coward” who orchestrated the scheme. “I was silenced and I was intimidated. I remain as steadfast for the truth as the day this all began,” Kelly said. “The fact that I am here in place of... the governor himself... only proves that justice is not blind...it picks winners and losers.” "

A Donald Trump supporter from Rhode Island allegedly threatened to kill and eat a college professor and “eradicate” Democrats, according to federal officials.
Matthew Haviland, a 30-year-old resident of North Kingstown, threatened to murder and eat the professor in a series of March 10 emails, according to prosecutors. Haviland was arrested on Wednesday after an FBI investigation, and faces federal cyberstalking and threat charges.
In emails to the professor, who has publicly advocated for abortion rights, Haviland allegedly threatened to “rip every limb from your body and eat it, piece by piece” and “savor” the teacher’s “innards.”
“You will have your face ripped off and eaten by me, personally,” Haviland wrote in another email to the professor, whose name and affiliation were not revealed by the feds.
Haviland threatened Democrats in other emails, saying that people wearing “pink fucking hats”—an apparent reference to the “Pussy Hats” worn by Women’s March participants—“should all be slaughtered,” according to his indictment. He also allegedly wrote that all Democrats “must be eradicated.”
“I will kill every Democrat in the world so we never more have to have our babies brutally murdered by you absolute terrorists,” Haviland wrote, according to prosecutors.
Haviland’s attorney declined to comment.
In a separate series of emails to a department at the university, Haviland allegedly said the school should be bombed, calling for “another Civil War.”
A friend of Haviland’s told law enforcement that his political views had recently become “more extreme,” according to the FBI affidavit, because he was angry over media coverage of Trump.
“[Haviland’s friend] believes this is at least in part because of the way the news media portrays President Trump,” the affidavit noted.
Additionally, Haviland made more than 100 threatening calls to a Rhode Island abortion clinic, officials said. He admitted to law-enforcement officials that he made those calls, court filings showed.
Haviland also made threats and promoted his political views in YouTube videos and posts to the publishing platform Medium, according to law enforcement.
In his online videos, Haviland accused Democrats of being “soulless” and “slavemasters.” He also accused members of the media of being “monsters” and spreading “cultural Marxism,” a far-right talking point that holds that reporters and academics subscribe to a philosophy trying to undermine the United States.
On his YouTube channel, Haviland praised a number of right-wing media personalities. He encouraged his handful of viewers to check out specific videos from conservative pundit Ben Shapiro , former Pizzagate promoter Mike Cernovich , and cartoonist Scott Adams, the Dilbert comic-strip creator who has reinvented himself as a vociferous Trump booster.
Haviland also used YouTube to praise Trump, saying the president does “good things,” and accusing reporters of being out to destroy his presidency. In one video, taken just days before his arrest, Haviland screamed into the camera about the prospect of Special Counsel Robert Mueller testifying before Congress, shouting that Trump “did nothing fucking wrong.”
The Daily Beast was able to connect Haviland to the YouTube account, “Democrats Dehumanize Developing Humans,” because it used an identical screen name to one mentioned in court records. The man in the YouTube videos also exactly matched a profile picture from a Medium account tied to Haviland, which law-enforcement officials identified as Haviland.
Haviland’s alleged email threats also reflected some common grievances on the far-right internet.
In emails to the university office, Haviland allegedly raged that the term “cisgender”—a term describing people whose gender identify corresponds with the sex they were assigned at birth—was an “insult,” complained that he received “constant abuse” for being white, and called “intersectional” feminism “an evil disease of a movement.”"

John William King, the ringleader of a racist trio who kidnapped a black father of three and dragged him to his death two decades ago in one of the most brutal hate crimes in U.S. history, was executed in Texas on Wednesday night despite a last-minute appeal.
King was pronounced dead shortly after 7:00 p.m., reportedly 12 minutes after receiving a lethal injection. As witnesses exited the building housing the death chamber at Huntsville, about 25 demonstrators outside reportedly let out a cheer .
Clara Byrd Taylor, the sister of King's victim, James Byrd Jr., told reporters in a statement after witnessing the execution that what was done to her brother was a “modern day lynching.”
“[King] wanted to make a name for himself,” Taylor said. “James was his chosen target... and was shown no mercy.”
Taylor also said King showed “no remorse tonight” and “didn't look” at the family after 21 years on death row. She characterized King's demeanor as an “act of defiance.”
“He was proud of what he had done,” she said.
When asked what she had felt when she saw King die, Taylor said she didn't feel anything.
“Can I be honest? I felt nothing,” she said, adding that she was “happy this was over with and this challenge was over.
King did not offer final words from the death chamber but said in a written statement released after the execution, “Capital punishment: them without the capital get the punishment.”
The Supreme Court denied a stay of execution for the 44-year-old about a half hour after he was scheduled to be put to death on Wednesday evening. According to BuzzFeed News , there were noted dissents to the court's decision.
Prison officials said King said next to nothing after being transferred to Huntsville on Wednesday, declining any counseling from the chaplain and opting not to have anyone witness his lethal injection.
The execution was witnessed by relatives of James Byrd Jr. who had to endure three separate murder trials detailing the brutality of the crime. Byrd, who was 49 at the time, was walking home from a friend's anniversary party in June 1998 when three white men—King, Shawn Allen Berry, and Lawrence Russell Brewer—kidnapped him in Jasper, Texas.
The men then took Byrd to an isolated road, chained him by his ankles, and attached him to the back of a pickup truck. They then drove the pickup truck almost three miles, dismembering Byrd in the process. They left parts of Byrd's body in front of a local black cemetery, and the rest of him was found about a mile and a half up the road.
All three men have since been convicted in Byrd's death. Brewer was executed in 2011, while Berry is eligible for parole in 2038. King—who sported white supremacist tattoos on his body, including one of a black man hanging from a tree—tried to file a series of unsuccessful appeals to avoid being put to death in recent years.
Byrd's brother, Louvon Byrd, watched Brewer's execution and told The Daily Beast that he would witness King's death by lethal injection.
“...he did live 20 years longer than my brother… and I think that speaks a lot,” Louvon told The Daily Beast. “The punishment would be just to take an injection and go to sleep, and even at that I still think he’s getting off easy.” READ THIS LIST "
Maryland Millionaire Daniel Beckwitt Found Guilty of Murder in 2017 Death of Man Who Helped Dig Bunker Tunnels,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/maryland-millionaire-daniel-beckwitt-found-guilty-of-murder-in-2017-death-of-man-hired-to-dig-tunnels-for-his-secret-bunker,"Travel DEADLY FEARS Maryland Millionaire Daniel Beckwitt Found Guilty of Murder in 2017 Death of Man Who Helped Dig Bunker Tunnels Askia Khafra died in 2017 while working on tunnels for a secret bunker in Daniel Beckwitt’s Bethesda home, which prosecutors called a ‘death trap.’ 04.24.19 7:26 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Montgomery County Police Department
A Maryland millionaire was found guilty of murder Wednesday night in connection with a 2017 fire on his property that killed a 21-year-old man who was helping him dig tunnels for his underground bunker.
Daniel Beckwitt, a 27-year-old stock broker, was charged in September 2017 with “depraved heart” second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the death of 21-year-old Askia Khafra, who was working underground when the fatal fire broke out.
Prosecutors argued that while Beckwitt did not cause the fire, the “death-trap” conditions in his trash-infested Bethesda home dangerously sacrificed safety for his own sense of security, ultimately preventing Khafra from escaping in time to survive the flames.
“This is not an intentional murder,” Montgomery County prosecutor Marybeth Ayres said in her closing arguments on Tuesday, adding that Beckwitt was able to escape the home and call the police. “This was a survivable fire.”
The verdict comes after a 10-day trial in Montgomery County Circuit Court, where jurors had to decide whether the death was an accident or a crime prompted by Beckwitt’s hoarding and the extreme lengths he went to in order to ensure that his bunker—which he was building in case of a nuclear missile strike by North Korea—remained a secret. Beckwitt declined to testify in the trial.
Defense attorney Robert Bonsib, describing his millionaire client as a “very strange young man,” argued on Tuesday that the fire was merely a horrible accident and Khafra’s death was a “mystery without an answer.”
“Being different, living in a different circumstance, is not a crime,” Bonsib said in court. “An accident is not a crime.”
On Sept. 10, firefighters found Khafra’s naked, charred body steps from a hole in the concrete floor of Beckwitt’s basement, which leads to a series of tunnels about 20 feet deep. Authorities later confirmed he was killed by smoke inhalation and thermal injuries, and his death was later ruled a homicide.
Inside Beckwitt’s house, police found “immense piles of garbage and discarded items strewn throughout the entire home” and “narrow maze-like pathways” that made moving within the single-family home difficult.
The 200-foot tunnel system beneath the basement was powered with a “daisy chain” of electrical power cords. At trial, prosecutors said that Beckwitt knew this dangerous system, coupled with the hoarding conditions upstairs, increased the “likelihood of a fire breaking out”—but he prioritized secrecy over his employee’s safety.
On the day of the fire, Khafra allegedly texted Beckwitt about a “smokey” smell inside the tunnels. Six hours later, the stock trader told Khafra that there had been a “major electrical failure” underground, but not to worry because he “just switched it all over to another circuit,” Ayres said. Authorities ultimately found no evidence that another circuit existed in the house.
Bonsib argued that while Beckwitt’s project was “weird,” the tunnels were not dangerous and were not created to do anything other than protect his client from a possible apocalypse.
“They may be weird. They may look weird. But they were solid as a rock and they were a safe environment,” he said.
One of Beckwitt’s former employees, 23-year-old Douglas Hart, last week said the tunnels were not “pristine and clean,” but he felt they weren’t dangerous as there was a clear path to the bunker, which was equipped with a small refrigerator, television, WiFi, and microwave.
“I thought he was really smart and interesting,” Hart said . “I really thought he was one of the smartest people I had ever spoken to. I had an interest in being his friend.”
Beckwitt is a skilled computer hacker who has a deep fear of a possible nuclear attack by North Korea, and even spoke at a hacker convention under the name “3AlarmLampscooter” to encourage others to take similar safety precautions, prosecutors said.
In an attempt to hide his project, Beckwitt engaged in other “extreme risk-taking behavior,” prosecutors alleged during the trial, like tricking Khafra into thinking the tunnels were in Virginia instead of Maryland, forcing the 21-year-old to wear “darkened, black-out glasses that prevented [him] from seeing where they were going,” and using internet “spoofing” to make it look like they were in a different location.
But the defense argued Khafra, who met Beckwitt online, was a willing participant in the tunnel’s construction. The millionaire invested money in Khafra’s company in 2016, and in turn, Khafra was helping Beckwitt dig the tunnels on the side, often working in underground for “days at a time.”
In court, Bonsib showed selfies Khafra took while working in the tunnels. “Dude can I please work,” he wrote to Beckwitt in one message."
Border Militias Use Facebook Live to Turn Immigrant Confrontations Into ‘Reality TV’,www.thedailybeast.com,William.Sommer@thedailybeast.com (Will Sommer),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/border-militias-use-facebook-live-to-turn-immigrant-confrontations-into-reality-tv,"RIGHT RICHTER Border Militias Use Facebook Live to Turn Immigrant Confrontations Into ‘Reality TV’ -Militias like the United Constitutional Patriots win new followers through Facebook livestreams.

Militias and other vigilante groups chasing immigrants on the southern border are able to broadcast their activities and gain new supporters thanks to Facebook’s live video feature. So far, the social media giant hasn’t done anything about it.
Last week, livestreamed Facebook video of a United Constitutional Patriots , a militia group in New Mexico, falsely identifying themselves as law enforcement to a group of immigrants and detaining them went viral. While the video eventually prompted a backlash against the group, it was initially filmed for the group’s more than 5,000 Facebook fans, who thrilled as members of the militia ordered migrants around, apparently illegally.
The group’s leader has since been arrested on gun charges. But United Constitutional Patriots and the people who shot the immigrant videos are still on Facebook, where they can use Facebook Live to broadcast future border activities against migrants and gain even more attention.
The United Constitutional Patriots aren’t the only border group using Facebook to draw in fans. “AZ Patriots,” an Arizona group devoted to confronting migrants, also livestreams its attempts to catch immigrants on Facebook. In one video that’s still live on Facebook, the group’s members are shown questioning migrants at the border.
Livestreaming on Facebook is key for border vigilantes looking to raise funds and recruit news supporters, according to Heidi Beirich, the head of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project. The live video lets them show supporters that they’re actually doing the activities they say they are.
“It lets someone be part of the reality TV action,” Beirich said. Want this in your inbox? Subscribe to Right Richter here.
Facebook livestreaming became a large part of the militia movement after different militia activists met during the 2014 Bundy Ranch standoff, according to John Temple, the author of an upcoming book on the Bundy incident. Militia activists started livestreaming various meetings and court hearings on Facebook, drawing in more members.
“They began livestreaming a lot in the subsequent years, because so many people met each other at that first standoff, and all these networks sort of formed,” Temple said.
Facebook Live has been fueling border militia activity since at least last year, when “Veterans on Patrol” — an Arizona group led by a QAnon believer — claimed that they’d discovered a Pizzagate-style sex trafficking camp in the Tucson area. The site was clearly just a homeless camp, but that didn’t stop Veterans on Patrol from attracting on “patrols” through the desert, where they allegedly repeatedly trespassed on private property. The Facebook Live footage was later used in court against one of the group’s leaders.
Asked why militias like United Constitutional Patriots are still allowed to broadcast their activities on Facebook Live, Facebook said only that they will shut down any fundraisers on the site that involve weapons.
“People cannot use our fundraising tools for activities involving weapons,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. “We will remove fundraisers this group may try to start on our service and any content that violates our Community Standards.”
As it turns out, though, Facebook doesn’t take that strong a stance against the militia groups fundraising. As of Wednesday, one of United Constitutional Patriots’ top posts is a fundraising link meant to raise money to keep the militia going on the border.

Trump’s Source on Fake Story That Britain Spied on Campaign: There’s a Conspiracy to Frame Me as ‘Conspiracy Nut’,www.thedailybeast.com,nico.hines@thedailybeast.com (Nico Hines) jamie.ross@thedailybeast.com (Jamie Ross),04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/larry-c-johnson-trumps-source-on-fake-story-that-britain-spied-on-campaign-says-hes-being-framed-him-as-conspiracy-nut,"04.24.19 4:52 PM ET Chip Somodevilla/Getty
LONDON—The source of President Trump’s false claim that British intelligence agents spied on his presidential campaign says there is a widespread conspiracy to frame him as a “conspiracy nut.”
Trump quoted former CIA analyst Larry C. Johnson on Wednesday after Johnson appeared on the right-wing One America News Network to repeat incendiary and totally unproven claims that America’s closest intelligence ally was used by President Obama to surveil his successor during the 2016 campaign.
Johnson’s claims first hit the mainstream in 2017, when Judge Andrew Napolitano repeated his theory on Fox & Friends. Fox had taken a claim from Johnson—who says he was banned from appearing on Fox News himself—that was first shared on an internet forum and Russia’s RT network and pushed it into the mainstream.
By the end of the week, Trump’s spokesman Sean Spicer had repeated the claims from the White House podium and a full-scale diplomatic incident was underway.
GCHQ (Britain’s equivalent to the NSA) issued a denial of unprecedented force. Britain’s intel agencies hardly ever issue public statements, certainly not ones that slapdown the White House. “Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct ‘wiretapping’ against the then president elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored,” the agency said.
Fox News issued a clarification that their reporting did not support the allegation, and Napolitano was briefly suspended from the air . After heavy pushback from London, Trump tried to distance himself from the claims —but he later Tweeted that Obama had tapped his phone.
On Wednesday, he tweeted:
GCHQ declined to respond this time, citing previous efforts to shut down the theory that the Obama Administration had asked Britain to spy on the Trump campaign in order to get around U.S. laws on wiretapping American citizens.
A government minister lamented to The Daily Beast: “If only the U.K. was that organized…”
It’s hard to say how much Trump would have remembered from the previous diplomatic blow-up, but he was now pushing a story deemed too extreme for Fox News.
Johnson told The Daily Beast that Fox News was part of the cover-up.
He claimed that he had been “fired” by former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes after speaking out against the war in Iraq, and that the network only disavowed the British spy story because Rupert Murdoch wanted to suck up to the British government.
Asked why that would have been Fox News’s priority, Johnson told The Daily Beast; “Dude, really sorry but that question is too stupid to even answer … If you recall the Murdochs were involved with negotiations with trying to buy some media assets in the U.K.”
Johnson refused to divulge any information on the source of his insight into transatlantic espionage beyond citing “friends in the intel community,” who he says told him that the Brits focused on electronic intercepts but also used MI6 assets to approach members of the Trump campaign.
“I'm not going to go any farther than that. I've been fucking burned by too many journalists already,” he said. “I mean you know I fully expect—don't take this personal—but I fully expect you to cast this as I'm some nut or I'm some extreme fringe guy.”
Johnson encounters no such problems on RT and OAN.
He said RT, which is funded by the Russian government, was one of the only reliable news outlets. “The Western media reminds me of Pravda during the height of the Cold War,” he said.
It’s not just the mainstream media that Johnson believes are out to get him. He said right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh had falsely accused him of pushing the Obama birther conspiracy and said that left-wing media monitoring site Media Matters had constructed an elaborate hoax with Sidney Blumenthal in order to frame him for pushing the false rumor that there was a video that showed Michelle Obama dismissing white people as “whitey.” “I’m not commenting on conspiracy theories,” Blumenthal told The Daily Beast.
Trump seizing on the GCHQ theory is not the first time he’s infuriated the British with his willingness to amplify stories from the fringes of the internet. In 2017, the British prime minister, Theresa May, directly criticized Trump for sharing a fake video purporting to show violent Muslims that had been posted by the far-right street organization Britain First . “It is wrong for the president to have done this,” she said.
Trump’s latest controversial tweet came just 24-hours after it was announced that the Queen would host the president for a State visit to Britain in June.
British politicians from across the political spectrum have called for the visit to be cancelled.
“The special relationship between the U.K. and USA is a cornerstone of our defence and the bonds of friendship between our two countries are unshakeable,” Labour lawmaker Wes Streeting told The Daily Beast. “President Trump, however, has demonstrated time and again that he is no friend of the U.K - from his attacks on the Mayor of London following a terrorist attack on our city through to his sharing of far right propaganda. He does not deserve the honour of a state visit.”"

A mother of seven pleaded guilty Monday in Wisconsin to disseminating information online on how to construct explosives and biological weapons—part of a plot to wage terrorist attacks at the behest of ISIS, the Associated Press reports. Prosecutors initially charged Waheba Issa Dais, 46, with two counts of providing material support to terrorists but later dropped one of the charges to elicit a guilty plea. Dais reportedly talked with purported members of ISIS about the possible attacks, tried to recruit others to go through with the attacks, and gave them information on how to make explosives and poisons, court documents show. “Nobody will ever know what all she could’ve inspired,” said U.S. Attorney Matthew Krueger, who serves in the Eastern District of Wisconsin.

But don’t expect ‘Ink’ to put the media tycoon’s morals and use of power on trial. 04.24.19 9:00 PM ET Courtesy Joan Marcus
It is not as grotesquely majestic as the pile of mannequins-as-dead-bodies in Taylor Mac’s Gary , but Bunny Christie’s duskily lit, toppling towers of newspapers and filing cabinets in Ink is another design marvel of this Broadway season.
Throughout this Manhattan Theatre Club production, which opens tonight at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre (to June 23) , journalists clamber up into little dug-out warrens to type. The desks are old and scuffed, the newspapers yellowed. Ink evokes a lost moment in media time, a time when print was king.
If James Graham’s uneven, intriguing play—with two excellent performances by Jonny Lee Miller and Bertie Carvel—has a romance around it, of this time of “hot metal,” it also seeks to impose a measured, piquant view upon its own sepia frame.
This is the story of how Rupert Murdoch (Carvel) bought The Sun in 1969, the British tabloid which not only redefined newspapers but also became both shaper and kingmaker of British politics and pop culture. (Full disclosure: I worked for Murdoch’s The Times of London for a number of years.)
The period that the play covers is The Sun ’s infant years, long before Murdoch as media sun king, long before phone hacking , long before Thatcherism and Trump , and long before the paper’s own conservatism, homophobia, racism, and AIDS-fearmongering had bloomed.
The first surprise is that this play is more celebration than moral inquisition. It doesn’t put Murdoch on trial for the things he is most condemned for now; it is a mainly sympathetic origin story.
The play does, however, interrogate the inherent sexism of Page 3 , The Sun ’s most famous feature—a daily picture of a topless woman on the paper’s third page, only in recent years expunged , after decades of campaigning against it.
The most significant prop in Ink is the graph showing the gap between the sales of the then-market leader, the Daily Mirror , and The Sun , which the Mirror ’s boss, Hugh Cudlipp (Michael Siberry), sold to Murdoch. The Mirror begins the play millions of copies ahead; Murdoch challenges his choice of editor, Larry Lamb (Miller), to beat it within a year.
The best parts of the play focus on their interactions; Lamb, bluff and direct, Murdoch more sly and obtuse; both joined by a desire to thrash the opposition and shake things up.
The first half of Ink is romp-ish; a kind of “making the band” as Lamb assembles his troupe of launch issue journalists, like his deputy editor Bernard Shrimsley (Robert Stanton), who confesses to a love of Emile Zola, and Joyce Hopkirk (Tara Summers), the women’s editor, who introduces the mainly-men to the idea of female desire.
Carvel—last seen on Broadway as the terrifying Mrs Trunchbull in Matilda —does not play Murdoch as particularly Machiavellian, but as a willful disruptor of established order. The Sun is presented as a vehicle of liberation-via-titillation, with a masthead that Lamb wants to literally lean into the future. A riotous party sequence of confetti and dancing accompanies the launch of the paper, with a cavalcade of crazy headlines. The Sun , at its birth, was fresh and new. “Power replaces power with itself. You can either stand on the other side of the window, tap, tap, tap, asking to come in. Or you can establish a new line of ascension.”
The audience in 2019 knows a very different Sun , and that presumably informs the play's more overwrought second half, constructed around two early Sun flashpoints.
The first is Page 3 itself, and an imagined confrontation between Stephanie Rahn, the first Page 3 girl (Rana Roy) and Lamb. Would he like his daughter to pose in this way, she asks. The confrontation is a shaming exercise, and quite right too; Page 3 was a hoary anachronism. But it also powered The Sun past the Mirror to deliver Lamb and Murdoch their much-desired victory over the Mirror ; and also is one of the most iconic Fleet Street icons of all time. It drew readers and notoriety. Say ‘ The Sun ’ to people, and ‘Page 3’ will likely come as a reflex response.
Fascinating as it is, this confrontation between young model and editor is also completely implausible, and an extended piece of liberal wish-fulfillment for audiences in 2019. The Sun didn't regret Page 3, it didn't apologize for it. It profited it from it for years, and sneered at its critics.
The second major story the play mines is the kidnapping of Muriel McKay (Tara Summers), the wife of The Sun ’s deputy chairman Alick McKay (Colin McPhillamy). The kidnappers believed they had taken Murdoch’s then-wife Anna hostage, and would eventually kill Muriel, but not before The Sun itself had reported on every twist and turn of the drama.
The play interrogates Lamb’s hardline dedication to doing so—and by extension the ruthless, story-at-all-costs modus operandi of all tabloids. Again, this is a puzzling focus, and adds another structural instability to the play itself, which up to this point has not focused on Alick McKay or his wife—so why should we care?
Again, the Sun's modus operandi was to pursue its targets ruthlessly. That didn't change in any way after the kidnapping and murder of Muriel McKay.
In both Page 3 and McKay scenarios, the story is told, the criticism made of how the Sun has behaved, and then that's that. Lamb carries on with producing his tabloid. These are presented as telling moral quandaries, but come across as more convenient plot padding. The subsidiary characters (some with very odd British accents) fade into the background.
Miller is excellent as Lamb, especially as he goes from genial boss to a figure of icier dominance.
Carvel gives Murdoch the faintest of Australian twangs, and the sense that his menace and command is quieter than the braying lieutenants that have run his tabloid newsrooms. He has an arrogance, a sense of superiority. Global domination was always his plan, Carvel’s character suggests. Just wait for the audible audience groan in 2019 when Carvel-as-Murdoch mulls the possibility of owning a New York newspaper and a TV station. “Just wait for the audible audience groan in 2019 when Carvel-as-Murdoch mulls the possibility of owning a New York newspaper and a TV station.”
Murdoch tells Lamb: “Power replaces power with itself. You can either stand on the other side of the window, tap, tap, tap, asking to come in. Or you can establish a new line of ascension.” This is what Ink shows: the seeds that turned Murdoch into an international political and cultural power player, courted and feared by prime ministers and presidents.
Ink is squarely a play of the past, and it is at its best celebrating the giddiness of The Sun ’s birth, a long time before that giddiness turned to something much darker—and which audiences in America, who may know little about The Sun , will remain ignorant of. Ink ’smost stunning scene is a sudden segue to ballet, showing the old process of story emerging from reporter’s typewriter to its incarnation on the page, encompassing copy boys, stone presses, the printers, the proofs, and yes, that hot metal.
At another graphic moment, Lamb ends up covered in newsprint. It looks like an anointing with the dirtiest blood. READ THIS LIST"
Joe Biden’s Big 2020 Advantage: He Has the Obama Email List,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick) sam.stein@thedailybeast.com (Sam Stein),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-bidens-big-2020-campaign-advantage-he-has-the-obama-email-list,"04.24.19 9:00 PM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
As Joe Biden gets ready to launch his third run for the presidency, he brings with him one of the most valuable pieces of infrastructure in all of politics: the Obama-Biden 2012 campaign email list.
On Tuesday, Biden ’s American Possibilities PAC sent an email to supporters asking them to sign up to be the first to know what Biden had in store in the coming days. A number of recipients told The Daily Beast they hadn’t registered for updates from the PAC but had put their email addresses on the Obama list. On Wednesday, a spokesperson for Biden confirmed to The Daily Beast that American Possibilities had the list at its disposal.
That Biden would utilize the list is hardly a surprise. It is one of the largest in politics and had reportedly helped raise more than $500 million for the Obama-Biden campaign in 2012. As part of that ticket, the former VP has a claim to it, giving him access to a base of potential grassroots supporters at a time when other Democrats in the race—including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX)—were building large networks of their own.
This would be a particular help to Biden, who has never been a prodigious money-raiser and recently said that he “will not be part of a Super PAC.”
It also fit into a tactic he has deployed in the lead-up to his formal campaign announcement. More than any other Democrat in the race or thinking of entering it, Biden has aligned himself with the Obama years . He has referred to himself as an “Obama-Biden Democrat,” leaned on his two-terms as the top sidekick for the nation’s first African-American president, and used that record to gloss over prior decades of legislative history that are not quite as palatable in the modern Democratic party.
Operatives say it’s logical, since most voters recognize him best as Obama’s veep, and also strategically sound.
“It is a lane to compete for,” said Ben LaBolt, the Obama-Biden campaign press secretary in 2012. “[T]alking about expanding upon strengthening health care, making the economy work for families regardless of their income level, returning to a government of dignity and normalcy, restoring alliances abroad, that would be an attractive message for a lot of voters.”
But LaBolt and others say there’s no guarantee that Biden’s ties to Obama assure that he’ll win over that “lane” of voters nostalgic for the last administration. Harris, for starters, was an early Obama supporter. And Buttigieg has elicited comparisons to Obama for his campaigning style and was touted by the former president as a future leader of the party—a designation that, according to an Obama aide, came after the mayor partnered with the Obama administration on the My Brother’s Keeper initiative and campaigns for infrastructure investment.
Those two candidates have also attracted a number of Obama bundlers—a front on which Biden should compete as well. The ex-vice president has amassed a network of deep-pocketed supporters throughout his decades in public service and he is already leaning on them to assist with his campaign.
Former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, who is involved in an upcoming fundraiser for Biden in Philadelphia, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday that the interest in attending was so overwhelming that he fielded a call from someone complaining that they couldn’t get in.
“I’ve been raising money since 1977,” Rendell said. “And I’ve never had anybody complain about not getting an invitation to a fundraiser. That shows you the depth of enthusiasm, the depth of relationships that the vice president has built over the years.”
And on Wednesday afternoon, Biden himself jumped on a conference call with donors during which he implored them to help him post a major fundraising total during the first 24 hours of his campaign launch. One participant in the call said Biden wasn’t pretending he could surpass the hauls pulled in by Sanders and O’Rourke, but that they “needed to be respectable.”
Biden’s access to the 2012 list could help with that effort, providing him inroads to the constellation of Obama voters and small dollar donors that his competitors lack. But digital strategists have questions about how effective the list will ultimately prove to be. Though there were reportedly 13 million names on it in 2009, no one is quite sure how many remain. A source close to Biden sought to downplay the perception that it would be a massive difference-maker, since a significant number of the contacts are likely faulty or dated. And many of the people who signed on in the first place likely did so because of their affinity to Obama.
“[Having the list] is certainly helpful,” said Jen Palmieri, Obama’s former communications director. “I don’t know if it is a golden ticket.”
Though the Biden presidential campaign hasn’t formally launched, the expectation is it will acquire the list from American Possibilities by some sort of transfer or swap arrangement (an exchange of email lists). The cost, if any, will be minimal, though operating a list of that size can be pricey. According to FEC filings , American Possibilities didn’t pay for the list, meaning that it was likely transferred without cost. But it has paid significant sums—some related to the list—for email services, digital consulting and internet advertisements to the firm Blue State Digital, which worked on both Obama-Biden campaigns.
One thing is certain,Team Biden will know the true value of the campaign-me-down soon. The first test of the mega-list should come within the first 24 hours of his campaign launch, which is expected to take place on Thursday morning."

If you know me, then you know that I’m a proud New Yorker and it really pains me to admit this but Chicago’s hot dogs are better than ours.
In fact, New York’s hot dogs bite.
Before dirty water defenders unleash a Sabrett-infused tsunami, let me qualify my statement. It’s not that the Big Apple doesn’t have decent dogs, or that the simple joy of occasionally indulging in a mediocre New York food tradition is lost on me, but if you pit these hot dog icons against each other, it’s no contest: Chicago is the obvious winner.
I can hear the knee-jerk howls. “What about Katz’s? Crif Dogs? Dickson’s?” Yeah, yeah, yeah. Please, show me a New York best-of list with a hot dog place I haven’t hit and I’ll hotwire the Wienermobile faster than you can say, “I wish I were an Oscar Mayer Wiener.”
Let me break down my argument for you and compare these heavyweight hot dog cities in a few essential categories: the bun, the link, and the toppings. You just might change your mind. THE BUN
In New York, the bun is an afterthought, a disrespected conveyance vehicle. It’s typically stale, eats like a cat’s tongue, and you’ll sit pretty if halfway through it doesn’t disintegrate. It’s toasted on a grill or a griddle, adding modest warmth (if you’re lucky) and rigidity but little more in the way of structural integrity or flexibility. At best , you feel like you’re eating old, lukewarm toast.
Meanwhile, in Chicago you almost always get a steamed poppy seed bun. No, the seeds don’t add flavor or texture, and they can get stuck in your teeth, which can be a pain. But they look nice on the bun. And given that the seeds will be spotted while you’re smiling because of how good your Chicago hot dog tastes, you’ll likely be forgiven. The bun is pillowy but pliable, carries the weight of the link ( and the plentiful toppings), and has been rejuvenated so as to recapture a hint of that universe-affirming breath of life you experience with freshly baked bread. If the merit of that is lost on you, nothing will save you. THE LINK
In New York, a sausage typically means Sabrett courtesy of Marathon Enterprises (which, when I last checked, supplies Papaya King and Gray’s Papaya), Nathan’s, and Hebrew National. No matter who makes them they’re usually all-beef dogs in sheepskin casings. And that’s not to mention 100-year-old seasoning recipes from the likes of Nathan Handwerker ’s wife Ida.
Whatever romantic notions you may have about these dogs, once prepared, the best-case scenario is that they’re slightly griddled. What’s more likely is that they’ve been sitting in hot (lukewarm, let’s be honest) water, and are as a result, almost without exception, floppy and snapless.
In Chicago, the default dog is made by Vienna Beef. They’re 75-percent ground domestic bull, 25-percent brisket and belly trimmings flavored with garlic juice and paprika, and sheathed in natural sheep casing. These Midwestern dogs are wide, beefy, and juicy. And whether they’re steamed, split, griddled, or grilled, which they’re thankfully done well at icons and average spots, they snap. Need I say more? No, I didn’t think so. THE TOPPINGS
On hot dogs in New York you usually go simple; mustard or (if you’re a monster) ketchup— as Dirty Harry says , “Nobody puts ketchup on a hot dog.” And there is also a long history of New Yorkers topping their franks with some combination of relish: kraut; the vinegary, tomato-paste based onion sauce (whose history is more interesting than its flavor); or, bewilderingly, Loeb’s Onion Crunch. There’s nothing wrong with a kraut-and-mustard dog. Sour, tangy, sweet, and spicy—it’s a classic, tasty flavor profile. If you’re a kraut fan that pile is usually big, and it’s incredibly one-note flavor all but drowns out the dog. With mustard, you’re barely left with much hot dog flavor other than salt. I can only shrug at onion water and onion crunch.
In Chicago, your Vienna Beef link is “dragged through the garden” and topped with the “Magnificent (or Chicago) Seven”: yellow mustard, chopped white onions, bright green sweet pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices (or wedges), pickled sport peppers, and a dash of celery. It’s sweet, tangy, zesty, juicy, salty, and spicy. Is this pile overcompensation for some kind of deficiency? I don’t think so. HOT DOG CULTURE
And don’t try to cite national recognition or historificate at me. I don’t care if Nathan’s is America’s most famous, or who invented the hot dog. Argue away about whether sausages were first paired with milk bread by Charles Feltman in Coney Island in 1867 or Anton Feuchtwanger in his white gloves at the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904.
I can happily play the game, too, and note that some claim the combination was first served at Chicago’s Columbian Exposition of 1893, the exact year that Vienna Beef was founded by Austrian-Hungarian immigrants Emil Reichel and Sam Ladany. I’m not even going to mention Abe Drexler ’s contributions to hot dog eating or speculate on the early 20th century origins of Chicago’s iconic toppings combination.
Contrary to what we may like to think, history does happen outside New York, and frankly, that’s a red (hot) herring in a conversation about flavor and quality. “Coney Island!” you shout. Yes, the July Fourth hot-dog eating contest is a thing of beauty and wonder. Preach. That doesn’t make a New York hot dog better. THE CONCLUSION
Do you disagree? Have you actually eaten any New York hot dogs, lately? To put my hot dog, er… money where my mouth is, I recently revisited the classic New York joints so as not to speak from memory, including the Papaya King at the edge of the East Village and Gray’s Papaya uptown. I even willingly suffered eating at a Times Square cart and made the two-hour round-trip on the N train to Surf Avenue to revisit Nathan’s flagship. (Previously, I checked out four dozen Chicago spots while compiling a list of the city’s best hot dogs for The Daily Meal .)
Guys, I’m glad these Big Apple places are still alive and well—they make up the fabric of the city that I love. And I certainly appreciate their appeal. But we need to admit that they’re certainly not better than any of the famous Chicago stands.
I rest my case.
Still unconvinced? At least, we can agree that New York makes superior pizza . READ THIS LIST"
Meet the 19-Year-Old Wunderkind Director Stunning the Tribeca Film Festival,www.thedailybeast.com,kevin.fallon@thedailybeast.com (Kevin Fallon),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/burning-cane-meet-the-tribeca-film-festivals-youngest-director-ever-19-year-old-phillip-youmans,"WUNDERKIND Meet the 19-Year-Old Wunderkind Director Stunning the Tribeca Film Festival In between studying for finals, 19-year-old NYU freshman Phillip Youmans will premiere his debut feature at the Tribeca Film Festival, the youngest filmmaker ever to do so. 04.25.19 5:18 AM ET Courtesy Denzian Pictures
In the festival’s 18-year history, it’s something the Tribeca Film Festival programmers and planners have never had to consider. The awards ceremony and most of the events thrown for filmmakers are typically sponsored by liquor companies, and are 21-and-over. This year, however, one of their marquee competitors is underage. “We were like, hmm, do you think he has a fake ID?” one of the festival’s programmers joked to me. “ Obviously, we did not ask him that.”
It’s not entirely out of the question. Phillip Youmans, whose film Burning Cane premieres at the festival Thursday, is a freshman at New York University. At 19, he is the youngest filmmaker ever accepted to compete in the Tribeca Film Festival .
He wrote and directed the film, which will vie for the Founders Award in the U.S. Narrative Competition. In recent years, the section included critically hailed indies like Reed Morano’s Meadowland , Ingrid Jungermann’s Women Who Kill , and Nia DaCosta’s Little Woods , which opened in theaters last weekend.

In what would become the repeated choreography and chorus of our conversation when we meet, he shakes his head in disbelief, squirms in his seat, and flashes his broad, youthful smile when I ask how he feels about it all. “It’s so dope, dude.” He runs his fingers through his hair. “It’s totally surreal.”
I’m only the second member of the press he’s ever talked to. When we finish our interview, he has to head back downtown to the NYU campus. He has a Writing the Essay class at 5 p.m., followed by Storytelling Strategies after that. At some point, he needs to study, too.
The festival ends May 5. If Youmans happens to win a prize, the celebration will be brief. There’s only a week left in the semester after that. From Tribeca, he’ll head into freshman year finals.
Youmans is part of an impressive Tribeca class. It’s the most inclusive slate of directors in the festival’s history. Forty percent of the festival’s 103 features are directed by women, and 50 percent of the competition films are. Almost 30 percent are directed by people of color, and nearly 15 percent by people who identify as LGBTQIA.
Even with esteemed filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola , Werner Herzog , and Rob Reiner taking part in this year’s festival, it’s Youmans whose name keeps coming up as one of the biggest draws. At a press luncheon celebrating the opening of this year’s program, Jane Rosenthal, who co-founded the festival in 2002 with Robert DeNiro , singled out Burning Cane as the competition film everyone in attendance should see.
After Youmans was accepted into this year’s lineup, Rosenthal invited him to a meeting at her office. Like any proper film school student—or, let’s face it, 19-year-old male in their freshman year at college—the walls at Youmans’ dorm room in the East Village are wallpapered with the posters for Taxi Driver and Goodfellas . DeNiro and Martin Scorsese will be interviewing each other at a special event at the festival, and Rosenthal promised that she’d introduce Youmans to them. She even sent Scorsese a screening link to his film.
She promised an intro to Francis Ford Coppola at a screening of a new cut of Apocalypse Now , too. “It’s so insane,” he says, beaming.
Youmans grew up in New Orleans’ Seventh Ward. “If you start in the French Quarter and go up towards the lake, it’s around there,” he says. He and his sister were raised by his mother, who transplanted to New Orleans from Lowcountry South Carolina. He went to a French immersion elementary school, and then high school at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts.
At around 12 years old, he started taking acting classes, and eventually started auditioning for and booking small roles in projects that shot locally around New Orleans. He was an extra in 2014’s Sex Ed , starring Haley Joel Osment, and had a small speaking role in 2015’s American Hero . On set, he found himself more interested in the conversations that the director and the DP were having than where his mark was supposed to be. From that point on, at age 14, he began making his own shorts.
His upbringing was rooted in the Baptist church, which inspired Burning Cane. His mother would take him every Sunday. During summers at his grandmother’s house in South Carolina, where she was the accountant at her town’s church, he would go almost every day.
Burning Cane is set in rural Louisiana, where cane fields backdrop the devastating tension between religion and family as an aging mother contends with her values and a grown son whose alcoholism and vices are overtaking his life. Wendell Pierce ( The Wire ) plays her conflicted preacher, a commandeering and leading presence in the community, but whose own alcoholism consumes him.
“I knew I wanted to touch on a lot of conversations and debates I was having within myself in the church and stuff that I had kind of always been going back and forth about throughout my whole upbringing,” Youmans says. “I’ve always been able to recognize why it’s powerful in terms of community building, but I’ve also always been able to realize that there’s a lot about the doctrine and what’s being preached that doesn’t speak to the sentiment of a lot of people who are attending church. A lot of it can be destructive.” “Even with esteemed filmmakers and big names like Francis Ford Coppola, Werner Herzog, and Rob Reiner taking part in this year’s festival, it’s Youmans whose name keeps coming up as one of the biggest draws.”
Burning Cane began as a short film, titled The Glory , that Youmans began writing when he was 16. Encouraged by one of his teachers, he started writing a feature version of the story. He shot the film near his arts school when he was 17. He edited it when he was 18, and finished the summer after he graduated, a month before heading to NYU.
He started an IndieGogo fundraiser to fund production, supplementing costs with his savings and money he made working at a beignet stand. His mother also donated money to the cause. But things really changed once he caught the attention of Oscar-nominated director Benh Zeitlin ( Beasts of the Southern Wild ), who would eventually become an executive producer.
After wrapping principal photography, Youmans cut a miniature trailer and sent it via direct message on Instagram to Zeitlin, who had an arts non-profit called Court 13 Arts that included a mentorship program for young filmmakers—but whom Youmans didn’t know personally.
By a miracle, Zeitlin watched it, and was immediately taken with it. He took Youmans under his wing, helped him secure a cash grant that would allow him to license music and set him up with an editing suite, where they would sit for hours together combing through the footage.
Zeitlin had no idea how young Youmans was when he watched the video he had sent over Instagram.
“What’s amazing both for his age, but for anybody, is that his work is totally not derivative of anything,” Zeitlin says. “Especially for someone coming up that young, you meet lots of filmmakers who are huge film fans and want to be Quentin Tarantino or want to be Martin Scorsese, but Phillip is drawing his own vernacular that seems to come from him completely magically.”
He was struck not only by Youmans’ raw talent, but how he engaged with the world. “I’ve also always been able to realize that there’s a lot about the doctrine and what’s being preached that doesn’t speak to the sentiment of a lot of people who are attending church.” — Phillip Youmans
“There’s a complete fluidity between his questions about film and his questions about, like, life,” he says. One question will be about whether a voiceover works in a particular scene, closely followed by whether Zeitlin thinks love lasts. “I think it’s emblematic of someone whose life and the way they express themselves with art are inextricably connected.”
Youmans submitted a five-minute version of Burning Cane , a character study called The Reverend that focused on Pierce’s character, with all of his film school applications. Ultimately he chose NYU because of a lifelong calling he felt to New York City.
He was in a recitation for a psych class when he checked his phone and saw the email that he had gotten into the Tribeca Film Festival. He ran to the bathroom and called his mother and texted Pierce. Then—he laughs even just remembering it—he had to go to back to class.
A question about what he does for fun as a freshman at NYU quickly turns to talk about more work—and some unintentional name dropping. He’s not much of a partier, he says. He’s been to one party, but it wasn’t in a dorm. “It was actually a frat party,” he says, laughing. “Maybe that’s why.”
He spends most of his free time working on extra-curricular film projects. He’s in post-production on his first short doc in collaboration with musician Jon Batiste, and also for a short narrative film he’s making for Solange ’s brand, Saint Heron.
“It’s dope. Dude, it’s crazy,” Youmans marvels over the fact that he is even mentioning the name Solange in our interview. “I really dig how unapologetically black everything she does is. I just feel fortunate really to have even fell into that situation, because I feel like it really aligns with my vision to tell black stories.”
Zeitlin isn’t surprised that the young filmmaker is finding so much success already. There’s something about the way he thinks that feels both fresh and familiar.
“It’s innovative, but it feels ancient,” Zeitlin says. “It’s not hip, it’s not new, it’s not flashy. It’s at the core of something that is eternal. It’s almost like when you listen to folk music and it’s the same song you’ve heard how many thousands of times, but the way someone plays that song makes it new again. That’s how Phillip’s film seems to me: I know this, but I’ve never seen this.”
A contingent of Youmans estimated to be around 15 strong will join him for Burning Cane’s premiere Thursday. His grandfather, who is also named Phillip Youmans, is particularly excited to see the moniker flashed in the credits of a film playing in a New York City movie theater.
Then again, the shake of the head, the fidgeting, the big sigh and bigger smile: “It so tight, man. Really. It’s insane.” READ THIS LIST"
We Can’t Tell the Difference Between a Robot and Human Voice,www.thedailybeast.com,Benjamin Powers,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/we-cant-tell-the-difference-between-a-robot-and-human-voice,"WHAT’S REAL EVEN We Can’t Tell the Difference Between a Robot and Human Voice A study shows that even when people are told to watch out for digitally altered voices, they can’t detect them. 04.25.19 5:18 AM ET Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/The Daily Beast/Getty
You pick up the phone and hear a voice. It sounds exactly like someone you know and love, perhaps your child or grandchild. They’re asking for money to help get them out of a dicey situation. You have no reason to suspect it’s not them—after all, it’s their voice.
But it’s not them. It’s someone using a digital tool that mimics their voice, built using that person’s vocal data—or small bits of recordings of their voice—to create a voice that sounds remarkably like that of someone you know.
That inability to hear “morphed” voices is because our brains are simply not able to keep up with increasingly sophisticated technology, according to recent research presented by the Internet Society. Evolution has not caught up with the internet revolution.
“The main takeaway is that human brains may not be able to distinguish a speaker’s voice from its morphed version, which means that people would be susceptible to voice impersonation attacks at a fundamental biological level,” Nitesh Saxena, lead researcher on the study and the director of the University of Alabama at Birmingham's Security and Privacy in Emerging Computing and Networking Systems ( SPIES ) Lab, told The Daily Beast.
The researchers used a specialized brain imaging technique utilizing near-infrared light to map and create images of the functions of the brain. The technique, called functional near-infrared spectroscopy, or fNIRS, is similar to an MRI in some ways, but fNIRS allows researchers to study subjects in an environment much closer to real life (participants have to lie down for an MRI, which isn’t how most people go about their days).
Using fNIRS, the researchers examined which parts of the brain were activated, and to what extent, when listening to real versus synthesized voices using a common voice synthesis tool. “The main takeaway is that human brains may not be able to distinguish a speaker’s voice from its morphed version, which means that people would be susceptible to voice impersonation attacks at a fundamental biological level.” — Nitesh Saxena, University of Alabama
Researchers first primed participants to be on the lookout for real and fake entities by exposing them to real and fake websites and forged and legitimate paintings.
The study then unfolded in two parts. First, 20 participants—10 males and 10 females from the University of Alabama at Birmingham—were informed they would hear a real and a morphed voice.
But the fNIRS imaging showed they couldn’t register a difference between the real and synthetic voices, despite being primed to look for a difference with the paintings; even when they were on the lookout, their brains heard the voices the same way.
That could be because of a region within the auditory cortex of our brain, the superior temporal gyrus.
Previous studies have shown that when impaired, this area of the brain drastically affects our ability to recognize voices. In this study, the area was especially confused because of the decision-making it had to do to figure out whether a voice was real or altered.
Saxena believes that the brain builds a model of a speaker’s voice, places it in their memory, and then recalls from that memory to identify the voice.
It’s a struggle many people are beginning to face, as companies have been developing this kind of tech for years.
In the summer of 2018, Google previewed one of its new products, Google Duplex , which enabled Google Assistant to make AI-governed phone calls for users, like set appointments at a salon or reserve a dinner date at a restaurant. Humans on the other end had little to no idea they were talking to a machine, and Google Assistant included nuanced parts of human speech, including placeholder words like “um.”
It wasn’t the first time technology like this had been demoed live. Adobe had previously been working to develop Adobe VoCo , tech that let users edit voices after a certain amount of vocal data had been fed into it. Using a text interface, a user could type in a sentence and Adobe VoCo would synthesize a person’s voice, to make them seem as if they were saying something, when they’d never said it at all.
And as we allow greater numbers of smart speakers such as Amazon Echo and Google Assistant into our homes, they create repositories of our voice data that can be hacked and used to create synthesized versions of our voices.
This study builds on previous research by Saxena and others, which showed that the average rates for rejecting fake voices were between 10 and 20 percent for automated systems. And while humans are better at it compared to automated systems, people only identify a morphed voice on average 50 percent of the time.
One limitation of the study, according to Saxena, is that in real-world voice impersonation attacks, the participants are not explicitly told to identify the real and fake voices, or that there is a fake voice at all.
But that, he points out, could also make the results of the study more troubling, because when people are told to watch out for another voice, they are still bad at identifying an altered voice correctly.
Is there any hope that our brains could get better at determining which voices are altered as they become a more common occurrence?
That’s unlikely, according to Saxena, but there’s hope.
“It may be possible to train the users to explicitly detect morphed voices based on some of the inherent features of these morphed voices,” Saxena said. “Although machine-based voice biometric systems are also susceptible to morphing attacks, it might also be possible to improve such systems to detect morphing attacks which may aid the human users.” READ THIS LIST "

Yep, it’s as bad as you think. opinion Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
Democrat Elijah Cummings chairs the House Oversight Committee, a tough job made tougher by White House stonewalling and by Republicans on the committee trying to torpedo an investigation into prescription drug pricing . Ranking member Jim Jordan of Ohio and his GOP sidekick Mark Meadows sent letters earlier this month to the CEOs of 12 pharmaceutical companies advising them not to cooperate with Cummings’ requests for information, alleging that the chairman would leak the information and tank stock prices.
Jordan and Meadows are the Thelma and Louise of the GOP, driving the party over the cliff. They’ve tried to protect Donald Trump from his former fixer Michael Cohen’s damaging testimony , calling Cohen a liar and echoing White House calls to investigate Hillary Clinton and the origins of the Russia probe. But shielding Big Pharma is another matter. It does not play well with voters, even some Republican ones—something Trump understands, at least rhetorically. He said in his first press conference as president-elect that the drug companies “are getting away with murder,” a charge he periodically repeats to bolster his populist credentials.
He even followed up with a proposal to allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical companies , which it currently cannot do, thanks to the enormous sums of money spent by the drug lobby to protect their profits.
Cummings wants to know why the cost of insulin for diabetics has skyrocketed, and the price of drugs to treat multiple sclerosis are rising much faster than inflation. Drug companies spend twice as much money on marketing as on research, while claiming higher prices are essential to bring new lifesaving drugs to the public.
News stories about people having to ration medication because of the cost, or go without and risk death, are shaming the industry and beginning to penetrate the iron curtain of secrecy around drug pricing.
At any other time perhaps those 12 drug companies would have heeded the Thelma and Louise calls to boycott the oversight committee. But not this time. A senior Democratic committee aide tells The Daily Beast, “All 12 companies committed to complying with the committee’s requests in January, and they have been producing information on a rolling basis, although some are further along than others. After Rep. Jordan sent his letters urging the drug companies not to comply, several expressed surprise and concern, but no company said it would refuse to cooperate, and we continue to expect full compliance going forward.”
The argument that Jordan and Meadows made to the drug companies about how data obtained by the committee would be leaked to embarrass them and potentially sink their stocks is based on their interpretation of how Cummings handled White House whistleblower Tricia Newbold. She testified last month behind closed doors about her concerns that the White House was not following proper procedures in issuing security clearances.
Republicans claimed then that Cummings released sensitive information from that session. Cummings denied these claims, which appear to be unfounded. Yes, he released “cherry-picked excerpts” but no, he didn’t violate national security. “Your efforts to interfere with this investigation represent a new low for a member of this Committee,” Cummings said in his written rebuke to Jordan, the ranking Republican.
Partisan warfare is not uncommon on committees, but no one can recall one party acting so blatantly to undermine a legitimate committee investigation which serves the interests, at least rhetorically, of both parties, and of the American people. “It is one thing to have an honest disagreement about the committee’s policy or approach—which would command respect—but it is quite another to actively obstruct an investigation in the service of placing corporate interests over those of the American people,” Cummings wrote.
Politicians in both parties rely on campaign contributions from drug companies. Otherwise the prohibition on Medicare bargaining for lower prices would have been lifted long ago.
If President Trump can achieve a victory on Medicare pricing that eluded President Obama, it would be the first time the powerful pharmaceutical industry took a hit. And it would signal an important change in Congress, that there is for the first time majority agreement that something needs to be done to restrain the cost of prescription drugs.
Cummings met with Trump in the White House a year ago to talk about curbing drug prices, after which Trump claimed Cummings told him he will go down as one of the great presidents in the history of the country. Not quite, Cummings said in a statement explaining that he predicated his prediction on Trump taking steps “to truly represent all Americans rather than continuing on the divisive and harmful path he is currently on.”
This week, Trump sued Cummings in an attempt to quash a subpoena issued by the Oversight committee to Mazars USA, the accounting firm that Trump has used since the early 1980s to prepare annual financial statements that Michael Cohen said in sworn testimony were falsified to make Trump seem richer than he is, and to secure loans under false pretenses.
The suit, filed in federal district court, is seen by legal experts across the political spectrum as a long shot effort to overturn decades of legal rulings by asserting that Congress can’t probe the executive’s financial dealings unless there is a legislative component. Trump’s attorneys cite an 1880 law as precedent, but that law was overturned in 1927. Congress’ right to investigate has been viewed broadly by the courts. The long-running Whitewater investigation of President Clinton was based on a land deal in Arkansas that pre-dated his presidency.
Cummings said in a statement, “The President has a long history of trying to use baseless lawsuits to attack his adversaries, but there is simply no valid legal basis to interfere with this duly authorized subpoena from Congress.”
There may not be a valid legal basis, but the wheels of justice move slowly, and the goal may be to delay and delay, tactics that stymie the opposition as documents are withheld, executive privilege is claimed, and the clock ticks down to November 2020. READ THIS LIST"
Deported for a Crime He Didn’t Commit—to the Wrong Country,www.thedailybeast.com,Scott.Bixby@thedailybeast.com (Scott Bixby),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/deported-for-a-crime-he-didnt-committo-the-wrong-country,"HOPE DENIED Deported to the Wrong Country—For a Crime He May Not Have Committed ‘The only similarity is the name,’ Ilir Hope’s attorney said, ‘and it’s the most common name in Albania.’ 04.25.19 5:17 AM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Photo Reuters
A longtime legal resident of the United States may have been deported to the wrong country for a crime he didn’t commit—all due to what a foreign court has determined could be a case of mistaken identity.
Ilir Hope, a 52-year-old citizen of Albania and a 16-year lawful permanent resident of the United States, was deported in October 2018 after ICE sought his removal for a decade-old drug trafficking conviction in Italy. But after his deportation to Italy instead of his native Albania, Hope was released from jail—because, it turns out, he may not have committed a crime at all.
An Italian appeals court found that the conviction that prompted his deportation may actually have involved a different person with the same name, born nearly 20 years later and in another country.
Now, it’s unclear how Hope can return to the United States from Italy, a country he has never called home and, according to ICE’s own guidelines, should never have been deported to in the first place.
“The initial outrage was that they had deported him to the wrong country, apparently on purpose,” Matthew L. Hoppock, Hope’s immigration attorney, told The Daily Beast. “Now he has a court order showing the conviction they deported him for—which had been entered in absentia in Italy—was for a different person.”
That person, according to a court order challenging Hope’s conviction in Italy—which formed the basis for his removal—was “Osmani Ilir,” born in Macedonia on April 2, 1985.
Hope was born in Albania on July 29, 1965.
“The only similarity is the name,” Hoppock said, “and it’s the most common name in Albania.”
“Osmani” was Hope’s original surname before he married a U.S. citizen in 2002 and changed his name, a change that is reflected in his Albanian passport.
Hope, whose parents and siblings live in the United States, was granted lawful permanent U.S. resident status in April 2002 following his marriage. Although he was placed in removal proceedings in January 2008 after being charged with abandoning his lawful permanent resident status—that is, leaving the United States for too long a period—the charges were later terminated without prejudice, and he had no further run-ins with the law until Nov. 12, 2017, when ICE agents pulled him over, arrested him, and charged him with an aggravated felony related to illicit trafficking.
Hope’s legal team protested to immigration authorities that the charges didn’t make sense.
The July 4, 2003 conviction, which referred to “Ilir Osmani,” was for cocaine possession and complicity in drug trafficking in Italy, at a time when Hoppock contends Hope wasn’t even in Italy. The Italian records for the case contain numerous conflicting birthdates, passport numbers, and physical measurements—the judgment entered in Italy had been entered against a man with a different date of birth, a different passport number, and who was six inches taller than Hope.
“Ilir Osmani” is one of the most common male names in Albania, sort of like being named “John Smith” in the United States. There are even other federal immigration cases involving respondents named Ilir Osmani.
The potential for mistaken identity wasn’t the only problem with the government’s case, Hoppock said. According to a decades-old Board of Immigration Appeals precedent , immigrants can’t be deported for Italian in absentia convictions because they don’t comply with due process.
“This is the issue we have pending on appeal at the circuit court—the law is pretty clear they weren’t allowed to deport him on this basis,” Hoppock said. “A foreign criminal judgment rendered in absentia, without adequate notice to the defendant, will not trigger deportation, because it is not a ‘conviction’ for immigration purposes.”
The Board of Immigration Appeals disagreed, ruling in August 2018 that the court “need only determine that the conduct reached by the foreign statute is criminal in nature under the laws of the United States.”
Hope was ordered to be deported to Albania, his country of origin, in late October 2018, but never arrived. After Hoppock and Hope’s family expressed concern that they had not heard from him since he was supposed to have arrived in Tirana, the Albanian capital, ICE deportation officer Paul Dechir sent a curt email on Halloween: “Mr. Hope’s removal flight transited Rome in route Albania. He was detained by Italian authorities in Rome. You or his family, will need to contact the embassy in Rome for more information.”
ICE is required by law to designate which country it is planning to deport a person to so that the deportee has a chance to seek protection if they fear being tortured or persecuted in that country. A transcript of Hope’s removal proceedings show that Department of Homeland Security lawyer Mohammad Abdelaziz designated Hope’s destination as Albania, and when Hoppock delivered Hope’s luggage and $500 cash to ICE on the night before his removal, the officer who arranged his travel told Hoppock that his client was being flown to Albania.
“We think that they did it on purpose—they sent him to Italy because they knew he’d get arrested there,” Hoppock said. “Italy tortures prisoners. This gentleman never got a chance to apply for Convention Against Torture protection because ICE lied about where it was deporting him.”
Shawn Neudauer, an ICE public affairs officer, told The Daily Beast that the agency is looking into the case, which he called “extremely complicated.”
Hope was eventually apprehended in Italy and jailed on the in absentia drug sentence, until the Milan Court of Appeals ruled on March 6 that the original conviction records had been addressed to the Ilir Osmani born in Macedonia in 1985, giving the court “a reasonable doubt... that the notifications were addressed to different individuals.”
The court ruled that Hope, whose birth date it got wrong yet again, “be granted relief from time constraints” in order to appeal his sentence, and ordered his release from custody.
Following the court’s decision, Hoppock filed supplemental evidence with the Board of Immigration Appeals on April 17, arguing that the decision “corroborates Mr. Hope’s defense that the convictions records the DHS filed... as proof of a foreign conviction appeared to relate to a different person with the same name.” The decision also undercuts the legitimacy of the in absentia sentencing, Hoppock argued, because Hope never could have had the opportunity to appeal a sentence that he was never notified had been handed down.
“They haven’t responded at all,” Hoppock said, despite numerous attempts to reach ICE, DHS and the Board of Immigration Appeals. Hoppock continues to pursue an appeal in the conservative Eighth Circuit on Hope’s behalf, but in the meantime, Hope remains stranded in Italy, where he is appealing the drug conviction that he maintains has nothing to do with him.
“Most of his family is here,” Hoppock said of Hope. “They haven’t heard from him in weeks.”"

I Prayed Like a Celebrity for Three Weeks. Millennials are fleeing organized religion at record rates, but you’d never know by the world of celebrity-approved Christian literature. 04.25.19 5:14 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty/Shutterstock
My astrology app Co-Star told me that on April 21, I would find power in love. The stars gave me blanket permission to speak up and express myself—or, in the app’s words, “Communication will enhance ego.”
Off I went that morning, the beginning of Taurus season, ready to tell my date of six months I wanted something more out of our budding flirtation. Jupiter was in Sagittarius, Co-Star told me, so naturally he would feel the same way, too.
God had other plans.
Less than an hour later, as I was trudged onto the train home, rejected, I balanced my pity bagel on the inside of my elbow and pulled out a copy of Jesus Calling . The leather-bound devotional is written in diary format, with daily entries from the perspective of Jesus Christ himself.
Turns out, the scrubs at Co-Star had no idea what they were talking about. According to Jesus, April 21 was not the day to put on a see-through top and demand that a boy like me back. It was always meant to be a day for silent reflection.
“LET ME CONTROL YOUR MIND,” the entry commanded. “The mind is the most restless, unruly part of mankind. Long after you have learned the discipline of holding your tongue, your thoughts defy your will and set themselves up against Me... When My Spirit is controlling your mind, you are filled with Life and Peace .” (Emphasis not mine. Jesus’ style guide includes gratuitous italicization.)
I have been reading Jesus Calling for the past three weeks, after Kourtney Kardashian recommended the tome on her lifestyle website Poosh .
In between instructional guides like “An Instant Butt Lift With Uncle Joe” and investigations such as “Does Having Sex Really Make You Look Younger? (A Therapist Explains),” the elder Kardashian confessed to cracking open Jesus Calling every day.
“A quick passage each morning can create a positive vibe for the entire day; it really is that simple,” she promised in a post titled “ Tapping Into Your Spiritual Side .”
Intent on fixing everything in my life, I bought Jesus Calling at a New York Barnes & Noble. There were five in stock. No surprise when you consider that the devotional megahit has sold over 10 million copies since its 2004 publication.
Jesus Calling was not my only purchase that day. Inspired by Kourtney Kardashian’s breezy Christianity, some (divine?) force poosh -ed me to look up more celebrity-approved religious texts.
I found options endorsed by the likes of Justin Bieber and Chris Pratt , cradled them in the crooks of my arms, and brought the books to the checkout counter.
As the tattooed saleswoman rang up $44 worth of religious texts, she eyed me distrustfully. I felt myself go red and thought about explaining that I was reading these all for a story. But then, I’d be yelling about being a writer inside of a Barnes & Noble, so I grabbed my goods and ran.
As a Gallup poll reported earlier this month, church membership in the United States is at an all-time low . Only about half of Americans report belonging to a house of worship. Sixty percent of those who were raised religious have left the faith.
And yet, not since Tammy Faye Bakker and her mile-long eyelashes has performative prayer been so visible. These religious books have found prominent fans not because of any accurate, insightful theology, but because the texts promise a quick fix. “I probably garnered more religious information from the ‘Dearly Beloved’ interlude in Prince’s ‘Let’s Go Crazy’ than I did from reading Veach’s take that God is the ultimate ‘hype man.’”
Much like the flat belly detox teas other Kardashians hawk online that pledge a slimmer waistline but deliver only a night spent on the toilet, these books are the snake oil of self-help literature. The authors paint pictures of achievable, realistic bliss, but remain light on tangible steps or actual guidance for getting there.
After studying these extremely unacademic works, I didn’t learn much about God. In fact, I probably garnered more religious information from the “Dearly Beloved” interlude in Prince’s “Let’s Go Crazy” than I did from reading Chris Pratt’s preacher’s take that God is the ultimate “hype man.”
If anything, my nearly $50 foray into the world of Christian publishing has taught me that everyone, even Justin Bieber ( especially Justin Bieber), needs a little reminder that they’re not alone.
Jesus Calling by Sarah Young
Celebrity fan: Kourtney Kardashian
Sarah Young, a press-shy missionary and counselor, wrote this 382-page behemoth after experiencing “conversations” with God during prayer. Young, who suffers from a debilitating form of Lyme disease, said she let Jesus dictate his thoughts to her over the course of a year, resulting in daily passages.
Jesus Calling has been dubbed a heretical work in some Christian circles, vexing some believers who are uncomfortable with the idea of God “speaking through” its author. “When you are with other people, you often lose sight of My Presence. Your fear of displeasing people puts you in bondage to them, and they become your primary focus.”
Like I do with all calendars, I cracked open Jesus Calling and first flipped to read what was being said on my birthday, May 2.
“Living in dependence on me is the way to enjoy abundant life,” the entry began. “When you are with other people, you often lose sight of My Presence. Your fear of displeasing people puts you in bondage to them, and they become your primary focus. When you realize this has happened, whisper My name; this tiny act of trust brings Me to the forefront of your consciousness, where I belong.”
Jesus was coming on pretty strong. But he was also reading the room, too. I spend a lot of time fretting over things I said or did in public, and my mind runs a montage of all the embarrassing things I’ve ever done each night before I go to sleep. How would Young’s fictional Jesus know this?!?!
Ruth Graham, writing for The Daily Beastin 2013, called Young’s interpretation of Jesus’ voice “ calming .” I found it entirely dominating. At first, it was impossible to not read Jesus Calling in my best Charlton Heston voice.
“LISTEN TO ME CONTINUALLY,” one entry began, and I felt myself sit up a bit straighter in bed.
“YOU ARE MINE FOR ALL TIME; nothing can separate you from My Love ,” read the text for April 9.
“I AM THE POTTER; YOU ARE MY CLAY,” inspired kinky images I could not unsee.
Forget Charlton Heston—I replaced his booming cadence with the timbre of a woman. Reading Young’s capitalized demands really does craft the mood Kourtney Kardashian swore it would.
I’m not sure if it’s an entirely “positive” vibe, or merely an alluringly louche one, but I’m still captivated by Jesus Calling . Even if it does tell me to shut up a lot.
The Meaning of Marriage: Facing the Complexities of Commitment with the Wisdom of God by Timothy Keller with Katy Keller
Celebrity fan: Justin Bieber
Within seconds of googling The Meaning of Marriage , I learned that this guide, inspired by Pastor Tim Keller’s many sermons, moved Justin Bieber to tears. Last summer, Bieber and his then-betrothed, the model Hailey Baldwin, were photographed in New York crying together on a park bench.
When a TMZ paparazzi asked Bieber what spurred the waterworks, the 24-year-old held up a copy of the book and said, “This! You got the good days, and you got bad days. It’s not real if it doesn’t have any bad days.”
Bieber’s impassioned monologue could very well have been sponsored content for Timothy Keller’s bestseller, which was first published in 2013. Keller, a friendly-looking fellow who resembles a balder version of the actor Wallace Shawn , writes in an amicable, measured tone. His folksy delivery and pleasant anecdotes detail his version of a healthy marriage.
For Keller, such unions are only between a husband and a wife (this is a guide for heterosexual couples only). The preacher concedes that wedded bliss is an illusion, and couples must push through “the bad days” Bieber spoke of. “Marriage is glorious but hard,” Keller writes, and duh .
Keller is such a pragmatist at times, gleefully letting down all of those who expect a fairytale romance, that I might even call him a total Miranda. Unfortunately, I cannot make this comparison in good faith. Keller straight-washes marriage and enlists his wife Kathy to act as a shield against sexism when she writes that traditional gender roles “divinely assigned.”
The pastor advises readers to take lust out of the equation when looking for a partner and find a good friend to marry instead—the sex thing will work itself out, trust him . Marriages that are based out of a mutual attraction are doomed and wrong. “Unions rooted in deep companionship, where a woman ‘serves’ her husband and he repays such servitude with ‘respect’ (those words are conveniently left undefined), will be successful.”
His main evidence for this is a story about a woman he knew who married a man she found “hot” but became miserable when he gained weight. Because of this, Keller writes, it’s clearly impossible for us to be levelheaded in the face of primal, earthly horniness.
Meanwhile, unions rooted in deep companionship, where a woman “serves” her husband and he repays such servitude with “respect” (those words are conveniently left undefined), will be successful.
I wonder how Hailey Baldwin, who entered her marriage to Justin Bieber with a cool $3 million to her name, reckons with Keller’s call for subordination.
Faith Forward Future by Chad Veach
Celebrity fan: Chris Pratt
Faith Forward Future is not, as I initially thought, some dystopian blockbuster, but a slim self-help book by Chad Veach.
The Instagram-famous pastor runs Zoe , an LA-based megachurch named after the Greek word for “life.”
Justin Bieber tattooed the initials of Veach’s daughter, who suffers from a brain malformation , on his arm. The actor Chris Pratt posted a video on YouTube calling Faith Forward Future “very helpful!”
The guide is a handbook for “moving past your disappointments, delays, and destructive thinking.” In his author photo, Veach wears oversized black glasses and an unbuttoned collar. He fashions himself less like a man of the cloth and more like an adjunct philosophy professor who quotes Kanye West songs on his syllabus.
The book is around 203 pages, but its best bits are pull-quotes that litter most pages. Read a few of the catchphrases—“Stop Living Disqualified; Know That You’ve Been Justified,” “Fear of Rejection Produces Fake Perfection,” “God Can’t Move Until You Move”—and you’ll quickly pick up Veach’s point.
The preacher totes a substance-less positivity worthy of an influencer—which makes sense, given his 230,000 Instagram followers. “Many of us have dead dreams,” Veach writes, which I read while staring at a three year-old unused yoga mat. “It’s time to jumpstart and dream again. This time around, let’s dream with God.”
Veach encourages followers to “Find their grace,” which is his own version of accepting predestination. He rattles off a few virtues.
“Maybe you have the instincts and ability to make money,” Veach begins. Good for you! “Maybe you have a winsome personality.” Let that shine! “Maybe you have administrative skills.” A less desirable life truth, but sure. In Veach’s words, “These are all gifts from God!”
There is a clear allure to some of this theology. Insisting that God has a “plan” we should submit to absolves readers of much responsibility. At the top of his book, Veach recounts a formative experience in his young life. After making the decision to break up with his first serious girlfriend, the pastor rationalizes, “I knew God had asked me to do it.”
I imagine a man dumping me with the explanation, “Jesus made me,” and suddenly I am an atheist."
Where Does ‘Avengers: Endgame’ Rank in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?,www.thedailybeast.com,Nick Schager,04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/does-avengers-endgame-rank-among-the-best-films-in-the-marvel-cinematic-universe,"Where Does ‘Avengers: Endgame’ Rank in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos Alamy There have been 22 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Here are our rankings—including ‘Avengers: Endgame,’ in theaters Friday. Nick Schager 04.25.19 5:10 AM ET
T he Marvel Cinematic Universe was born in 2008, when Jon Favreau’s Iron Man not only introduced the world to Robert Downey Jr.’s billionaire-genius Tony Stark, but also set in motion a plan to unite various stand-alone adventures into a unified tapestry. It was a daring gambit at the time, but one that, eleven years later, has proven successful beyond all expectations, shattering box-office records and establishing new standards for serialized big-screen storytelling and CGI-enhanced action-adventure—not to mention quality control, as the studio has rarely made a calamitous creative misstep (much less suffered a deflating financial failure) in its groundbreaking efforts. In the history of cinema, there’s simply never been a run like it.
All good things must come to an end, however, and that they most certainly do—in spectacular fashion—in Avengers: Endgame , directors Joe and Anthony Russo’s gargantuan finale to both last year’s Avengers: Infinity War and the initial phase of the franchise.
While there’s no doubt that there’ll be more Marvel films to come in the ensuing years, the Russos’ latest extravaganza serves as a definitive culmination and conclusion, bidding farewell to beloved characters and setting its remaining marquee faces on new courses. As such, now’s the perfect time to look back at the first decade-plus of the MCU, from its relatively humble origin-story beginnings to its legitimately epic finish.
22. Thor: The Dark World (2013)
Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is the sole reason to sit through Thor’s (Chris Hemsworth) second solo outing. With the warring siblings forced to team up to defeat a Dark Elf, it plays like a pointless exercise in brand extension, and—unsurprisingly—is the least popular, and vital, installment in the entire MCU.
21. The Incredible Hulk (2008)
Largely ignored by the MCU (save for William Hurt’s General Ross), this second attempt at a stand-alone Hulk saga is heavy on the smash-heavy action. Edward Norton’s ho-hum Bruce Banner, as well as a general dearth of interesting style, relegates it to also-ran status, especially in light of Mark Ruffalo’s subsequent, superior take on the gamma-infused character.
20. Thor (2011)
Having not yet been reinvented as the Avengers’ funniest member , Chris Hemsworth’s long-locked hero comes across as a stoic snooze in his first solo film, which only gets interesting when situating its story in the colorful heavenly realm of Asgard. The stuff on Earth, including a finale in a cardboard cutout small-town set, is a chore.
19. Ant-Man (2015)
Amidst so much world-hangs-in-the-balance MCU weightiness, Ant-Man ’s frivolity is refreshing. Unfortunately, despite appealing headlining work from Paul Rudd as thief-turned-hero Scott Lang, Peyton Reed’s film never comes close to being as funny as it wants to be—even with the participation of the amusing Michael Peña.
18. Iron Man 2 (2010)
Reports that Jon Favreau’s sequel was being written (and re-written) during production are hardly unbelievable, given the choppiness of its story involving Iron Man (Downey Jr.) taking on both electric whip-wielding Russian baddie Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) and business rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). Its messiness is at once its strength and its undoing.
17. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)
Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) meets his dad (Kurt Russell), who happens to be a living planet, in this uneven follow-up, which suffers from a static narrative that never goes anywhere interesting, and pairs off its characters for unnecessarily long stretches. James Gunn’s amusing writing helps alleviate some of those shortcomings—but not enough of them.
16. Captain Marvel (2019)
Brie Larson’s Air Force pilot Carol Danvers becomes the all-powerful Captain Marvel in a perfectly average origin story that leans heavily on ‘90s nostalgia and complicates its otherwise-straightforward tale with a memory-loss twist. It’s fine as far as it goes , which often isn’t far enough.
15. Doctor Strange (2016)
Magic gets its proper MCU due with Scott Derrickson’s Doctor Strange , in which a physician (Benedict Cumberbatch) becomes heir to the Sorcerer Supreme throne courtesy of Tilda Swinton’s Ancient One. An A-list cast and some truly psychedelic visuals help compensate for the fact that Strange remains better suited for supporting-player responsibilities.
14. Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018)
More tonally assured than its predecessor, Peyton Reed’s sequel makes Evangeline Lilly’s Wasp a clear co-lead alongside Paul Rudd’s Ant-Man , giving the proceedings a playful romantic jolt. Their fight against Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen) is forgettable, which can’t be said about strong supporting turns from Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, Walton Goggins and Michael Peña.
13. Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)
Joss Whedon’s highly-anticipated sequel is stellar in the intersquad-banter department (in particular, the running bit about Thor’s hammer), and Ultron (James Spader) turns out to be a thematically foundational figure for the series. Too bad, then, that quite a bit of its bigger-is-better action is underwhelming.
12. Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)
It doesn’t achieve the heights reached by Sam Raimi’s non-MCU Spider-Man trilogy. Still, Jon Watts’ webslinging adventure has its charms—a script that sidesteps origin-story obligations for wise-cracking teen comedy; Tom Holland’s energetically adolescent Peter Parker; Michael Keaton’s villainous Vulture; and Downey Jr. as Parker’s sarcastic father figure/mentor.
11. Captain America: Civil War (2016)
No matter its title, the Russos’ 2016 adventure is basically Avengers 2.5 , featuring most of the series’ characters to date (minus Thor, Hulk and Hawkeye) in a team-dividing saga about a superhero registration act that Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) supports and Captain America (Chris Evans) opposes. Even if some of its tale is muddled, it ably brings Spider-Man and Black Panther into the MCU fold.
10. Iron Man (2008)
The one that started it all, Jon Favreau’s maiden Iron Man handles its origin-story duties far better than it manages the tacked-on conflict between Tony Stark and corporate bedfellow Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). Downey Jr.’s magnetic Stark is the high watermark against which all other MCU performances are judged, and it holds up superbly.
9. Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
Director Joe Johnston taps into the noble national values that define Captain America in this rah-rah origin story, about a feisty weakling named Steve Rogers who gets the chance to fight the Nazis—and Red Skull (Hugo Weaving)—thanks to a super-serum that transforms him into a WWII Avenger. It’s a cheeky, nostalgic creation myth.
8. Iron Man 3 (2013)
Reeling from the events of The Avengers , a traumatized Tony Stark faces off against a not-what-he-seems adversary known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) in Shane Black’s amusing Christmas-set threequel. By placing a premium on character and comedy, it allows Downey Jr. to deliver his best performance as the MCU’s signature hero, and outshines both of its series predecessors.
7. Black Panther (2018)
Ryan Coogler’s Black Panther takes a novel approach to the origin-story format, allowing us to learn about its hero (Chadwick Boseman) through a present-day adventure with deep roots in the past. That, plus its unique visual imagination and a sturdy supporting turn from Michael B. Jordan as evil revolutionary Killmonger, makes it one of the MCU’s most distinctive entries.
6. Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
Captain America’s sophomore outing places him in the present, where his wholesome American beliefs are challenged by a modern military-industrial complex that’s not to be trusted. It’s Marvel’s take on Three Days of the Condor , with Chris Evans leading the way in perhaps his finest go-round as the Stars-and-Stripes-decorated do-gooder.
5. Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
The Avengers find themselves in apocalyptic trouble when the Mad Titan, Thanos (Josh Brolin), comes knocking in search of the remaining Infinity Stones, which he plans to use to wipe out half of all life in the universe. The ensuing mash-up of heroes and conflicts is routinely exhilarating, and it concludes with an all-time great dust-in-the-wind cliffhanger .
4. Thor: Ragnarok (2017)
Hands-down the funniest entry in the MCU , Taika Waititi’s Thor: Ragnarok may also be its most important, given that it reinvents the God of Thunder as an arrogant-doofus laugh-riot, even as it further develops him as a three-dimensional character. Also featuring Hulk, Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum), this outer-space adventure has the series’ highest replay value.
3. The Avengers (2012)
Joss Whedon’s 2012 film gets off to a bumpy start, but once it starts pitting its lead heroes against each other—all before uniting them as a team against the forces of Loki—it delivers on its years-in-the-making promise. Best of all, it does so with consistent comedic repartee, while simultaneously, and finally , figuring out how to bring the Hulk (via Mark Ruffalo) to thrilling life.
2. Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)
James Gunn’s 2014 adventure introduced the world to Star Lord, Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel), a ragtag interstellar squad thrust into unlikely hero duty. Balancing absurdity and mayhem with aplomb, all of it set to a throwback soundtrack, it’s just about as good as Marvel gets.
1. Avengers: Endgame (2019)
The Russos’ three-hour epic is the closer the franchise deserves, sending its heroes—led by Iron Man and Captain America—on a sprawling, fan service-y mission through time and space to reverse Thanos’ “Snapture” and recover “the vanished.” Hitting its every note with expert precision, it’s a triumph of humorous, action-packed, poignant blockbuster filmmaking."

Trevor Noah Mocks Trump for Throwing a Tantrum Over How Many Twitter Followers He Has,www.thedailybeast.com,marlow.stern@thedailybeast.com (Marlow Stern),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-daily-shows-trevor-noah-goes-after-trump-over-ridiculous-twitter-follower-complaints,"YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS Trevor Noah Mocks Trump for Throwing a Tantrum Over How Many Twitter Followers He Has “It’s like breaking the news to a child that Santa isn’t real,” joked the comedian. 04.25.19 2:06 AM ET Comedy Central
On Wednesday, the news broke that President Donald Trump had an Oval Office meeting with Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey, wherein he proceeded to badger the bearded tech bro over his follower count .
Trump, who boasts close to 60 million Twitter followers—far short of former President Obama’s 106 million-plus—reportedly argued that he’d lost a significant number of followers due to purges targeting conservatives. But Dorsey “had to explain to the president that like other Twitter users, @realDonaldTrump periodically loses followers when the site deletes fake or bot accounts,” reported The Daily Beast .
“That’s right, my friends: the President of the United States is upset because he feels he should have more Twitter followers,” said Trevor Noah. “This is absolutely ridiculous. Like, what’s next? He’s going to complain to Instagram because his thirst traps aren’t blowing up?”
The comedian dedicated a portion of Wednesday night’s Daily Show to the IRL Twitter meet-up, at which Trump and a group of his close advisers—including Dan Scavino, the White House’s social media director—also complained to Dorsey about anti-Trump Twitter bias.
And, as The Daily Beast previously reported , “Trump has repeatedly griped to associates about how his predecessor, President Obama, has had more Twitter followers than he has, even though—by Trump’s own assessment—he is so much better at Twitter than Obama is.”
“I actually feel sorry for everyone in this meeting with Trump who had to sit there and take it seriously,” joked Noah, before zeroing in on the concerned/confused face of Scavino. “Look at this guy’s face! That guy works for Trump but even he’s looking at him the same way you look at your dad when he whips out a Speedo for the beach.”
“And poor Jack Dorsey,” Noah continued. “He has to explain—to a president—that some of his followers were deleted because they were bots and spam accounts. It’s like breaking the news to a child that Santa isn’t real. It’s like, Sir, you’re 72 now so I think you’re old enough to know the truth: @Mikhail_62875 isn’t a real person .

Fox News host Tucker Carlson began his program Wednesday night by taking aim at Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg for criticizing Vice President Mike Pence on the campaign trail, only for his guest to take that opportunity to call Islam the “most hateful, intolerant religion on Earth.”
During his opening monologue, Carlson portrayed the South Bend, Indiana, mayor as engaging in a “fake feud” with Pence, the former Indiana governor, solely to portray himself as a victim because of his homosexuality. (The vice president is known for his embrace of anti-LGBT policies , both as veep and governor.) The Fox News host, meanwhile, contrasted Buttigieg’s criticisms of Pence with the vice president saying kind words about the mayor.
After ending his monologue by suggesting Buttigieg isn’t truly Christian because he supports “late-term abortion and attacking people who have been kind to him,” the Fox host welcomed conservative journalist and frequent guest Chadwick Moore . Asked how Buttigieg could be seen as a victim since he “went to Harvard and is a Rhodes scholar,” Moore invoked Brunei’s law of punishing homosexuality with death.
“The way he speaks about the vice president you would think that Sultan of Brunei was holding the office,” Moore said as Carlson chuckled. “Of course, the true enemies of gay people in this world. Unlike the present administration, which I might add, as you know, the administration announced an effort to work to decriminalize homosexuality around the globe. Vice President Pence is behind this.”
Moore, who is also gay, went on to chastise Buttigieg for pushing a “hate hoax” against Pence, claiming the South Bend mayor only criticized Pence to “pay his woke penance” and “appease himself to journalist and the most unhinged activists on his side.”
The pair went on to say Buttigieg should just act more like President Trump and be an “honest, straight talker” and vouch for Pence’s “gentle, meek character,” Moore claimed the vast majority of Christians who are opposed to same-sex marriage still believe homosexual couples “should have the same civil rights, but we don’t like the word marriage being used because of our faith.”
“Why is it Christians, though?” Carlson wondered.
Moore replied that liberals “despise Christianity because America is founded on Christian values,” adding that while “lefties don’t like any kind of religion” they “choose Islam” because “the enemy of their friend is their friend.”
“Exactly,” Carlson responded.
“So, they will stand up for the most hateful, intolerant—in places of the world, obviously not all Muslims, but the most hateful, intolerant religion on Earth,” Moore continued. “Where, you know, every single nation where gays are murdered, there's seven of them, it ain’t Indiana Christians who are running those nations, Mayor Buttigieg.”
“It’s not?” Carlson sarcastically replied before ending the segment. READ THIS LIST"
Joe Biden Kicks Off 2020 Campaign With Brutal Attack on Trump,www.thedailybeast.com,nico.hines@thedailybeast.com (Nico Hines) Scott.Bixby@thedailybeast.com (Scott Bixby),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-biden-finally-announces-presidential-campaign,"COMING OUT SWINGING Joe Biden Kicks Off 2020 Campaign With Brutal Attack on Trump Many expected the former VP to pitch himself as an elder statesman. Instead, he’s announced himself as the toughest brawler, using the legacy of Charlottesville to lambaste Trump. 04.25.19 6:09 AM ET Handout via Reuters
Former Vice President Joe Biden officially joined the Democratic presidential race Thursday with an incendiary announcement video that focused on the deadly march in Charlottesville and portrayed Donald Trump as a stain on American history who must be removed from power.
“If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen,” he said.
Biden has led early polling of potential Democratic candidates for months, in part due to the name-recognition that comes with serving two terms as President Barack Obama’s vice president and decades in the Senate. His intention to run has become an open secret in recent weeks, but few people expected him to enter the race with such an aggressive and direct attack on the president.
The 76-year-old former Delaware senator plans to formally kick off his presidential campaign with an appearance at a Pittsburgh union hall on Monday. Biden’s first interview after his announcement, an appearance on The View , will air on Friday.
The four-minute video posted on his Twitter account Thursday morning contrasted sharply with the optimistic announcements by his many Democratic rivals. Biden was presenting himself as the brawler who has the power and the willingness to go toe-to-toe with Trump in what is guaranteed to be a bruising presidential election in 2020.
“We are in the battle for the soul of this nation,” he said, claiming that American democracy is “at stake” under Trump .
The launch video shows men with tiki torches shouting “Jews will not replace us” and images of swastikas and Confederate flags at the right-wing marches that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.
“We saw Klansmen and white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out in the open. Their crazed faces illuminated by torches, veins bulging and baring the fangs of racism, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the ’30s,” he said.
“That’s when we heard the words of the president of the United States that stunned the world and shocked the conscience of this nation. He said there were quote some ‘very fine people on both sides.’ Very fine people on both sides?”
Biden said he’s running for president because everything about American democracy is “at stake” under a Trump presidency. “We have to remember who we are—this is America.”
In the widest and most diverse field of presidential contenders in the party’s history, Biden will have to combat concerns that his age, more moderate legislative and policy record, and recent questions about his interactions with women make him just another old white guy seeking the nomination.
“He operated at a different time and environment and will have a lot to answer for,” a former Obama-Biden aide told The Daily Beast last month. “Look at Hillary Clinton’s numbers before she got into the 2016 race. The most popular moment is when you're a prospective candidate and a statesman who can shape the field from the outside. Being in presidential campaigns tends to be diminishing for everyone except for the victor.”
Biden told reporters after a speech in front of union workers in Washington, D.C., last month that he would bide his time as the Democratic field continued to grow. “My intention from the beginning was if I were to run would be the last person to announce,” he said.
It appears he has surveyed the field and concluded that no one else has shown the firepower to stand up to Trump. By going after the president directly—over the heads of his primary challengers—Biden appeared to signal his unrivaled stature in American public life.
The aggressive campaign launch may also be pitched at America's white working-class voters, a cohort that Democrats are desperate to win back from Trump. Biden has made his close ties with union workers a centerpiece of his until-now nascent presidential campaign in recent weeks, joining a picket line of striking grocery store workers in Massachusetts and telling a firefighters union in Washington that the United States “was built by the great American middle class—and unions built that middle class.”
His relationship with the unions and working classes combined with his close ties to Obama-era fundraisers and staffers, gives the former vice president a formidable campaign operation—to the point that deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield told NBC News that Biden requested Obama not endorse his candidacy, so as to avoid the appearance that the Democratic establishment was in the tank for his campaign.
Biden’s family foundation has also announced that it will suspend all operations, effective immediately .
In all of his decades of experience, however, lurk potential landmines for any presidential candidate, particularly a presumptive frontrunner with nearly two dozen opponents seeking to bring him down. Biden’s first two presidential campaigns, in 1988 and 2008, ended disastrously after a plagiarism scandal and a racially insensitive gaffe about his future running mate, respectively, and Biden’s handling of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ confirmation hearings provides fertile ground for opponents who will likely seek to paint him as too out of touch with the current Democratic Party.
More recently, Biden’s own behavior with women has come under scrutiny as well. After a former Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor in Nevada described feeling deeply uncomfortable when he touched her, kissed her and smelled her hair during a campaign event in 2016, more than half a dozen women came forward to describe similar physical interactions.
Biden responded to the allegations in a cellphone video, saying that he would be more “mindful” of women’s personal space in the future, but later joked about the controversy, a sign that the former vice president’s famously undisciplined speaking style, too, presents potential pitfalls."

How the Queen Sang Along to Rodgers and Hammerstein Classics at Intimate Dinner Party,www.thedailybeast.com,tom.sykes@thedailybeast.com (Tom Sykes),04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-queen-sang-along-to-rodgers-and-hammerstein-classics-at-intimate-dinner-party,"Oh What A Beautiful Monarch How the Queen Burst Into Song Listening to ‘Oklahoma!’ at the U.S. Ambassador’s Party We usually think of Her Majesty as an austere figure. So it’s refreshing to hear stories of her letting her hair down for a good old sing-song at the U.S. ambassador’s house. 04.25.19 9:13 AM ET WPA Pool
Queen Elizabeth requested show tunes from the Rodgers and Hammerstein toe-tapper Oklahoma! for after-dinner entertainment, and sang along to Oh What a Beautiful Morning , a singer who was invited to perform for her at a private dinner has revealed.
The rare insight into Her Majesty’s musical tastes comes from singer Dennis McNeil, 58, who told People magazine that he was asked by the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom to perform for Her Majesty.
Sensibly, McNeil did a little research.
“We reached out to the palace for her musical tastes, and her lady-in-waiting informed us she loves show tunes,” says McNeil, “Especially show tunes from Oklahoma .”
Well, who would have thought it?
Having prepped a number of Rodgers and Hammerstein classics, the singer donned his black tie and tootled along to the intimate dinner at the ambassador’s London residence, Winfield House, where some 20 guests were gathered for an exclusive soiree.
The Queen worked her way casually through the room, McNeil says, and told him that the first opera she ever saw was Wagner’s Tristan and Isolde , when she was 8 years old. Her mother took her along with her sister, Princess Margaret.
This might seem an odd choice for an 8-year-old’s first exposure to the operatic arts, but, as she told McNeil: “It was the re-opening of [the opera house at] Covent Garden, so I suppose we had to be there.”
Well quite. Duty calls and all that, even for an 8-year-old
Her Majesty then dropped what might be interpreted as a not-particularly subtle hint about how she would like the evening’s entertainment to unfold: “She mentioned how she wished more singable songs were written today. The kind of tunes you can hum along to.”
Fortunately, having done his homework, McNeil was able to break into Some Enchanted Evening from South Pacific .
During the song, he told People , the Queen pulled out her purse and took out her lipstick.
“As I sang, she applied a fresh coat of lipstick,” he says.
He then sang It Had to Be You . “I’m told she was tapping her feet to that one,” he says. “Afterwards, one of the guests said that she leaned over to him and said, ‘So nice to hear real music.’”
The next song was Oh What a Beautiful Morning. “A lot of people in the room sang along, including the Queen,” he says. “That was really cool.”
Yes, you read that right: The Queen burst into song. In the annals of royal biographical detail on our usually sphinx-like monarch, this counts as a highly revelatory insight.
Having told McNeil that the music was “delightful,” HM left the party.
“As the car started to pull away, she gave that trademark wave through the window. It was pretty phenomenal,” he said, “I couldn’t sleep that night. It was a Cinderella kind of night. I never wanted the evening to end.” READ THIS LIST"
