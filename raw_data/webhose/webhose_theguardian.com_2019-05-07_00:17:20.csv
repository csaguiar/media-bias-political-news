To me it is not that unbearable when Remain voters find out that they are entitled to other EU member states’ passports. It is upsetting when Leave voters get them (something with making your bed and laying in it)
Your husband understood that Brexit is a huge risk and could detrimentally affect the UK’s economy while simultaneously limiting the options to go abroad and build a life there. It seems that you hadn’t. Don’t blame your husband for that.
Also what is your obsession with “getting your point across” when you “don’t know what your point is”. Educate yourself until you have one, or just say you don’t know but that you have some sympathy for specific elements. Don’t blame your surroundings, just do it."

If you were a strong Brexiteer, I could understand you being disappointed / disgusted / angry ' frustrated etc. about being with someone whose beliefs and opinions are so opposed to those you hold. (I feel like that with my husband's family who are all firm leavers whereas I am a firm remainer.)
But you do not indicate that you hold strong views on this matter so to my mind your issue seems to be your partner's background and behaviour in general.
If he really is such an obnoxious, superior, arrogant, self-satisfied baffoon, you don't need Brexit to do the right thing and leave him.
You are clearly irritated by everything he says and does and this illustrates there is no love softening the irritation. So why stay?
(We all find that our partner has habits or says and does things we find annoying, but if there is a deep-rooted love and respect, we can live with these. This does not seem to be the case in your situation.) I wish you the wisdom to make the right decision for you and the strength to carry it through.
Just as an aside: He may just be really chuffed to still be able to call himself a European rather than being boastful. We have all applied for Irish and German passports in my family and are really happy we managed to get them. We are not rich, wealthy, any shape of elite etc. But the fact that you feel he is boasting seems to indicate that you really dislike everything he is, says, does and represents."

This is further complicated by the fact that, markets in which the Government is the main or only customer are highly susceptible to cronyism – the nexus between the governing elite and the business elite that contrives to put the interests of business first , at the expense of the wants, needs and expectations of ordinary citizens. Not least, because the twin evils of lobbying and corruption rear their ugly heads every time taxpayers’ money crosses the boundary between the Public Sector and the Private Sector.
It is, as economist Randall Holcombe puts in his book Political Capitalism a “ system in which the economic and political elite cooperate for their mutual benefit .” The political elite tilt the economic playing field in favour of the economic elite, privileging them through subsidies, regulatory protections and targeted tax breaks. In exchange, the economic elite then help to ensure that the political elite remain in power. The rest of us pay the bill for this quid pro quo through higher taxes, higher prices, and a less efficient, less dynamic economy.

It would also fuel the “intransigence” allegations, already being deployed by the nationalist and populist right, like the attack dogs of the DUP and Mogg’s crazy friends in the AfD. And they are saying this when the EU has been nice as pie.
That is not to say that the EU should give in to the Brexiteer ultras’ ludicrous demands. They have been right to deal with these politely but firmly at the official level.

'It’s still wide open, but what are the odds on the remaining Brexit scenarios?
From cross-party deal to no deal, short to long extension, we assess the options on the race to leave Europe'
No consideration in the above given to:
EU does not grant extension (objection by member-state or whatever).
No Deal' Brexit crash-out on the 12th - OR (as Parlimant has rejected a 'No Deal')
Revoke Article 50!
I fail to see why this is not still an option. Does it make any difference if we do this and, at some future point again consider leaving or have a long extension and possibly leave anyway?
Equally, we could have a long extension and stay in the EU either because of a second referendum oor political changes in the UK.
Or perhaps we eventually decide it is not in our best interests.
My biggest fear, should there be a long extension, is in the indifference of the greater part of the voting populace when it comes to electing MEPs.
You need to be organised and dedicated to getting the ones that best represent your interests - and the interests of the UK.
Extremist parties always seem to be very good at this. 25%-30% is usually enough to have a majority which means the voice of the other 70% is diminished or absent.
I am only considering the voting population here and ignoring those (about 17.5 million under 18) who have no say and currently seem to be totally ignored even though they are citizens as well. But if you cannot vote and nobody represents you"

Kyle Walker’s VAR escape shows up football’s dunderheaded experiment | Barney Ronay | Football,www.theguardian.com,cynicalshrink,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/apr/06/kyle-walker-var-escape-football-fa-cup-semi-final-brighton#127808031,"The usual flood of carping comments against City all motivated by envy. We have suffered our fair share of wrong decisions from referees. Opposition players getting yellows for potential leg-breakers, goals wrongly disallowed, opposition goals wrongly allowed. City give away more free-kicks for very minor fouls as a result of our high pressing game. That’s why we win so often, our players work their socks off to recover possession. I can’t recall a serious challenge by a City player since Nigel de Jong left.
Never mind. Keep on carping, we don’t care. We’ll enjoy watching you all suffer from high blood pressure and indigestion as we sail serenely by."

I once took Will Hutton seriously, but he’s becoming a joke.
Hutton suggests with undisguised bile, that an unintended software problem at Boeing, can be laid squarely at the door of Trump’s presidency.
Does Hutton view the very much intended software fraud at VW, can equally, be laid squarely at the door of Merkel?
Sometimes I think a little bit self-reflection from these hysterical article writers wouldn’t go a-miss.
O.K. Guardian, we get it,.. You hate Trump,.. You hate Brexit,.. What else have you got?"

In truth the FAA has always had a conflict of interest between safety and commercial interests. The most famous impact of this being the failure to mandate a fix to the DC-10 cargo door fault apparent in a near miss accident over Canada. The same fault went on to kill everybody in the infamous Turkish Airines accident in the 70s.
The major issue here is a failure of safety critical engineering within Boeing and the regulator is always going to struggle to be well enough resourced to catch this (although this is so poor they really should have).
Ignoring the wisdom of again pushing another iteration on a 60s airframe, sombody decided to use trim as a flying control, which should have been questioned. Worse they based the design on a single sensor with no resilence (they didn't bother to wire in the second sensor so they had no way of detecting questionable data and certainly no reliable way of mitigating it). That should have failed the design review in any safety critical company.
After that even if you train crews (and the second accident was long enough after the first for it to be known) the aircraft is still fundamentally unsafe because requiring stressed crews to recognise the fault quickly enough to override the system (especially with a stick shaker going off at low altitude) is wishful thinking.
Much like the MD-11, which had a similar bodge to fix the stability issues caused by modifying the DC-10 it was based on, the 787-Max will be pulled from passenger service quickly if it ever gets certified to fly again. A software only change won't cut it."

They observe the weird class ridden Tory Party as an extension of Downton Abbey where wealthy idiots are taken seriously and underclass watch on in admiration. Perhaps we need a revolution to finally explode the myths surrounding class and privilege. Perhaps a sudden Brexit would be the jolt required.

It seems to me this couple are mismatched, quite possibly from the outset - the references to ‘wealth’ and ‘privilege’ are particularly telling - and the issue of Brexit serves merely to bring the mismatch into the open.
After 30 years separation is obviously a damaging option and neither partner will remain unhurt, but that is an option if the relationship is damaged beyond repair. On the other hand the wife might choose to swallow her irritation and soldier on. But none of this has anything to do with Brexit."
