Sex, Drugs, Jazz and the Man Who Ruled Morocco Hidden inside the high Atlas Mountains of Morocco sits a kasbah largely left to nature's whims. But it was once the over-the-top home of the country’s now-hated ruler. 04.28.19 12:12 AM ET Jean-Denis Joubert/Gamma-Rapho via Getty
TELOUET, Morocco—Not so long ago, Morocco was all about sex, drugs and jazz. And the man in charge, T’hami El Glaoui, the pasha of Marrakesh from 1912 to 1956 and rumored to be the richest man in the world, ran a prostitution racket so large that the 27,000 hookers operating in Marrakesh represented a reported 10 percent of the population. “Putting them (this clan) in charge was like letting the Mafia run Las Vegas,” Vanity Fair said in a 2015 article —although he did, apparently, love jazz.
That was then. This is now.
It took me a good dozen trips to Morocco to finally reach the fabled Kasbah of Telouet, the Glaoui family residence that was designed to be the most beautiful palace in the world. It was said to boast the finest Islamic architecture in Morocco. El Glaoui apparently decorated it using some of his pimping cash.
Not everyone makes it to the kasbah but anyone in Morocco should try before it crumbles to dust.
The kasbah is hidden inside the high Atlas Mountains of Morocco. It presided over the old caravan route to the Sahara that the Glaoui clan oversaw. Along this route, precious goods like gold and ivory were transported from the south to the rulers in the north. It was big money for El Glaoui who leveraged his position here and the fact that he was in charge of the Berbers in the local mountains that the French could not control to become the Pasha of Marrakesh under French rule during that period. He was both loathed for betraying his people and for the lavish parties entertaining important out-of-towners in style here in the palace. As a result, his palace has largely been left to rot.
It was for no reason, other than the fact that I had given up California for Europe and was looking for a place to stay warm in winter that I found myself in Morocco, repeatedly, writing a book about his people, the Berbers—some of whom El Glaoui famously shopped in exchange for the Pasha title, bestowed upon him by the French.
Starting a few years ago now, I found myself traversing the old caravan route, over which his clan presided, regularly, before I finally reached the crumbling Kasbah. It is said 1,000 workers and 300 artisans worked on it, no less. But it’s a case of catch it while you can. And it is quite a trip to get there along the old caravan route which cuts through the majestic peaks of the Atlas Mountains, winding its way from the inviting red walls that surround Morocco’s beating heart—Marrakesh—through to the glistening sand dunes of the Sahara in the south. Its now-paved road cuts through rippling hills and mountain peaks dotted in intermittent green foliage.
The French stamped out the caravan routes when they ruled Morocco, in the first half of the 20th century. It is no longer as charming, as it sounded back then. But not everything has changed. On the day that I went there, donkeys trotted along shabby tracks by the roadside. Washing fluttered outside half-built houses, selling terracotta pots and hand woven carpets imbued with local symbolism, woven in wool and silk. Men in traditional djellaba robes board battered buses that ferried workers back and forth.
One passes pit stops featuring makeshift stands, placed outside barren cafes, grilling shavings of raw meat cut from the carcasses dangling in the wind. It is a far cry from the El Glaoui glory days here.
The site of legendary soirées, attended by the global glitterati, and the closest thing Morocco has ever had to Hearst Castle, the OTT California residence of the newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, the Kasbah beckoned from its perch on a hilltop hidden between those shivering mountains. From there, its owners, the El Glaoui warlords, had ruled over this important trading route.
The current kasbah was built in the 1860s, on the site of an existing one. It was lavishly re-decorated in the early 20th century when 300 workers spent three years on the ceilings and walls. Some of this was recently restored.
On several of those trips, I had passed by North Africa’s highest peak, Mount Toubkal, in complete ignorance of the Kasbah’s existence. But sitting a couple of years ago, in Dar Khalifa, the Casablanca mansion made famous by owner Tahir Shah’s best-selling book, The Caliph’s House , it was drawn to my attention.
“Haven’t you seen it?” he asked.
Soon it grabbed my imagination, and in a novel that I subsequently wrote in his garden, a plot unfolded in my mind which reached its climax at this legendary Kasbah that I had yet to see.
It was clear I had to go there before it crumbled into the dust. Shah had mentioned to me that, slowly, it had been falling into the ground. It’s myriad of rooms were disappearing as time went on.
The Kasbah was one of several hang-outs where El Glaoui liked to entertain important visitors. But it was very much an upstairs, downstairs kind of place. While guests partied upstairs, its dungeons were filled with traitors whose heads were often hung from the doors, as legend has it. Some of which still stand.
El Glaoui was so reviled by the people that, upon his death, his associates were hunted and burned. His property was confiscated and given to the government. That government has left his most fabled Kasbah to rot.
From the outside today, the Kasbah looks like a haunted house from a Disney film. Room upon room has fallen away, since it was all but abandoned in 1956. Jagged walls and piles of rubble, now roamed upon by donkeys and local children, stand in stark contrast to a half-dozen rooms that stand in their original splendor, at the heart of this eerie complex.
I had finally determined to see it and driven from Marrakech in a taxi. What was a $100 fare for a day’s drive? Two guards stood outside and levied a small fee when I arrived, but I was otherwise alone. I paid next to nothing for the privilege of venturing beyond the intricately woven doors to have what remains of the Kasbah to myself, for several hours that afternoon.
Hardly anyone, these days, ventures beyond the main caravan route to drive out to the ruins. It takes about an hour from the main road along a bumpy track. I was scared, as I clambered up broken staircases, and passed through long, empty corridors, before I reached this inner sanctum.
A bird darted from the roof. It flew out through a half-broken window that revealed a scene of pastoral bliss basked in sunshine.
I inspected the former harem, a long, dark subdued space next to the master bedroom. I marveled at the intricacy of the woodwork, the rippling arches in marble, the heavily carved doors that lead through this series of inner chambers. The fabled tiles. I spent time inspecting the deep colors of the walls, before settling on the window ledge, with the sun warming my back, as I wrote. I tried to imagine what had gone on in here back in the day.
My driver wandered in a couple of hours later, and broke the silence. The spell of being alone inside this ominous space. It was a slice of his history that he was discovering for the first time. The lair of a man that had betrayed his people. It wasn’t a memory that he or the government was keen to preserve.
But now I carried it forward, as the setting for a fictitious scene in a novel in which a French reporter is murdered uncovering the ancient lore of the Berbers, some of whom El Glaoui helped bury in history from this very spot.
But it’s a case of catch it while you can. READ THIS LIST"
What ‘Avengers: Endgame’s’ Shocking Ending Means for the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Future,www.thedailybeast.com,Nick Schager,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/what-avengers-endgames-shocking-ending-means-for-the-marvel-cinematic-universes-future,"SPOILER ALERT! What ‘Avengers: Endgame’s’ Shocking Ending Means for the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Future As Phase 3 of the MCU comes to an end, we look at what effects ‘Endgame’ will have on the Marvel Cinematic Universe. [Warning: Major Spoilers!] 04.28.19 12:08 AM ET Marvel Studios
Thanos may have murdered half the universe—including many fan-favorite superheroes —at the end of Avengers: Infinity War , but the Marvel Cinematic Universe is as healthy as ever thanks to Avengers: Endgame , which opened this weekend to record-breaking numbers. That’s certainly deserved since it’s the best MCU film to date , as well as the stellar culmination of an 11-year undertaking that’s resulted in 22 films, dozens of characters, and billions of dollars in profit. An extravaganza that hits its humorous, exhilarating and poignant notes with expert precision , directors Joe and Anthony Russo’s three-hour saga about family, sacrifice and heroism is, in the final tally, an epic triumph in every respect, bringing to a close one chapter of the franchise even as it clears a forward path for its beloved characters.
Which, naturally, begs the question: where does that path lead?
[ Major spoilers follow ]
Answering that question requires a discussion of Avengers: Endgame ’s most significant moments—of which there are many. As those who’ve seen it now know, things get off to a fast start with a brooding group of Avengers (accompanied by Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel ) finding Thanos (Josh Brolin) at his remote hideaway. There, they learn that his actions are irreversible. Which is bad news for everyone, Thanos included, since it compels Thor to “aim for the head”—and decapitate the Mad Titan.
Cut to five years later, and time travel via the Quantum Realm ( thanks, Ant-Man! ) provides the remaining Avengers with an opportunity to atone for their failure to stop Thanos’ “Snapture.” By taking trips back to some of their prior exploits, the heroes attempt to recover the not-yet-in-Thanos’-possession Infinity Stones. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) revisit the “Battle of New York” seen in 2012’s Avengers ; Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) head to Asgard circa 2013; War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) visit Morag, the site of 2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy intro scene ; and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) journey to Vormir, still presided over by the specter of Red Skull (Ross Marquand).
Those expeditions, as well as Iron Man and Cap’s pit stop at a 1970 New Jersey Air Force base, are marked by cameos aplenty involving the likes of Thor’s mom Frigga (Rene Russo) and former girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), Iron Man’s dad Howard Stark (John Slattery), and Cap’s eternal flame Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). Courtesy of Nebula (and a mind-meld with her past self), they also provoke a confrontation with Thanos himself, who learns of the Avengers’ plan to stop his successful future apocalypse, and endeavors to get in their way. That he does, eventually touching down on Earth to engage in what is unquestionably the most titanic superhero showdown in cinema history, featuring not only all of the aforementioned do-gooders—highlighted by Cap going mano-a-mano against the Mad Titan in an extended bout of nerve-wracking ferocity—but the “vanished,” who are resurrected (or returned from whatever void in which they were hanging out for the last half-decade) and ready for some payback.
Before that climax can take place, however, Endgame dispatches with one of its still-living A-listers: Black Widow, who like Gamora (Zoe Saldana) before her, perishes at Vormir in order to obtain the soul stone—a sacrifice she willingly makes, thereby thwarting grief-stricken Hawkeye’s desire to be the one to die. According to the rules set forth in Endgame and Infinity War , this demise (like that of Vision’s) is permanent, as evidenced by the fact that Gamora isn’t resurrected at film’s end; instead, a younger past version of Gamora winds up in the present, and takes her older dead self’s place. What that means for the impending stand-alone Black Widow film (being helmed by Cate Shortland, and co-starring Florence Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz) is anyone’s guess. But one can assume the movie won’t be set in the current MCU timeline, but rather in the past—perhaps as an origin story.
These turns of events do mean Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will boast a full roster, plus one—Thor, who at the conclusion of Endgame joins up with the ragtag interstellar team, much to the hilarious chagrin of Star Lord (Chris Pratt). That should create a cornucopia of novel comedic opportunities for writer/director James Gunn’s threequel, while Spider-Man: Far From Home (due July 2) will undoubtedly proceed as normal, now that the wall-crawler (Tom Holland) is back in high school alongside best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon). And all is well in Wakanda too, as Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) is once again on the throne, surrounded by his mother Ramonda (Angela Bassett), sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), and right-hand badass Okoye (Danai Gurira).
Of course, the “vanished” only achieve their resurrections thanks to the exploits of Iron Man, who in the climactic battle swipes the Infinity Stones from Thanos’ gauntlet and, in a snap (“I. Am. Iron Man”), turns the purple villain and his alien minions to dust. Wielding such power, however, brings about the fate fans have been dreading: with wife Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) and apprentice Spidey by his side, Iron Man dies from his Infinity Stones wounds, thus closing the book on this phase of the MCU, of which he was always the central, uniting figure.
As if that weren’t a definitive-enough ending, Cap then heads off to return the Infinity Stones to their respective timelines. Instead of reappearing seconds later as his same youthful self, he reemerges as an old man, and promptly hands over his shield—and the reins to the Captain America title and position—to Falcon (Anthony Mackie). In case the reason for his geriatric condition wasn’t already evident, Falcon spies a wedding ring on Cap’s hand. While he won’t tell Falcon about his bride, preferring to keep the memory to himself, the film immediately segues to the 1940s, the Russos’ camera gliding up to the window of a house, where inside Cap is dancing with Peggy, the two reunited across space and time for an impossible happily-ever-after. It’s a grace note that finishes Evans’ run as the character, and paves the way for Mackie to someday don the Stars and Stripes…albeit not before he completes his duty in the upcoming Disney+ series Falcon and Winter Soldier .
By permanently dispatching/retiring Downey Jr. and Evans, its two biggest characters (and stars), Endgame makes clear that some stories—even serialized ones that are as lucrative as any in entertainment history—ultimately come to an end. It’s a shrewd move that brings both decisive finality and promises unpredictable new adventures to come. And in doing so, it confirms that, regardless of whether the future MCU continues as an intertwined series of films, or functions as a looser collective of stand-alone efforts marked by the occasional crossover, the studio has set a new standard for interconnectivity—not to mention thrilling, amusing, tear-jerking, larger-than-life superhero fantasy.
Plus, it also puts to rest the burning question of who has the MCU’s best derrière. Closure, indeed. READ THIS LIST"

Plus, watch an exclusive clip from the event. 04.27.19 11:12 PM ET Tasos Katopodis/Getty
Following an amusing cold-open parody of Aliens featuring Sigourney Weaver (!) as Ripley delivering an inspirational speech to Samantha Bee’s disheveled Newt, the second annual Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner was underway.
Presented by Full Frontal and hosted by Bee, the event, which dedicated all its proceeds to the Committee to Protect Journalists, was taped on Friday night but aired on Saturday to compete with the actual White House Correspondents’ Dinner, which President Trump once again refused to attend, and whose organisers caved to the thin-skinned ex-reality show host’s demands by not having a comic this year following last year's appearance by Michelle Wolf .
“If Trump really wanted to ruin journalism, he’d put his name on it,” cracked Bee at the top of her opening monologue, before getting serious: “Thank you for holding the president—and all of us—accountable.”
In a callback to last year’s Correspondents’ Dinner, wherein White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders warped Wolf’s jokes so that she could play the victim , Bee dedicated the night’s “In Memoriam” segment to the White House press briefing, noting, “It’s been 47 days since the last briefing, which raises a very serious question: what the fuck does Sarah Huckabee Sanders do all day? Does she just lie into a mirror or… I don’t even know!”
The host was then interrupted by the night’s “humor adviser” Sarah Huckabot Sanders, a humorless robot dressed in a wig, pink football pads, and with a Southern accent. “Unacceptable! That was about my appearance! How dare you! How dare you!” the robot replied.
Bee also took a few light-hearted shots at the media, criticizing the TV news media for its inability to call things outright racist. “Let’s talk about euphemisms. If you mean ‘racist’ say ‘racist,’ not this ,” offered Bee, before airing a montage of news anchors using “racially charged” and “racially insensitive” to describe overtly racist acts—like the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh. “Things can be electrically charged or solar-charged or sexually charged, but racially charged isn’t a thing!” she exclaimed.
The night’s musical numbers, like Bee’s spin on My Fair Lady , didn’t really land—and neither did SNL alum Taran Killam’s parody of an awful conservative stand-up comic who punctuates his cringeworthy jokes with digital piano beats.
Better was Bee’s mini-roast of “sexual assaulter” Trump.
“There are so many things you could say about the president: that he’s vicious, vindictive, stupid, unattractive, unloved, and will die alone, but what can we say that Melania hasn’t already said?” cracked Bee. “So tonight, I really want to focus on what a fucking coward he is. Imagine being the most powerful man in the world and you can’t listen to a comedian razz you for five minutes? Barack Obama did it, George W. Bush did it. You know who else has been roasted? Justin fucking Bieber. Justin Bieber is braver than you and he’s a man who once let a monkey go to jail for him. And I know you technically had a Comedy Central Roast too, but that was Apprentice Donald Trump, not President Donald Trump. That’s like roasting Hitler for his use of watercolors.”
Bee then gave a list of people braver than Trump, including Christine Blasey Ford, the 23 women who accused him of sexual assault or harassment, and the undocumented immigrants who worked at Mar-a-Lago and spoke out about it.
But she reserved her toughest jokes for Huckabee Sanders. “Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ looks are the best thing about her,” said Bee. “She has shiny hair, pretty eyes, and a lovely complexion. But on the inside? Hideous as a pinworm in an anus. On the inside? That woman is 90 percent taint, and I mean that medically.”
Finally, Bee welcomed Trump nemesis Robert De Niro onstage for a final dig at the president: “I’m happy to stand with Samantha Bee tonight to support the First Amendment—the right of the president to be a relentless and unrepentant lying scumbag, the right of his supporters to not give a shit, and our right to do something about it.” "

The newest launch from direct-to-consumer suitcase brand Away isn’t a suitcase at all. It’s the Weekender , an all-encompassing bag that will be a great travel counterpart.

The Weekender comes in three colors: Black , Olive , and Natural , and features a leather bottom and accents.

Polway Synagogue Shooting Victim Jumped Between Gunman and Rabbi,www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/polway-synagogue-shooting-victim-lori-kaye-jumped-between-gunman-and-rabbi,"DIVINE INTERVENTION Polway Synagogue Shooting Victim Jumped Between Gunman and Rabbi Lori Kaye, 60, was at the Polway synagogue to pray for her dead mother. Then she saved the rabbi’s life. 04.28.19 9:57 AM ET David McNew/GETTY
Lori Kaye was at the Congregation Chabad synagogue in Poway to say a Kaddish prayer of mourning for her mother who died in November, as she often did on Saturday mornings.
But when the 60-year-old mother heard gunshots from the alleged shooter’s AR-15 style assault rifle and saw that Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein had been shot in the hand, she instinctively jumped in the line of fire to protect him, Roneet Lev, her close friend of 25 years, told CNN.
The rabbi kept preaching, calling for unity, even after two of his fingers had been severed by the gun shots, Lev recounted. But Kaye paid the ultimate price for her selflessness. She died hours later of fatal gunshot wounds from the self-described anti-Semite gunman.
Kaye’s husband, a local physician, rushed to the synagogue to administer first aide to those who had been shot the moment he heard there was an active shooter, Lev said. But when he realized that his wife was a victim, he fainted on the spot.
“She didn’t die a senseless death,” Lev told CNN. “She died advertising the problem we have with anti-Semitism and to bring good to this world ... If God put an angel on this planet, it would have been Lori.”
Among the three others seriously wounded by 19-year-old John T. Earnest, was 9-year-old Noya Dahan, who was hit by shrapnel in her leg and face. Her parents had narrowly escaped death in Israel when they were injured by rocket fire. They moved to the relative safety of the San Diego suburb eight years ago.
Israel Dahan, the injured girl’s father had three of their five children at the synagogue to pray on Saturday. He said that antisemitism was on the rise in their community; their home had been painted with swastikas a few years ago. Now, his daughter was nearly killed by a gunman inside what should have been the safety of the synagogue. “It’s a little bit scary,” he told CNN. “We’re all over the place.”
“We were under the impression that everything is good here,” he said. “Today we noticed this is not even close to be regular life.”
As he waited in the hospital for his daughter to be treated, one of his other children asked him, “Why we are staying here?” He didn’t know how to answer.
Dahan’s brother-in-law Almog Peretz, 34, was also grazed by shrapnel while trying to protect his nieces. Peretz, who was visiting from Israel to celebrate Passover with his family, is credited with opening the synagogue’s door and herding the children to safety, yelling at them to hide. Lev told CNN that the children had been so afraid, two of them were missing and still hiding 45 minutes after the gunman left.
Peretz said the shooter’s rifle jammed or there would have been far more bloodshed. Police on Saturday said they were also looking into that possibility, as well as the quick thinking of an armed off-duty border patrol agent who was working as a security guard and fired at Earnest as he fled. He struck the gunman’s car multiple times and may have stopped the carnage."

Sri Lanka has banned two Islamist groups suspected to be behind the Easter suicide bombings on churches and hotels that killed more than 250 people, the president announced on Saturday. The groups, National Thawheedh Jamaath (NTJ) and Jamathei Millathu Ibrahim, were banned under the president's “emergency powers,” President Maithripala Sirisena said in a statement. Authorities were able to ban the groups almost a week after the bombings after proving enough evidence against them, in accordance with Sri Lankan law. Police also revealed on Saturday the wife and child of the mastermind behind the bombings, Mohamed Hashim Mohamed Zahran, were wounded during the military raid in a safe house Friday night that killed 15.

Getting your design off the ground can take years of hard work. San Francisco-based company GANTRI is trying to ease that hurdle, starting with over 100 different designs of lights .
There’s a huge pain point for designers to get their work produced, and GANTRI helps take care of it. Designers submit their drawings from anywhere, they’re vetted, and if approved, produced in the brand’s San Francisco headquarters. The brand started with lights that are sleek, modern, and sculptural yet accessible to anyone. They are unlike anything I’ve seen come from a 3-D printer. The smooth lines give way to harsh angles that look more like molded glass, rather than plastic. And speaking of plastic, these are made from a sustainable, corn-based plastic. Each light also features a fully-dimmable LED bulb.
Most of them look like pieces of art, like the new PyraSphere (designed by Louis Filosa) that features a smooth sphere nestled into a pyramid base. Or the Brooklyn , for instance, that takes inspiration from the gravity water tanks that sit atop NYC buildings. And how about the Iceburg , that’s giving me serious Aggro Crag vibes.
All of these lights were designed by incredible artisans and sustainably made using the science fiction-y process of 3-D printing.

Newt Gingrich Clashes With ‘The View’ Over Trump’s Charlottesville ‘Both Sides’ Remark,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/newt-gingrich-clashes-with-the-view-over-trumps-charlottesville-both-sides-remark,"BOTH SIDES Newt Gingrich Clashes With ‘The View’ Over Trump’s Charlottesville ‘Both Sides’ Remark At one point, Gingrich tried to pivot to how there is a ‘fair amount of violence on the left.’ 04.29.19 12:58 PM ET The View/ABC
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich struggled to defend President Trump’s double-down on his Charlottesville response, clashing with the hosts of The View Monday morning, who pushed back against his assertion that Trump clearly opposed white supremacists and never subtly played any political dog whistles.
Following former Vice President Joe Biden’s official presidential campaign announcement slamming Trump for his “very fine people” equivocation about white nationalists in Charlottesville, Trump insisted his reaction was handled “perfectly” and that he was speaking about those who opposed the taking down of a monument to Robert E. Lee, who he described as a “great general.”
Claiming that it’s a “myth” spread by the left that Trump defended white supremacists and neo-Nazis at the “Unite the Right” rally, Gingrich asserted that Trump “clearly” said he was opposed to those groups in his responses to the violence.
“It’s not that clear,” co-hosts Joy Behar and Sunny Hostin both replied to cheers from the audience. Gingrich, meanwhile, declared that it was “pretty darn clear” that Trump did rebuke racists in Charlottesville’s aftermath.
“It’s not,” Hostin shot back. “His first statement is he said there was violence on many sides—on many sides. Two days later, after all the backlash, is the first time he even mentioned the KKK and neo-Nazis and then the following day, he still said, ‘You had some very bad people in that group, you also had some very fine people on both sides.’”
Gingrich called this an “interesting topic” before asking the View hosts if they were saying that anyone who finds Lee a “decent person” is inappropriate, causing Hostin and Behar to point out that the Confederate general was a “traitor to his country” and a “slave-holder.”
Co-host Whoopi Goldberg , meanwhile, attempted to find middle ground with Gingrich.
“What might have worked better if the ‘good people’ he alluded to looked at the placards and the anti-Semitic things that were written, they might have marched in a different march,” she said. “If you see that, you leave. If you’re going to march with these folks and you’re in the picture with them, it looks like you’re part of the problem.”
The former speaker and current Fox News contributor pivoted to claims that there’s a “fair amount of violence on the left” and that it’s “irrational” to say Trump is anti-Semitic since he has family that’s Jewish.
“No one said that,” Hostin pushed back. “What we said, Speaker Gingrich, is that he said ‘you had some very bad people’ in that group. You also had ‘some very fine people on both sides.’ And the suggestion somehow that he did not say that is intellectually dishonest.”
“I’m not being intellectually dishonest, I’m disagreeing with your interpretation,” Gingrich replied as the crowd cheered Hostin. “Are you literally saying that everybody who favors having those statues is somehow a bad human being?”
“If you’re marching with people wearing signs that say ‘down with Jews’ and ‘Jews are not going to take over our lives’ and you don’t step away because that’s not how you feel, you’re going to get lumped into that group,” Goldberg fired back, again to audience cheers.
Behar, meanwhile, added that just because Trump has Jewish relatives doesn’t mean that he can’t send out “dog whistles to white nationalists,” something Gingrich claimed the president doesn’t do.
Eventually, Gingrich admitted that Trump did not handle his Charlottesville response “perfectly” before saying the president “has a very powerful personality who at times steps on his own messages and makes mistakes.”"
Fox’s Judge Napolitano Fires Back After Trump Publicly Bashes Him: Is This How You Treat a Friend?,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/foxs-judge-napolitano-fires-back-after-trump-publicly-bashes-him-is-this-how-you-treat-a-friend,"Travel JUDGE THIS Fox’s Judge Napolitano Fires Back After Trump Publicly Bashes Him: Is This How You Treat a Friend? Appearing on FBN with Maria Bartiromo, Napolitano humorously asked of Trump: ‘[If] this is the way you treat your friends, how do you treat your enemies?’ Justin Baragona 04.29.19 11:31 AM ET
Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano responded to President Trump’s weekend Twitter attacks on Monday morning, denying that he asked the president for a Supreme Court spot while joking about the way Trump treats his long-time friends.
On Saturday night, the president took to Twitter to fire shots at Napolitano, who recently has said Trump is guilty of committing obstruction of justice and that the president’s behavior was “deceptive and repellent.”
“Thank you to brilliant and highly respected attorney Alan Dershowitz for destroying the very dumb legal argument of ‘Judge’ Andrew Napolitano,” Trump wrote , referencing Dershowitz’s Friday night appearance on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle.
“Ever since Andrew came to my office to ask that I appoint him to the U.S. Supreme Court, and I said NO, he has been very hostile! Also asked for pardon for his friend. A good ‘pal’ of low ratings Shepard Smith,” he concluded, taking an additional shot at Fox News anchor Shep Smith.
Appearing on Fox Business Network’s Mornings with Maria Bartiromo , Napolitano humorously noted that if “this is the way you treat your friends, how do you treat your enemies?,” prompting host Maria Bartiromo to ask whether Napolitano pushed for a Supreme Court position or a pardon for a friend.
Napolitano explained that he met with then-President-Elect Trump to discuss possible replacements for Antonin Scalia’s spot on the bench. While the judge claimed he was describing Neil Gorsuch during their conversations, Trump felt he was talking about himself and eventually asked him “why I should put you on” the Supreme Court.
“I gave him the spiel, someone else in the room said ‘That’s interesting, the judge is long in the tooth,’ to which the president said blank you to the person who said the judge is long in the tooth,” the Fox News analyst stated. “‘I’m four years older than the judge and I’m about to become president.’ It was that kind of conversation.”
In March 2017, Politico reported that Napolitano had told friends he was on Trump’s Supreme Court shortlist, noting at the time that he met with Trump twice during the transition.
As far as the pardon situation, Napolitano said they talked about a “mutual friend” of theirs and Trump was the one who asked him about the person’s conviction and whether it was just. According to the judge, Trump disagreed with the conviction and told him to call the person up and let him know he was going to be on the list of pardons he’d consider.
Napolitano concluded by calling the president’s broadside against him “brilliant” because Trump wanted to draw attention away from the Mueller report’s findings and Napolitano’s commentary about them.
“His relationship with me is not the story,” he added. “We’ve been friends for 30 years and probably will be for the next 30 years.”
Since the president’s tweets on Saturday night, Fox News itself has remained mum about Trump’s criticisms and allegations against its senior analyst. MediaBuzz , the network’s Sunday morning media analysis show, did not address it at all and the network has not provided comment on it. READ THIS LIST"
Scouted: Not All Waterproof Jackets Need to Be Raincoats — And These 8 Prove It,www.thedailybeast.com,jillian.lucas@thedailybeast.com (Jillian Lucas),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/shop-waterproof-jackets-for-spring,"Scouted By The Beast
The thought of owning a rain-only jacket is confusing to me. When it comes to outerwear, I believe that it should be versatile, and raincoats usually tend to look out of place when there isn’t any actual rain. Why turn your coat into a unitasker ? You should find a water-resistant coat that you can easily wear any day, whether or not it’s actually raining.
Not all raincoats need to look like raincoats . We’ve found a handful of outerwear pieces that you’ll be happy to wear even when there’s no rain in sight. Some of these are made from water-resistant materials like nylon and others have a water-resistant coating (DWR). Either way, all of these pieces of outerwear were made to look and feel like any other jacket, rain or shine.
Staff Jacket , $195 from The Arrivals: A streamlined, waterproof top coat is a great way to keep the water from getting onto your body and without adding bulk. This hoodless option looks more like a simple top coat than a raincoat and is perfect for days when the rain is consistent but light (which is the most annoying kind of rain, in my opinion).
Mountain Khakis Mountain Trucker Jacket , $75 from Backcounty: This DWR-treated cotton trucker jacket is perfect for those spring days where it threatens to rain at any moment, or when you get those days that the rain is more like an overall mist. Pair it with a T-shirt and jeans and you’ve got an outfit you’ll enjoy wearing out on a weekend without looking like Paddington the Bear.
Mr. & Mrs. Italy Waterproof Zipped Jacket , $1,290 from Farfetch: Mr. & Mrs. Italy originally started making waterproof parkas before expanding their style selection. This bright biker jacket is crafted from waterproof nylon and has two front pockets and two side pockets to keep your hands (and things) from getting wet. The slightly high collar can help keep those spring breezes at bay.
Pueterey Buttoned Waterproof Coat , $361 from Farfetch: It may have a “classic” raincoat sheen, but this buttoned jacket is anything but ordinary. The front flap pockets, button closure, and classic collar make this jacket more of a utility coat than a raincoat, and it should be treated as such.
The Cotton Bomber , $88 from Everlane: Yes, a bomber jacket can be a raincoat. Especially when it’s treated to be waterproof. Everlane’s attention to detail when it comes to technical-cum-everyday clothing is proven here, because this bomber is the perfect everyday topper, even in the sunniest of weather.
Hunter Boot Refined Waterproof Bomber Jacket , $219 from Neiman Marcus: Speaking of bomber jackets, this one from rain-aficionado Hunter has a silk-like finish so you can look stylish and stay dry. The elastic cuff sleeves will help keep any rogue moisture from getting in and the drawstring bottom will keep a moist spring breeze from getting all up in your business.
Voyager 3-in-1 Jacket , $150 from Eddie Bauer: This nylon blazer is reinforced with a DWR coating, plus a waterproof inner vest. You can wear it alone or together for added insulation on the days that the spring sun just isn’t cutting it. This is the kind of jacket you could wear all day as part of your outfit, rather than something you’d take off upon arriving at work.
Always Effortless Jacket , $128 from Lululemon: A high neck, a multitude of pockets, and a DWR coating all come together to make this topper a perfect companion to an early, wet morning commute. Toss this on fully-zipped to keep yourself protected from the elements, then keep it unzipped at the end of the day to make it into a simple, light jacket.

Joe Scarborough Slams Trump for Inciting White Nationalist Violence: Blood ‘Is On Your Hands’,www.thedailybeast.com,olivia.messer@thedailybeast.com (Olivia Messer),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-scarborough-slams-trump-for-inciting-white-nationalist-violence-blood-is-on-your-hands,"‘FAR BEYOND DOG WHISTLES’ Joe Scarborough Slams Trump for Inciting White Nationalist Violence: Blood ‘Is On Your Hands’ ‘The president is trying to move people to violence,’ the co-host of ‘Morning Joe’ said on Monday. 04.29.19 9:45 AM ET MSNBC
Following the shooting at a synagogue in Poway, California over the weekend, Morning Joe co-host Joe Scarborough unleashed an angry monologue on President Donald Trump early Monday, blaming him for stirring up hate and white nationalist violence through his speech at the National Rifle Association convention last week.
During his speech , the president targeted Democrats and the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for what he described as a failed “coup” attempt.
“They tried for a coup, didn’t work out so well. And I didn’t need a gun for that one, did I?” Trump told the crowd in Indianapolis. “Far-left radicals in Congress want to take away your voice, your jobs, your rights, and they especially want to take away your guns.”
Scarborough responded Monday: “The president is trying to move people to violence.”
“I know you’re trying to stir up hate and maybe even violence because of your words,” he continued. “But a coup? That’s just a lie. You know it’s a lie. You know it’s irresponsible, you know it’s just as irresponsible when you say ‘enemy of the people.'”
“We are so far beyond dog whistles here, Donald,” Scarborough said.
“The blood that is spilled is on your hands,” he continued, “from white nationalists, from people that listen to that sort of rhetoric, any violence to journalists, ‘enemy of people,’ the kill list—yes, let’s go back to the kill list. Your Justice Department let somebody that has a manifesto inspired by white nationalist killers, including a guy that slaughtered over 68 children, your attorney general and you let that person walk.”
Last week, Scarborough and his wife and co-host, Mika Brzezinski, became emotional when a self-proclaimed white nationalist facing firearms charges was released from jail—despite having allegedly made a hit list of prominent Democrats, Supreme Court justices, and TV journalists including Scarborough.
Christopher Hasson, 50 was not charged with any terrorism-related offenses , but U.S. Magistrate Judge Charles Day acknowledged last week that he had “grave concerns” about Hasson.
“We are so past dog whistles now, Donald,” Scarborough continued on Monday. “You are just inciting violence, it’s just obvious.”
“You are unfit to be president of the United States,” he noted, before adding a plea: “You can call out white nationalism. You can call out political violence. You can pull yourself back. You can restrain before there is more bloodshed. Because let me tell you, the synagogue shootings are not going to stop until you call out white nationalism by its name.” READ THIS LIST"
Moby: The Time I Drunkenly Rubbed My Penis on Donald Trump,www.thedailybeast.com,Moby,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/moby-the-time-i-drunkenly-rubbed-my-penis-on-donald-trump,"NEW YORK STORIES Moby: The Time I Drunkenly Rubbed My Penis on Donald Trump In this exclusive excerpt from his memoir ‘Then It Fell Apart,’ available April 30, the musician recounts the time he “knob-touched” the future president of the United States. exclusive Reuters
After September 11, 2001, the only way in which I knew how to process my grief was to stay drunk, do as many drugs as possible, and throw myself into whatever degeneracy flowed out of New York’s perpetually degenerate spigot. Sometimes the degeneracy was gritty and old school—cheap drugs in dive bars and sex in tetanus-y bathrooms. And sometimes the degeneracy was gilded—helicopters to Staten Island and parties with billionaires.
The degeneracy in this story was in the baffling/gilded category, with the aforementioned helicopter to Staten Island and a generic product launch party wherein I was dared to brush my drunken, flaccid penis up against Donald Trump’s suit jacket. Although, in the spirit of alcoholic disclosure, my caveat is this: as I was very drunk and high at the time I’m still not 100% sure it actually happened. But even though this happened almost 20 years ago, I’m still perpetually stunned by the fact that Americans elected as president a dimwitted con man whose only claim to fame is that he once hosted a mediocre reality-TV show.
That Time I Knob-Touched Donald Trump
By Moby
New York City, 2001
“What are you guys doing now?” he asked. “Want to go to a party?”
I was supposed to meet my friends Lee and Dale, so I asked if they could join us.
“Sure!” he said. He gave me the address of a restaurant on Park Avenue and 20th Street, which I texted to them. Larry, Clarice and I took a taxi across town to the restaurant. Lee and Dale were waiting outside—it was a party for a wealthy real-estate developer and security was strict, so they weren’t allowed in without us.
On Staten Island I’d had three glasses of champagne, three glasses of red wine with dinner, a shot of vodka before dessert, and an Armagnac digestif, so I was well on my way to getting drunk. Lee and Dale had been drinking since the middle of the day, so they were even more liquored up than I was.
“Hey!” I said, once we were inside the party. “This is where I met David Bowie!”
Clarice’s eyes widened. “You met David Bowie?”
“Actually, now he’s my neighbor. We wave at each other from our balconies.”
“What?”
“Come over later and I’ll show you,” I told her.
She smiled inscrutably.
“Dale,” I said, once we had ordered drinks, “tell Clarice about ‘knob touch.’”
“First off, you’re beautiful,” he told her.
“She’s a Miss USA runner-up,” I said, proud of my new friend.
“Okay,” Dale continued, “‘knob touch’ is when you take your penis out of your pants at a party and brush it up against someone.”
“Eww,” Clarice said, grimacing. “And that’s sexy?”
“No, no,” he said seriously, “it’s not sexual, it’s just stupid and funny. You only knob-touch their clothes, and the person you knob-touch can’t know they’ve been knob-touched.”
Clarice turned to me. “Have you done this?”
“No,” I admitted.
The party wasn’t that exciting. It was mainly full of businessmen and real-estate developers, most notably Donald Trump, who was standing a few yards away from us at the bottom of a staircase, talking loudly to some other guests.
“Moby, go knob-touch Donald Trump,” Lee said.
“Really?” I asked. “Should I?”
Donald Trump was a mid-level real-estate developer and tabloid-newspaper staple whose career had recently been resuscitated by a reality-TV show.
“Yeah,” Dale said.
“Yeah,” Clarice said, mischievously.
“Shit,” I said, realizing I now had to knob-touch Donald Trump.
I drank a shot of vodka to brace myself, pulled my flaccid penis out of my pants, and casually walked past Trump, trying to brush the edge of his jacket with my penis. Luckily he didn’t seem to notice or even twitch.
I walked back to my friends and ordered another drink. “Did you do it?” Clarice asked.
“I think so. I think I knob-touched Donald Trump.”
After a few more drinks I asked Clarice, “Do you want to come to my house and see David Bowie’s balcony?”
“That’s a pretty good pickup line. Okay.”
We got in a cab and headed down Broadway, stopping at my local deli to buy beer. The afternoon of September 11 it had been filled with people silently stocking up on water and food. Nobody knew the extent of what had happened or how bad it might get. The man standing in line in front of me was covered in gray dust from the towers. His head was bowed and he was crying quietly.
A month later the deli was brightly lit at 1 a.m. and felt almost normal. Clarice and I brought a six-pack of Sierra Nevada up to my roof and I pointed out David Bowie’s balcony across the street. A mile away and to the left of Bowie’s apartment was the gaping hole where the Twin Towers had been.
Clarice took my hand and pointed. “That’s where we were.” I realized she was right—you could see Staten Island through the space where the World Trade Center had been.
“Do you think you’ll stay in New York?” I asked.
She wrinkled her nose. “I think so. And you?”
This was the city of my birth, the city where you could meet a beautiful woman and take her to your roof to look at David Bowie’s apartment, and also the city where strangers took you on helicopter rides to Staten Island and then watched as you surreptitiously knob-touched Donald Trump.
“I don’t know what would ever make me leave,” I said.

CNN’s Van Jones Is Not Going to Apologize for Complimenting Trump: ‘I’m Proud of It’,www.thedailybeast.com,marlow.stern@thedailybeast.com (Marlow Stern),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/cnns-van-jones-is-not-going-to-apologize-for-complimenting-trump-im-proud-of-it,"IN CONVERSATION CNN’s Van Jones Is Not Going to Apologize for Complimenting Trump: ‘I’m Proud of It’ Getty The political commentator and host of ‘The Van Jones Show’ talks to Marlow Stern about his new series ‘The Redemption Project,’ taking heat from liberals, and much more. 04.29.19 7:02 AM ET
“ This is not true crime,” says Van Jones. “This is about the truth after the crime.”
The ex-Obama official turned CNN personality is discussing The Redemption Project , an original series that “seeks to heal the harm caused by crime” by uniting victims and/or surviving family members with criminal offenders. Hosted by Jones, the 8-part show debuted Sunday night at 9 p.m. on CNN—the slot formerly occupied by the late, great Anthony Bourdain .
“That’s sacred ground here, so for CNN to give these kinds of stories that kind of position is really powerful—and it’s historic,” offers Jones.
I’m seated across from Jones inside CNN’s not-so-bustling newsroom. The reason for the relative quiet is they’re currently in the process of moving from Columbus Circle’s Time Warner Center, where we are, to the new Hudson Yards complex about thirty blocks south. Most of the desks are barren, with orange moving crates by their sides.
In addition to his myriad CNN duties, Jones is an ardent activist presiding over several non-profit organizations— #YesWeCode , which teaches at-risk children to code; Green for All , that pushes for a greener economy; REFORM Alliance , aiming to fix the U.S. criminal justice system; and #cut50 , a bipartisan initiative for criminal justice reform. Jones’ work with #cut50—and, along with Kim Kardashian, personal lobbying of Trump—played a substantial role in the recent passage of the First Step Act, which seeks to reduce sentencing and recidivism by, in part, providing time credits for educational and job-training programs completed behind bars.
Jones is a star at CNN—and, dare I say it, even more handsome in person. He also has plenty he’d like to get off his chest.
How did you arrive on the premise for The Redemption Project ? Because it is very unique—and certainly a difficult one to navigate.
I think a lot of people don’t know I’ve spent 25 years of my life working on criminal-justice issues, in and out of prisons, and I’ve discovered that there are some real diamonds behind those walls—people who may have gone to prison with a bad attitude but often, in spite of the prison conditions and not because of them, can transform. I’ve met people behind bars who are wiser, stronger, smarter and with more character than 99 percent of people I’ve met not behind bars. I’ve always wanted to figure out how to let some of those diamonds shine publicly, because you’ve never seen that. Then I started noticing how the culture itself has become so toxic and negative, and it’s no longer “trendy” or “cool” to have empathy, compassion, grace, forgiveness, none of that. It’s trendy to be part of the “call-out” culture, the “cancel” culture, the “I’m gonna block you” culture, and to me that’s poison—and you can’t live that way. So I was trying to figure out a way to put some medicine into what I think is a very sick system.
And how did you land on the format?
I knew this guy Jason Cohen—an Oscar-nominated director for a film [ Facing Fear ] about a former U.S. neo-Nazi who reconciled with one of the victims of his voice—and I said, “Why don’t we take that concept even broader.” And so we found eight people who’ve done really bad things years ago and who want to make amends, who want to atone. We talked to them, got their backstory, then we talked to the people they hurt and got their backstory. Then we simply film them talking to each other face-to-face for the first time—with a facilitator, to keep it kosher.
That has the potential to be explosive.
I would say, “Don’t try this at home,” because the facilitator worked with them both for sometimes weeks, sometimes months ahead of time to make sure that when they got there, it was constructive. What we captured on film was really powerful. Since it’s never been done before, nobody’s play-acting; every word that’s uttered in all eight episodes is the authentic voice of someone who’s trying to find a voice out of hell—because the people that are in prison are in a kind of hell, and the people who are survivors of crime live in their own emotional hell for years and decades with unanswered questions.
Somebody said to me, “Why would anyone want to sit down and talk to someone who murdered their family member?” and I say, “Because, even after the verdict comes down and that person’s led away in handcuffs, you still don’t know what actually happened. All you know is the court proceedings.” So you have so many unanswered questions, and to get the opportunity to hear it from the horse’s mouth can be a step toward healing. Now, of the eight, two of them do not end in a warm-and-fuzzy place. But three of the eight, the survivors actually go and help get the person out of prison. So you have the full range of human response. I just think we have to start giving people a path back culturally.
So you think there’s a growing empathy gap nowadays. What do you think is causing that gap to widen?
And it’s getting worse and worse. [ Taps on phone ] Devices.
The cloak of anonymity that social media gives people?
All of that. First of all, people say stuff about me on Twitter that they’d never say to my face. When I DM them they’re all apologetic. Also, we think we’re programming these phones? These phones are programming us. The minute you like a couple things, swipe a couple things, share a couple things, the algorithm knows what you like, and they just start feeding you only things that you like. And you’re in the bubble. So something happens that you don’t like and you say, “Well, I’m just gonna cancel you.” I think we’ve gotten a lot of data and very little wisdom in the culture, and that’s very dangerous. This show tries to seek some wisdom.
It’s interesting timing because there’s this debate raging right now between some of the Dem candidates about letting criminals vote. Where do you fall in that debate? The Dems have fallen into different camps, with Bernie saying all criminals—even those still in prison—should be allowed to vote, while Buttigieg opposed felons voting from prison. And then some brought up how they wouldn’t want people like the Boston bomber to vote.
I think the right to vote is a fundamental human right so everyone should be allowed to vote. That doesn’t mean everyone should be allowed to wander on the streets, but everyone should be allowed to vote. Ninety-five percent of people in prison come out, and I would rather see them have a reason to keep up with current events and consider themselves to be a part of society. And by the way, something that nobody’s pointed out—not even Bernie: the census count to determine who goes to Congress includes prisoners. So you take poor black and brown people out of blue cities, put them in prisons in red counties, and those human beings count toward representation in those red counties but you’re not allowing them to vote. You’re inflating the value of the vote for white folks in red districts where there’s a prison. They get an extra congressperson but those people don’t get a vote! If you don’t want those people to vote then quit counting them in the census!
I wanted to speak with you too about the current administration’s record. You got some flack for saying they’ve done a “great” job on criminal justice reform.
I’ll say it again now if you want me to!
I’m curious why you said that, because while the First Step Act is a big step, when we talk about this administration’s track record on criminal justice reform it’s hard to divorce that from what’s going on at the border, when you talk about imprisoning families—including young children.
That’s immigration—that’s not criminal justice.
It’s still a criminal justice issue though—these are immigrants being thrown into mainly private prisons.
No, it’s not—it’s immigration, from a legal point of view. “ If you’re not willing to be as loud when they’re right as you are when they’re wrong, then I think you have zero credibility. ”
But it’s a criminal justice issue, you see what I’m getting at? It’s hard to divorce that from the Trump administration’s record on criminal justice.
I’ve done nothing but attack the Trump administration on their deplorable, despicable human-rights catastrophe on immigration—repeatedly, loudly, over and over again.
Right but these immigrants are being thrown in private prisons, and the Trump administration’s been the biggest boon for the private prison industry since ever. Obviously Obama cut off private prisons at the knees before he left office but that order was rescinded, and one year after Trump was elected president private prison stocks were up 100 percent . So when you factor in everything…
Right. Even the day he was elected they started going up.
And the First Step Act was a big first step, but the Trump administration only sought to dedicate $14 million for it in the 2020 budget, which really isn’t much.
Well now, you know just enough to be dangerous but not enough to know what you’re talking about on this. Look at what I actually said—not the liberal freak-out reaction to what I said—which is, if you point out one positive thing that the Trump administration did, people will say, well what about the 97 bad things they did? By the way, I’m on record on those 97,000 bad things that they’ve done! Every night on CNN, over and over and over again! But they were right on the legislative side of criminal justice. And if you’re not willing to be as loud when they’re right as you are when they’re wrong, then I think you have zero credibility. And what I’m seeing now is people are saying, if you’re the referee, because they had 14 fouls even when they make the shot you have to call it a foul.
But they’re fouled out of the game at that point.
I’m just saying, the bench players that are still on the court. So I refuse to back down on this. Every time they do something right, I’m going to scream, holler and cheer; and every time they do something wrong, I’m going to scream, holler and boo. And if you look at my record, 99 percent of the time I’m booing. But I am not going to be a part of this Trump-derangement syndrome that says you have to boo them even when they’re right because they’ve been wrong.
You think there’s “Trump-derangement syndrome?” That’s a pretty loaded term.
I live with it. There is a section, not everybody. Look, those of us who are opponents of Trump and Trumpism are right to be upset about all the stuff that we see. And listen, if we tried to do an interview on everything that’s wrong we’d be here until the sun came up—including transgender people being thrown out of the military when Trump wouldn’t even serve—I mean, it’s just outrageous. But you cannot have credibility if a kid turns in their homework and you say, “Well, you missed nine out of ten so I’m going to actually give you a demerit for the one you got right.”
I think for some people it’s an issue of motive: Where is this coming from? Why did he pass it, given his history? For instance, there’s this Central Park Five movie coming out…
…I’m not going to sit here and defend Trump. Why are we doing this? This has nothing to do with it.
I’m just saying that I think that’s why some people are skeptical when Trump does something like the First Step Act. They ask, “Why is he doing this?” And it may be to court the black vote, because right after that Kim Kardashian meeting in the Oval Office, where she worked to free Alice Marie Johnson, Trump reportedly told her that she was boosting his popularity with black voters . So when people are reluctant to compliment Trump over things like the First Step Act, I think they’re skeptical of his motive. But I understand that sometimes the end can justify the means.
It turns out that sometimes some politicians do things for political reasons. If we’re gonna freak out about that, then we can’t engage with any politician. So part of why I won’t back down is, we can’t lower our own standards on the left. We are fact-based. We are fairness first. And if we start going in a different direction just because our opponents have, then where is the hope? So being fact-based and fairness first means, even the team you hate, even the team that’s been cheating, if they score a proper goal, you give them the credit and you give them the applause for doing it the right way—and that doesn’t mean that the next 15 things they do aren’t wrong. What I observed was, my insistence on encouraging the good wherever I can find it then gets reinterpreted as an apology for the things that I’ve denounced louder than the people who are criticizing me. That doesn’t make any sense!
I’ve watched you a lot on CNN, and I think you do a fine job on there. One thing I really took issue with, however, was the “he became president in that moment” line following Trump’s speech to the joint session of Congress.
I’m proud of that one too.
You really are? You don’t want to take that one back?
No. I’m proud of it.
So during that speech, you don’t think that whole spiel he gave on “illegal immigrants,” and having the parents of people killed by “illegal immigrants” there, was dog-whistling?
That wasn’t what that was.
You thought it was genuine empathy he was showing for those people?
No, no . You should go back and play it—and also play the other eleven minutes where, I literally attack him for ten minutes and I say one positive thing and we’re still talking about it two years later. This is what I’m saying. Like, you’re talking about somebody who literally in the past 18 months has helped to pass 18 criminal justice bills in 10 states; helped to pass the First Step Act—25,000 people this year alone will have shorter sentences than they would have, 4,000 will come home; and we’re talking about tweets and comments on CNN.
I thought that was a big thing, though, where a lot of your fans—myself included—were like, what’s that about ?
It was two years ago.
I understand. I’m curious though about my earlier question—why you still stand by it.
I’m proud of it. First of all, it wasn’t about an undocumented person killing someone. That wasn’t what that was. Eleven minutes—ten minutes attacking him for what he did wrong in the speech, one minute praising him for what he did right in the speech. And we’re having the same conversation we just had. So I’m gonna be done with this and talk about something else. This line of questioning is why I’m doing The Redemption Project , because two years later, you’re talking to the only person in this building who’s passed not one, not two, but 18 bills—bipartisan, to help lots of people—but we’re not talking about that. I’m the only person in this building who founded not one, but two social justice organizations. But we’re not talking about that. We’re not talking about deeds, or achievements.
I only asked you a couple questions about the CNN comments—and they were comments that made headlines and attracted a lot of criticism, so I wanted to hear your side of it.
Well, what I’ll say about that is, it’s very simple: when Trump walked in that night, he was a president of the United States walking into Congress for the first time. He turns in one direction and is only shaking hands in one direction. Why? Because the Democrats won’t even go and shake his hand, because they knew—and were not wrong—that if they were caught in a picture shaking hands with Donald Trump at that point…
…political death.
Political death. Who do I blame for that? Donald Trump, and how he’s conducted himself. But as an American watching that, that was as shocking as anything I’ve seen in the formal ceremonies of American life. I thought, “We’re so broken that they won’t even shake his hand”—and they probably shouldn’t. And then he goes up there and starts giving his speech. And at no point during the speech do Democrats even feel comfortable clapping. So I said to David Axelrod, “This guy has lost the country. As far as I’m concerned, you can eulogize the presidency right now. When you can’t even get the opposing party to shake your hand, there’s something really, really wrong.” And then he found a spot in the speech where he was actually able to do something that presidents are supposed to be able to do, which is to bring some kind of unity— some kind of unity —to the country, and get everyone in accord about something. And I said, “ That was the moment.”
And then twelve hours later—tweet, tweet, tweet.
Fine. So what? You’re doing live television and you’re trying to be honest about what you’re seeing, and call it fair. I’m happy, and proud of it, and would do it again. I can’t lower my standards to deal with everybody’s freak-out. I’m a progressive—facts first, fairness first. I don’t care if you’re my worst enemy—if you say something that is true, I’m going to say it’s true. Once we start saying, “Well, you said it was true but because you’re a Republican you probably didn’t mean it so I’m going to give you a demerit anyway,” now I’m just like them.
I think your ability to compliment the Trump administration is, in a sense, a testament to your objectivity because you’re someone who should have a serious ax to grind against some of these people—especially Mike Pence, who helped run a smear campaign against you to get you booted out of the Obama administration.
Don’t stop with them! Jared Kushner, the first thing he does when his father-in-law gets elected, is he calls two doors down to Jeff Zucker and says, “Fire Van Jones and fire Ana Navarro.” And who did I work with to get the First Step Act passed? Jared Kushner. Who am I standing next to when Trump signs the bill? Mike Pence. Who wrote the check to Americans for Prosperity to build a dossier to get me out? Mark Holden and Koch Industries. Who’s standing on the other side of me when Trump signs the bill? Mark Holden. I’m literally standing there with Mark Holden, Mike Pence, and Jared Kushner while Donald Trump signs the bill and hands me the pen. Why? Because I don’t care about all this bullshit. I’m just trying to get people out of prison.
Kushner stepping in and trying to get you and Ana Navarro fired from CNN is a pretty crazy thing to do.
He gave me job security for life! [ Laughs ]
But I wanted to talk about the 2016 audit. Last month, I was down at SXSW where Jeff Zucker spoke about what happened during the 2016 election on CNN , and he had some regrets. You were in that tornado every night—along with Ana Navarro and David Axelrod—sometimes going up against three or four Trump surrogates like Kayleigh McEnany, Jeffrey Lord, and all these people who’ve since been jettisoned from the network. But I’m curious how you feel CNN handled the 2016 election? Because it felt at times like it devolved into a cafeteria-food-fight situation.
I don’t want to talk about that. Let’s talk about my show! Let’s talk about what CNN’s going to do in 2019.
Well, because we’ve got an election coming up in 2020, so I’m curious if you have any insight into how that went, and what can be done differently the next time around.
I think in 2019 we can watch my show, The Redemption Project , Sundays at 9 o’clock. It’s Anthony Bourdain’s slot and that’s sacred ground here, so for CNN to give these kinds of stories that kind of position is really powerful—and it’s historic. There’s something happening. I’m going to stop doing these interviews because everybody wants to talk about this other stuff, and I’m telling you man, people are missing it. They’re so caught up in, “Somebody said something nice about Trump!” “But Trump’s a bad person!” Like, really? We can have that conversation for another four or five years if you want to, but here’s what we’re missing."
The Obliteration of Baghouz: How Many People Died in the Last Stronghold of ISIS?,www.thedailybeast.com,Airwars Samuel Oakford,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-obliteration-of-baghouz-how-many-people-died-in-the-last-stronghold-of-isis-3,"DEATH DEALING The Obliteration of Baghouz: How Many People Died in the Last Stronghold of ISIS? It is clear the U.S.-led coalition vastly underestimated the number of civilians trapped with ISIS in its last Syrian redoubt. 04.29.19 6:52 AM ET Delil Souleiman/Getty
Their images are by now well known: the thousands of women and children who emerged from ISIS’s last stronghold, now housed in the al Hol detention camp in Northwest Syria. According to Kurdish forces, these are the wives and children of foreign fighters, and their future hangs in the balance.
Yet out of the town of al Baghouz from which they staggered—a town which the U.S.-led Coalition effectively destroyed—also came an estimated 60,000 Iraqi and Syrian women and children, survivors of the last battle of a five year air and ground campaign to obliterate the so-called Islamic State as a territorial entity.
Many questions about that battle still need answers, including why the Coalition continued to employ its massive firepower on an increasingly narrow swath of territory in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, or MERV? And why, after five years of fighting, were military planners so completely wrong-footed in their estimates of the huge civilian population still left inside Baghouz, the final redoubt of ISIS?
The Coalition’s own data illustrates the bombardment's intensity. Over a four month period, ISIS was pushed by air and artillery strikes out of a string of towns and villages—including Hajin, Kashma and al Soussa—and driven relentlessly south towards the hard line of the Iraq border at Baghouz.
Between December 16 and March 9, CJTF-OIR reported a total of 2,151 separate strikes on ISIS targets in Syria. Tracking the location of Coalition bombings has become more difficult after it stopped identifying the nearest city or town in late 2018. With the MERV the only area of Syria where Coalition-backed forces were still involved in large scale hostilities—and the only place where Airwars recorded substantial allegations of civilian harm—it’s safe to assume that the great majority of those 2,151 strikes targeted the zone. The effects were profound.
Josh Lyons, director of geospatial analysis at Human Rights Watch, has studied satellite imagery charting the path of destruction etched into the Syrian landscape by Coalition strikes along a stretch of land connecting Hajin—where ISIS was defeated in December—down to Baghouz and the Iraqi border. Though the Coalition refrained from creating a “ Highway of Death ,” by blasting every retreating vehicle off the road, the damage was nevertheless astonishing. In many places, seemingly every other building was destroyed and thousands of structures, in Lyon’s estimation, appear to have been bombed into ruin in recent sorties.
“When we look at the waves of destruction, and look at the actual number of people who survived, the larger question is how many people didn’t make it out,” said Lyons. “There needs to be an authoritative independent investigation to determine casualties.” “We have given the population a loathsome image of what a Western-style liberation may be like, leaving behind the seeds for an imminent resurgence of a new adversary.” — Col. François-Régis Legrier, French artillery commander
In response to Airwars questions about whether the Coalition’s strikes in the final months of the campaign had been focused on pushing ISIS to the Iraqi border versus destroying them en route—and whether this related to attempts to prevent civilian harm—spokesperson Col. Scott Rawlinson insisted that “a majority of the strikes conducted were isolated to eliminate Daesh [ISIS] identified by intelligence at remote locations.”
Airwars’ earlier probes, including assessments of the battles for Mosul and Raqqa , indicate that levels of civilian harm in the anti-ISIS war often tracked closely with the intensity of bombardment, along with any significant presence of civilians. Other findings suggest this trend is only worsened by intelligence failures . So did the same happen at Baghouz?
The Coalition, again breaking with past practice, will no longer provide Airwars with munition figures for the final months of fighting in the MERV. However continued heavy use of artillery and aerial firepower is readily apparent in satellite imagery of eastern Syria, and equally from witness accounts on the ground. There are also clues from Coalition members. Speaking to the AFP news agency as fighting in Baghouz began, French artillery commander Col. François-Régis Legrier said that his forces alone had fired some 3,500 rounds in the previous four months. “There were much deeper and larger craters than I’d seen in Mosul.” — Josie Ensor, Middle East correspondent for the Daily Telegraph
Legrier also took the extraordinary step of publishing an excoriating critique of the Coalition’s own tactics in eastern Syria—ones his forces helped carry out—which he described as wantonly destructive. The article in Revue Défense Nationale , which has since been removed from its website, and with Legrier reportedly facing reprimand from French authorities—focused primarily on the battle for Hajin. The French artillery colonel claimed the town could have been captured with less prolonged suffering if ground forces had played a more prominent role.
“We have massively destroyed the infrastructure and given the population a loathsome image of what a Western-style liberation may be like, leaving behind the seeds for an imminent resurgence of a new adversary,” wrote Legrier.
Reporters on the ground found evidence of where those artillery shells had fallen, and also where predominantly American aircraft had unloaded their quarter-ton bombs from the air.
“I did notice on the approach to Baghouz, in towns such as Soussa and Hajin… there were much deeper and larger craters than I’d seen in Mosul,” said Josie Ensor, Middle East Correspondent for the Daily Telegraph, who also covered earlier battles against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria. “They were about 2-3 storeys deep, which suggested to me the Coalition might have been using 500 lb Paveway IV bombs to just destroy everything moving in those towns.”
No one doubts that the majority of those trapped at Baghouz at the end were civilians who, like the ISIS fighters alongside them, now had nowhere left to flee. Whether that was always the Coalition’s intent is less clear.
“The question of whether civilians were pushed into Baghouz is a tricky one because there were different dynamics at play,” said Nadim Houry, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch, who spoke with people who fled the fighting. “On the one hand, some people were able to escape to SDF-held areas and avoid being trapped in Baghouz. But others told us that they were too scared and felt they had no choice but to move with ISIS until there was nowhere to retreat to.”
As fighting for Baghouz intensified in early February, videos showed bombs hitting all around the small area where civilians and fighters were sheltering, at times appearing to hit munitions depots. Two weeks into the fighting, Human Rights Watch documented what appeared to be ongoing mass burials in Baghouz. “Escaped civilians told us bodies were piling up in the streets by the end,” tweeted Washington Post reporter Louisa Loveluck.
SDF officials repeatedly suggested victory was close at hand, and that few fighters and civilians remained either in a warren of tunnels beneath Baghouz, or in surface encampments strewn with tents and vehicles that served as the backdrop for press reports—both of which were targeted by Coalition air and artillery strikes.
Yet the alliance’s intelligence proved completely wrong. Thousands upon thousands of women and children—and hundreds of ISIS fighters—continued to pour out of the town during pauses in hostilities.
“During the battle for Baghouz, SDF spokesmen and officials continuously expressed their surprise at the number of people,” said Hashem Osseiran, a journalist with AFP who managed the agency’s coverage from Beirut. “The large number of people still inside Baghouz was also a surprise for us journalists, who were struggling to understand how so many people could be living in what is essentially a small patch of land the size of a few football pitches.”
Meanwhile, a Western journalist who arrived at the front on March 1 described the tempo of fire inside the town: “I saw two airstrikes and felt another two in the space of about two hours,” said the reporter, who works for a large Western outlet but asked not to be named. “That is much more intense than anything I saw in Raqqa, especially when you take into consideration that the pocket in Baghouz was so small. I left the front that first night convinced nothing could possibly have survived that barrage.”
By the second week of March, those emerging from the town told reporters “about bodies, body parts in the streets of women and children.” Reporting at night, as Coalition strikes in the near-distance hit parts of the town where women and children likely still sheltered, CNN’s Ben Wedeman said, “There have probably been a very high number of civilian casualties, fatalities as a result of the ferocity of the airstrikes, the artillery, the mortars as well as the heavy machine gun fire.”
Meanwhile, aid groups expressed alarm at the number of women and children fleeing the last redoubt of ISIS. The U.N., too, appeared to be caught unaware. On February 19, its human rights office expressed concern for around 200 families it said were in the last slivers of ISIS-controlled areas. There were in fact many, many more. For those on the ground, visibility may have been limited, but shouldn’t the Coalition have known better?
“During the planning phase, it is incumbent on the military to undertake assessments on the terrain… location of infrastructure and religious sites, estimates on population and density, [and] population pattern of life,” said Sahr Muhammedally, Middle East and North Africa director at CIVIC. “We learned a lot on challenges in fighting in cities like Mosul and Raqqa. One would hope the Coalition integrated key lessons from those battles in order to reduce civilian harm.""
Yet during the roughly three month period which included the final battle in Baghouz, the Coalition reported bombing on average 54 targets every day, only just below the 56 targets bombed per day in Mosul during March 2017—a month which had seen the most intense Coalition bombardment of that city, and the highest reported civilian casualties. “Almost two years after the Coalition and its allies defeated ISIS at Mosul and Raqqa, the alliance has expressed no appetite for any official inquiry.”
Based on satellite imagery, HRW reported that “the majority of buildings in Baghouz were destroyed”—the group counted “630 major damage sites”—“during a one-month period between January 19 and February 20, a period during which large numbers of civilians were still present.” During the month and a half battle for the town, the Coalition reported that over 1,600 targets were struck in Syria by its forces—again, nearly all likely in Baghouz.
“The planes were hitting people even as they escaped—we saw them one night, up on the mountain people trying to escape, women and children and then boom, boom—two rockets right on the mountain,” said one Iraqi man who spoke with HRW .
The true civilian death toll in Baghouz remains unknown. Airwars’ current best estimate of between 326 and 850 civilians killed—based on available reporting of likely civilian deaths from December 1 to March 21— may be outweighed by the ultimate total in Baghouz alone. In a single event on March 19, for example, at least 160 civilians reportedly died, according to multiple sources.
“I have no way to ascertain how many people died,” said one aid official who recently visited a camp for survivors. Those who spoke to Ensor, the Telegraph correspondent “talked about seeing piled up bodies” in Baghouz. The main encampment in the town was off limits in the final days of fighting, she said, which some surmised was “because the clean-up of bodies had been going on.”
Others offer a contrary perspective, with one Western reporter telling Airwars: “I think, actually, miraculously, most women and children got out alive. I think being in tunnels saved most of them. Most were suffering from malnutrition and cold rather than injury. [Al Hol] camp authorities said there was only an uptick in people arriving with trauma wounds in the last week of the offensive. No one I spoke to of dozens of women who came out mentioned that their children or friends had died in airstrikes.“
Most of the women and children who emerged from Baghouz were sent north by the SDF to a camp for displaced persons called al Hol, in Hasakah governorate. From a population of some 10,000 in December, al Hol swelled to house 45,000 by the end of February. The camp currently holds at least 73,000 women and children, as international agencies warn of dire conditions within .
But was everyone in Baghouz associated with ISIS? According to recent accounts, some of the foreign women have had to be separated from their Iraqi and Syrian counterparts at al Hol, “many of whom fled the Islamic State,” as T he Washington Post reported .
Formerly enslaved Yazidi women who escaped Baghouz were also brought to al Hol, said ICRC President Peter Mauer, who visited the camp in March. “Because they can't prove who they [the women] are they are basically put in detention-like facility in camps,” he told a group of reporters in New York earlier this month.
That so many were able to escape Baghouz was due primarily to the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Coalition’s Kurdish-dominated proxies in eastern Syria. SDF-orchestrated pauses in the battle allowed tens of thousands to escape.
“The SDF paused fighting multiple times to allow civilians an opportunity to get out of harm's way,” Coalition spokesperson Col. Scott Rawlinson told Airwars. “They were extraordinarily good stewards of their duty to protect civilians from danger and conducted their engagements professionally and responsibly.”
Dareen Khalifa, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, recently travelled to eastern Syria and spoke with the SDF leadership. These high-ranking officials, she said, couldn’t give a clear answer on why intelligence was so poor. Khalifa did get the impression, however, that the SDF was—possibly to a greater extent than the Coalition due to local considerations—more cautious in their tactics.
“This has always been a strategic decision from the SDF, especially in the final battles,” said Khalifa. “There was a lot of back and forth between them and the Coalition, but they were very consistent on not wanting to get dragged into what was going to be a massacre with large civilian casualties,” she said.
It may be a long wait before the real toll for civilians and ISIS fighters at Baghouz is understood. As time passes, it becomes more difficult to piece together individual stories, or determine where someone was killed in the final months of fighting. Almost two years after the Coalition and its allies defeated ISIS at Mosul and Raqqa, the alliance has expressed no appetite for any official inquiry into the thousands of civilians credibly reported killed in those cities.

The Secret to Le Bernardin’s Award-Winning Wine Program? Female Sommeliers,www.thedailybeast.com,Jordan Salcito,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/star-sommelier-aldo-sohm-reveals-the-secrets-to-new-york-restaurant-le-bernardins-award-winning-wine-program,"The Secret to Le Bernardin’s Award-Winning Wine Program? Female Sommeliers Courtesy Francesco Tonelli We chatted with Aldo Sohm, who was named best sommelier in the world in 2008, about his wine program at New York’s legendary restaurant Le Bernardin and his diverse team. Jordan Salcito 04.29.19 5:16 AM ET
A ldo Sohm is the wine director of famed French seafood restaurant Le Bernardin in midtown Manhattan and a partner in his eponymous wine bar next door. While you might not guess given his humility, Aldo is one of the most decorated sommeliers in the world. In 2008, he earned the title Best Sommelier in the World, preceded by Best Sommelier in America (2007) and Best Sommelier in Austria (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006).
Aldo’s wine program at Le Bernardin won the James Beard Award for Outstanding Wine Service in 2009, and is consistently counted among the best programs in the world. Last November, Le Bernardin was top restaurant in the world as judged by La Liste . And that’s not to mention that since opening its doors in 1986, Le Bernardin is the only restaurant to exclusively garner four stars from the New York Times .
Aldo and I sat down recently to discuss his approach to hiring and empowering a diverse team.
Jordan: “Recently, you mentioned to me that you have a nearly all-female sommelier team, and that in the past you’ve had exclusively all-female sommelier teams. Can you tell me about how that came about?”
Aldo: “Well there are a number of reasons. First, I’m a firm believer that women taste wine better than men do. There’s no doubt about it. Men just have a hard time admitting it! We men make it up with training, we make it up with ego. We men care about ‘is the ‘96 vintage better than the ‘04.’”
Jordan: “Men like to qualify things.”
Aldo: “Yes. And women care less about that. Take my girlfriend Catherine, for example. She could care less about what’s on the label. She just wants to drink something delicious. She has an excellent palate. She can tell you the truth without putting ego into it or being swayed by a brand or a vintage.
One day she and her girlfriends asked me to do a wine tasting. I told them I’d taste with them under one condition: we taste blind. I asked them to be honest and to tell me one thing only—do they like the wine or not? So I pulled a bottle of Roulot Bourgogne Blanc, a bottle of Grüner Veltliner, and just to mess around with them I put a bottle of Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio in there. It’s one of the biggest selling brands in the United States. Highly successful. Sommeliers have an opinion on it—and you know what? It doesn’t matter. The fish has to like the bait, not the fisherman.
My girlfriend warned me—and, of course, as a man I didn’t want to listen, and sure enough—they liked the Pinot Grigio the best. And I was in shock.”
Jordan: “Wow! I am in shock as well.”
Aldo: “Yes—and I said why? And they said, this wine we can drink. The other two wines are too complicated; they distract from our conversation. So I did a similar test with red wines. I [poured] ‘96 Alain Graillot Crozes-Hermitage—sommeliers would have gone crazy. But this group hated that wine with a passion.”
Jordan: “Because it’s so full of personality?”
Aldo: “It’s just…there are so many layers. I gave them Malbec on the side, they loved it. And you know, at the end of the day I said, ‘I’m afraid, I learned more than you did today!’
The reason, to come back to your question is, I believe, that women are better tasters. They are more thoughtful, more intuitive. That is one of the reasons why I had, until two years ago, a team of seven sommeliers—all of whom happened to be women. I personally don’t care whether they’re men or women—I believe in the best person for the job. They have to be good. They have to be passionate. They have to be humble. They have to be curious. And then I look always for a certain special quality—I have to be able to connect with that person, to be able to talk to them and really enjoy working with them.”
Jordan: “Because you’re spending at least 12 hours a day at work?”
Aldo: “But also from a guest’s perspective, you want to have someone who is talking to you and you know that you can trust that person—what that person tells you to drink, you drink. That’s ultimately the goal.”
Jordan: “Can you talk a little bit about the training programs at Le Bernardin or the Aldo Sohm Wine Bar?”
Aldo: “The process at the wine bar is a little simpler, more casual, because it’s more informal than LB. Now with the team I did one thing, I set up a system where they all train with each other.”
Jordan: “And what does that look like?”
Aldo: “They study with each other. They have tasting groups, they have family meal and they talk about different wines—then one goes to travel to a winery and shares her experiences there. And I do wine class with them every Thursday. We talk about not only about the wines on the list but also about broader topics and issues. Last week, we talked about reduction. What is it, how does it smell and how does it show in certain different wines? We really fine slice those layers of how oxidation and reduction differ. I show them premox [premature oxidation], wine faults, corked wines. But I also share experiences I accumulate every day. I review them myself on a daily base when I go back home to Brooklyn on the subway.”
Jordan: “You review your day in your mind and grade yourself?”
Aldo: “This is a ritual I always do. I think about what I did well, what I could have done better.”
Jordan: “A number of people on your team have very compelling side hustles.”
Aldo: “I always say, look, you need to realize one thing—your career cannot rely solely on the reputation of this restaurant. How strong is your own brand? You ultimately have to create your own, outside of the work you do here.”
Jordan: “That’s very powerful and quite uncommon for a boss to encourage personal brand-building, especially at such a high-stakes and esteemed restaurant.”
Aldo: “It’s important to bring them to the next level if you want to keep them engaged and committed to the restaurant. I’ll use the examples of the people who work with me now for a while. At Le Bernardin, Katja Scharnagl has worked with me for eight years, Sarah, Maya and Marie for four-and-a-half. Cameron for four years. Marie and Sarah have built strong businesses outside of the restaurant, but they still stay with me. Now I have three guys on the team as well. It’s interesting, coming from an all-female team because my all-female team set the culture that still exists.”
Jordan: “Can you talk about how?”
Aldo: “By having an all-female team all of a sudden you have no more ego. No ‘I sold the bigger bottle than you’—that’s completely irrelevant. No, they share among each other. They communicate much stronger among each other. So this dynamic is the culture now, and it remains even when we add in a few junior men.” “ By having an all-female team all of a sudden you have no more ego. No ‘I sold the bigger bottle than you’—that’s completely irrelevant. ”
Jordan: “It’s about communication.”
Aldo: “Always. Back to brand building, it’s imperative that they take on responsibility because it’s important to see that success entails hard work. You have to have initiative, you have to chase things. You know that.”
Jordan: “Yes. And can you talk a little bit more about this? Because you are setting a new standard. And it’s worth noting here that Le Bernardin is unrivaled in its excellence and its awards. No other restaurant in America has upheld these standards of excellence more consistently for as long as Le Bernardin. Do you think we can credit co-owner, Maguy Le Coze, for this in large part?”
Aldo: “Absolutely. No question! She is unbelievable. She is the most impressive boss I’ve ever worked for or with. Alan Richman wrote about her recently in the New York Times and I think he captured her more than anyone. She knows everything. She measures your performance on the floor, your precision, your ability to deal with critical situations, personal issues and your coworkers. In the background she knows the numbers. She listens to customers who give feedback. She checks every invoice. And her discipline—that’s the most impressive part. I always tell her that German generals are sloppy by comparison. She is also incredibly fair. She takes care of you. It’s something I have never seen before. She demands a lot, but she also gives. And that’s the most impressive part. She is the gold standard.”
Jordan: “Did Maguy encourage your studies to become Best Sommelier in the World?”
Aldo: “Yes, of course! I remember after I won, I spoke to her and she screamed on the phone—out of happiness.”
Jordan: “And how do you maintain these standards of excellence while also encouraging your team to build their own brands and grow? Presumably when it means that they’re spending a bit less time at the restaurant? How do you make that work?”
Aldo: “You know, here’s the thing: we evolve. Times change. Look, why do restaurants have such large sommelier teams right now especially the highly starred restaurants? It’s that the service team becomes younger and younger. Back in the day, when I came to New York, every captain, every front waiter knew a lot about wine. That is not always the case anymore. Part of it is because we do have a new generation of young, hungry sommeliers that has reduced the professional need for non-wine service staff to be quite as educated on that topic, but it is definitely a different environment from before.”
Jordan: “How do you manage that?”
Aldo: “You have to have anchors who keep everything together. But also, you know, you have the minimum wage increased and that becomes incredibly difficult. Not having too much overtime now becomes critical. And young people, they really insist on their free time. It’s a generational change. Back in the day, people like me they’d work five doubles, and would be upset if they lost a shift!
Again that changed, that mentality changed. And I realized that. So, I noticed, and I evaluated—where are their values? What is important to them and what does it take for me to keep them happy and keep them tied into the restaurant? Every great restaurant needs consistency.
So that’s why I like to keep this team as happy as possible. Of course, you have to keep them focused. But, if there are some personal problems, I pull them aside and talk with them after service.
I want to be compassionate. It excites me when my team becomes successful. I was asked recently by a German journalist, what has been your biggest victory? In Austria, I was a teacher for an educational program called Young Sommeliers. Eventually they created the first Young Sommelier Competition, and I trained three women for this very intense competition. One backed out two weeks prior because she was too freaked out—and the other two went and took first and second place.
Motivating yourself is one thing. Motivating others and getting them to that level is totally different. And that to me was the biggest victory. It’s the same thing I’m trying to do with my team at Le Bernardin now. When Marie came to me about creating her wine label Colete I thought, yes! Follow your passion! For Sarah Thomas, when she came with Kalamata’s Kitchen , I supported her, and I said you’ve got to do that! She now works part-time, which we’ve never done before! However, I told her: when you are on the clock at Le Bernardin, you are at Le Bernardin. You’re 100 percent here.”
Jordan: “But it’s worked! Because she knows the list and knows the systems?”
Aldo: “She knows the list and she is actually excited to come here. What good does it do to me when they move on and go somewhere else?”
Jordan: “Can you talk a little bit about Katja, the head sommelier at Le Bernardin?”
Aldo: “Katja is my anchor. My introduction to Katya came through friend, who is a watch journalist. He a very critical customer, very demanding. It’s all about precision with him, obviously. He sent me her resume and mentioned that she wanted to work in New York. But you see, Europeans think working in New York is like Sex and the City —again we all know this is a fantasy, not reality.”
Jordan: “Like going to Austria means floating down the Danube…”
Aldo: “Yeah and, you know, singing The Sound of Music in the Alps. So, he sent me her resume and she had referenced my biggest mentor, Helmut Jörg. So I called him. He said to me, ‘it’s very simple: she is like you. Once she signs up for that job, she is on that job.’ She’s—we have a slang word in German for that— octifle . Katja loves to work. You can rely on her hundred percent.
But when it comes to studying, she can procrastinate. And I know she won’t mind me saying this! For example, she is an excellent baker. And so, I said no more dinner parties, no more cookies, no more cake! Study. And, again, I could have said nothing. But I knew where she wanted to grow.”
Jordan: “Because you knew her goals and her ultimate ambitions from the outset.”
Aldo: “Ultimately, yeah. I knew she couldn’t achieve it without encouragement, so I started pushing her. Some people have more confidence, some people lack confidence who are absolutely brilliant. So I remember I sat outside with her before she flew for her Advanced exam. She was very nervous. And I said: you should be scared right now about the Master Sommelier exam, because this is just a step!”
Jordan: “And did that shift her perspective?”
Aldo: “She looked at me and said ‘do you think I’m able to get that one?’ And I looked at her and I said, ‘of course, that’s why we’re doing this!’ And the Advanced exam, for her, was a breeze.”
Jordan: “Do Americans just have bigger egos?”
Aldo: “Every person is different. Humility is important. My girlfriend asked me recently ‘why do you do so much mentoring in your free time?’ I said, that’s an excellent question and you probably will never understand my answer, but I was very fortunate that people helped me in their free time. I think it’s only fair, as a sign of respect, to offer this to others as well.”
Jordan: “And it elevates the wine community.”
Aldo: “I think so. You know, together—this is actually an American thing—together we’re strong, the more you build this up, the more you can elevate. By the way, didn’t I train you, too?”
Jordan: “Yes, before I sat for my Master’s exam. You trained me down downstairs in Le Bernardin on a Sunday, your day off.”
Aldo: “So I do this, too, with everyone who works with me. Look, the reason why I’m pushing them all so hard is that you have to build off your experience at Le Bernardin. You can utilize it, of course, but you have to bring something to it as well. Life is not only taking, it’s giving.
And then these different aspects of your career start communicating with each other, and that’s ultimately what you want to get into. So I push that mentality onto my team, and make sure they stay with me. I mean who has that track record? I’m proud that people stay for so long because like Bobby Stuckey said [ in a Daily Beast article on sommeliers ], three years is typically the lifespan of an employee these days.”
Jordan: “And it’s not like this is an easy place to work.”
Aldo: “Not at all, we’re full-on. We have extremely high standards, but we treat each other with respect. The example comes from the top—chef Eric Ripert and Maguy Le Coze have built an institution here, and it is up to us to maintain and elevate it for them.”
Jordan: “You also don’t make mistakes very often.”
Aldo: “Mistakes don’t sit very well with us. And if mistakes are made, which they inevitably are, how you handle and fix them is key. I train them for that. A mistake can be an opportunity to get to know a guest better, if handled correctly.” “ If mistakes are made, which they inevitably are, how you handle and fix them is key. I train them for that. A mistake can be an opportunity to get to know a guest better, if handled correctly. ”
Jordan: “This sounds like a good model for future or current restaurateurs who are worried about labor cost, turnover, all of the very real problems that make our industry so difficult. You’re making a very compelling argument for curating and training a team that learns discipline by providing extraordinary service to guests and is in turn pushed to build their own brands that allow them to grow, ease overtime costs, and give back to the restaurants.”
Aldo: “And you have to live it for them. You cannot bless water and drink wine. Look, even I have to evolve. Last year, I realized wine prices from certain areas are climbing up, up, up. I am fortunate—I was able to afford the Chaves and the Roumiers and Roulots and the DRC’s during my studies—not every afternoon, but once or twice a year. That’s obviously changed.
I raised a team meeting to discuss natural wine, which could work at Le Bernardin. But it’s complicated because Eric Ripert’s food is so clean. And then we discovered the whole Iberian Peninsula—and I’m talking about the New Spain not the classics.”
Jordan: “Yes! José Pastore’s portfolio…”
Aldo: “Exactly. Or Olé from Patrick Mata. Because, look, when you’re 25 and come for the first time into Le Bernardin, you’re not going to spend $500 on a bottle of Chambolle-Musigny. So, what can we offer that important client? Something really cool that the sommelier is 100-percent excited about? You have to have a $50 bottle of wine that’s delicious.”
Jordan: “What books do you recommend to servers who tell you they want to learn more about wine?”
Aldo: “It is a good question, for sure the Oxford Companion by Jancis Robinson. Also, Windows on the World by Kelvin Zraly.”
Aldo: “Yes. And there’s a 24-Hour-Wine-Expert by Jancis Robinson. This book is packed with information and probably took her the most time to write.”
Aldo: “One more thing about my team: Diversity is important to us. It is absolutely key.”
Jordan: “And we live in New York, an ecumenical city with so many different cultures and perspectives. You bring Austrian discipline and focus.”
Aldo: “We’re stronger because of a diversity of perspectives. Everybody brings extra input. And then we have this powerful cocktail of a team to which everybody contributes and you elevate the entire product. Marie is from France, Sarah is from Pennsylvania even though her parents are from India. Then you’ve got Gili from Israel, then we have Katja who is from Austria, then we have Cameron who is from America, Maya is from Brazil, then we have now Barbara who is from Queens ,New York, but her parents are from China. And you can cater to all sorts of clients. The different cultural backgrounds we have represented mean that we can make a huge array of guests even more comfortable. We can relate. So look, you bring business in because, how many Israeli sommeliers are out there in New York? How many Indian sommeliers? How many Austrian or Chinese? Not that many. That diversity is the key.
Here you have to be on. This is like the Super Bowl every day. Every person with a smartphone is a critic. You have to perform, you have to execute but nothing you know is as important or authentic than when you’re happy. When you have a genuine smile. And when you can look at people and know what they want before they do. And the customer can read if their sommelier is excited to see them. That’s my team.”
Jordan Salcito is a veteran sommelier with a decade spent in the dining rooms of James Beard and World’s 50 Best recognized Eleven Madison Park and Momofuku. She is the founder of organic Italian grapefruit wine spritzer Ramona and also Bellus Wines.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Becomes a Bona Fide Movie Star in Netflix’s ‘Knock Down the House’,www.thedailybeast.com,amy.zimmerman@thedailybeast.com (Amy Zimmerman),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-becomes-a-bona-fide-movie-star-in-netflixs-knock-down-the-house,"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Becomes a Bona Fide Movie Star in Netflix’s ‘Knock Down the House’ Netflix The Netflix doc, premiering May 1, won the Festival Favorite award at Sundance and was acquired for $10 million. And if you thought AOC was big before, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet. Amy Zimmerman 04.29.19 5:15 AM ET
K nock Down the House is at once an intimate portrait of four female candidates and a compelling look at the political big picture. The film, which is directed by Rachel Lears and set to premiere on Netflix on May 1, chronicles outsider candidates during the 2018 midterm elections. Near the opening of the doc, confessional-style videos of the film’s stars—Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Amy Vilela, Paula Jean Swearengin and Cori Bush—flood the screen, only to be joined by more and more videos from candidates across the country. These candidates, who each have intensely personal reasons for suspending their lives to run for office, quickly blur into a movement far bigger than one race or cult of personality.
The four women at the heart of the film are running against powerful incumbents. They campaign on issues like healthcare for all and raising the minimum wage, on fighting for working-class families and providing drinkable water and breathable air to their would-be constituents. Collectively, they’re waging war against political insiders who seem more interested in pleasing wealthy corporations than representing their own constituents; a system of entrenched power that makes it near impossible for “average” voters to see a candidate like themselves on the ballot, let alone in office. All four candidates provide a template on how to run for office—without taking corporate or lobbyist money—on issues that connect with their communities.
One of them, Ocasio-Cortez, proves that this strategy can win .
Knock Down the House is also blissfully Trump-light, recognizing that our country’s political dysfunction goes far deeper than our current president. In a memorable scene, Ocasio-Cortez picks apart her opponent Joe Crowley’s mailer . The flyer, which the powerful Democrat sent out to voters, mentions “Trump three times, commitments zero times.” Ocasio-Cortez notes that the mailer illustrates Crowley’s “insider” status, favoring empty rhetoric over actionables.
Ocasio-Cortez is the undeniable star of the film . Her story gets the most screen time—and for good reason. It’s fascinating to watch the early days of her campaign, as the would-be congresswoman who’s now a household name juggles small living room fundraisers with her bartending day job. Knock Down the House follows her through the restaurant kitchen and on the subway, in her apartment and campaigning on the streets. In bits and pieces, we learn more about the candidate soon to be known as AOC.
For one, she never saw herself running for office. Ocasio-Cortez, Vilela, Swearengin and Bush were all recruited by political action committees Brand New Congress and Justice Democrats. The organizations aim to eke out a new path to political office, disrupting the political status quo by encouraging everyday Americans to run.
Ocasio-Cortez, who was nominated by her brother, is attuned to the needs of her community and how they’ve been failed by their current representatives. She explains that she started waitressing because her family was on the verge of losing their home, and she had student loans to answer to. “You just do your best to survive,” she continues. “That’s been the reality for so many people in this country… they feel like no one’s fighting for them.”
In addition to charting Ocasio-Cortez’s historic campaign, the documentary traces a personal arc as she gains confidence in her message and her candidacy. At first, Ocasio-Cortez is fighting an uphill battle, and doesn’t seem quite convinced that she’s the person to do it. Knock Down the House doesn’t sugarcoat just how hard it is to come up against a Democratic powerhouse like Joe Crowley. No established New York Democrat would risk upsetting Crowley, who hasn’t faced a primary challenger in 14 years. Just to get on the ballot, Ocasio-Cortez explains, they’ll need to collect far more than the 1,250 signatures that are technically required. “Joe Crowley has appointed every board of elections judge,” she sighs. “Because we’re challenging the boss, we need to collect 10,000 signatures.”
Ocasio-Cortez says that the most common question she gets when campaigning is “why you?” “Literally anybody could,” she explains, “because the alternative is no one.” This sentiment is perfectly visualized during an early community debate where Crowley sends a representative in his stead. Ocasio-Cortez turns this obvious slight to her advantage, absolutely obliterating her no-show opponent. You can feel the crowd turning against Crowley; as his surrogate demurs on yet another question, saying Crowley would need to be present to fully explain his position, audience members shout out “he’s not here.” At the end of the debate, Ocasio-Cortez hammers home that “for once, we have a choice.” The crowd seems ready for one. Afterwards, she stays behind to take more questions and listen to the concerns of Crowley’s constituents. “ This whole time, he’s going to tell me I can’t do this. He’s gonna tell me I’m small, I’m little, I’m young, I’m inexperienced… ”
As enthusiasm for AOC continues to rise, with people across the country taking notice, Crowley finally deigns to debate Ocasio-Cortez. Pre-debate footage offers a fascinating, intimate window into Ocasio-Cortez’s psyche, as she hypes herself up—to herself—as a formidable opponent. “I need to take up space,” she says, stretching her arms out wide in her small apartment. “This whole time, he’s going to tell me I can’t do this. He’s gonna tell me I’m small, I’m little, I’m young, I’m inexperienced,” she recites. But she’s ready. “I am debating on behalf of the movement tonight. This is not about electing me to Congress, this is about electing us to Congress.”
Throughout the film, director Rachel Lears illustrates how the four candidates lift each other up. They live geographically disparate lives and campaign on a number of different key issues. Cori Bush is a registered nurse and ordained pastor running for Congress in Missouri, in “the district where Mike Brown was murdered.” She’s running in a place that has been represented by one single family since 1969. In Las Vegas, Amy Vilela is campaigning to fix a broken health-care system. Vilela’s 22-year-old daughter Shalynne went to the ER in pain and couldn’t provide proof of insurance. After she was discharged, she passed away from a pulmonary embolism. “I’m not going to allow my daughter to have died for nothing,” Vilela explains. And in West Virginia, Paula Jean Swearengin, who comes from a long line of coal miners, is running against a senator who takes big money from the coal industry and fights against its “demonization” in Washington. “If another country came in here, blew up our mountains and poisoned our water, we’d go to war—but industry can,” Swearengin intones.
There’s a palpable sense of solidarity between these struggles. In an early meet-up for potential candidates, Ocasio-Cortez exclaims “our future is in this room.” At a later convening of the “outsider” candidates, Swearengin urges, “Let’s take our lives back.”
Together, these candidates are an even stronger threat, and career politicians start to take notice. In the late stages of the campaign, a member of Vilela’s team points out that their opponent has received money from Joe Crowley, AOC’s incumbent. “If Amy wins against the establishment Dem,” they wryly note, “things look a little more hopeful for the scrappy fighter from the Bronx.” After Vilela loses her election, she tells Ocasio-Cortez on the phone that “some of us have to get through.” “For one of us to make it through, a hundred of us need to try,” Ocasio-Cortez replies.
The final act of the documentary is dedicated to Ocasio-Cortez’s unexpected triumph. Even as her campaign gained steam, few thought she could actually unseat Crowley. We watch Ocasio-Cortez vote, flanked by her partner and mother. It’s an emotional scene; as Ocasio-Cortez previously made clear, “It will never be the same after Tuesday, no matter what the outcome.” A vulnerable AOC explains that she’s worried about letting down the volunteers and community members who rallied around her, saying, “I get scared of the cynicism that could result from people really believing in something, and then it not working out.”
In the car to her election-night party, Ocasio-Cortez doesn’t want to hear any results—and then she sees press flocking to the venue. Running into the crowded space, she quickly breaks out into an expression of pure disbelief. First she’s in the lead, and then she’s won the race. People are shouting, hugging, and crying. Ocasio-Cortez somehow manages to stay on message, saying, “We met a machine with a movement.”
But the documentary doesn’t end at the victory party. Instead, it closes on a quiet moment five days later, as Ocasio-Cortez and her partner visit D.C. and survey her future. Silently crying, Ocasio-Cortez tells the camera about a trip she and her late father took to the Capitol Building when she was young. “He pointed at everything, and he said, you know, this all belongs to us. This is our government, it belongs to us, so all of this stuff is yours.” "
The Millions Amazon Spends to Protect Jeff Bezos,www.thedailybeast.com,Casey Coombs,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-security-the-millions-amazon-spends-to-protect-its-founder-and-ceo,"PRIMED The Millions Amazon Spends to Protect Jeff Bezos From retired Marines to a bulletproof office, Amazon pulls out the stops to keep the world’s richest man safe. 04.29.19 5:15 AM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Photos Getty
Earlier this year, Amazon installed bulletproof panels in founder and CEO Jeff Bezos ’ Seattle office, perched in a glittering high-rise on the company’s urban campus.
Designed to withstand multiple shots from a military assault rifle, the inch-and-a-half thick fiberglass panels meet the highest level of bullet and blast resistance, according to the manufacturer .
Started last spring, the project only cost Amazon $180,000, according to building permits filed with the City of Seattle, but it demonstrates the lengths Bezos is willing to go to guard against real or perceived threats as his public profile grows .
An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.
Amazon spends $1.6 million a year protecting Bezos when he’s outside company facilities and not traveling for work. It’s among the largest personal security budgets that public companies report paying to protect their CEOs, according to proxy filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Apple spent about $310,000 on personal security services for CEO Tim Cook last year, while Oracle set aside just over $1.6 million to protect CEO Larry Ellison.
Facebook’s executive security budget has swelled as “ negative sentiment ” toward the company has grown. The social networking company dropped $9.6 million on CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s protection last year, plus a $10 million pre-tax allowance to cover any additional costs related to the tech chief and his family’s security.
“These numbers are certainly justified knowing the climate of our world today and especially with our technology and social media advancements,”said Arnette Heintze, founder and CEO of Chicago-based risk and management consultancy Hillard Heintze, whose clients include Fortune 500 companies. “But I will tell you that [in the case of Bezos] a budget of $1.6 million is a drop in the bucket for the security challenges these executives are confronting.”
But Bezos has challenges most other executives don’t—mostly notably from hostile tabloids and foreign powers with sophisticated intelligence services.
The Saudi Arabian government unleashed a torrent of social media attacks on Bezos after Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in a Saudi consulate in October. The Bezos-owned Post exhaustively reported emerging details that pinned the murder on an assassination squad ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In January, the National Enquirer joined the public assault, exposing Bezos’ then-secret love affair using text messages from his cellphone.
After the Enquirer ’s story broke, Bezos gave his longtime security consultant Gavin de Becker a blank check to find out how the tabloid had obtained his compromising photos and racy texts.
The Enquirer ’s parent company, AMI, soon found out about the investigation and threatened to blackmail Bezos with the release of additional revealing photos if the Amazon chief and de Becker didn’t publicly state that they had “no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AMI’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.”
De Becker concluded that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia pilfered Bezos’ private information .
Much of Amazon’s security operations that protect Bezos aren’t broken out separately in SEC filings.
Amazon has in recent years started beefing up security for Bezos’ top lieutenants, Worldwide Consumer chief Jeff Wilke and Andy Jassy, who heads Amazon’s cloud business.
The Seattle company spent about $75,000 to protect Jassy and Wilke outside company facilities and business trips last year, more than double their security expenditures in 2017.
Last year, Wilke’s office was outfitted with bulletproof glass, blast-resistant doors, and panic buttons as part of a $3.4 million high-security renovation project.
An elite group of guards known as Executive Protection Agents is charged with protecting senior executives.
Current agents, who have backgrounds in the Marines, U.S. Secret Service, and on SWAT teams, execute security and logistical plans when senior executives travel or make public appearances, evacuate them during workplace crises, and maintain a database of communications and personnel who pose potential threats to the executives, according to a recent job posting for the position.
Bezos and his ex-wife, MacKenzie, were shadowed by a brawny guard with an earpiece at the grand opening of Amazon’s terrarium-like Spheres building last year. Similar-looking men flanked Bezos after Amazon’s annual shareholder meeting a few months later.
Amazon’s more than 45,000 corporate employees in Seattle rely on an army of low-level security contractors paid to protect them and the more than 10 million square feet of office space they occupy.
Bill Pola, a former Amazon security contractor, managed a team of the guards posted at the entrance of every building. He investigated incidents like theft, vandalism, and occasional violence on the campus using video surveillance of employees scanning their name badges at turnstiles, elevators, and other secured areas equipped with card readers.
“In addition to those first-line folks, you’ve got roving response teams to provide backup to any incidents,” he said.
The contractors are restricted from certain parts of the buildings, including the floor on which Bezos works in the 37-story Day 1 tower, he said.
In addition to office safeguards and security personnel paid for by Amazon, there are transportation and home protection costs that likely come out of Bezos’ own pocket.
Bezos travels on a Gulfstream G650 private jet, valued at $65 million, which he purchased through his holding company Poplar Glen in 2015.
His Seattle-area home is worth nearly $80 million, according to the King County Assessor’s office, and Bezos paid $23 million for the former Textile Museum in Washington, D.C. Securing these properties and Bezos’ numerous other estates can be costly.
“You’ll find that many individuals with significant wealth like that don’t even cross the threshold of trying to get the corporation to pay for it,” Heintze said. “They just pay for it outright.” READ THIS LIST"
Salute to the Kind of Leader From Delaware Our Nation Needs,www.thedailybeast.com,michael.daly@thedailybeast.com (Michael Daly),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/christopher-slutman-joe-biden-and-a-salute-to-the-kind-of-leader-from-delaware-our-nation-needs,"PRINCIPLES TO UNITE US Salute to the Kind of Leader From Delaware Our Nation Needs Protector, defender, ready to put his fellow Americans’ welfare over his own always—this is not Joe Biden, but Marine and FDNY firefighter Christopher Slutman, laid to rest Friday. 04.29.19 5:14 AM ET Spencer Platt/Getty
The state of Delaware bestowed on us a leader guided by the principles that could reunite our divided nation.
But 43-year-old Christopher Slutman was not a politician like Joe Biden of Delaware and the other candidates who aspire to become our country’s next leader.
He was from the 1 percent of us who are not rich but constitute our nation’s essential wealth, the first responders and members of the military who stand ready to sacrifice all.
Slutman was both a Marine staff sergeant and a New York City firefighter. He was on military leave from Ladder Company 27 in the Bronx, nearing the end of his most recent deployment with the Marine reserves in Afghanistan, when he and two comrades were killed by a roadside bomb on April 8.
After the news reached his firehouse, his comrades made an addendum to the whiteboard on which they keep a tally in black Sharpie of the number of American casualties in the war that much of the nation forgets, but the FDNY would have always remembered even if it had not started with 9/11. The latest addition to fatalities in 2019 was in FDNY red:
“6 + 1.”
Slutman’s name joined that of other fallen members of the company painted on the side of the rig. His was accompanied by his twin distinctions:
“FF/SSGT Christopher Slutman.”
At 11am on Friday, the very day Slutman was supposed to have been on his way home from Afghanistan, the rig rolled slowly to the front of St. Thomas Church, just down Fifth Avenue from Trump Tower , the eponymous Manhattan home of our present leader. The emergency lights were flashing. An American flag flew from the back. A white gloved hand was on the steering wheel. The slate gray sky above portended rain.
Behind the rig came the FDNY Pipes and Drums playing a mournful “Dawning of the Day.” The pipes went silent and the drums began the same slow march they had played at hundreds of funerals and memorials after 9/11 and too many since then. That included rites for three other firefighters who had died while serving with the military during our longest war.
The ceremonial caisson bearing the remains of the fourth such loss now pulled up to the church and stopped. The drums ceased and the whole avenue was hushed as an attentive group of firefighters, Marines, and family led Slutman’s three daughters inside. The girls were wearing white dresses. McKenna is 10, Kenley is 8, and Wesleynn is just 4.
Their mother, Shannon Slutman, stood in the street with her husband’s longtime best friend, Army Sgt. Bruce Weaver. Her eyes were on the flag-draped coffin atop the caisson.
Also present were Slutman’s parents and three bothers. One brother is in the Marines, another in the Army. The third is a firefighter in Washington, D.C. The father is an Army vet and was a volunteer firefighter, as was Slutman’s mother.
“Detail, hand salute!” a voice called out.
Thousands of white gloves rose to dress uniform cap brims as an FDNY honor guard carried the coffin from the caisson. A lone piper began to play “Amazing Grace.” The other pipers then joined in, filling the air with what felt at the center of the chest like the swelling of overwhelming grief. The face of a Marine sergeant standing across the street clenched as he fought back tears.
Shannon Slutman closed her eyes and tilted her head back for an instant before she composed herself. Her left hand raised seemingly to wipe away tears, but instead tucked back her hair. She had told people that she and her husband had discussed that a day such as this could come.
The white gloves lowered as the FDNY honor guard gently set the coffin on a red wooden stand at the base of the stone steps. A USMC honor guard just as gently raised it.
“Detail, hand salute!” the voice called out again,
The white gloves rose again and the band struck up the Marine Corps hymn as the coffin was carried up into the church. The steps were lined by firefighters on the left, Marines on the right. “There were a small number of men that when they spoke, silence fell; when they issued an order, the response was immediate; and when they were looked upon, it was with reverence. Christopher Slutman immediately stood out as a leader who was respected and admired.”
Inside, the USMC honor guard placed the coffin before the altar. Slutman’s wife and three daughters sat in the front pew to the left. The first speaker was Marine Sgt. Major Christopher Armstrong, who has served 27 years, eight of them in the same unit as Slutman.
“Upon joining the unit, I began observing the Marines; who they watched, how they looked at their leaders, and what they said,” Armstrong told the mourners. “There were a small number of men that when they spoke, silence fell; when they issued an order, the response was immediate; and when they were looked upon, it was with reverence. Christopher Slutman immediately stood out as a leader who was respected and admired.”
Armstrong added, “He didn't pound his chest, he didn’t try to impress or go on about what he was going to do. He just did it.”
Armstrong continued, “He placed his Marines’ welfare before his own, always. Chris never sought credit, but he always gave it.”
Armstrong described how Slutman led his Marines.
“You treat them with firmness, fairness, dignity, and love.”
Armstrong’s love for Slutman now caused his voice to break. He addressed the daughters.
“Girls, your daddy is and will forever be our hero, and this world is a better place for having been graced by such an amazing man,” he said.
FDNY Battalion Chief Chris Williamson spoke next. He said Slutman had received a medal in 2014 for bravery while responding to a fire on the seventh floor of a high-rise building in the Bronx. Slutman had encountered intense heat and thick black smoke from floor to ceiling, but he had not waited for a hose line to cover him.
“Chris crawled on his belly through the smoke to a rear bedroom and found an unconscious woman,” Williamson said.
Williamson did not add that this meant crawling blindly amid flames and toxic fumes in ever increasing danger of being unable to find your way out, feeling around until encountered what your hand recognized as a human form.
“He dragged the woman back out past the fire and out of the apartment,” Williamson simply said, as understated as had been Slutman himself.
Williamson went on to describe a day when the company stopped at a combined Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins.
“Everyone had a cup of coffee in their hand, but I noticed Chris had an extra-large pink milkshake in a clear cup that had about four inches of whipped cream and a cherry on top,” Williamson remembered. “I jokingly said to him, ‘Chris, you’re going to ruin my image of you. Jarhead Marine Corps warriors don’t drink pink milkshakes.’ At this point Chris took a long sip, making sure to get his nose down in the whipped cream, then came up with a pink milk mustache with a dot of whipped cream on the end of his nose.”
Williamson reported what Slutman then said:
“This one does.”
As would be expected, FDNY Commissioner Dan Nigro spoke. He described Slutman as ""the type of American we can all be proud of.” “Chris was a protector of those in danger, a defender to those who needed him, a rescuer to those who needed saving, and a leader who demonstrated his valor on every tour of duty both here and abroad.” — FDNY Commissioner Dan Nigro
“Chris was a protector of those in danger, a defender to those who needed him, a rescuer to those who needed saving, and a leader who demonstrated his valor on every tour of duty both here and abroad,” Nigro said.
As Slutman was a native son of Delaware, the state’s current governor, John Carney, also stepped up to the lectern.
“Our former vice president and United States senator Joe Biden from Delaware has a prayer that he offers those who lost loved ones,” Carney said. “And that prayer is this: May the time come quickly when the memory of Chris brings a smile to your lips instead of a tear to your eye.’”
The offering of a prayer from a politician in these circumstances might have been expected to cause some of the mourners to shift in their pews and maybe glance at each other. But none of that was apparent as viewed from the choir loft.
Biden does indeed have some searingly hard-earned wisdom on the subject, having lost his wife and daughter in a car accident years ago and more recently his son to brain cancer. And he is enough of a regular guy that he was well received when he stopped into the quarters of FDNY Rescue 1 on the 14th anniversary of 9/11.
Biden paused to speak to the sister of one of the 11 members of Rescue 1 who died at the World Trade Center. He posed for a photo with current members.
“Your reputation’s going to take a hit taking a picture with me,” Biden had half joked.
“Yeah, you’re all right,” one of the firefighters had said.
The firefighter had been speaking not about Biden’s politics, but about Biden himself, his worth as a person as it might have been appraised by their murdered brothers. The firefighter afterward offered a high compliment.
“Genuine,” he said of Biden. “Biden is not one of those few who are looked upon with reverence and inspire silence when they speak.”
But if being Genuine Joe can make Biden that rare Democratic politician whose mention does not make America's more noble 1 percent grow uneasy at this mention during a line of duty funeral, it does not mean he is a leader such as Armstrong described. He was shaky when running the Anita Hill hearing and shaky when apologizing for it years later . He was back and forth when it came to raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He is not one of those few who are looked upon with reverence and inspire silence when they speak.
But Biden and the rest of us do have a guide to follow in the person of the fallen Marine and firefighter from his home state. Further insight into the way of Slutman came when his best friend, Sgt. Weaver, became the final speaker.
“Chris was the way he was because of his big heart,” Weaver said. “That was at the core of his sense of duty. Every oath he swore was meaningful.”
Weaver invoked his friend’s full name, as would befit a historical figure.
“This country needs more Christopher Kenley Aldrich Slutman. This country needs more firm handshakes. More eye contact. More truth tellers. And more people of heart.” “Slutman, who called him “Brucie,” had said two things. One was “Brucie, do what’s right whether or not anyone’s looking.” The other was “Brucie, keep your mouth shut and be supportive.””
Weaver said he had managed to speak to Slutman about three days before he was killed. Weaver had to sought Slutman’s advice about a personal problem he was having. Slutman, who called him “Brucie,” had said two things.
One was “Brucie, do what’s right whether or not anyone’s looking.”
The other was “Brucie, keep your mouth shut and be supportive.”
Brucie now summed up Slutman.
“He was everything right about us.”
The service neared a conclusion with a long moment of silence for all those who have fallen victim to terrorism and war. That was ended by a lone FDNY piper playing “The Fallen.” The entire assemblage then sang the National Anthem.
Rain had begun falling outside, as if the sky itself were faring no better than the clench-faced Marine sergeant who had fought to hold back tears earlier. The flag-draped coffin was further covered with clear plastic before the USMC honor guard carried it back out of the church and down to the wooden stand at the base of the steps.
One hand salute was again followed by another as the USMC honor guard again passed the coffin the FDNY honor guard, which carried it to the caisson. The band played “Going Home” and then “Hard Times Come Again No More.”
Slutman’s wife was standing with their daughters out front under an umbrella. Two buglers began playing “Taps” and the mother pulled the youngest girl to her. The middle girl leaned into her mother.
Commissioner Nigro presented Shannon Slutman with her husband’s helmet, which had been respectably scuffed and battered while he was saving lives. The oldest girl reached over to touch it and gave it a little loving tap.
At that indelible instant, we as a nation became all the more obligated to unite and do what’s right, whether or not anyone’s looking, to be truth tellers and people of heart. The three girls returned with their mother to one of the vans that would follow the caisson bearing their father's casket.
The band struck up “America the Beautiful,” and America had never seemed more wrenchingly so as the procession started down along 11 blocks of uniformed firefighters and Marines and other members of that other 1 percent. The sky beyond the foot of Fifth Avenue was brightening, but the rain kept falling, leaving the living with a chill.
At 9 a.m. Tuesday, the FDNY band will be at the Memorial Gate of Arlington National Cemetery for Staff Sgt./Firefighter Christopher Slutman’s internment. Another memorial is said to be set for Wednesday in Delaware, and if Biden does not already plan to attend, he should. He should sit at the back and not talk, but listen. He and the rest of us could still learn much from the true leader that Delaware bestowed on us."

Now parents are terrified that their kids are eating plastic and cardboard for Snapchat clout. 04.29.19 5:13 AM ET Theerakul Ingkaninant/EyeEm
Eating Tide Pods is over. Now, according to a number of breathless news reports, parents should instead be terrified that their children are going to gobble up plastic and cardboard in an attempt to impress their friends with the “Shell on Challenge.”
Local newspapers and TV stations across the country have become fixated on the idea that teens are filming themselves eating the “shell” around an item of food that doesn’t actually have a shell. The “shell” for a lemon would be the lemon peel, for example, while the “shell” on a pineapple would be its hard skin. The shell for cereal would be the cereal box, sending anyone who wants to eat cereal with the “shell on” eating right through the cardboard and plastic the cereal came in.
Media outlets have rushed to warn parents that teens are gobbling up plastic, then posting the videos to Snapchat . The Today show declared the Shell on Challenge to be a “harmful new trend” that could “do a lot of damage” to kids, while Food Network personality Sunny Anderson denounced it . The New York Post dubbed it the “dangerous Snapchat trend among teens.” An Arizona Republi c story on the dangers of the Shell on Challenge featured an interview with a local teen who bit into a plastic bag of baby carrots.
Like other recent, much-hyped social media challenges, though, there’s little evidence that this supposed trend is real.
Matt Schimkowitz, a senior editor at Know Your Meme, says there’s scant evidence that the Shell on Challenge is catching on. The news reports claim the Shell on Challenge is taking place on Snapchat, where most videos disappear after a short amount of time. By now, though, according to Schimkowitz, the Shell on Challenge would have migrated to other platforms if it was genuinely popular.
“Either it’s truly only on Snapchat—making it basically the first and only Snapchat trend to not bleed over to Instagram or YouTube—or it’s not actually a thing, which is my hunch,” Schimkowitz told The Daily Beast.
The news stories on the Shell on Challenge all rely on the same few videos, including the Arizona teen biting into a bag of baby carrots or a video of a young man in a hoodie biting into an unpeeled banana. Out of the handful of Shell on Challenge videos that are available on YouTube or Twitter, most involve people biting into citrus fruits—something that’s generally safe, presuming that fruit has been washed beforehand. Notably, none of the videos of the challenge show anyone swallowing the plastic they bit into—the baby carrot video, for example, ends right after the teenager takes the bite.
Tate Turner, a photographer in St. Petersburg, Florida, was cited in one news story as a participant in the Shell on Challenge after he posted a picture of a box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch with a mouth-size hole in it.
Turner told The Daily Beast that he didn’t eat the plastic and cardboard surrounding the cereal.
“It’s just a dumb trend,” Turner said in an email. “You don’t actually eat it (although I did take the bite to make it look as real as possible) but yeah you don’t eat the ‘shell’ it’s just poking fun at dumb things.”
The Shell on Challenge panic recalls 2018’s Tide Pod Challenge fever, when news reports claimed that young people were eating Tide laundry detergent pods in large numbers in search of social media fame. YouTube pulled down Tide Pod Challenge videos, and government health officials begged teens not to consume the pods. In the end, though, only a few dozen people ingested the Tide Pods— many of them elderly .
The challenge isn’t even the first viral challenge hoax of 2019. Earlier this year, parents panicked after news stories claimed that someone posing as the monster “Momo” was urging children to commit suicide. The Momo Challenge, too, turned out to be fake .
For now, Know Your Meme’s Schimkowitz says he hasn’t seen much evidence of the Shell on Challenge catching on. That might change, though, thanks to all of the news reports warning people not to do it.
“Because places are still treating it like a national epidemic, I wouldn’t be surprised if people actually started attempting it in larger numbers,” Schimkowitz said."
Why Conservatives Keep Getting Anti-Semitism Wrong,www.thedailybeast.com,Jay Michaelson,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/poway-synagogue-shooting-why-conservatives-keep-getting-anti-semitism-wrong,"BLIND SPOT Why Conservatives Keep Getting Anti-Semitism Wrong By detaching anti-Semitism from its nationalist ideology, the right dodges responsibility over and over again for its fellow travelers. opinion Sandy Huffaker/AFP/Getty
What motivates someone to burst into a Southern California synagogue and shoot unarmed worshipers, there to recite the memorial prayer for the dead?
Depends who you ask: progressives say nationalist, racist ideology, while conservatives say hate. The difference may seem slight, but in fact, it’s why right and left talk past one another—and seem to be moving farther apart.
Progressives, and most scholars, regard the kind of anti-Semitism that motivated the Poway shooting as part of the xenophobic, ultra-nationalistic constellations of hatreds and “otherings” that also, in our day, include Islamophobia, racism, and anti-immigrant animus. Jews are the “enemy within,” facilitating the evils of immigration and multiculturalism to destroy the motherland.
This is borne out by what Poway, Pittsburgh , Christchurch, and other white terrorists all said in their manifestos and other online comments. Like thousands of others of ultra-nationalists in Europe and America, they see their white, European cultures being overrun by foreigners. And they believe that Jews are making it happen.
In the words of the Charlottesville white supremacists, “you will not replace us,” a taunt aimed at non-whites, is easily changed to “Jews will not replace us.” That is a political statement—filled with ignorance and hate, of course, but also ideology.
On the right, however, anti-Semitism is regarded as hate, not ideology.
Despite reams and reams of ideological-political writing, from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion forgery to Mein Kampf to the paranoid manifesto of the Poway shooter that allege in precise terms the ways in which Jews destroy the national homeland, conservatives insist that anti-Semitism is simply pure, irrational, timeless, and ahistorical hatred that has nothing to do with any politics whatsoever. It’s the same whether it comes from Pharaoh in Egypt, a Tsarist pogrom, or a Hamas terrorist.
“We forcefully condemn the evil of anti-Semitism and hate, which must be defeated,” President Donald Trump said in response to the Poway shooting.
This definition of anti-Semitism is extraordinarily wrong. It is at odds with what anti-Semites themselves have said since the term was popularized in 1879. It mashes together religious animus, true nationalist anti-Semitism, and resistance to right-wing Zionism. And it is particularly helpful to the very people who exacerbate it, today’s nationalists, for three reasons. “If anti-Semitism is defined simply as anytime someone hates Jews for any reason, then it is a free-floating hatred that finds a home in Palestinian activism, fringe black nationalism, and among Muslim Americans.”
First, of course, it absolves them of any responsibility. To most rational observers, it seems obvious that when Trump spreads lies about the dangers of immigrant crime and Muslim terrorism, he stokes the fires of populist nationalism. In response to that incitement, some will merely wave a flag and don a red hat. But others will take matters into their own hands, striking back at Jews or Muslims or Mexicans.
Some, like Poway shooter John Earnest and Pittsburgh shooter Robert Bowers , may even believe that Trump himself has not gone far enough. They are extending Trump’s logic, not defying it.
Yet if anti-Semitism is merely a pathological hatred and has nothing to do with any ideology, all of this is coincidence. Why did anti-Semitic incidents rise 60 percent in the first year of Trump’s presidency? Well, anti-Semitism is an age-old hatred; no one can explain its pathology , the right says.
Once again, such a denial of causality and reality seems facially absurd, and yet, it is what the likes of Trump, Stephen Miller, Steve Bannon, and their ilk would have us believe. Moreover, since hardly any “mainstream” Republicans have spoken out about Trump’s incitement of hatred, either they believe this delusion as well, or, by refusing to speak, are implicated in the violence that Trump has incited.
Hatred of Jews goes back thousands of years, but the anti-Semitism of John Earnest is a specific, nationalist phenomenon with specific roots and specific myths.
The unmooring of anti-Semitism from ideology has a second benefit for nationalists, which is that it reinforces their own nationalism. In Israel, of course, this is most obvious: everyone hates the Jews, the thinking goes, therefore Jews must be strong and dominant. Force is all the Arabs understand, I remember being taught in Hebrew school, so we have to be stronger than they are .
But even for nationalist parties like those governing Brazil, the United States, and Hungary, anti-Semitism is a convenient reminder that violence and hatred are endemic to the human condition, and strong ethno-nationalism is the only way to fight it.
“We have no choice,” as Trump has said many times.
This is how Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can find common cause with barely reconstructed anti-Semites like Hungary’s Viktor Orban . It suits Netanyahu fine for Orban to demonize George Soros and other Jews—after all, Netanyahu hates Soros, too. But more broadly, both men are also engaged in the same anti-democratic activities: attacking human rights organizations, enforcing patriotic speech, undermining the independent judiciary and, most importantly, demonizing “foreigners.”
To nationalists, the solution to anti-Semitism is not, as progressives would have it, stamping out bigotry, ultra-nationalism, and scapegoating of the “other,” but rather a strong ethno-nationalist state (Jewish or otherwise). The presence of anti-Semitism serves to reinforce this view. It simply means that we must all be even stronger and more nationalistic.
The third and final function of the uncoupling of anti-Semitism from ideology is perhaps its most important: it enables “anti-Semitism” to be a scourge of left and right alike, rather than a feature of right-wing nationalism. If anti-Semitism is defined simply as anytime someone hates Jews for any reason, then it is a free-floating hatred that finds a home in Palestinian activism, fringe black nationalism, and among Muslim Americans like Rep. Ilhan Omar.
Now, we are told, including by centrists who should know better, that an “ancient hatred” has reappeared on the right and left alike—as if it is campus BDS supporters who are shooting up synagogues and chanting “Jews will not replace us.”
Of course, there are indeed instances of anti-Semitism on the far left, including conspiracy theories involving Jews and slavery, Palestinian propaganda depicting Israelis as drinking blood, and anti-capitalist screeds that call out Jewish financiers in particular (which, of course, a Trump campaign ad also did).
But in the United States, the quality and quantity of these incidents pale in comparison by those found on the right.
Most importantly, there are no left-wing equivalents for the incitement coming from the nationalist right . There is no left-wing equivalent of Trump seeking to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. There is no left-wing equivalent of “Make America Great Again” with its harkening back to a whiter and less equal past. There is no left-wing equivalent of the lies about Mexicans bringing crime, drugs, and rape to America. A single remark that congressional support for Israel is “all about the Benjamins”—a claim applied every day to the NRA, Big Pharma, or the fossil fuel industry—is nothing compared to these violent, constant, and powerful incitements to ultra-nationalist frenzy.
To the right, the Poway shooter has more in common with Ilhan Omar than with the massacre at a Christchurch mosque.
But to the Poway shooter himself, Christchurch was his inspiration . Contrary to the false and exculpatory claims of the right, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism are arms of the same murderous monster, together with ultra-nationalism, hatred of the other, and racism.
And when you agitate one part of that monster, the whole beast rises. READ THIS LIST"
"Poway Synagogue Vigil Erupts Into Debate About Trump, Anti-Semitism",www.thedailybeast.com,Tarpley.Hitt@thedailybeast.com (Tarpley Hitt) Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/arguments-and-jeers-interrupt-tense-poway-synagogue-vigil-as-mourners-debate-who-to-blame,"04.29.19 5:06 AM ET REUTERS/John Gastaldo
POWAY, California—An intense political debate broke out at a candlelight vigil on Sunday for the dead and wounded of Chabad of Poway synagogue, where mourners argued whether it was a lack of gun control, or a lack of political self-control, that led to this terrorist attack.
A 19-year-old nursing student who penned a virulently racist manifesto is accused of opening fire on the congregation the day before, killing congregant Lori Kaye, who died when she stepped between the gunman and Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein , effectively taking a bullet for her spiritual leader. Authorities say they are investigating the attack as a hate crime.
Hundreds gathered in Valle Verde Park, less than a mile from the attack, including Janith Seidel, who came to the vigil to pay her respects to Kaye. and to question the absurdity of the senseless act. “I knew Lori. Everyone knew Lori,” Seidel told The Daily Beast. “She was just such a big volunteer. If you ever were involved, if you ever came to the shul, if you ever came to the Chabad at all, you knew Lori.”
Seidel, who was not at the synagogue when Earnest opened fire, questioned why–yet again–anyone was allowed access to a semi-automatic weapon. “We need to license every gun,” she said. “Like a car.”
A few feet away, a trio of attendees huddled together, locked in a tense conversation about the root of the problem that shattered their community.
“Thank God we had a Jew with a gun,” Dorina Feygin, an older woman said, referring to the off-duty Border Patrol agent who is credited with helping chase the gunman away. “Thank God for a Jew with a gun.” (The agent said he recently rediscovered his Jewish roots.)
Feygin, who emigrated from Ukraine, came to the vigil from Mt. Carmel, California, where she is a member of the local Chabad there. Feygin, a self-described Donald Trump voter, seemed to believe that anti-Semitism does not come from the right wing, but from the left.
“It’s not right-white nationalism. It’s left,” she claimed. “Fascism is a socialist ideology. I’m from the Soviet Union. I should know the signs. Fascism and socialism are the same sides of a different coin.”
Mary Marshall and Steve Gould, members of the Beth Israel Congregation from Carmel Valley who were standing near Feygin, disagreed. “Trump is feeding white nationalism in this country,” Marshall said.
“No, he’s not,” Feygin shot back.
“Of course, he is,” Gould responded.
As the crowd around the trio started to interject with heated opinions, Marshall ended the dispute.
“This is not the time for this,” she said. “We do not need it today. We have a very big difference of opinion. We shouldn’t talk about it right now.”
Earlier in the day, Rabbi Goldstein talked at length about how he had received a phone call from President Trump.
“He was so comforting. He brought amazing consolation,” he said. “I had a 15 minute conversation. He spoke to me like a friend. Like a colleague. He spoke to me like he felt for me, for my anguish and pain. We spoke about why is there so much anti-Semitism, and what we can do to change that.”
During his conversation, Goldstein told Trump about his proposed solution to curb gun violence. His idea was not increased gun control, stricter background checks, or improved mental health and counseling services. Instead, Goldstein proposed implementing a moment of prayer in the school system.
“I told him about how I thought we should have a moment of silence in our public schools,” he said. “It used to be that in our public schools, children would be required to pray every morning. And then, they stopped that.”
Near the end of the service, a woman spontaneously took the microphone and was quickly booed off of the stage. Calling herself Janice, she claimed the rabbi, who she referred to as a “strict Jew,” was “good with money.” She suggested that Earnest might not have attacked the Chabad if he only had “Jesus in his heart.”
“This is about Poway,” she said. “It’s about curing the depression in the schools. If this boy had Jesus in his heart, he wouldn't have had a gun.”
When the audience began to yell ”she’s done,” Janice was quickly ushered away from the podium and the crowd returned to the difficult task of trying to understand their grief. READ THIS LIST"

[Warning: Spoilers] Melissa Leon 04.29.19 1:14 AM ET
I t’s almost as if Game of Thrones got this far by subverting what we expect of a fantasy. The series’ most sprawling battle yet, the Battle of Winterfell, kills few of the characters whose sentimental last scenes in “Knight of the Seven Kingdoms” seemed like closure before a climactic end. The living, against all odds, succeed in killing the show’s seemingly formidable villain, the Night King, eliminating the army of the dead with him—and upending the show’s final episodes, revealing a blander, more ordinary path to the end than the series led us to expect.
The figure who rejiggers the board is the episode’s most triumphant shock: it’s Arya Stark who saves the North , her family, and hope for the living in a last-minute, thrilling reversal, just as the battle is at its bleakest and it seems the Night King has finally taken what he wants.
The road to that triumph in “The Long Night” is a wild one, filled with heart-throttling sequences of tension and dread compounded into terror, followed by relief, followed by terror, again and again in an exhilarating ebb and flow. Parts of it play like a horror movie; other scenes compose pictures of eerily quiet beauty, with two dragons lost in moonlight above the clouds, or a horizon of tiny flames slowly swallowed up by darkness. Yet more scenes played out in a pitch black so thick, my TV screen could barely process it.
Director Miguel Sapochnik proved skilled at grounding the chaos of an onslaught in character-driven drama (usually Jon Snow’s) in “Battle of the Bastards” and “Hardhome”; here, he and co-creators/writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss expand it to a whole roster of characters, surveying different conflicts and perspectives, to slightly less coherent effect.
The spectacle plays out on both an epic and human scale, doing its best to invest us in every movement. It doesn’t quite amount to a masterpiece as rousing as, say, the Battle of the Blackwater—a battle in which characters fundamentally changed or revealed new sides of themselves, rendering their interactions as dynamic as the battle’s brilliant climax. That battle also benefitted from comprehensible strategy. In “The Long Night,” half our heroes barely speak and their strategy is muddled at best.
Still, it’s an often dazzling installment, a mishmash of survival horror and battle action that hardly feels like 82 minutes. Battle scenes can grow stale quickly, especially against mindless villains, but the episode uses the zombies in inventive ways. Wights overcome Winterfell’s flaming trenches by throwing themselves on top of it, extinguishing a gap wide enough for the horde to break through. From Grey Worm’s perspective, we see the terrifying way they move in waves, overcoming the Unsullied in a literal wall of death.
And Arya finds herself thrust into a Resident Evil game, sneaking lithely through her home’s wight-infested library. We sigh in relief with her as she closes the door behind her—but as with so many of the episode’s small victories, it’s followed in a heartbeat by something much worse. What Do We Say to Death? Not Today.
Arya’s sprint through Winterfell from a teeming horde of wights summons something from her not seen in years: genuine fear. It’s a recurring expression on lots of characters’ faces here (the episode begins with Sam’s shaking hands and staggered breathing), driving home how outmatched and overwhelmed everyone is. The Hound finds himself paralyzed by fear as flames surround Winterfell. What snaps him out of it is the sight of someone he loves in danger: he sees Arya, running from death.
Melisandre’s return in the quiet opening minutes of the episode earns a hard stare from Arya, who once promised to kill the red priestess for what she did to Gendry. Even so, after the Hound catches up to Arya, swoops her up in one arm, and drags her to safety, the youngest Stark girl doesn’t immediately move to kill Melisandre. Instead, the Red Woman reminds Arya of what she said when they first met—and instantly, something clicks.
The episode purposely buries the moment in a flurry of chaos within and outside Winterfell’s walls; we lose track of Arya, amplifying the surprise of her last-minute ambush. In the minutes in between, Daenerys tests dragon fire against the Night King, a hard-won moment that she and Jon nearly die attempting—but all the fire does is seem to tickle him. He actually grins. The Night King is kind of a dick! (Bran did mention in the episode before this that no one has ever tried to kill a White Walker this way.)
What is guaranteed to kill them is Valyrian steel, like that of the dagger Bran gave Arya last season, the same one the Catspaw assassin used to attack Bran seven seasons ago. Drogon is no match for the Night King, and neither is Theon Greyjoy, however poetic the Ironborn prince’s last act is in charging straight at the Night King to defend Bran, redeeming his early history of cowardice.
No, it’s Arya who lunges in with a roar, landing herself in the Night King’s clutches in a moment that seems like her last—until she drops the dagger, stabs her enemy in a sleight of hand, and shatters him and his army into icy dust. Arya, who trained as a servant of death, saves countless lives.
The show passes Arya’s slaying of the Night King off like a moment it’s been leading to since at least Season 3, when Melisandre first met Arya and saw a “darkness” in her. She saw eyes of different colors staring back at her then, and eyes “sealed shut forever.” She lists them again for our benefit: “Brown eyes, green eyes, blue eyes.” Arya suddenly realizes whose blue eyes Melisandre was referring to—the Night King’s and his White Walkers’.
The Night King is a symbol of death. And as she reminds Arya, what we say to death is “Not today.” So, What Was Up With Melisandre?
Speaking with Arya is the last thing Melisandre does before the battle is won. As relief washes over everyone, the Red Woman casts off her necklace, and transforms into the ancient, frail crone we saw her as once before; then she collapses in the snow and dies, leaving behind more questions than answers.
Just before she left Dragonstone last season, Melisandre told Varys she’d be heading back to Volantis, where the Temple of the Lord of Light is. Tyrion planted seeds of support for Daenerys there in Season 6, hiring the red priestess Kinvara to spread the word of his queen as the prophesied Princess Who Was Promised. Why did Melisandre come back alone, instead of with a cadre of followers of R’hllor ready to fight for Dany? More, now that the Night King is dead and the threat of the Long Night supposedly gone, does that prophecy even matter anymore?
Or is Arya the one the prophecy described all along? She doesn’t fit many of the qualifications for either the Prince Who Was Promised or Azor Ahai—she’s not a descendant of the Mad King, nor has she woken dragons out of stone, etc., etc. What secrets did Melisandre take with her to the grave? The Casualties the North Will Remember
Surprisingly, the battle’s colossal body count includes relatively few of our main heroes, despite the fake-outs of the episode’s meanest trick: rapidly cutting away from a hero just as they’re tackled, bitten, or overwhelmed by the dead, leaving their fate uncertain for several agonizing minutes. (It’s an effective trick, but it does result in a sense of confusion, as we can’t tell how anyone’s surviving, or where they end up in relation to one another.)
Another follower of the Lord of Light, Beric Dondarrion, dies protecting Arya in the halls of Winterfell. Melisandre reveals, I guess, that protecting Arya is the reason the Lord of Light brought Beric back from death six times. Now that he’s saved her from a few random wights, his “purpose has been served.” To which I say: It sort of feels like we’re making this up as we go along! (The show’s creators claim they’ve known “for three years” that Arya would be the one to take out the Night King.)
Dolorous Edd, meanwhile, succumbs to a wight’s sword as he fights by Sam’s side. And Daenerys nearly eats it after she falls off Drogon, unarmed, not a plate of armor on her. Her dragon, overrun by wights, can’t save her. Jon has bolted off to find Bran. (A mission he fails at miserably.) Instead it’s Jorah, more gallant than ever in a sword and knight’s armor, who finds his way to her and protects her—swinging his blade as one wight after another stabs through his armor. Dany fights too, killing Jorah’s attackers despite an awkward, untrained grip on the sword she picks up off the ground. That Jorah dies protecting her isn’t a surprise so much as it is his self-determined destiny; still, his stifled attempt to say goodbye to Dany (and his last words: “I’m hurt”) land hard.
Why Beric, of all people, was chosen for near-immortality was once one of the most mysterious questions the show posed. Ditto the Night King’s human identity. Jorah’s greyscale miracle cure once seemed poised for some larger payoff than simply his return to Dany, too. “The Long Night” seems to have decided these questions don’t get satisfying answers.
The episode’s grisliest murder, however, unfolds against its smallest, most dignified fighter. Lady Lyanna Mormont, who staunchly refused her uncle Jorah’s pleas to wait out the battle in the crypts with other children, dies in the grip of a giant. Hers is one of the first voices of authority we hear in the episode as she orders men inside the castle walls into battle formation, fearless in the face of what makes grown men (like Sam) tremble.
The episode goes for the jugular with her death, as we hear each bone crack and her face contorts in stifled pain. Her last act, at least, is a fitting “fuck you,” as she stuffs a dragonglass sword in the giant wight’s eye and kills it, just as her broken body gives out. (We see it reanimated again, for extra cruel measure, when the Night King raises the battle’s dead into his army.) Sansa and Tyrion in the Crypts, Which Are Definitely Safe
It’s no guarantee that Lyanna would have been safer in the crypts, though—would you believe it’s not the best place to hide vulnerable people from a guy who raises the dead? Tyrion and Sansa share a sweet moment of “I Survived Cersei Lannister” bonding, even entertaining the notion of giving their marriage another shot with an energy I can only describe as flirty, but annoyed. Sansa can tell Tyrion is in love with Daenerys, which would put a damper on the marriage. Varys sits through all of this like he’d rather be eaten. “At least we’re already in a crypt,” he deadpans in the funniest line of the night.
That Jon never thought to communicate to anyone that the Night King can raise the dead is only one of this battle’s most confounding strategic missteps. It’s right up there with sending one doomed contingent of Dothraki screamers against 100,000 undead, in effect just adding them to the Night King’s army. Winterfell had roughly two weeks to prepare from the time they learned the Night King would come from the north. Why not prepare a way to set the forest itself on fire? Why not dig more than one flaming trench? Why not bother coordinating your archers so they let loose in consecutive waves of flaming arrows instead of measly one-offs? Have none of you watched Lord of Rings ? There’d have been no one left for Gandalf to save if Aragorn had been this sloppy at Helm’s Deep!
It doesn't help that the Winterfell plan falls apart before we can even really discern what it is. All we see is characters flailing, cues being missed, chaos at every turn. (And yet miraculously, every named character on the front lines survive wave after wave—we don’t see how. We can’t make out much of anything.) By the time Jon and Dany actually crashed into each other mid-air on dragonback, I too wanted to tell someone “I’m going to go now” and warg uselessly into a flock of crows.
Anyway, Sansa, Tyrion, Gilly, Baby Sam, and Varys are fine. Around 100 helpless unnamed women and children are not, since the crypts turn into a scene from Night of the Living Dead with a wave of the Night King’s bony hand. If only there had been someone who knew that would happen! euron greyjoy outlives the night king
All of this leaves Cersei, as things stands now, as the last Big Bad standing, a genuine surprise that I’m hoping plays out with some twist in the execution.
The Lannister queen is a fascinating, tragic figure—both oppressed and oppressor, contorted over a lifetime of resentment and abuse into a ruthless, self-destructive tyrant.
And the Night King’s early end does throw an intriguing wrench in what we expect of fantasies, where heroes usually win and stories end with the defeat of supernatural villains like Sauron, Voldemort, or the Night King. But to doom the series’ final three episodes to more squabbling over the Iron Throne is frankly a more straightforward (and boring) path to the end than a show this twisty and dense has always seemed to promise.
After eight seasons, Game of Thrones has taught us to expect the unexpected—hopefully, there’s more to this final phase of the series than more of Euron Greyjoy’s pillow talk."
Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein Recounts ‘Indescribable’ Moments of Terror at Poway Synagogue,www.thedailybeast.com,Tarpley.Hitt@thedailybeast.com (Tarpley Hitt) Lyle Moran Victoria.Albert@thedailybeast.com (Victoria Albert),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/poway-synagogue-shooting-rabbi-yisroel-goldstein-recounts-indescribable-moments-of-terror,"04.28.19 8:38 PM ET Lyle Moran/For The Daily Beast
POWAY, California—One day after a gunman entered his synagogue and murdered one of his congregants on the final day of Passover, Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein recounted the moments of terror as he returned to the Chabad of Poway to memorialize Lori Kaye, the 60-year-old woman who saved his life when she leapt between him and the shooter.
Goldstein said he saw Kaye, whom he’d known for nearly 25 years and who had helped secure the loan for the synagogue decades ago, just a day before the attack. Saturday’s service was a memorial service for Kaye’s mother, who had recently passed away. Kaye had invited her only daughter, who drove in from Los Angeles where she’s a student at UCLA.
On Saturday, he said, he walked into the synagogue’s banquet hall to wash his hands. “I walk two, three footsteps when I hear a loud bang, I thought Lori may have fell, or the table tipped over in the lobby right here,” he said. “I turn around and I see a sight that is indescribable. Here is a young man standing with a rifle, pointing right at me. I look at him. He has sunglasses on. I couldn’t see his eyes. I couldn’t see his soul.”
He froze for a few moments, then raised his hands in surrender—which is when he took the bullet that would eventually cause him to lose part of the index finger on his right hand.
“I turned around and went to get the children that were playing in the banquet hall,” he said. “My granddaughter, four and a half years old, sees her grandpa with a bleeding hand, and she sees me screaming and shouting ‘get out, get out.’ She doesn’t deserve to see her grandfather like this.”
“Miraculously,” the shooter’s gun jammed, he said—which gave a man Goldstein identified as off-duty border patrol agent Jonathan Morales a chance to jump up and pursue the shooter, who turned and fled. Police have said he was working as a security guard, but it was not completely clear on Sunday.
“[The shooter] was standing right there in the lobby,” he said. “He was aiming at me in the banquet hall. He could have easily gone left and gone into the sanctuary where the seats were full for the memorial service and he could have used all the clips he had. It could have been such a bloodbath. I don’t even want to think about how that would be.”
Once the shooter left the synagogue, Goldstein said, he went back to check on Kaye. He found her on the floor unconscious next to her husband, a doctor who tried in vain to resuscitate her before fainting from the trauma.
“He faints, and he’s lying on the floor next to his wife, and then their daughter Hannah comes out screaming ‘Daddy and Mommy let’s go,’” he said. “It’s the most heart-wrenching sight I could have seen. I was frozen in time.” Kaye died of her injuries hours later.
“I grabbed a prayer shawl,” he added. “My congregation was standing out here, and and I said. ‘I got to do something.’ I got up on a chair right here, and I looked at our congregation, and I said we are a Jewish nation that will stand tall. We will not let anyone take us down. Terrorism will not take us down.”
Goldstein urged all members of the Jewish faith to go to their local synagogues this coming Friday night and Saturday in a show of strength.
“We need to fill up those rooms,” he said. “We need to show them that terrorism and evil will never prevail. Let’s fill up the synagogues. Let’s stand tall. Let’s dance together.”
He said for those Jews who haven’t been to synagogue for a long time, now was the time to visit.
“This is a personal request from myself as a rabbi asking you to come synagogue this weekend to show solidarity,” Goldstein said. “God will inspire you and bless you.”
Goldstein later added that President Trump called him to express his condolences in the aftermath of the attack, and that in a 10- to 15-minute conversation, Trump “shared with me condolences on behalf of the United States of America,” and “spoke about his love of peace and Judaism and Israel.”
“He was just so comforting,” Goldstein added. “I’m really grateful for our president for taking the time and making the effort to share with us his comfort and consolation.”
Nineteen-year-old nursing student John T. Earnest was arrested minutes after the shooting, and charged Sunday with Kaye’s murder , as well as three other counts of attempted murder. Police say he’s the only suspect in the case. He will be arraigned on Wednesday. READ THIS LIST"
Synagogue Shooting Suspect Was a Piano-Playing Nursing Student From Religious Family With a Racist Secret,www.thedailybeast.com,Tarpley.Hitt@thedailybeast.com (Tarpley Hitt) Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau) Pervaiz.Shallwani@thedailybeast.com (Pervaiz Shallwani),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/poway-synagogue-shooting-john-t-earnest-a-piano-playing-nursing-student-from-religious-family-was-secretly-racist,"04.28.19 5:47 PM ET Sandy Huffaker/AFP/Getty
POWAY, California—Nineteen-year-old nursing student John T. Earnest, who was charged with murder Sunday as the lone gunman in the deadly Poway Synagogue shooting , played piano for hours a day and earned a 4.31 grade point average. His father was a church elder whom neighbors called “the sweetest man.”
But somewhere on his path, Earnest took a terrible turn, claiming Adolf Hitler as an idol and writing what appears to be his own rambling manifesto that Jews “deserved nothing but hell.” He wanted to be the one to, as he put it, “Send. Them. There.”
Police say someone purporting to be him posted the anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, white supremacist “manifesto”—which eerily mirrored the Q&A style that Christchurch terrorist Brenton Tarrant used in his own pre-massacre diatribe—about 20 minutes before he walked into the Poway synagogue with an AR-15 style assault rifle and started shooting—killing one woman and injuring three others—before the gun malfunctioned and he was chased out by an armed security guard.
Earnest was arrested by police a few minutes after the shooting as he fled, called 911, and told them where to find him off an exit on a California highway, authorities said. As an officer approached, he exited his vehicle, raised his hands, and surrendered. A rifle was recovered from the car. He is scheduled to be arraigned on Wednesday on one count of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted first-degree murder, according to the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department.
In his online posting, Earnest championed the likes of Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue shootings in Pittsburgh six months ago, Tarrant, who killed 50 people in a New Zealand mosque in March; and Hitler.
He used mainstream social media like Twitter and the fringe message boards 8Chan in what has become a proven way for terrorist groups and lone wolves alike to ensure that propaganda is disseminated to both those looking for it and those who are not. He posted the original screed on Pastebin.com and Mediafire.com, and linked to them on 8Chan. Like Tarrant, he promised to live-stream his killing spree, which he evidently failed to pull off. Facebook immediately removed the profile link he intended to use, but had somehow not seen the warning signs when he created the page.
Sheriff William Gore of the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department said during a press conference late Sunday that authorities were carrying out searches in the suspect’s home and “looking into digital evidence and checking the authenticity of an online manifesto.”
If it is validated as authentic, the student, who was previously unknown to police, found footing in the usual tenets of hate and the now all-too-familiar desire for infamy.
Zach Keele, pastor of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, where Earnest’s father was an elder, or officer of the church, confirmed that he was part of the parish. “So John T. Earnest is a member here,” he told The Daily Beast. “We completely deplore what he did. That is not part of our practices, our teachings in any way. Our hearts, our prayers, our tears go out to the victims, to all those wonderful neighbors at the synagogue.”
Keele said Earnest had never appeared to be the sort of person who would carry out this sort of an attack. “This is a complete surprise,” he said.
In a service at the church on Sunday, Keele delivered a sermon on betrayal and forgiveness, offering condolences to the victims–but also to Earnest’s family.
“We pray, Lord, for those who are hurting, and we pray for the victims of that synagogue,” Keele told the crowd of 50 or so parishioners. “We deeply mourn that this evil came out from us. We do not understand it, oh Lord, and we pray that you would forgive us for any such shortcoming, for any good deeds we left undone. We pray, Lord, that you will be with the Earnest family.”
Speaking to his congregation after the service, Keele said he had spoken with Earnest’s parents the night before. They had spent the night huddled in their other son’s apartment close to the beach while their own house was searched by SWAT teams, he said. Earnest’s father plans to release a statement Monday morning through an attorney. “It’s a good statement,” Keele said. “They have good family support.”
The minister added that Earnest must “suffer the full punishment of the law.” Still, he hopes he will “recant his hatred.” Keele plans to visit the young man in prison, if convicted, he said.
After the service, Gerrit Groenewold, a board member at the Orthodox Presbyterian Church who happens to be the father of the girlfriend of one of Earnest’s brothers, told The Daily Beast that he had noticed Earnest had seemed quiet, and often tried to reach out to the young man, but with little luck. “I have tried to talk to John several times, but he is very silent and very reclusive. I noticed that he was quiet and just wanted to have contact... The other [members of his family] are not nearly as quiet,” he said. “It’s not good if someone is that quiet. He needs to be part of the community, to let them know what is going on.”
Earnest also claimed responsibility for an attempted arson attack last month on Dar-ul-Arqam Mosque in Escondido, about nine miles from Poway, Security cameras at the mosque caught a suspect breaking a lock and pouring liquid on a side door but had failed to identify the person. Gore said investigators are now looking his “possible involvement in the arson and vandalism of mosque.”
In a comment that was left after the synagogue shooting, someone asks, “How does a child of such privilege go so horribly wrong? Where does this hatred come from?”
Late Saturday afternoon, California State University San Marcos president Karen S. Haynes confirmed that Earnest had been enrolled at the its nursing school.
“We are dismayed and disheartened that the alleged shooter—now in custody—is a CSUSM student. CSUSM is working collaboratively with the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department to assist and gain more information,” Haynes said in a statement. “We are heartbroken by this tragedy, which was motivated by hate and anti-Semitism.”
A man who identified himself as Earnest’s grandfather expressed shock at his grandson’s role in the deadly shooting on Saturday.
“He did what?” the man told The Daily Beast when reached by phone. “That is out of whack. My heart is sinking into my chest. I’m going to hang up now.”
By Saturday evening, police had barricaded the streets leading to the cul-de-sac in Rancho Peñasquitos, a hilly, middle-class suburb of San Diego about seven miles from the synagogue where Earnest lives with his family. More than three dozen law enforcement officers, including FBI agents, ATF agents, and cops, were at the scene. Eyewitnesses told The Daily Beast that the family left their home under police escort hours earlier.
Around 9 p.m. local time, law enforcement had secured a search warrant to enter Earnest’s house, which may well confirm the authenticity of his hate-filled screed and could possibly uncover how far he was willing to act on his hate."

The 19-year-old man accused of using an assault rifle to open fire on the Chabad of Poway synagogue in suburban San Diego was charged with murder Sunday afternoon, according to jail records filed by the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department.
John Earnest was charged with one count of murder in the death of 60-year-old Lori Kaye and three counts of attempted murder in the mass shooting that took place on the last day of Passover.
Earnest is being held in county jail on no bail, according to court records. He will be arraigned on Wednesday. Police have said that there are no other suspects in the shooting.
Local officials have called Earnest's actions a hate crime. Authorities, including San Diego County detectives and local FBI agents, are combing through evidence to determine whether apply the state statute for his actions and determine if he violated federal civil rights laws.
Investigators are currently reviewing Earnest’s sprawling multi-page manifesto published just before the attack, and investigating Earnest’s potential involvement in a mosque fire in Escondido last month.
Earnest stepped in to the 33-year-old synagogue at about 11:30 a.m. on Saturday, exactly six months after Robert Bowers allegedly slaughtered 11 people at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Saturday was the last day of Passover, and the congregation was in the midst of a holiday celebration.
Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, who was saved from the gunfire when Kaye lept between him and the shooter, described the carnage to CNN as “unfathomable, indescribable terror.”
Because of Kaye’s bravery, Goldstein was only shot in the hand; Kaye passed away from her wounds hours after the attack.
“It’s unfathomable why this beautiful, beautiful, wonderful human being would be shot down,” Goldstein said.
Three other people were wounded, including 9-year-old Noya Dahan, who was struck by shrapnel in her leg and face, and Almog Peretz, who was hit in the leg while trying to usher a group of children to safety. READ THIS LIST"
"Extreme Right Vox Party Set to Enter Spain’s Parliament, But Socialists Will Govern",www.thedailybeast.com,Gregory Beals,04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/extreme-right-vox-party-set-to-enter-spains-parliament-but-socialists-likely-to-govern,"VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN Extreme Right Vox Party Set to Enter Spain’s Parliament, But Socialists Will Govern Spain remains one of Europe’s most tolerant countries. But a party that denies the Holocaust, wants to limit women’s rights and put a brake on immigration gained ground Sunday. 04.28.19 2:42 PM ET Pablo Blazquez Dominguez/Getty
BARCELONA—It was 10 a.m. and Antonia Huguet, 75, trundled home from a dilapidated school in the middle of Barcelona’s Gothic neighborhood after voting in Spain’s general election . With her dyed blond hair done up in a bun, Huguet looked like a character out of a Pedro Almodóvar movie—which seems rather appropriate since Spanish democracy these days could easily be mistaken for something on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
Like many of the characters in Almodóvar’s films, Huguet lived through Franco’s dictatorship and can’t abide the idea of fascism returning in her lifetime. After Spanish democracy began in the late 1970s there were two political parties (the right wing Partido Popular and the Socialist Workers Party on the left).
Now there are five political parties including the newly emergent extreme right-wing Vox party. Mention Vox and Huguet begins to mutter under her breath in anger. Even 44 years after Francisco Franco’s death in 1975, “There are a lot of fascists in Spain, even though they would never admit it in public,” she says. “I am worried.”
In other parts of Spain however, the idea of Vox—a party that denies the Holocaust, wants to limit women’s rights and Spain’s decentralized system of governance, and puts a brake on immigration—elicits a more giddy response.
In the trendy area of Pla del Remei in Valencia there were very few Vox pamphlets left, a party representative told the daily El País. “If you watch for five minutes, you see it. People who esthetically look like PP [Partido Popular] voters, such as well-dressed ladies, are mostly picking up Vox papers today.”
Spain went to the polls on Sunday and there was only one consensus: the two-party political system that once provided stability was effectively comatose. The PP had the worst results since it was founded and its leadership will likely be challenged. The modest rise of Vox has effectively left a polarized and potentially dangerous new political landscape in its wake.
Practical issues—like whether the left-wing political coalition actually will rule—are still up in the air although by 11:15 p.m. local time on Sunday, a government spokeswoman said that PSOE won the election, allowing the group to govern in coalition with the leftist Podemos party and with Catalan separatists. Meanwhile Vox was expected to gain as many as 23 seats in parliament. The PP, meanwhile, was well on its way to having the lowest political representation in parliament since 1989. The result will likely lead to a major debates within the party as to where its future lies.
Voters came to the polls in droves. Voter turnout had increased by nearly 9 percent over the elections in 2016. In Catalonia, where the Socialists need to do well in order to remain in power, turnout increased to nearly 18 percent. A strong turnout, especially in Catalonia, has meant that the question of Catalonia’s independence remains up for grabs.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez will likely negotiate with the independentista party Esquerra Republicana, though he could come into office even if the independentista parties abstain during the confirmation process.
The Sánchez government itself came to power nine months ago when the government of Mariano Rajoy’s Partido Popular was reduced to a shadow of itself after a resounding multi-party no-confidence vote in parliament, the consequence of a series of corruption scandals and a botched response to Catalonia’s 2017 independence bid.
No one, however, could be blamed for mistaking the position of Spanish prime minister for a kind of revolving door. The current prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called the elections in February after his minority Socialist government lost support from Catalonia’s independentistas .
The prospect of an independent Catalonia slivered the PP into various factions, each of which attempted to outdo the others in punishing the Catalan independentistas. Vox, considered as something akin to a political joke until then, was the most aggressive.
When leaders of the Catalan independence bid went on trial in Madrid for sedition, Vox took the astute step of joining in the proceedings against them, which is allowed under Spanish law. Then in December of last year Vox scored an unexpectedly strong result in regional elections in Andalusia where they polled 11 percent of the total vote and won 12 seats on a Trumpesque anti-immigration platform (wall included).
It was enough for a coalition of right wing parties to oust the PSOE, which had held power in the region for generations.
Whereas during Europe’s 2011 economic crisis the Socialists were threatened by an emerging left-wing Podemos party, now the conservative PP is threatened by Vox and its gun-toting leader, Santiago Abascal.
“In the conversations that I had with Mariano Rajoy when he was prime minister, one of the things that struck me most was that he was already talking to me about the far right in Spain, about Vox. I’ve never said this before,” Sánchez said recently. “When Rajoy was prime minister, Vox was already on the radar of the right, in their opinion polls.”
If Vox threatens the PP, Abascal’s party is a welcome enemy for Sánchez and the PSOE, despite the loss in Andalusia. “The socialist party has constantly mentioned Vox to mobilize their electorate,” says Olivas Osuna . “They know that if Vox grows it will undermine the chances of the PP to get a majority.”
Sunday’s result means that no single party will be able to garner a majority and several possible coalitions could take place allowing either the left of the right the opportunity to govern. An intense round of deal-making is in the works. If Vox garners more than 10 percent of the electorate, it will likely want to have members of its party represented in government—a risky proposition not only for the PP, but also for other parties necessary for the right to return to power.
At the same time, Sánchez and the PSOE may be forced to deal with Catalan independentista parties in order to form its own coalition—the very same parties that plunged his government into crisis after rejecting the prime minister’s budget in February. Sánchez himself has said that the independentista parties “cannot be trusted.”
“They know that independence is not possible,” Sánchez said. “Independence leaders are inside their own labyrinth. When they get out, we will be waiting to find a space for dialogue.”
For the Catalan separatists who until recently have been playing a game of “ Quien es mas independentista ” among themselves, negotiations with PSOE-led coalition may come sooner rather than later. The independentista parties, having been savaged by the suspension of regional government, the defunding of Catalan institutions and the sedition trial of several of their political leaders, desperately need friends in Madrid. Given the choice between PSOE and a right-wing coalition that includes avowed Franco admirers, Catalan’s separatists may just support the former. READ THIS LIST"
The Bernie Sanders Army Gears Up For The Next Phase of His Campaign,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-bernie-sanders-army-gears-up-for-the-next-phase-of-his-campaign,"PERSON TO PERSON The Bernie Sanders Army Gears Up For The Next Phase of His Campaign The Senator’s plan to win hinges on a massive mobilization effort jump started by thousands of house parties across the country and a new app to connect volunteers and voters. 04.28.19 1:03 PM ET Mark Makela
Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) has led the crowded 2020 Democratic primary field in fundraising , cultivating a massive list of over one million volunteers along the way. Now, with the field largely set, following the entrance of former Vice President Joe Biden this week, Sanders’ team is putting that people-powered muscle to work.
On Saturday, the campaign launched a nationwide organizing program with nearly 5,000 house parties in every state throughout the country, demonstrating a show of force for his volunteer network and an opportunity to mobilize supporters in a primary contest that could remain close through the early voting states and beyond.
“If we’re going to defeat Donald Trump, we’re going to need a massive grassroots effort and that’s what today is about,” Sanders told The Daily Beast in an interview on Saturday. “Our job is to significantly increase our citizen participation and we think the agenda that we are fighting for, an agenda that works for all of us and not just the one percent is an agenda that can bring millions of people together to transform our economic and political life.”
In addition to the house parties, which Sanders spent part of the day calling into, the campaign also launched a new app called BERN which will be crucial to their strategy going forward. It allows for volunteers themselves to log conversations with voters, friends and family for the purpose of ensuring voter registration and getting Sanders’ supporters to participate in primaries and caucuses within their states.
This distributed organizing strategy, used in Sanders’ last presidential campaign as well as former Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s (D-TX) 2018 Senate bid, is different than a typical system in which volunteers are often only allowed to do this work with supervision from field organizers in various campaign offices. It eliminates the necessity for a campaign to need field offices and staff to oversee volunteers and allows for the campaign to get an early jump on outreach long before primary voting begins.
As Claire Sandberg, national organizing director for Sanders’ campaign explained, a volunteer can look up a voter, whether it’s someone they know personally or someone they meet in their community, and mark down whether that person is a Sanders supporter, undecided or backing another candidate.
“We have two main modes for the app: friend to friend mode and community canvass mode,” Sandberg said, noting that the first mode is more effective than talking to strangers. “They're both very similar, but in friend to friend mode volunteers can tell us if they know the voter. This is important, because in the future we'll want to ask volunteers to have conversations with their undecided friends, make sure that their friends who need to register or request a Democratic ballot get registered and know how to vote, and eventually make sure their friends turn out to vote or caucus for Bernie.”
In the previous campaign, Sandberg said that volunteers in New York were desperately trying to get ahold of a voter list to engage independents and even third-party voters to get them to switch their registration to vote in the Democratic primary, which needs to be done six months in advance in the state. The new app helps fix that problem and simply put “volunteers everywhere can have conversations with voters now, rather than having to wait for the campaign to arrive in their state or community.”
It’s a crucial next phase for the campaign, though one that Sanders has acknowledged bears a few risks, and a tactic that he thinks will differentiate himself from a sprawling field with other heavyweights. The Independent from Vermont is hoping that this engagement even helps level the playing field when it comes to social media, where he noted that President Trump dominates the Democratic contenders with nearly 60 million followers on Twitter alone. It also comes after Biden outraised the first-day totals of other candidates in the field, though with fewer individual donors than Sanders and a high-dollar fundraiser as well.
“It’s a grassroots campaign funded by grassroots low donor contributions and that’s why I think we win,” Sanders told The Daily Beast. “That’s why I think we are going to win. I’m excited about what’s happening today and I think it’s a very good omen for the rest of the campaign.”"

Poway Synagogue Shooting Suspect’s Parents Call Him ‘Evil’,www.thedailybeast.com,Tarpley.Hitt@thedailybeast.com (Tarpley Hitt),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/poway-synagogue-shooting-suspect-john-earnest-parents-call-him-evil,"Poway Synagogue Shooting Suspect’s Parents Call Him ‘Evil’ John Earnest allegedly murdered a woman during Passover services after posting anti-Semitic screed online. 04.29.19 2:07 PM ET via Facebook
POWAY, California—The parents of John Earnest, who allegedly opened fire on a synagogue Saturday, called their son evil on Monday.
“We are shocked and deeply saddened by the terrible attack on the Chabad of Poway synagogue,” the family said in a statement released through an attorney. “But our sadness pales in comparison to the grief and anguish our son has caused for so many innocent people. He has killed and injured the faithful who were gathered in a sacred place on a sacred day. To our great shame, he is now part of the history of evil that has been perpetrated on Jewish people for centuries.”
On Saturday morning, Earnest entered Chabad of Poway with an assault-style rifle and allegedly opened fire, killing one woman and wounding three others, including a rabbi.
Twenty minutes before the attack, Earnest published a virulently anti-Semitic manifesto repeating centuries’ old libels against Jews as justification for murdering them. The message said he idolized Brenton Tarrant, the alleged Christchurch mosque attacker, and Robert Bowers, who allegedly murdered 11 Jews at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Earnest also approvingly cited Adolf Hitler.
Twenty minutes after posting the message, he entered Chabad of Poway with an assault-style rifle and allegedly opened fire, killing one woman and wounding three others, including a rabbi. Earnest was chased out of the synagogue by an Army veteran and fled in a vehicle. Soon after, he called 911 and told authorities where to find him on a highway, according to authorities.
He will be arraigned Wednesday morning in San Diego County court, one count of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted first-degree murder.
Earnest, 19, grew up in a middle-class neighborhood not far from Poway. He was an honors student and accomplished pianist at Mt. Carmel High School, where his father, also named John, works as a teacher. Earnest’s father also served as board president of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in Escondido, where the family attended church weekly.
Gerrit Groenewold, a member of the church, told The Daily Beast on Sunday that Earnest was the quietest of his family, so quiet that Groenewold grew concerned. “I noticed that he was quiet and just wanted to have contact,” he said. “It’s not good if someone is that quiet. He needs to be part of the community, to let them know what is going on.”
Earnest was not known to law enforcement prior to the attack, authorities said, and has no known ties to white supremacist groups. READ THIS LIST"
‘We Are Shocked’: California Fertility Doctor Arrested for Wife’s Murder,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/eric-scott-sills-california-fertility-doctor-arrested-for-murder-of-wife-susann-stephanie-arsuaga-sills,"MYSTERY ‘We Are Shocked’: California Fertility Doctor Arrested for Wife’s Murder Susann Stephanie Arsuaga Sills, 45, died in November 2016. Over two years later, her husband has been charged with murder. 04.29.19 2:00 PM ET Arsuaga Family
A fertility doctor in Southern California has been charged with murder in the 2016 death of his wife, authorities said.
Eric Scott Sills, 54, who’s suspected of killing 45-year-old Susann Stephanie Arsuaga Sills on Nov. 13, 2016, was arrested Thursday night and is being held on $1 million bail, according to the Orange County District Attorney’s Office.
“We are happy there has finally been movement in Susann’s case. Obviously we are shocked that Eric has been arrested in her murder,” Cynthia Arsuaga, Susann’s stepmother, told The Daily Beast on Monday. “Right now we are trying to grief as a family as these wounds are now reopen, and we hope to find peace for Susann.”
Authorities have released few details in the case, including Sill’s cause of death, the motive behind the two-year-old murder, and what new evidence led to the doctor’s arrest.
The couple co-founded the Center of Advanced Genetics fertility clinic in Carlsbad, about an hour outside of San Diego. Eric Sills, who holds a doctorate from London’s University of Westminster and a medical degree from the University of Tennessee, served as the center’s medical director while his wife was the managing partner. The pair started the clinic together in April 2015, the center confirmed to The Daily Beast on Monday.
According to his company bio, Eric Sills practiced in-vitro fertilization in Europe and the U.S. and wrote multiple books, including Fighting At The Fertility Front—A Navigational Guide to Infertility for U.S. Military, Veterans and Their Partners.
“In addition to books, Dr. Sills has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed journal articles and has collaborated on the discovery of three previously unknown human gene mutations,” his online biography states .
Susann Sills, a Philadelphia native, received her MBA in international studies from the University of Miami in 2000. Together, the couple has two children, twins Mary-Katherine Estelle Sills and Eric Scott Sills II. The 54-year-old doctor also has two children from a previously marriage, Charles Alton Carmack Sills and Ann-Marie Carter Sills.
“Her sudden loss was a deep sorrow for the many friends, family, and patients to whom she had endeared herself during her love-filled life,” her obituary said .
According to users, the 45-year-old was a member of Patrick.net, a social forum where she posted under the pseudonym turtledove. In a thread posted soon after her death, one member, MMR, wrote that Eric Sills reached out to say she had died of an accident.
“I got an email from her husband today indicating that she had passed away,” the user wrote, adding that Sills said his wife suffered from “chronic migraines which kept her up.”
MMR also claimed that Eric Sills said his wife “fell down the stairs early Sunday morning,” an assertion that some found it hard to believe. In another post, MMR alleged that the mother of four had been cremated.
“I just find it hard to believe that someone as young as she was could sustain life threatening injuries falling down the stairs,” one wrote.
Sills’ attorney, Fred Thiagarajah, declined to comment on the case, saying that his team is “choosing to not speak about it until they have gathered more information.”
The Orange County Sheriff’s Office declined to release any details about Susann Sill’s death, as they have “passed off the investigation to the district attorney’s office.” The district attorney’s office also declined to provide further details on the investigation, citing “the sensitivity of the ongoing investigation.”
Sills is currently being held at the Orange County Correctional Facility."

Mitch McConnell Turned the Courts Conservative—and Democrats Helped Him,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/mitch-mcconnell-turned-the-courts-conservativeand-democrats-helped-him,"NEW NORMAL Mitch McConnell Turned the Courts Conservative—and Democrats Helped Him As the lead nominations lawyer for President Obama, I saw firsthand how Republicans light norms on fire for short-term advantage. opinion Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos by Getty
“ Nuclear Mitch ” McConnell may be destroying the Senate, but he’s not irrational. The senseless ones are the Democrats who refuse to follow the precedent he has set, so we can restore balance to our courts in the future.
Republicans have long understood that the courts are central to implementing their extreme, unpopular agenda. A Republican-controlled Congress and White House can’t repeal the Affordable Care Act? Ask the court to strike it down instead. Support for Roe v. Wade at a record high ? Just tee up a dozen cases for the five Republican men on the Supreme Court to criminalize abortion for you.
So it should be no surprise that when Republicans have power, they manipulate and leverage it to the greatest extent possible to achieve their highest priority: packing the courts with narrow-minded judges who will favor corporations and the powerful, while turning back the clock on our rights, for generations.
For example, Republicans disregarded “blue slips,” a Senate tradition since 1917 that allowed senators to object to judicial nominees from their home states. They kicked the non-partisan American Bar Association out of its traditional role evaluating potential judicial nominees. And they rushed hearings and stacked them with multiple circuit court nominees to bypass scrutiny. When the Senate Rules got in their way, Republicans invented the “nuclear option” and gained leverage by threatening to change the Rules with a simple majority vote, instead of the required super-majority.
This isn’t a litany of norms McConnell has destroyed for Trump—it’s what Republicans did for George W. Bush. Breaking norms to pack the courts is what Republicans do and have been doing—regardless of Democratic efforts to restore any shattered practices.
I worked on judicial nominations for President Obama for nearly seven years, including as the lead nominations lawyer in the White House Counsel’s office for more than half of his presidency. I understood and sometimes even admired our impulse to try to rebuild norms and lead by example. To negotiate instead of confront. When Republican Senators used their blue slips—reinstated by Democratic Chairman Patrick Leahy—to reject well-qualified candidates for no reason or simply because “that’s not the lawyer I would nominate,” we would try again to find a consensus alternative. When Republicans even rejected nominees they had originally recommended, we would try again .
But while we were idealistically trying to depoliticize the judiciary, McConnell was busy using his power and leverage to politicize them even more by keeping judicial vacancies open as long as possible. Every day that Republicans could keep a Democratic-appointed judge off the bench meant more cases for narrow-minded Republican judges to hear instead. So McConnell lit more norms on fire—blocking Obama nominees to the D.C. Circuit solely to prevent a majority of its judges from being Democratic-appointed; filibustering district court judges; dramatically increasing the wait time that even non-controversial nominees languished on the Senate floor; and refusing to confirm packages of judges before recesses or even at the end of a Congress.
When McConnell regained control of the Senate, he practically stopped confirming Obama judges altogether. Most notably, he stole a Supreme Court seat by denying President Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland so much as a hearing, but McConnell was relentless throughout the entire judiciary. He only allowed two circuit court confirmations in 2015-16, the fewest in a two-year Congress since the 1800s. Overall, he kept 108 judicial vacancies open for President Trump—nearly double the number inherited by President Obama.
The frightening thing is that it could have been even worse, but in 2013, Democrats used their power to change the rules and counter McConnell’s unprecedented obstruction. If Democrats had not changed the rules, not only would Republicans have a commanding majority now on the D.C. Circuit, but Trump would have had dozens of additional lifetime judgeships throughout the country to fill.
Unfortunately, too many Democrats have not yet learned the lessons of the Obama administration. Some are apologizing for changing the rules in 2013—even though, as Harry Reid has recently reiterated, the choice was “ [e]ither Obama’s presidency would be a joke or Obama’s presidency would be one of fruition .” And even though Republicans have rammed through 10 circuit court nominees over the objections of Democratic home-state senators, just a few weeks ago, Judiciary Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein inexplicably maintained, “ it’s not too late to return to honoring the blue slip of home-state senators of both parties.” “Democrats need to understand that once one side destroys a norm, it’s not a norm anymore—no matter how much we wish it were or try to reinstate it.”
Many people criticize Leahy’s decision to reinstate and enforce blue slips during the Obama presidency. In retrospect, it was probably naïve to expect that Republicans, so hellbent on packing our courts, would retain blue slips under a Republican president, although institutionalist defenders point to then-Chairman Chuck Grassley’s pledge to do so. Certainly, looking ahead, the future of blue slips should be clear: Fool Democrats once, shame on you. Fool us twice, shame on Senator Feinstein.
Democrats need to understand that once one side destroys a norm, it’s not a norm anymore—no matter how much we wish it were or try to reinstate it. So we must not self-impose a set of rules that will only apply to us. Blue slips are dead. ABA ratings are irrelevant. Hold hearings with multiple circuit court nominees, even if the Senate is in recess. This is the new normal.
Democrats also must follow the new norms that have been set around changing the rules and, when we regain control of the Senate, use them to restore balance to the courts with fair-minded progressive judges.
As far as I can tell, other than some angry floor speeches, there has been no Democratic response to this latest Republican rules changes—just as there was no Democratic response to Republicans changing the rules to confirm Supreme Court justices by a simple majority. But maybe this isn’t a bad thing. Maybe using the nuclear option to change the Senate rules is just the new normal.
Democrats must embrace this new world order and, as Senator Jeff Merkley has said , “We must be prepared to use a majority to restore constitutional values and pass democracy reforms returning power to the people.”
Anything else just doesn’t make sense. READ THIS LIST "
Army Vet Hatched Domestic Terror Plot to Avenge New Zealand Shooting: Feds,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/army-vet-hatched-domestic-terror-plot-to-avenge-christchurch-shooting-feds,"‘MARTYRDOM, BRO’ Army Vet Hatched Domestic Terror Plot to Avenge New Zealand Shooting: Feds ‘There were mosque shootings in New Zealand,’ Domingo posted to a private group online. ‘[T]here must be retribution.’ 04.29.19 4:34 PM ET REUTERS
A U.S. Army veteran has been arrested for an attempted terror attack in “multiple” Los Angeles locations allegedly in “retribution” for the mosque mass shooting in New Zealand last month, federal prosecutors announced Monday.
Mark Domingo, a 26-year-old former U.S. Army infantryman who served in Afghanistan, was charged with providing and attempting to provide material support to terrorists in his attempt to make an improvised explosive device (IED) “in order to commit mass murder,” according to an U.S. District court indictment filed over the weekend.
The California man was arrested Friday night after receiving what he thought was a live bomb to carry out his attack but was, in fact, a fake explosive delivered by an undercover law-enforcement officer as part of an FBI investigation.
According to the complaint, Domingo was outraged over the massacre at two New Zealand mosques that killed 50 people and injured dozens on March 14, and he boasted in online posts about purchasing supplies to make several bombs.
“There were mosque shootings in New Zealand,” Domingo posted to a private online chat on March 14, according to federal prosecutors. “[T]here must be retribution.”
He added: “I feel like I should make a christians life miserable tomorrow for our fallen bros n sis in [N]ew Zealand...maybe a jews life...they shed our blood...no Muslim should have to experience this, a message needs to be sent.”
In various conversations with an FBI informant who was already in the private message group and an FBI “online covert employee” two days later, Domingo expressed support for a violent jihad, the indictment claimed.
For six weeks, Domingo plotted with the informant about murdering several “enemies,” including Christians, Jews, white supremacists, LAPD police officers, even his next-door neighbor. He also allegedly discussed his desire to set off explosives on the Santa Monica Pier and on several Los Angeles freeways, and voiced support for ISIS—though he had trouble developing a concrete plan.
In one exchange, the informant asked Domingo if he intended to get caught, to which he replied: “Martyrdom, bro,” Domingo said, according to the indictment.
Finally, the 26-year-old “asked his confederate… to find a bomb-maker,” revealing he had “purchased several hundred nails to be used as shrapnel inside the IED.”
“Domingo said he specifically bought three-inch nails because they would be long enough to penetrate the human body and puncture internal organs,” the complaint stated. Domingo also allegedly showed up to one meeting with the informant, armed with a rifle similar to an AK-47.
The 26-year-old, who completed a four-month deployment to Afghanistan in Jan. 2013, was finally arrested after he told the informant of his plans to attack a “white-nationalist rally” in Huntington Beach on April 27.
“This investigation successfully disrupted a very real threat posed by a trained combat soldier who repeatedly stated he wanted to cause the maximum number of casualties,” U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said on Monday in news conference announcing the “chilling terrorism plot.”
Domingo, who has been in federal custody since his arrest, is expected to appear in court Monday afternoon."

Oscar-nominated director John Singleton, who is best known for such films as Boyz n the Hood and Poetic Justice, has died at the age of 51, his family said in a statement to The Associated Press .
The director had been in a medically-induced coma at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center since suffering a catastrophic stroke on April 17.
Singleton was the first black filmmaker ever nominated for an Oscar in the best director category—at the age of just 23. He was considered an influential member of a community of black filmmakers who turned the movie industry upside-down in the ’90s along with Spike Lee, Matty Rich, Julie Dash, and F. Gary Gray.
Singleton’s family announced the decision to take him off life support earlier in the day.
“It is with heavy hearts we announce that our beloved son, father and friend, John Daniel Singleton will be taken off of life support today,” the statement said, according to The Associated Press . “This was an agonizing decision, one that our family made, over a number of days, with the careful counsel of John’s doctors.”
Singleton’s final days were tumultuous. His mother, Sheila Ward, said that he was in a coma and filed papers to become his temporary conservator last week. But some of his children disputed Ward’s characterization of his medical state, and tried to prevent her from becoming her son’s legal guardian.
As news of his death broke, celebrities flocked to Twitter to memorialize the icon.
“John was a brave artist and a true inspiration,” wrote filmmaker Jordan Peele. “His vision changed everything.”
“My prayers go out today to John Singleton and his family,” said actor and director Robert Townsend . “May God bless the young cinematic king who gave us images that will stay with us forever.”
“Mourning the loss of a collaborator & True Friend John Singleton,” wrote Samuel L. Jackson. “He blazed the trail for many young film makers, always remaining true to who he was & where he came from!!! RIP Brother. Gone Way Too Soon!”
Singleton reflected on his career in an interview with The Daily beast earlier this year. “I look at stuff now like, ‘OK, that’s where I was in my early twenties. That’s how I was thinking in my early twenties,’” he said.“I was trying to work it out and I appreciate being allowed to work it out. Now, you don’t get a chance to learn on the job. I learned on the job. I had the chance to have triumphs and mistakes and learn from those mistakes by making films. And I’m very grateful for it.”
Singleton, who had been a vocal critic of Hollywood’s marginalization of black directors, writers and actors, said progress still had to be made to level the playing field in Hollywood.
“They want to water us down, water [the stories] down, make the stories neutral and not potent,” he said, acknowledging that things are better than when he won his Oscar nomination 30 years earlier. “The audience won’t allow it anymore—other people telling our black stories. That’s old. You need someone, a conscious African-American, to tell certain stories. Not a puppet that’s going to do whatever.”
Singleton is survived by five children from two wives. READ THIS LIST"
How House Dems Plan to Stop Trump’s Birth Control ‘Gag Rule’,www.thedailybeast.com,Laura Bassett,04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-house-democrats-plan-to-stop-president-trumps-birth-control-gag-rule,"How House Dems Plan to Stop Trump’s Birth Control ‘Gag Rule’ Title X has always had strong bipartisan support, until now. 04.29.19 4:25 PM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos Getty
Democratic leadership has found a way to block President Trump’s domestic “gag rule” on abortion: The House will only pay for a federal family planning program that doesn’t include it.
The Trump Administration released a rule in March that said no federal family planning funds can go to any group that provides or even refers patients to abortions. That includes Planned Parenthood, which uses Title X family planning funds to subsidize birth control and STI tests for low-income patients. (Federal funds are already prohibited from paying for abortions.)
The rule, which was supposed to take effect this week, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge after Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit against it. And House Democrats, who mainly control the nation’s purse strings, included language in their annual Labor-HHS Appropriations Act on Monday that would permanently block the abortion gag rule by refusing to allocate funds toward implementing it.
“Democrats are standing up for women’s healthcare by pushing back on the Trump-Pence administration’s dangerous attacks on family planning services, including abortion and contraception,” said Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Ct.). “Women know what is best for them and their families much better than this administration. That is why we are fighting to protect Title X and the millions of patients who get care through this program in this year’s Labor-HHS funding bill.”
This approach may face long odds in the Republican-controlled Senate. However, two key Senators, Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), have signaled they are open to blocking the change. The senators co-wrote a letter saying they oppose Trump’s abortion gag rule when it was first reported last year, and Collins said in February that she was considering legislative remedies to block its implementation.
“I oppose this misguided rule change that could significantly diminish access for women to crucial contraceptive services, which have been critical in reducing the number of abortions in our country over the past three decades,” she said in a statement .
The Senate Appropriations Committee drives the Senate’s negotiations with the House, and Labor-HHS appropriations bills typically do not go to the Senate floor before that conference takes place. So it’s likely that the House version will go to a full vote in the Senate, putting pressure on Republicans to either fund this decades-old family planning program as it has been carried out for decades or scrap the whole government funding bill in order to keep birth control subsidies from Planned Parenthood and other providers.
Trump also has the power to veto the appropriations bill, it wouldn’t be the first time he signed appropriations bills before that include provisions he didn’t like.
Not to mention, stripping funding from Planned Parenthood is broadly unpopular with voters, which is why Republicans have failed to do so even with control of both chambers of Congress.
“There’s a lot of good reason to think that this protection has a real shot at ultimately becoming law,” said Emily Stewart, Planned Parenthood’s vice president of public policy, who lobbied Democrats on this issue. “We believe we are standing on very firm ground.”
Title X has long been a bipartisan program. Then-Texas Rep. George H.W. Bush championed it in Congress in 1970, and Republican President Richard Nixon signed into law. The program provides nearly $300 million a year to clinics that provide family planning services to 4 million low-income men and women -- mostly people of color. Forty-one percent of Title X recipients receive those services from Planned Parenthood, which would be barred from the program under Trump’s new rule.
Congress has mandated since 1996 that pregnant women using the Title X program must receive “nondirective counseling” from medical providers, which means full, unbiased information about their options. U.S. District Judge Stanley Bastian granted a preliminary injunction last week in response to lawsuits from family planning providers claiming that the gag rule violates federal law.
“It reverses long-standing positions of the Department without proper consideration of sound medical opinions and the economic and non-economic consequences,” he wrote.
Planned Parenthood president Leana Wen, a physician, thanked House Democrats in a statement on Wednesday for standing up to the Trump administration over birth control funds.
“The Title X gag rule is unethical, it’s dangerous, and it’s illegal,” she said. “Planned Parenthood applauds our health care champions in Congress who are taking action to stop the gag rule and protect health care for the 4 million people who depend on Title X health centers.” READ THIS LIST"

Pilar Melendez 04.29.19 3:43 PM ET
A Georgia woman who represented herself at her own murder trial was convicted on Monday of starving her 10-year-old stepdaughter to death, then burning her body.
Tiffany Moss, 36, was found guilty on all eight counts against her—including malice murder, felony murder, first-degree cruelty to children, and concealing the death of another—for her repeated abuse of Emani Moss, who died in 2013.
The Gwinnett County jury reached their verdict in less than three hours. The mother of two, who represented herself during the trial, now faces the death penalty.
“[Emani] wasn’t a child to her,” Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney Lisa Jones said in her closing argument on Friday. “She was nothing. She was a nuisance. She was ugly. She was a pain. She was disposable. She was trash.”
Prosecutors argued that after the child died, Moss and her husband, Eman Moss, doused her body with an accelerant and set her on fire outside of their apartment in an attempt to cover up their crimes. Eman Moss is already serving a life sentence after pleading guilty in 2015 for his role in his daughter’s death.
“This is a case where you only have an evil stepmother,” Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter said at the start of the trial, describing the case as “a Cinderella story gone horribly wrong.” “As a result of that, a 11-year-old child is starved to death while her own children remained healthy and happy.”
Prosecutors accused Moss of “deliberately starving” Emani and sometimes even beating her with a brown leather belt. The abuse got so extreme, Jones said , Emani would often run away and sleep outside in bushes to escape her stepmom.
On Oct. 24, 2013, her father returned home from work and found Emani unresponsive in a bathtub. Taking her out of the tub, Eman Moss placed his only daughter in her bed, prosecutors said. The 10-year-old died several days later. She was denied food the entire time, prosecutors said.
“Emani died in that room, in her own filth and waste, by herself while this defendant watched TV and cooked lasagna,” Jones said.
When authorities found 10-year-old Emani Moss’ body in a trash can on Nov. 2, 2013, she weighed 32 pounds, the approximate size of a toddler.
“She was more or less skin and bones,” Dr. Michele Stauffenberg, the medical examiner who conducted Emani’s autopsy, testified on Friday. “She was extremely thin and emaciated. She had a starved look.”
Eman Moss also testified against his wife on Thursday in accordance with his plea deal, detailing the weeks leading up to his daughter’s death and the moment they realized she was dead.
“[Tiffany] was saying, ‘We can’t call 911. We’ve got to hide the body,’” he said , adding that they kept the child’s body in their apartment for several days while they figured out their next move. Moss, who was still on probation for an earlier abuse charge, told her husband she was scared she would lose custody of her two biological children.
“We talked about concealing her death, making it seem like she ran away,” the father said while Tiffany stared at him in court emotionless.
Eman Moss testified that while his wife wanted to bury the 10-year-old, he went to Home Depot and bought a galvanized trash can, trash bags, charcoal, and lighter fluid as part of an attempt to cremate her body . Eventually, he called police, unable to live with the guilt, he said.
Moss did not mount a defense at trial, and did not make a closing argument on Friday. Her court-appointed standby lawyers, Brad Gardner and Emily Gilbert, asked the judge on Friday to let them step in on their clients’ behalf, but their request was declined.
The lawyers, who were assigned to Moss from the State Office of the Capital Defender, also filed a motion on Thursday requesting they be allowed to represent Moss during the sentencing phase of the trial “should she be found guilty,” according to court records.
“The jury will have nothing upon which to base a life sentence, not because Mrs. Moss wanted the death penalty, but because she was incapable of representing herself,” Gardner wrote in a motion.
If sentenced to death, Moss would be the third woman executed in Georgia."
Trump Allies Manage to Blame Ilhan Omar for Right-Wing Terror Attack on Poway Synagogue,www.thedailybeast.com,William.Sommer@thedailybeast.com (Will Sommer),04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/poway-synagoge-shooting-trump-allies-blame-ilhan-omar-for-right-wing-terror-attack,"CONFUSED MUCH? Trump Allies Manage to Blame Ilhan Omar for Right-Wing Terror Attack on Poway Synagogue Fox News and Ted Cruz accuse the Muslim-American congresswoman of anti-Semitism and somehow say she’s to blame for murderers who hate her kind. 04.29.19 3:23 PM ET Shutterstock
Hours after a far-right gunman allegedly killed one person and injured others at a synagogue in Poway, California, President Trump’s allies keyed in on a surprising person to blame for the shooting and other recent anti-Semitic attacks: Rep. Ilhan Omar.
The alleged attacker, John Earnest , posted a manifesto to the extreme right internet forum 8Chan, where it was filled with references to anti-Semitic right-wing memes. The statement criticized Trump for not being right wing enough, and claimed that white people were at risk of being exterminated by immigrants and Jews—a favorite trope of the far-right.
The statement also Brenton Tarrant, the alleged terrorist who killed 50 people at a Christchurch, New Zealand mosque, saying Muslims were replacing whites. It also praised Robert Bowers, who similarly blamed Jews for orchestrating the destruction of the white race through immigration and attacked a Pittsburgh synagogue last year.
Despite the overwhelming evidence of Earnest’s far-right inspirations, Fox News guests tried to connect it to Omar, the Democrat from Minnesota who has been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for saying pro-Israel groups use money to win favor with American politicians.
On Sunday morning, Fox News hosted Elizabeth Pipko, a pro-Trump personality who is attempting to convince Jewish voters to leave the Democratic Party. Pipko first blamed the shooting on a recent New York Times cartoon that pictured Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a dog leading Donald Trump. The Times later apologized for the cartoon.
“Things like that cause things that happened yesterday,” Pipko said.
Prompted by a Fox host who asked if Omar would inspire Jewish voters to leave the Democratic Party, Pipko slammed the congresswoman.
“I think a lot of American Jews right now feel uneasy,” Pipko said. “Both sides have made mistakes.”
Fox News didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Pipko wasn’t the only Fox guest on Sunday who attacked Omar in the wake of the shooting. Rabbi Evan Moffic claimed that Omar’s comments had required rabbis to ramp up security at their synagogues — even though both the Poway shooting and the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting in October 2018 were allegedly perpetrated by far-right gunmen.
“That’s a direct result of the rhetoric,” Moffic said of Omar.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) also attacked Omar the day after the shooting, calling her part of “the anti-Semitic left” in a tweet.
“The House can’t even pass an anti-Semitism resolution,” Cruz wrote. “Responsible Dems need to say Enough is Enough.”
Omar responded with her own tweet, accusing Cruz of ignoring the Poway shooting.
“A white nationalist literally terrorized a synagogue during Passover yesterday and you have yet to say anything,” Omar wrote. “Shame on you.”
The attempts to focus on Omar, rather than far-right extremism online, in the wake of white nationalist violence aren’t new. Earlier in April, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on white nationalism. Rather than focus on the right-wing groups that were supposed to be the topic of the hearing, though, Republicans on the committee asked conservative witnesses like Zionists of America’s Morton Klein about whether Omar was promoting anti-Semitism.

Biden’s Pitch: I’m Good Enough for Democrats and Better Than Trump,www.thedailybeast.com,Matt.Lewis@thedailybeast.com (Matt Lewis),04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bidens-pitch-im-good-enough-for-democrats-and-better-than-trump,"ABIDE WITH ME Biden’s Pitch: I’m Good Enough for Democrats and Better Than Trump The old white guy opens up by playing defense with primary voters, and offense with general election voters. opinion Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast / Photos Getty
We are starting to see what a Joe Biden candidacy will look like. It’s a two-pronged approach, designed to (a) inoculate himself against charges of being an old white guy in a Democratic primary, while (b) simultaneously casting himself as the old white guy who’s Donald Trump’s most serious obstacle to winning states like Pennsylvania.
This was the backdrop when Joe Biden took the stage to Bruce Springsteen’s “We Take Care of Our Own” on Monday for his first campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was there to give a speech about rebuilding the middle class and to receive the backing of the International Association of Fire Fighters labor union.
Biden described his priorities as a campaign to “restore the soul of the nation” and “to rebuild the backbone of this nation.” Last week’s video rollout was largely about checking the box on the former. Monday’s rally in Pittsburgh was about the latter. (Biden added a third prong—unifying America—but every candidate says that.)
But faced with a good economy (the unemployment rate in Pennsylvania is 4.3 percent) coupled with Trump’s penchant for at least sounding like a populist, this was a tougher-than-normal challenge.
As Trump tweeted on Monday : “Sleepy Joe Biden is having his first rally in the Great State of Pennsylvania. He obviously doesn’t know that Pennsylvania is having one of the best economic years in its history, with lowest unemployment EVER, a now thriving Steel Industry (that was dead) & great future! ”
The most straightforward way for Biden to defeat Trump is to win back states like Pennsylvania (the last Democrat to win the presidency without the keystone state of Pennsylvania was Harry Truman in 1948)—and the most straightforward way to do that would be to play the populist card.
Biden tried to get around this by talking about how “It’s not enough for the stock market to rise.” He noted that “Too many people are left out or left behind.” And he implied that Trump’s brand of populism is just for straight white men, insisting that “All America has to be included… as we rebuild.” He talked frequently about “dignity” and, specifically, the dignity of work.
“I believe that Pittsburgh represents the cities and towns that make up hard-working middle-class Americans who are the backbone of this nation,” he said.
“If I’m going to be able to beat Donald Trump in 2020, it’s gonna happen here,” he continued.
In hindsight, last week’s decision to focus his launch video on Charlottesville and the “battle for America’s soul” makes more sense when you think of it as a one-two punch.
It also proved profitable (on many levels) for Biden. For one thing, he raised $6.3 million in his first 24 hours after the announcement. It’s hard to argue with (that kind of) money. Equally important, the story ended up driving a week’s worth of news cycles.
This narrative was aided by Trump’s choosing to respond to the launch video (which Biden might have predicted) and another horrific attack on a synagogue in Poway, California (which Biden couldn’t have predicted).
Talk of racism and hate crimes dominated the news cycle for days, and by highlighting Charlottesville (where white supremacists chanted “Jews will not replace us” in 2017) Biden positioned himself as the Democrat calling out Trump on these issues.
So, on one hand, Biden got a lot more mileage out of an announcement than most presidential candidates can sustain. On the other hand, the choice of focusing his first campaign video on Charlottesville demonstrates the surprising challenges Biden may face by trying to out-populist Donald Trump.
Biden’s trip to Pennsylvania, coming on the heels of the video announcement, was the perfect opportunity for Biden to discuss the lunch-pail issues that may resonate with Rust Belt voters, but it was also just miles away from Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue, where a white supremacist killed 11 worshippers last October (it should be noted that, in this instance, the shooter was no fan of Trump). Indeed, he opened his rally by referencing this tragic event.
Pittsburgh, it turns out, was the perfect place to combine his message about hate and racism with his message about working-class Americans.
One is largely about winning the primary. The other is largely about winning the Electoral College. Both are vital if Joe Biden is to succeed. READ THIS LIST"

New York Times Drops Syndication Service That Supplied Anti-Semitic Cartoon,www.thedailybeast.com,lloyd.grove@thedailybeast.com (Lloyd Grove),04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-york-times-drops-syndication-service-that-supplied-anti-semitic-cartoon,"NO MORE New York Times Drops Syndication Service That Supplied Anti-Semitic Cartoon A ‘Times’ spokesperson told The Daily Beast exclusively about the paper’s decision to stop using syndicated cartoons, including those from the syndicator of the offensive cartoon. exclusive Gary Hershorn/Getty
The New York Times decided on Monday to cease the Times ’ relationship with the syndication service that supplied an anti-Semitic political cartoon that ran in last Thursday’s international print edition of the newspaper.
The cartoon, drawn by Portuguese artist António Moreira Antunes and originally published by the Lisbon newspaper Expresso , depicted a blind, yarmulke-wearing Donald Trump being led by a dachshund sporting the face of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a Star of David dog collar.
A Times spokesperson told The Daily Beast exclusively about the paper’s decision to stop using syndicated cartoons, especially from CartoonArts, the New York-based syndicator that has been providing the Times and other newspapers with more than 30 cartoons weekly through the Times Licensing Group for several decades.
The announcement came after The Daily Beast conveyed to the Times a complaint from Jonathan Greenblatt, executive director of the Anti-Defamation League, about a second cartoon published over the weekend in the paper’s international edition.
This one depicted Netanyahu dressed as the Old Testament prophet Moses, sporting sunglasses as he descends from a mountain while holding a selfie stick in one hand and, with the other, hoisting aloft a stone tablet graced by the Jewish star.
“It looked like the Ten Commandments,” Greenblatt told The Daily Beast, “It might not be as blatantly anti-Semitic as the first cartoon, but it was clearly insensitive and absolutely offensive after the first piece of propaganda.”
After a request for comment, Eileen Murphy, the Times ’ head of communications, emailed this statement: “The cartoon that ran in the international print edition of The Times last Thursday was clearly anti-Semitic and indefensible and we apologize for its publication. While we don't think this [second] cartoon falls into that category, for now, we've decided to suspend the future publication of syndicated cartoons.”
In an interview, Greenblatt called the newspaper’s apology—which was issued Sunday—“a good start but it’s insufficient,” and added: “We need action and accountability. We don’t need apologies at this point.”
Greenblatt’s criticisms—which he said he’s registered personally to “the leadership of The New York Times ”—come at a moment when an apparent white nationalist gunned down Passover worshipers Saturday morning at a Southern California synagogue, wounding several and killing a 60-year-old woman. “To see the New York Times publish a piece of propaganda that clearly communicates that Jews have excessive control, or that Jews manipulate events, is unconscionable”
The ADL is preparing to issue a report on Tuesday showing an alarming increase in anti-Semitic incidents, year over year, in the United States.
“ The New York Times sets the tone of the public conversation,” Greenblatt said, adding that the publication of the first cartoon “is an example of the normalization of anti-Semitism that we worry so much about at ADL. And in an environment where anti-Semitism is on the rise… where people like the shooter this weekend are taking inspiration from these conspiracy theories that Jews have excessive control, that Jews manipulate events—to then see The New York Times publish a piece of propaganda that clearly communicates that Jews have excessive control, or that Jews manipulate events, is unconscionable.”
Greenblatt said that in his conversations with the Times ’ leaders, “I’m strongly encouraging them to do more. It’s overdue frankly. We’re going to continue to apply all that we can… There is a deep problem here, and it needs to be dealt with. Standing up to anti-Semitism isn’t something you should after the fact. It needs to happen before there’s an incident… I think the Times needs to take corrective action in advance to ensure that this never happens again.”
The Times initially called publishing Thursday’s cartoon “an error of judgment” but didn’t apologize. But after a storm of criticism, the paper issued a statement saying “we are deeply sorry” and vowed : “[W]e are committed to making sure nothing like this happens again.”
Greenblatt added: “They absolutely need policies and procedures… They need a clarification about how these decisions get made. And the person who would make such a decision to publish a cartoon like that, I think it’s kind of obvious that they don’t have the judgment that’s necessary to be in an institution like the Times … I think they need a thorough review and an overhaul of how those decisions get made. I don’t know, was it one person? Multiple people? I don’t think it’s very clear at this point. This wasn’t a misjudgment, it was a moral failing. It wasn’t a clerical error.”
The Times initially blamed the cartoon’s publication on an unidentified editor who was “working without adequate oversight” because of a “faulty process,” according to a Times story .
Times columnist Bret Stephens also weighed in , writing on Sunday: “The paper owes the Israeli prime minister an apology. It owes itself some serious reflection as to how it came to publish that cartoon—and how its publication came, to many longtime readers, as a shock but not a surprise.”
Greenblatt, for his part, called on Times management to “institute sensitivity training for the staff on anti-Semitism. Clearly they need it, to make sure they cover these issues with an eye toward focusing on the facts rather than perpetuating prejudice. And thirdly, I think they owe it to their readership to educate them on the persistent poison of anti-Jewish hate.”
Murphy declined to comment on Greenblatt’s recommendation to start sensitivity training sessions, or his suggestion that the editor or editors involved shouldn’t be working for the Times ."
Bank Worker Gets 10 Years for Insanely Elaborate $4M Heist,www.thedailybeast.com,Tracy.Connor@thedailybeast.com (Tracy Connor),04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/alaska-keybank-worker-gets-10-years-for-insanely-elaborate-dollar4-million-heist,"BEST LAID PLANS Bank Worker Gets 10 Years for Insanely Elaborate $4M Heist Gerardo Adan Cazarez Valenzuela planned every detail, down to hiring a private getaway jet, but he didn’t count on Mexican police searching his luggage. 04.29.19 7:58 PM ET U.S. Attorney’s Office
An Alaska man who pulled off a $4 million bank caper worthy of Hollywood—but with an ending that went badly awry—was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison on top of the seven years he spent behind bars in Mexico.
Gerardo Adan Cazarez Valenzuela was the vault manager for a KeyBank branch in Anchorage in 2011 when he cooked up a complicated scheme to rob his employer and flee the country.
According to prosecutors, Valenzuela meticulously plotted the heist and the getaway—having his brother buy him an AK-47, buying a plane ticket to Seattle for his girlfriend, and using a bogus employee training exercise to remove dual controls from the vault.
In late July of that year, he stole $30,000 from the bank and used some of the money to rent a private jet. A day later, he told his boss he was staying late to organize an ice-cream social for customers.
When everyone was gone, Valenzuela went into the vault, boxed up $4.3 million in cash, rolled it to the parking lot, drove to the private jet, and flew to Seattle—where his girlfriend was waiting for him, according to court documents. He plunked down $19,000 for a new car and headed south.
To give himself more time to get out of the country, Valenzuela set the timer on the vault lock to six days and mailed his and his galpal’s cellphones to New York to throw investigators.
He managed to drive to Mexico before the theft was discovered, but the escape ended at a checkpoint where police inspected his luggage and found $3.8 million in cash and firearms.
Valenzuela was arrested and convicted of money-laundering and firearms smuggling. After serving seven years in Mexico—in a lockup he called “the filthiest place imaginable”—he was extradited to Alaska, where he pleaded guilty.
In a pre-sentencing memo, the bank thief apologized and claimed he stole the money to pay for his father’s medical expenses.
“I accept full responsibility for my actions, and although I was heavily addicted to cocaine and alcohol, there is no excuse for how selfish and inconsiderate I was,"" he said.
He claimed that he left $500,000 with family in Washington state before he fled the country but that his father, now dead, was robbed, so he cannot recover and return it.
In their sentencing report, prosecutors said that story was probably false and that Valenzuela had previously admitted his brother stashed the remaining cash somewhere so he would have something to fall back on if he got caught.
They also noted that before the bank theft, Valenzuela had a line he often used on his co-workers: “You can trust me with your life, but not your money.”"

President Trump, members of his family, and the Trump Organization have filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank and Capital One to stop the banks from answering congressional subpoenas.
According to court documents filed in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York on Monday, the Trump family argues that such subpoenas—part of an extensive House Judiciary Committee investigation into public corruption and obstruction of justice—are meant to “ferret about for any material that might be used to cause [the president] political damage” and that “no grounds exist to establish any purpose other than a political one.”
News of the suit was first reported by The New York Times.
“We filed this case to protect the privacy rights of the President, his family and their businesses,” Trump’s attorneys reportedly said in a statement on Monday . “The subpoenas issued to Deutsche Bank and Capital One by Chairpersons Schiff and Waters are unlawful and illegitimate. They seek information going back decades from anyone with even a tangential connection to the President, including children minors and spouses.”
“Every citizen should be concerned about this sweeping, lawless, invasion of privacy,” the statement continued. “We look forward to vindicating our clients’ rights in this matter.”
The suit also contends that, on April 17, 2019, attorneys for Deutsche Bank issued a written statement that said the subpoenas seek “‘records and/ or information related to banking activities, including information regarding accounts, financings, and related financial information’ for all named Plaintiffs.’”
A Deutsche Bank spokeswoman told the Times “we remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations and will abide by a court order regarding such investigations.”

POWAY, California— Lori Gilbert Kaye dreamed as a child of being a TV newscaster who shared stories about the world with viewers. But in a tragic turn of events Kaye became the focus of news reports worldwide in recent days because she was killed in the shooting at Chabad of Poway synagogue while trying to protect her rabbi.
Kaye’s 22-year-old daughter, Hannah, told those gathered at the synagogue Monday for Kaye’s funeral, it is fitting her mother will be remembered for her brave actions on Saturday .
“For this, my mother’s childhood dream has come true of wanting to share a story with the world, in this case, her heroism,” said Hannah, a UCLA student.
Kaye, 60, was the only person killed in the shooting believed to be inspired by the anti-Semitism of a lone gunman, though three others were injured, including Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein.
Howard Kaye, a doctor who unsuccessfully tried to revive his wife after she was shot, said the bloodshed was a stark contrast to the message of peace his wife promoted. Kaye kept a peace pole outside their house that said in multiple languages, “May peace prevail on earth.”
“That is the universal message from Lori, and our household and of my daughter,” Howard Kaye said.
Kaye, who was at Chabad on Saturday along with her family for the last day of Passover to mourn her late mother, was also remembered as a devout Jew from a young age.
Hannah Kaye said Passover and Sukkot were her mother’s favorite holidays. Randi Grossman, one of two sisters Kaye leaves behind, recounted a Passover Seder she attended at Kaye’s Poway house just last week.
“You and Howard led the most beautiful Seder, of course ending with your trademark parting gifts,” Grossman said.
Many speakers at the funeral, which drew an overflow crowd watching on a large screen outside, remembered Kaye’s generosity.
She was known for delivering challah bread and coffee to family, friends and strangers.
Roneet Lev called Kaye the “queen of knick-knacks” and said her close friend’s generosity almost got her into trouble one time. Lev shared how airport security once stopped her and showed her there was a long knife in her luggage. At first, Lev thought the object couldn’t be hers.
“Then I remembered Lori,” Lev said. “She gave me a wrapped present to give my sister: a challah knife.”
Others who helped thwart the shooter from inflicting further damage were also acknowledged during the service on a gray and, at points, rainy day in Poway.
Oscar Stewart, an Iraq War Army veteran who yelled expletives at the gunman and helped chase him outside, sang “God Bless America” along with Poway Mayor Steve Vaus.
John T. Earnest, a 19-year-old nursing student, has been charged with Kaye’s murder and three counts of attempted murder. He will be arraigned Tuesday afternoon in San Diego County Superior Court.
Kaye’s daughter said she believes her mother has already forgiven the shooter “because her mission, how she lived her life, and her decision to preserve the life of the leader of the community.”
Meanwhile, Howard Kaye concluded his remarks about his late wife with a message for those perpetrating hatred in the world.
“Turn your life around,” he said. “Come back into the real world, the world of Lori, which is peace and love on earth.” READ THIS LIST"

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell gleefully signed a T-shirt joking about the death of former Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, according to photos tweeted Monday. The T-shirt features Garland’s face surrounded by clouds and the dates 3/16/16 and 1/3/17, with the cursive phrase “gone but not forgotten.” McConnell played an instrumental role in keeping Garland , who was nominated by then-President Barack Obama, from filling the seat vacated by Antonin Scalia. Within hours of Scalia’s death, McConnell declared a moratorium on any of Obama’s appointees, arguing that the nomination should be the responsibility of the next president. He refused to hold hearings on Garland, rendering Obama’s appointment meaningless and successfully holding the seat for Trump’s eventual pick, Neil Gorsuch. This isn’t the first time McConnell’s publicly gloated—soon after the court upheld Trump’s travel ban and sided with anti-abortion pregnancy clinics, McConnell spiked the football by tweeting a picture of himself with Gorsuch.

ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s New Video Is Desperate—but Potentially Effective,www.thedailybeast.com,Rita Katz,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadis-new-video-is-desperatebut-potentially-effective,"COME ONE, COME ALL ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s New Video Is Desperate—but Potentially Effective Sure, Baghdadi looks rough in his first video in five years. But that’s part of his transformation to hardened insurgent leader, and his appearance might draw recruits. 04.30.19 12:25 AM ET Reuters TV
On Sunday afternoon, ISIS and its supporters began hyping an upcoming video from al-Furqan Media Foundation, the group’s media arm largely dedicated to producing leadership speeches. Not counting audio releases, the upcoming video was to be Furqan’s first since a July 2016 video detailing the provinces, departments, and other structural components of the group.
Still, it was an unusually energetic promotional campaign for a video that no one even knew the subject of. New channels were created and social media dedicated to the upcoming release, disseminating its promotional banner. One ISIS-linked group, Bank al-Ansar, even issued a notice offering social media account credentials for anyone participating in the campaign.
The hype finally made sense Monday when the video was released, featuring elusive ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . The man who had so many times been reported dead or debilitatingly injured was right in front of us.
The new video marks Baghdadi’s first visual appearance since a July 2014 video in which he, then the newly announced leader of ISIS’ rapidly expanding “caliphate,” delivered a sermon in Mosul, Iraq.
In Monday’s video, Baghdadi lectures three masked men sitting across from him, their faces blurred, on numerous global developments, many of which are recent, including Israel’s April 9 legislative election and political protests in Algeria and Sudan. After the visual lecture section, he praises the ISIS-pledged perpetrators of the Easter church bombings across Sri Lanka , though this audio may have been added after his face-to-face lecture with the men.
Of note is that for all his talk about Sri Lanka, he didn’t once mention the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand as justification. His lack of commentary follows suit with ISIS’ official claim, showing once more that the group didn’t need New Zealand to justify its massacres in Sri Lanka as its warped ideology has long allowed and urged for attacks on Christians, which I wrote about in the attack’s aftermath.
His justification for the Sri Lanka attacks instead aims elsewhere.
“And as for your brothers in Sri Lanka,” he is heard saying while footage of the attackers and attacks rolls, “they have put joy in the hearts of the monotheists with their immersing operations that struck the homes of the Crusaders on their Easter, in vengeance for their brothers in Baghuz.”
This appeal to Baghuz (also spelled Baghouz), the last vestige of ISIS’ caliphate in Syria, reclaimed by coalition and Syria Democratic Forces in late March, is the most critical element of Baghdadi’s statements. The loss was a major blow to the so-called caliphate and a staple of some leaders’ narratives of the group’s “defeat.” However, immediately upon its defeat, ISIS began to spin it into a recruitment narrative of the world’s war against ISIS and, by extension, against Islam. Baghdadi is more than willing to play along:
The battle of Baghuz had ended, and in it the barbarity and savagery of the nation of the Cross toward the Ummah of Islam was clear. At the same time, the bravery, steadfastness, and endurance of the Ummah of Islam was evident. This steadfastness tore apart the hearts of the Crusaders, which increased their frustration and hatred against those firm people from the Ummah of Islam…
Baghdadi even directly mentions ISIS’ “Revenge Operations for Blessed Sham Province” military campaign of revenge-branded operations across different battle fronts, saying it spans “290 operations in eight countries.” This campaign likewise instructed ISIS-linked media groups and supporters to post incitements against the West and Christians via images, articles, and other types of media.
But even considering the most grandiose of his assertions and less-than-subtle narratives of the world’s war against Islam, there wasn’t much to Baghdadi’s words—at least not anything that wasn’t already stated by ISIS spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, its weekly Naba digital magazine, or even any fighter in a routine video.
That said, the real rhetorical weight of Baghdadi’s resurfacing is not so much in what he says but rather Baghdadi himself.
On one hand, Baghdadi looks healthy—or at least healthy enough—appearing in this new video as an unspoken answer to ISIS’ significant military defeats and repeated news he had been killed.
On the other hand, nearly five years since we last saw him deliver his sermon in Mosul, Baghdadi appears significantly aged. His beard, once mostly black, is now gray, the bottom half of it dyed. He sits on a carpeted floor in a tan pocketed vest, far removed from the elaborately carved stonework of Mosul’s Great Mosque, where he wore commandingly black garb and a notoriously fancy watch .
Of course, ISIS could have presented its leader in a much more esteemed way—perhaps behind a table, at a podium, or even with an updated Just for Men treatment. But ISIS’ circumstances have changed drastically in recent years. With that, what we see now is the new, rebranded Baghdadi: caliph of the people. No longer the well-groomed, fancy watch-wearing ruler of country-sized swathes of Iraq and Syria, but instead the hardened leader of an insurgent force.
If this sounds like an act of desperation by ISIS, it’s because it is, but that doesn’t mean it’s not potentially effective. What Baghdadi and ISIS are attempting to tap into are elements much older than his tenure as self-proclaimed caliph. Humble attire was a staple of Osama bin Laden. The way he dressed was something that added to his reputation as the rich kid who left it all for his religion—something Baghdadi may see as worth striving for, given the adoration of bin Laden across the entire global jihadi community.
Even putting Baghdadi’s attire aside, the very format of this video emulates that of another immensely popular jihadi figure, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, former leader of al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) and Baghdadi’s predecessor. The similarity between Monday’s showing of Baghdadi and “ A Message to the People ,” an April 2006 video showing Zarqawi sitting among a group of his own fighters, is impossible to ignore.
Monday’s video in many ways the last, but most powerful, recruitment hand the group’s leadership can play. It allows Baghdadi to prove he is alive while giving a jolt of life to the us-versus-the-world narrative that has already radicalized so many.
So while his appearance may not in itself project the military threat he once exerted, it nonetheless serves as a dangerously powerful line of outreach between Baghdadi and those who sincerely believe him to be their caliph.

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick Tells Laura Ingraham That Beto O’Rourke Is ‘Light in the Loafers’,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/texas-lt-gov-dan-patrick-tells-laura-ingraham-that-beto-orourke-is-light-in-the-loafers,"SAY WHAT? Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick Tells Laura Ingraham That Beto O’Rourke Is ‘Light in the Loafers’ ‘He is so light in the loafers he floats off the ground at times,’ Patrick, a longtime conservative talk radio host, said. Justin Baragona 04.30.19 12:12 AM ET
During a Monday night appearance on Fox News’ The Ingraham Angle , Republican Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick used a well-known if antiquated gay euphemism while describing Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke, prompting host Laura Ingraham to give him an opportunity to clean up his comments at the end of the interview.
Taking aim at the former Texas congressman right from the start, Patrick called O’Rourke a “moron” for saying undocumented immigrants are currently kept in “modern day bondage” because they are “living in the shadows” and employers use their immigration status as leverage.
Adding that O’Rourke “has no substance,” Patrick railed against the one-time Senate hopeful for supporting reparations for descendants of slaves, wondering if we were “ever going to let that go.”
“Whatever happened to this guy?!” Ingraham exclaimed. “What happened to this guy? Wasn’t he a little more reasonable not so long ago? Was he always this left wing? He never left the punk-rock weird—”
Patrick’s response to Ingraham’s question was to offer up a dose of homophobia.
“He is so light in the loafers he floats off the ground at times,” said the longtime conservative talk radio host.
After Patrick claimed he doesn’t “like to be critical and call someone names,” Ingraham ended the segment by asking the lieutenant governor what he meant by saying O’Rourke was “light in the loafers.”
“You just meant not consequential, correct? You didn’t mean any pejorative, right?” Ingraham added, helpfully walking Patrick through his clean-up.
“No, no, no! What I mean is he flaps his arms a lot,” Patrick shouted as Ingraham noted “people might think something else.”
“I meant he’s a lightweight,” Patrick said as the Fox News host nodded along. READ THIS LIST"

Ex-NFL Cheerleaders Speak Out Against Sexism and Abuse: ‘We Deserve to Be Respected’,www.thedailybeast.com,amy.zimmerman@thedailybeast.com (Amy Zimmerman),04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/ex-nfl-cheerleaders-speak-out-against-sexism-and-abuse-we-deserve-to-be-respected,"Ex-NFL Cheerleaders Speak Out Against Sexism and Abuse: ‘We Deserve to Be Respected’ Courtey Tribeca Film Festival ‘A Woman’s Work,’ a new doc chronicling the NFL’s exploitation of cheerleaders, premiered at Tribeca. The film’s whistleblowing subjects open up about their fight for fair pay. Amy Zimmerman 04.30.19 4:59 AM ET
I n 2014, former Oakland Raiders cheerleader Lacy Thibodeaux-Fields sued the team, claiming that she had been paid less than minimum wage for her work at practices and games—not to mention work-related expenses like transportation, clothing, and beauty upkeep.
Her lawsuit launched a movement .
A new documentary, A Woman’s Work: The NFL’s Cheerleader Problem , reveals that a third of NFL teams with cheerleaders have since been sued for wage theft, illegal employment practices and discrimination. The film, which was directed by Yu Gu and premiered at the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival, closely follows Thibodeaux-Fields and former Buffalo Bills cheerleader Maria Pinzone as they take legal action against their ex-employers .
The arc of Thibodeaux-Fields' and Pinzone’s journeys is one of rejecting patriarchal edicts both overt and unspoken. Their lawsuits are an outright violation of their grooming as NFL cheerleaders, who are consistently told that they should be grateful for the opportunity to perform alongside players for a pittance. Lacy and Maria reject the narrative that they owe their teams and the NFL for everything they’ve given them, instead laying outright claim to what they are owed—to the disapproval and censure of many, from football fans to other former cheerleaders.
“Oh she’s a cheerleader, she shouldn’t be upset about not getting paid,” said Thibodeaux-Fields, impersonating a dismissive response to the cheerleaders’ complaints during a recent interview. “Like, no, she’s working for an organization. She’s providing a service. She deserves to be paid. Period. It’s not even a question of what you do, what you’re wearing, how you’re dressed, how you dance, where you dance. If you’re making money for someone, it should be for yourself.”
Pinzone and Thibodeaux-Fields, as well as director Yu Gu, sat down with The Daily Beast in New York to talk about the film and reflect on their (largely successful) legal battles. The lawsuit against The Raiders resulted in a $1.25 million settlement, and ensured that future Raiderettes will earn $9 an hour, to be paid every two weeks (when Thibodeaux-Fields was a Raiderette, they were paid less than minimum wage, and only at the end of the season). Pinzone told The Daily Beast that they’re currently at a standstill and are hoping to get back into negotiations with the Bills soon: “We’re hopeful that we’ll be able to settle the case and come to a conclusion, and get what we ultimately went in seeking.”
When Gu first started filming Thibodeaux-Fields, the issue of fair treatment and wages for NFL cheerleaders wasn’t the massive story it is today. Nonetheless, she was immediately attracted to the idea of following these women as they attempted to take on a thoroughly American institution. “Football to me is such a microcosm of the values of the United States,” Gu told The Daily Beast. “And then there are the optics of it as well in terms of the 32 owners who are all old white male billionaires and the players who are predominantly African-American, and then the women who are on the sidelines cheering them on and providing this endless enthusiasm and support and loyalty for the team. So when I first found out about Lacy’s lawsuit, I was like, this is an opportunity to be able to see in an intimate way how this all comes together. What are the contradictions and the tensions within this world, and what does it tell about the larger world that we live in?”
Both Thibodeaux-Fields and Pinzone grew up with football, nurturing lifelong desires to cheer on a professional level. For Thibodeaux-Fields, her path seemed almost pre-ordained: “Growing up as a young girl who’s from a small town that shuts down for football, cheerleading and dance was always my first love and passion.” When it came to cheerleaders, “I looked up to those girls. I wanted to be one of those girls that people looked up to.”
“I spent every day in college on my treadmill thinking about one day I was going to audition for the NBA, one day I was going to be an NFL cheerleader,” she continued. “I wanted it so bad.”
She had a great experience dancing in college, where she was awarded a scholarship and compensated for her time. “I got to the NBA, the Warriors took great care of us, and I was paid for my time and given all these opportunities. And it wasn’t until I reached the Raiderette organization when I started being like, wait, what?”
“You know, we were in this big room,” she recalled, “And this was after we made the team, this was after our calendar was shot. This was after we formed relationships and we were in our lines for the season when we finally sat down and got all the rules and got the contract. And it wasn’t until that moment I realized: this is so different. Like, you’re not going to pay me ‘till the end of the season? You're only going to pay me $1,250 for the whole season?”
“Nobody was questioning it. I kept bringing it up at practice, like does it bother you guys that we don’t get paid? That’s just how it is in the NFL—that’s what I was told over and over again.”
Pinzone, who auditioned for the Buffalo Jills cheerleading program three times before making the team, expressed a similar disillusionment. “It just didn’t sit right with me going through the whole season. There were a few red flags and things that just kind of kept popping up. So I questioned a lot of things… So I went and talked to the attorneys about it. It was really more or less, I just wanted to get my story out there and what I had experienced and what I had went through and like, am I crazy to think these things?”
One particularly striking moment in the documentary cycles through a number of rules that NFL cheerleaders pledge to abide by. The rules range from physical appearance to comportment with the players. “Make a point to find out if a player is married,” The Raiderette handbook reads. “In most cases he will not tell you. Just think, how narrowly you missed having your photo in all the local papers, and/or being assaulted.” The Jills handbook orders them to “not be overly opinionated about anything,” and includes edicts on table manners and feminine hygiene products.
Pinzone told The Daily Beast, “For me, seeing that information presented to me, it was a little bit insulting. Like I needed to be told these things or they thought they needed to go over these things with me or something. It was just very bizarre. It took you back almost, to like the ‘50s.”
Legal docs allege the following: “The Jills were subjected to weekly ‘physique evaluations’ during which defendants’ representatives tested the Jills’ bodies for ‘jiggling.’ During the ‘Jiggle Test’ defendants scrutinized the women’s stomach, arms, legs, hips, and butt while she does jumping jacks. The physique evaluations largely determine whether or not any particular Jill would be allowed to perform at the Bills’ next home game.”
Gu said that she was struck by “the total imbalance of the control and the rules that [the cheerleading programs] had versus what the cheerleaders were getting compensated.” She added, “And also, it’s a double standard with the team in terms of like, you have to be perfect at all times, otherwise we’ll just get rid of you. But the football players, oh you can just do whatever you want.” “ One person in the office’s salary will employ 40 women; and instead they said, we’re going to punish you for standing up for your rights. ”
For Lacy and Maria, coming forward against their former employers came at a cost. They faced backlash both from other former cheerleaders who felt betrayed, and from outside critics who were dismissive of their fight for compensation. Pinzone explained that right after they filed the lawsuit, the Buffalo Bills shut down the Jills. “So that was really hard to deal with in the beginning because everyone was mad—there was a team picked out for the next season to start cheering and, you know, these girls wanted to cheer so bad. I know what it took for me to get on the team, three times trying out, and all the work and effort I put into making the team, so to take that away from them—I felt horrible that the Bills had made this decision to do that.”
As of publication the Jills program is still inactive, but Pinzone is hopeful that this film will help pressure the organization to “do it the right way,” noting, “Because they can, clearly, they did with the Raiderettes.” Thibodeaux-Fields chimed in, “It takes one person’s salary to pay 40 women the amount of money, minimum wage. One person in the office’s salary will employ 40 women; and instead they said, ‘We’re going to punish you for standing up for your rights.’”
She also felt isolated at times, recalling, “It did hurt, you know, when everyone disappeared, and were kind of like, ‘Oh no, I can’t believe she did that.’ But at the end of the day I was doing it for [other former Raiderettes] and I knew that it would be worth it. And whether they ever say it to me or not, I know they feel it.”
The film doesn’t shy away from drawing connections between the NFL’s treatment of its cheerleaders and a larger perceived “gender problem” between players accused of domestic violence and misconduct allegations within the organization. Documentary footage shows NFL commissioner Roger Goodell talking about a recent “women’s summit” and expressing their aim to get young girls participating in athletics, and to support female executives. A reporter asks about the apparent hypocrisy when “your largest and most visible group of women working for the league are the cheerleaders, who complain of pay inequity.” Goodell fails to recognize the “mixed message,” and insists that the NFL has always encouraged fair compensation.
While neither Lacy nor Maria were shocked to learn that other cheerleaders were also suffering, they had no idea that the labor violations were so widespread. “I had a suspicion,” Thibodeaux-Fields offered, “but as they were coming out, even [Maria’s] experience compared to my experience, that was devastating to learn what they actually did to them, like circling body parts…I would’ve walked out, honestly. That was so offensive to me and the fact that that was happening and she’s the first one to bring it up, and by herself, I was amazed.”
She went on to describe it as “disrespectful, bullying, and degrading.”
Speaking on the prevalence of these issues, Pinzone remarked that, “There’s really no way to find out. Every organization was run differently, did their own things. So it was not like there was this standard across the NFL—which they really need.” As if to illustrate their point, Thibodeaux-Fields and Pinzone revealed that they had only just met in the process of premiering the film.
“You see the isolation that they both felt on different levels, and the other women, too, who filed other lawsuits,” Gu commented. “It’s almost like we’re all struggling in these silos, but at the same time they’re sharing in the same fight. I would love for everybody to meet each other—not just in this film but in general, in terms of women fighting for women.” Thibodeaux-Fields emphatically agreed, recalling a thought she had during her flight to New York—that “women are so much more than the uniform that they wear.”
“Like, OK, I wore a skimpy little cheerleading outfit, right?” she began. “And then there’s women who are nurses in their scrubs and there are swimsuit models, exotic dancers, and Hooters girls. We’re all so much more than the uniform. And if we’re working, we deserve to be paid and we deserve to be respected and we deserve to feel safe, like all women.”"

The Inside Story of the $6 Million ‘Devil’s Violin’ Heist,www.thedailybeast.com,Nick Schager,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-inside-story-of-the-dollar6-million-devils-violin-heist,"WICKED GAMES The Inside Story of the $6 Million ‘Devil’s Violin’ Heist A new doc ‘Plucked,’ premiering at the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival, chronicles the theft of a $6 million Stradivarius violin that was rumored to have been touched by the Devil 04.30.19 5:26 AM ET Tribeca Film Festival
At Cremona, Italy’s Stradivarius Museum, peerless 18th century violins are protected by myriad security measures, including cameras, alarms, and armed guards stationed both in the museum’s hallways and inside a remote control booth. Though kept on display for the public, the instruments exist in what might rightfully be thought of as a glorified high-tech vault.
In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, circa 2008, however, the Lipinski Strad—a 1715 Stradivarius violin valued at over $6 million, and rumored to have once been touched by the Devil himself—was left in the hands of acclaimed musician Frank Almond, whose sole means of safeguarding it was hiding a cell phone in its case, for GPS-tracking purposes.
This was, as you might assume, a less-than-ideal way to handle a treasured work of musical art that was constructed centuries earlier by legendary craftsman. As Plucked makes clear, that assumption was proven correct on January 27, 2014, when after finishing a concert with the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra, Almond exited the building to head to his car, only to be confronted by a man with a taser. A debilitating jolt of electricity later, and Almond was on the ground screaming in pain, and the Stradivarius was speeding off in a van, its case discarded close by on the snowy side of the street.
Premiering at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival, Joel Van Haren’s gripping documentary is the story of both that heist and the police’s urgent efforts to recover it before it was irreparably damaged or, worse still, vanished forever—a fate that had previously befallen other prized violins pilfered from their caretakers. The ensuing investigation (including a $100,000 reward) soon led law enforcement to a colorful pair of suspects who didn’t come across as exceptionally careful (much less clever) about covering up their crime. Which they weren’t, in large part because the mastermind behind this snatching seemed, on some level, to court the notoriety his deed would inevitably engender.
That individual was Salah Salahadyn, who early on in Plucked discusses his fondness for hand-crafted works of historical art, as well as proclaims, “I pride myself on knowing things that other people don’t.” As Van Haren subsequently elucidates via a series of first-person interviews, Salah grew up on the wrong side of the Milwaukee tracks, and was sent to a suburban school for three grade-school years by his single mother, who encouraged his hunger for reading, knowledge, and the finer things in life. When he returned to his local public school, Salah claims, he felt out of place—his clothes, speech and interests were a cut above his peers, even though he wanted to fit in. This, in turn, led him to seek street cred by doing stupid things, like firebombing a store (which he denies), and stealing a $25,000 sculpture (which he confesses he did). “‘Plucked’ implies that Salah’s actions were the byproduct of racial and socioeconomic disparities.”
A stint in prison for the latter infraction followed, as did a relationship with long-time partner Latoya, the mother of his four kids, who admits—in one of Plucked ’s many deeply-weird moments—that she was attracted to Salah both because he was highly confident and intelligent, and because of his dark skin (“The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice!” she laughs). Unfortunately, Salah’s self-assurance bordered on the cocky (he says he has “a noble name attached to a noble person”). And his feelings about his hometown’s white culture and community—which he respected and coveted on the one hand, and deeply resented on the other—were intensely conflicted.
Through comments by Salah’s former school principal and late juxtapositions between a ritzy symphony gala and boarded-up inner-city storefronts, Plucked implies that Salah’s actions were the byproduct of racial and socioeconomic disparities. The fact that Van Haren hastily raises—and then drops—this suggestion speaks to its dubiousness, since the more persuasive motivation for Salah’s theft was, as Latoya contends, his massive ego. That ostensibly blinded him to his meager chances for success, which shrank from slim to none the second he enlisted a jujitsu-teaching barbershop owner named Universal Knowledge Allah (yes, that’s his real name) to aid him in his quest, and then found himself in an interrogation room where—as videos reveal—he looked guilty as sin.
Employing a mix of talking-head interviews, dramatic recreations and archival material, Van Haren generates potent intrigue from his depiction of detectives’ race-against-time search for the Lipinski Strad. He benefits from the considerable outrageousness of his tale and, particularly, of Salah, who, decked out in buttoned-to-the-top shirts, dark-rimmed glasses and a trim goatee, resembles a narcissistic-nerd character that Chris Rock might have played on Saturday Night Live , and whose justifications for his behavior are as unconvincing as his headspace is muddled. By the time he’s semi-playfully—albeit not quite playfully enough—forwarding the idea that he might have been Satanically enchanted by the violin (given its prominent relation to the Faustian legend), it’s apparent that he’s an erudite and cultured man with more than a few screws loose.
At a fleet 84 minutes, Plucked maintains suspense about the ultimate fate of the Lipinski Strad. Along the way, it exhibits a cheeky sense of humor—never better than during its climax, when handling the precious possession is equated with the moon landing, replete with cutaways to footage of a descending Apollo 11. Such comedic touches are apt in light of the bonkers nature of this headline-making material, which quickly attracted local and national media coverage. Though he doesn’t state it outright, Salah seems to have wanted that sort of disreputable attention, no matter if it put him back behind bars—a notion forwarded by a police-interrogation chat in which he acts borderline-offended by cops’ ignorance about his past crimes (thus mitigating his vision of himself as a criminal braniac).
A deeply-conflicted figure plagued by varying degrees of anger, arrogance, bitterness and covetousness—all of which were wrapped up in issues involving race, economic and social hierarchies, and his bizarro kinship with Morgan Freeman’s Moorish character Azeem from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (!)—Salah turns out to be Plucked’s most uniquely-fascinating subject. For a film that’s nominally about a fabled, and fabulously expensive, Stradivarius, that’s no small feat. READ THIS LIST "
Why the Next American President Should Be Able to Bartend,www.thedailybeast.com,David Wondrich,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-the-next-american-president-should-be-able-to-bartend,"POLITICAL (COCKTAIL) PARTY Why the Next American President Should Be Able to Bartend The skill and experience of bartending is, contrary to popular belief, excellent training to be a politician. opinion Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Photos Getty and Wikimedia Commons
It’s a testament to our age that a whole lot of people, our president among them, think both that it’s a sick burn to call someone a bartender, and that to point out that a person did such work is to prove that he or she is disqualified to hold political office.
Of course, by “he or she” I mean “she,” and by “she” I mean the Congressperson for the 14th District of New York, Ms. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez .
The fact that her political opponents are trying to use Rep. Ocasio-Cortez’s former occupation against her speaks volumes about their attitudes to the people who perform the services from which we weave the fabric of our daily lives.
But it also demonstrates how deeply unobservant they are. If they knew to look clearly at what happens around them, they’d know that bartender, like short-order cook, plumber and electrician, is one of those jobs that may not require an advanced degree, but does require an uncommon intelligence.
If that seems crazy to you, the next time you’re in a bar—and I mean a cocktail bar, where you can see the profession exercised at its full extent—spend a few minutes watching the bartender work and try to imagine how things would go if you were suddenly thrust in his or her place.
So there you are, standing behind the bar, and some guy in a Brooks Brothers shirt steps up and orders a round of drinks. Nothing weird, but not just shots and beers, either. Let’s call it, for the sake of argument, a Margarita —make that Tommy’s style—a Rittenhouse Rye Manhattan , a glass of white wine—nothing too oaky, though—a Penicillin, a pint of the IPA and…oh yeah, a Mai Tai .
Ok, go.
Not so simple, is it? If you were on the customer side of the bar, you’d put the order in and fully expect to have it all lined up on the bar in front of you in not much more than five minutes. Behind the bar, a lot has to happen in those five or six minutes, and it has to happen accurately and in the right order.
Those six drinks require, by my count, ingredients from 16 different bottles—everything from rye whiskey and tequila to ginger, agave, and orgeat syrups—plus a tap for the beer. All of those will have to be precisely measured. There are four different garnishes on top of that, and three different styles of glass to put everything in. Three of the drinks require shaking with ice and one stirring, also with ice. One drink needs rocks in its glass, another crushed ice and a third a small block of ice.
You can’t turn these out in any old order, either, not if you want your customers to be happy and leave generous tips. If you pour the beer and the wine first to get them out of your way, they’ll sit around getting warm (and in the beer’s case flat), while you make the other drinks. If you do the cocktails first, they’ll get warm while you’re seeing to the beer and the wine.
Here’s what you have to do, more or less (every experienced bartender will have his or her own solution for this problem). Ask if the guest wants the Margarita with salt and the Manhattan with a cherry or a twist and if he’d prefer the Riesling or the pinot grigio. Fill a cocktail glass with ice and set it to chill. Rub a cut lime around the outside rim of an Old-Fashioned glass and roll the wet part in coarse salt. Measure out the lime juice for the Margarita into one shaker and for the Mai Tai into another one. Measure out the agave syrup and tequila for the Margarita into the proper shaker. Measure out the orgeat syrup, orange curaçao and two rums for the Mai Tai into the proper shaker. Measure out the lemon juice, ginger syrup and blended Scotch for the Penicillin into its own shaker. Measure out the vermouth, bitters and Rittenhouse Rye for the Manhattan into a mixing glass. Add ice to the Manhattan and stir it. Let it “cook” in the mixing glass. Add ice to the other three drinks and shake them. Fill the salt-rimmed glass with ice cubes and strain the Margarita into it. Fill another Old-Fashioned glass with cracked ice and strain the Mai Tai into it. Put a large ice block or ball into a third Old-Fashioned glass and strain the Penicillin into it. Pour the Riesling. Strain the Manhattan into the chilled cocktail glass. Add a float of Laphroaig Single Malt Scotch to the Penicillin. Garnish the cocktails: a lime wheel for the Margarita, a piece of candied ginger for the Penicillin, a mint sprig and lime shell for the Mai Tai and a twist of lemon peel for the Manhattan. Deal out six cocktail napkins and put a drink on each. Smile.
Piece of cake, right?
Making a round of drinks is, essentially, a word problem, just like the ones that used to drive you crazy in tenth-grade math. “If Train A leaves the station at 11:13, and Train B…”—those things. Bartenders are presented with dozens of them a night, and they have to work them out on the spot, without benefit of time to think or paper on which to make calculations. As if that’s not enough, often a skilled bartender will work two or more such problems simultaneously, just to be efficient—if you’ve got drinks from different orders using the same bottle, why not weave ‘em together?
A good bartender has to be an on-the-fly systems engineer, able to hear an order and instantly diagram out a process that will quickly and efficiently result in the requested drinks all lined up on the bar and in peak condition. That requires a particular kind of intelligence. In computer terms, it needs a lot of RAM; of quick processing capacity.
But besides inborn quickness of mind, bartending requires a lot of study and preparation. The only way you can be sure you can engineer your drinks properly is if you’ve visualized what you’ll need during your shift and made sure it’s all in place: that your liquors are in stock, your tools are all present and accounted for, your juices are fresh, your twists cut, your ice ample.
Beyond that, you have to know what everything in those bottles is, because your customers will ask you. That means knowing the difference between génépi and genever; sotol and solera; brouillis and Brugal; Tullahoma, Tullamore and Tullibardine. More than that, you’ll need some basic knowledge of base materials (e.g., the different flavors rye and wheat bring to a bourbon), processes ( how does a column still work? ), regional cultures and a dozen other things. Top bartenders are always attending lectures, whether they’re on the traditions of Haitian rum, the history of the pot still , or the drinks of nineteenth-century Paris . If they’re not doing that, they’re reading books on whiskey or mezcal or mixology or practicing their wine-tasting.
Then there are the recipes. The best way to memorize the couple hundred that a good bartender must know is to do it analytically, rather than by rote. Most bartenders will organize the world of mixed drinks into various families , either standard ones or ones of their own, and then fit each new drink into a family based on common elements, even if that drink might be quite dissimilar to the eye. Thus you might find the Bloody Mary in the same category as the Gin Rickey , based on their common use of spirits, citrus and a lengthening agent (tomato juice for the Bloody, soda water for the Rickey).
But even if you master all this stuff; if you know your recipes, understand what’s in the bottles and engineer your rounds properly to get them out correctly and in time, Mr. Brooks Brothers still might not be happy with his order when it’s in front of him. Bartenders, of course, are expected to talk to their customers if their customers want to talk.
So if, while you were making his drinks, Mr. B. B. had asked you about the building going up across the street, told you about the Mai Tai he had once in Stockholm, or otherwise uttered whatever it was that was on his mind, you would be obligated to listen to him and make appropriate answers, even though that’s the equivalent of holding a conversation while working out a word problem. If he had turned his attention to another patron who was under no such obligation and made it clear that the attention was unwelcome, you would be obligated to divert his attention, diplomatically if possible.
If you put all these skills together, you end up with someone who has to be exceptionally quick-thinking, obsessively well-prepared, organized, curious, and diplomatic, but also decisive. Lawyers, who make up the vast majority of the House and the Senate, are trained to address a problem by fixing the liability for it; bartenders have to just fix it.
Given a choice of the training I’d want for my Representative, I’d say college, sure—most of the top bartenders I know have college degrees, although I know plenty of impressively knowledgeable ones who don’t—but then, given the choice between the Bar and the bar, I’ll take the one where they learn to fix things, not to fog them. Abraham Lincoln was a lawyer, but before that he was a bartender. I like to think that in him the better angel of his training prevailed. READ THIS LIST "
Travel to the Haunting Ruins of Chernobyl,www.thedailybeast.com,The Daily Beast,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/chernobyl-travel-to-its-haunting-ruins,"JUST BOOKED Travel to the Haunting Ruins of Chernobyl David McMillan has visited Chernobyl 22 times, making him uniquely positioned to document the forces of nature slowly taking the land back. 04.30.19 5:02 AM ET David McMillan
Chernobyl . It has been more than three decades, yet the name of this once-obscure Soviet Ukraine city is now synonymous with nuclear disaster. In recent years, it has also become a must-visit outside of Kiev for fans of disaster tourism—its abandoned homes, classrooms, and fields a source of eye-catching photography. Left to rot, it has also become a symbol of mother nature slowly reclaiming the ruins of 20th century progress. Its iconic status makes it a no-brainer, therefor, that this week's selection for Just Booked , our twice-a-month series on gorgeous travel-related coffee table books , is David Baillargeon's David McMillan: Growth and Decay: Pripyat and the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone from Steidl.
Since 1994, McMillan has visited Chernobyl 22 times, making him uniquely positioned to document the forces of nature slowly taking the land back. The images are arresting. On one page, white Soviet apartment blocks cross-cross the landscape with trees merely lining the streets and parks. On the facing page, a photograph from the same spot 20 years later shows only a couple buildings peeking through a dense forest. There are classrooms with crumbling walls and disintegrating Soviet paraphernalia and in another a group of mason jars entombed in cobwebs along a windowsill. The photographs are stunning reminders of so many things from the failures of the 20th century to our morbid fascination with decay. All of which make this book a worthy addition to any coffee table collection."
Lin-Manuel Miranda: How ‘Hamilton: The Exhibition’ Dives ‘Deeper’ Into History Than the Musical,www.thedailybeast.com,Kimberly Bellware,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/lin-manuel-miranda-how-hamilton-the-exhibition-dives-deeper-into-history-than-the-musical,"HISTORY LESSON Lin-Manuel Miranda: How ‘Hamilton: The Exhibition’ Dives ‘Deeper’ Into History Than the Musical Lin-Manuel Miranda and his colleagues have ensured historical accuracy meets gorgeous design in ‘Hamilton: The Exhibition.’ It’s also an experiment in civic engagement. 04.30.19 5:02 AM ET Timothy Hiatt/Getty
CHICAGO—For audiences interested in American history, the camps can be roughly broken down to those who like to absorb the lessons via Hollywood feature films and those who tackle them in a Ron Chernow-length tome.
Hamilton: The Exhibition , a new interactive museum that debuted in Chicago this weekend for an as-yet undetermined residency, manages to appeal to both.
The exhibition is a spinoff of Lin-Manuel Miranda ’s blockbuster Broadway musical, which has since expanded to Chicago, London and toured in Puerto Rico. But it’s also a worthy stand-alone experience that you don’t need an understanding of the stage show to appreciate.
At the weekend ribbon-cutting for the exhibition, Miranda told The Daily Beast the exhibit fills in the historical gaps and inaccuracies of the musical as it explores the larger context of the nation’s origin story.
“With [the musical], there's only so much I can do with two and a half hours of your time, and I have to make everything rhyme,” said Miranda, who served as an artistic advisor to the exhibition.
“Listen, I couldn't even fit Ben Franklin in my show; I couldn't get the state of Pennsylvania in. But here, we can do a deeper dive on slavery in the north and the south. We can talk about Native American contributions , we can talk about women in the war effort. And you can go down all of those tributaries during this exhibit.”
The experience is an impressive, spare-no-expense endeavor that packs in the careful curation and historical accuracy of a museum with the striking visuals, punchy soundtrack and accessible storytelling of Miranda’s stage show.
Miranda’s influence is clear, though he insisted his main contribution was hiring the best people to “do the things we don’t know how to do.” In that case, the A-team includes the work of set designer David Korins and the historical knowledge of Yale professor Joanne B. Freeman, widely considered the foremost expert on all things Alexander Hamilton .
Built inside an airplane hangar-sized structure on the shore of Lake Michigan, the feel is not quite a concert hall experience, but not quite a typical museum experience, either.
There are replicas of artifacts like Hamilton and Aaron Burr’s dueling pistols, interactive features about Hamilton’s pre-Revolution New York City, plenty of reading material and no shortage of highly Instagrammable set pieces (a palate-cleansing room dedicated to King George foregoes historical accuracy for flocked wallpaper and neon signage, but it’s all to good effect).
The exhibition is scheduled to allow a set number of visitors entry at a time, but once inside, you can move at your own pace. Go at a whirlwind speed and you’ll get out in about 45 minutes; linger over every placard and audio piece and it will take twice as long (but it’s worth the time).
Like the stage production that inspired it, the exhibition excels at making a 250-year-old story feel relevant and even familiar without being so dry that it seems like homework.
History buffs will geek out on the exacting attention to detail—things like the level of lighting in Hamilton’s ship from St. Croix to the precise distance he and Burr stood during their duel—while audiences as young as fourth-grade will come away remembering something about the Battle of Yorktown.
While the $40 admission (with discounts for youth, seniors and military members) costs more than a movie ticket, it’s far more accessible than the musical itself.
The creators—already confident that the exhibition will delight—voice the hope that it could also help “reaffirm the importance of our democracy,” and frame the exhibit as a celebration of those ideas.
Is that an awfully idealistic ambition for what is, lest we not forget, an extension of an extremely successful and lucrative creative commercial enterprise? Absolutely. But Hamilton: The Exhibition thankfully doesn’t feel like a soulless cash grab. The cynicism recedes at bit when you see the ways in which the exhibition steadily makes the case that it’s trying to be a better version of the history lessons that preceded it.
The notable inclusions are the stories and contributions of women, of enslaved people and of Native Americans. Not only are they present, they’re contextualized in a way that makes it clear just how incomplete the story of the country’s founding is without them.
In one room that reimagines a Revolution-era wintertime ball among the political elite, life-sized figures of Hamilton’s wife, Elizabeth Schuyler, the Comte de Rochambeau and others are positioned around the room. Visitors can point their listening devices at each figure’s placard to hear specific details about their life at that point in history.
On the perimeter of the ballroom is a figure dressed as a servant and labeled “unknown”—a composite of the many enslaved Africans whose stolen freedom helped build this country.
Instead of recounting in broad strokes the harshness of life for slaves during the American revolution, the audio instead challenges listeners to think about who this woman could have been—“Where was she from? Who did she love? What were her dreams?”—and how misshapen the legacy of our nation is because we don’t have answers for questions like these.
Miranda told The Daily Beast that his biggest insight when writing Hamilton was that the language he needed was contemporary because “the past is prologue in our country” and the fights we had during our nation’s founding are the fights we’re still having. “The election of 1800 taught us everything we need to know about every presidential election we're ever going to have. It was that ugly and that vicious.”
“The original sin of slavery is something we’re still grappling with, and its repercussions today,” Miranda said. “Every character in my show, except for George Washington, dies as a result of gun violence. We’re still deciding ‘when do we get involved in the affairs of others?’”
He singles out the part of the exhibition that covers the election of 1800, full of headlines that were written by John Adams about Thomas Jefferson and Jefferson about Adams.
“What’s there is every bit as misinformative as some of the misinformation we got in 2016,” Miranda said.” The election of 1800 taught us everything we need to know about every presidential election we're ever going to have. It was that ugly and that vicious. I mean, [Adams] printing a rumor that Jefferson died so ‘vote for me’—that’s shit that really happened!”
He added, “It's always amazing to sort of look at the past. I think it's important to look at the past, see what we've been through, and and see how we have emerged.”
Miranda expects the exhibition’s audience might share his competing feelings of frustration and comfort when it comes to understanding just how closely our present rhymes with history. “That's been sort of the biggest surprise for me: how often it comes up in political conversation, how people use the lyrics from the show. When healthcare repeal went down and people said, ‘You don’t have the votes,’ it’s very surreal. And it doesn’t stop being surreal.”
“My feelings on the fate of the country vary widely, from Twitter morning to Twitter morning, just like everyone else’s,” he said, laughing.
Miranda has felt the impact of Hamilton in many contexts. “I remember being so overwhelmed at the first Women’s March and seeing so many ‘History has its eyes on you’ and ‘Women are the sequel’ placards. When you see the lyrics of your show become shorthand in the national conversation it is truly overwhelming.
“That's been sort of the biggest surprise for me: how often it comes up in political conversation, how people use the lyrics from the show. When healthcare repeal went down and people said, ‘ You don’t have the votes ,’ it’s very surreal. And it doesn’t stop being surreal.”
The mood infusing the exhibition is a decidedly optimistic one. It ends with a room covered in the famous “History has its eyes on you” line from the musical. Having spent roughly an hour re-treading the hopes, mistakes and dreams of people who cared enough to get involved, visitors are given a place to reflect on how they might engage in civic discourse—at least before they hit the gift shop.

"Ukraine’s Funny New First Lady Is Dead Serious, Just Like Her Husband",www.thedailybeast.com,Anna Nemtsova,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/ukraines-funny-new-first-lady-olena-zelenska-is-dead-seriousjust-like-her-husband,"LAST LAUGH Ukraine’s Funny New First Lady Is Dead Serious, Just Like Her Husband Olena Zelenska used to write gags for the TV comedy that got her husband elected president of Ukraine. But she says their commitment to freedom and democracy is no joke. exclusive Sergei Grits/AP
KIEV—Ukraine’s new first lady, Olena Zelenska, cracks jokes for a living. Until a week ago, she was a professional scriptwriter on her husband's comedy show. Now it's time to become, well, not only serious but ""passionate about democracy,” she said in an interview with The Daily Beast.
Millions of Ukrainian fans of Servant of the People , the television program that starred her husband Volodymyr Zelenskiy as a fictional president, came to see him as a true fighter against corruption.
Now that he has been elected president for real, and by a landslide, will he stick to the model he and she created?
“It will be easy for my democratic husband to be the servant of the people, and not a master,” Zelenska said, then shook her head and gave a pensive little smile as we sat down to talk at Zelenskiy’s office in Kiev.
“It’s interesting what is happening now,” she said. “Not only our opponents, but even our supporters try to fit Volodymyr and me into some sort of caricature, discussing appearances—’Oh, he scratched himself!’ ‘Oh, she turned the wrong way!’ ‘Look at that gesture!’ ‘Look at him laughing!’ And we want to say, ‘Guys, you are used to the Soviet nomenklatura.’” She was referring to the stern-faced gray politicians and bureaucrats once appointed by the Communist Party. “A human being should stay human,” she said.
Criticism of Zelenskiy before the election focused on whether the untested politician was a puppet of the highly controversial exiled oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, owner of the television station that aired his comedy show.
“Volodymyr is never going to be anybody’s puppet,” Zelenska insisted. She said in 2015 she watched her husband fight against the oligarch’s effort at censorship. “We had a famous scandal when Kolomoisky canceled a broadcast of our political stage show on his TV channel 1+1 because of political jokes. Volodymyr called him on the phone and yelled so loudly that I thought we would never air our shows on TV again.”
“That was the turning point when we defended our independence,” said the first lady-elect.
Zelenska has known her husband since they met in high school in their hometown of Kryvyi Rih. They are the same age, 41, and sometimes they can understand each other without words, their friends told me. Over the last 15 years the couple created a political comedy club, “Quarter-95,” together with a team of some 700 friends and colleagues. But it hasn’t been a laugh a minute.
As we talked, Zelenska looked back on the last five years, from the “tragic” time when Russia annexed Crimea, to the scary days when her husband went touring the war zone in eastern Ukraine putting on shows for patriotic soldiers near the front lines.
Zelenska and her husband realized they had to do something to try to stop the crisis in Ukraine, she said, and finally they decided to participate in politics, not just satirize them. On election day, after winning more than 70 percent of the vote in a crushing defeat for incumbent Petro Poroshenko, the two kissed on stage with fireworks above them and dozens of cameras trained on them.
So, Volodymyr Zelenskiy is no longer the fictional president he and Zelenska used to discuss in their kitchen, writing jokes and snickering at preposterous situations, but a real leader, and head of a country still at war. But their personal style may not change that much.
Olena and Volodomyr share an apartment with their two children, two dogs, a guinea pig and fish tank, across the park from the parliament. The first lady thinks that her husband could walk to work. “That would be healthy for him. Why not? The Dutch prime minister goes to work on a bicycle,” she said.
More importantly, Zelenska is convinced the new team should keep away from the immense presidential administration building on Bankova Street known as a den of scheming office holders and operatives. Generations of bureaucrats and political advisers, including Paul Manafort, Donald Trump's former campaign chairman who is now in U.S. federal prison, wove their intrigues in that building.
“We don’t want to ever step inside,"" she said. ""The place is infected with its dark, negative past. We would be happy to make a contemporary museum out of that building, or pass it on to some university.”
The main question that millions have for the new president is how he is planning to develop his relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the first lady has a strong opinion about that hard question. “It is impossible to start from scratch. I don’t think there will be a direct bilateral negotiations any time soon,” Zelenska said. “Volodymyr is not ready for a curtsy before the aggressor, but he is ready to negotiate with Russia in the presence of international leaders.”
Indeed, new tensions between Moscow and Kiev erupted last week, when Putin announced that his government would give Russian passports to all interested Ukrainians.
President-elect Zelenskiy’s response: “I would not advise Russian authorities to waste time tempting Ukrainian citizens with passports of the Russian Federation. Ukrainians are free people in a free, independent, sovereign and indivisible country; and Ukrainian citizenship means freedom, dignity and honor.”
Ukraine’s president elect offered shelter and help to anybody who is ready to fight side by side with Ukraine “ for our freedom and yours ,” a resonant phrase that dates back to Polish and Russian uprisings in the 19th century.
“We satirists used to joke about all public figures non-stop,” Zelenska said, harking back to the early days ribbing President Leonid Kuchma, who left office in 2005. “Most politicians took our humor with dignity, the way it should be, like in the United States where you can call the president anything,” she said. “But in the last five years authorities indicated ‘the game is over.’ President Poroshenko’s elite tried to punish us for our jokes.”
Zelenska’s big eyes grew serious. “That’s when we decided to do something, to save our democracy. When TV channels one by one fell under the leadership’s control, we realized if we didn’t act, we’d end up in the same situation as Russia.”
In 2014, news poured in from the front lines of the war that was begun by Russian-backed separatists in the eastern or Donbass region of the country after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula. At the time the Zelenskiys’ little girl was nine and their boy only one year old. “I remember Volodymyr came home and gazed at our children with sad eyes,” Zelenska said. “I asked him to calm down; we had to do something about it.”
Soon Zelenskiy and his friends from Quarter-95 traveled along the front line giving shows and Olena stayed home to wait for them. “That was his civic position,” she said. “All our songs and performances were written with heart.”
Accusations suggesting they lacked patriotism were especially painful for the Zelenskiy couple. “For months our critics were creating and feeding scandals around us.""
Zelenskiy’s gang of comedians made sharp jokes about local and Russian politicians, which sometimes infuriated dangerous people. In 2014 their sketch about Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov breaking down in tears provoked death threats. A video on Youtube featured Chechens telling Zelensky to “get prepared for the cold earth.”
The Zelenskiy couple had to hire security. “We still don’t know if the threat was true or our law enforcement agencies were trying to scare us with stories of Chechen criminals arriving in Kiev to go after us,” Zelenska said. “I sent my security away, but kept the bodyguards for my children. The guys have become like members of the family. Hopefully we can keep them now.”
After a career making fun of everything she could, Ukraine’s first lady is quite serious about fighting for freedom, especially freedom of speech.
Her voice was strong and confident when she spoke about assassinations of journalists and activists, and the cases in particular of Pavel Sheremet and the activist Yekaterina Handziuk: “Reporters and activists get killed—that’s the worst nightmare; years pass by and the crimes have not been investigated. Now we hope to see justice, starting from investigating the shootings on Maidan square during the revolution,” she said.
“For some people it’s easier to exist without freedom, under restrictions defined for them,” Olena Zelenska told me. “But when politicians feel free to make decisions and give no freedom to journalists who want write openly about the truth, that is not honest.”"
Rightor Doyle Was a Dominatrix’s Bodyguard.

He Turned the Experience Into Netflix’s ‘Bonding.’ At 22, Rightor Doyle was trying to make it as an actor when he became the bodyguard to his friend, a dominatrix. The experience inspired him to create the Netflix show ‘Bonding.’ 04.30.19 5:02 AM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Photos Getty and Netflix
There are lots of different BDSM scenes in the Netflix comedy drama Bonding : the man who dresses as a penguin and wants to wrestle, the female partner of a man who wants to punch someone, the scary guy who wants to do real harm.
But at the heart of Bonding —for which Rightor Doyle is writer, director, showrunner, and executive producer—what is more involving than all the sex we see is the complex relationship of central characters Pete (Brendan Scannell) and Tiff (Zoe Levin).
Pete is loosely based on Doyle himself, who at 22, fresh in New York and trying to make it as an actor, became the bodyguard of his longtime friend, a real-life female dominatrix just like Tiff, whom he declines to name.
“What you see on screen is highly fictionalized, and my ‘Tiff’ was nothing like the character of Tiff, who is quite hard. She was joyful and lovely.”
Doyle, now 35 and starring in Barry , did the gig for six months, on and off. “The idea was that I would act as a witness of a kind. If it was an offsite job, you’re putting yourself into the hands of someone you don’t know and having a companion there can defuse any of the wrong kind of tension or danger. Consent is very sexy in dom culture. It’s part of the code you live by: the person needs a specific thing, and the dominatrix will supply that in a very specific way.”
The show has been criticized by dominatrixes and those within the BDSM community for— as IndieWire reported —casting “a bad shadow and stigma on professional domination,” as Mistress Synful Pleasure wrote. Others have criticized Doyle for not consulting enough people in the BDSM community in writing the show.
In response to the criticisms, Doyle told The Daily Beast: “I am very much listening to what the community has to say. The discourse happening on Twitter is important and I receive it fully. I am glad that these many differing opinions are being heard in an impactful way. They have certainly impacted me.
“Though it is based on a small chapter in my life and I did consult people in the community prior to filming, if given the opportunity to make more, I would be thrilled to invite a wide array of people into the conversation to deepen and enrich our knowledge of the world.
“The reach of Netflix is vast and hopefully Bonding , with its bright colors and comedic flourishes, helps change certain preconceived notions of this line of work. Tiff and Pete are not perfect, and I am certainly not perfect. But we can all learn and grow together.”
In an Instagram post , Doyle said he saw the show “as a way of dissecting the many ways the patriarchy had had a stranglehold over sexuality and shame.”
“As a young gay man still struggling with my own sexuality, guarding a door while one of my best friends from home tied a naked man to a four poster bed and whipped him was jarring to say the least, but to my surprise it eventually freed me of many of my own sexual hang-ups.”
In light of #MeToo, these stories became, for Doyle, “allegories on power, secrets, and consent.”
Doyle told The Daily Beast that hopes the show helps destroy the shame that people feel around all kinds of sex. What he hadn’t expected doing the job was to learn so much about “the way people communicate sexually and the specificity of what people need. It made me wish I was that honest in my life. My friend made it very fun for me. It could be a very intense situation, and then she would shoot me this little look to say, ‘We’re fine,’ and we started laughing.”
Doyle’s friend, also a student at university like Tiff on the show, was “super-intelligent” and could read people very well, he said.
He laughs today to recall how shocked he was to hear someone wanting to be pissed on. “In gay culture that’s not so bad. But back then, I was like, ‘Oh my God. Fucking excuse me .’ I never thought of that. I thought you only peed on someone only and specifically if they had been stung by a jellyfish, and even then it was an act of love.” “In ‘Bonding,’ people are doing things which you may judge, but then I want you to ask yourself about those judgments and to think about who these people really are.”
The look of Bonding is colorful and bright; more David LaChapelle than a stereotypical sex dungeon aesthetic. Doyle said he wanted to focus less on the kinds of sex in BDSM than to ask why people had it and what it means in the context of their lives. It is also about the co-dependency of Pete and Tiff themselves, which again is based on the relationships Doyle had with his close female friends.
“When I was 22 I was just coming out of the closet, so sexually I was not really evolved. I was learning to accept myself. Sex was bad, a secret disease that had taken over my body. In Bonding , people are doing things which you may judge, but then I want you to ask yourself about those judgments and to think about who these people really are.”
The show follows the 2015 TV series he created, The Walker , which he wrote based on his experiences of escorting famous friends to glamorous Hollywood parties.
“It was a weird thing. We were good friends, and yet the world saw me as this accessory if we were photographed when we were out. We were equals, and these women are the loves of my life, and I’m so happy for their success. But that whole experience showed me how the world sees that Hollywood world. At the parties we were seen as ‘ Will and Grace ,’ and back at home we were real and equal. But we survived!”
Doyle saw how insanely ageing was adjudicated by Hollywood , particularly for women, and “that if you don’t keep good people around you, you’ll lose yourself.”
Doyle grew up in New Orleans (13 generations of his family is from there, he said), the middle child between older twins (a boy and girl) and a younger brother. His parents, liberal and “wonderful,” would have welcomed if he had come out as a teenager, but Doyle did not. He said he was an angry child, with a huge ego, believing himself to be very special and not “getting my rightful due.”
He sang, danced, and acted at junior school, but at his all-boys Catholic high school “I was called a faggot every day. I failed myself out of high school. I wrote my name at top of tests, and turned them in blank. People aren’t afraid of gay people, but people are afraid of crazy people, and the bullies they laid off me after that. It was a weird way of asserting my own power.”
Doyle thought if he didn’t have sex with anyone “then I wouldn’t have to classify myself in any way. Everyone called me ‘gay’ so much that I thought I had to fight back against it. Now, it’s so amazing younger LGBT people can embrace who they are. ‘Gay’ was such a derogatory term when I was younger.”
All of his best friends were girls. “They were my protectors, educators, and confidantes. My relationship with them felt romantic in many ways. Even without sex there can be romance.”
At Bard College, he found “everyone had read Ulysses ,” and he began to value learning again. “I realized I couldn’t be the baddest bitch in the room. I had to focus and learn.” After college in New York, he tried to be the actor “doing Chekhov and plays where people slit their throats, but I realized there was someone else much cooler and better than me doing that work.”
A mentor advised him to lean into his gayness, to accept being a ‘type,’ and accumulate experience for his acting toolbox. That was freeing, Doyle said. He started having sex, although—unlike his friendships with women—it took him a little more time to develop such close friendships with other men. “What I did with my friend felt very weird and private and small. I don’t know if I was able to process it at that time. With a decade or more in between, I was able to see how a small kernel of story could become about something bigger.”
It was around this time that his bodyguard work began. Pete is probably more naïve and sheepish than he was, said Doyle.
Making Bonding was a “real slog.” The show was shot in 20 days, with cast and crew working from 4 a.m every day, a “labor of love.” He hopes it looks “like a $10 million thing.” Naturally, he would love Netflix to commission a second season. “What I did with my friend felt very weird and private and small. I don’t know if I was able to process it at that time. With a decade or more in between, I was able to see how a small kernel of story could become about something bigger.”
The complicated friendship of Pete and Tiff is an extension of Doyle’s own experiences: gay men and straight women are two disenfranchised groups, he said, and in Bonding we see a member of each of those groups vie for power. Tiff is a not just a dominatrix, but also dominant in the friendship with Pete, and Bonding follows the pair as they see how and if this relationship can be equal.
Another telling moment is when Pete’s potential partner tells him he’s not as special as he thinks; this isn’t said or intended cruelly, but more as a reminder that humans share many shades of similar experiences. “I thought of myself as so special as a child, and the dark truth I wasn’t as special and dark as I thought.”
Doyle's parents love Bonding . There’s nothing he could tell them which would shock them, he said. “They love their super-verbose, says-whatever’s-on-his-mind gay son.”
He came out to them at 22. “I had been asked on a date by a famous person, and thought it would be the perfect way to come out to them.” He laughed. “I thought the famous person would cancel out my news.” Instead, his parents were nonplussed by both. “They didn’t care about me being gay, or the famous person. They just said, ‘Have a great time.’” “I’m more vanilla than I would ever want to let on. But it’s funny; when we’re young, we’re taught that sex is bad. But sex is part of life, and can be joyful, painful, exciting, thrilling.”
Right now, Doyle is single. “I like to call myself Rapunzel and the witch. I put myself in the tower and cut my own hair and just wait for some growth. I live in Los Angeles. It’s harder to date there than in New York, where you walk down the street and think life could go in any direction. In Los Angeles, you think, ‘I can’t believe I just masturbated for the fifth time today. I haven’t left my apartment.’” Doyle said he prefers to meet people face to face than on apps. Marriage and children are certainly possibilities, if and when he finds that elusive right person.
Like the real-life experience which changed Doyle, he hopes Bonding ultimately adds to understanding.
“The message of the show is ‘don’t be scared.’ I’m more vanilla than I would ever want to let on. But it’s funny; when we’re young, we’re taught that sex is bad. But sex is part of life, and can be joyful, painful, exciting, thrilling. I’m still a judgmental person, and people may have many judgments about me, but maybe Bonding will give them more understanding and empathy and an ability to listen. I hope it goes way beyond ‘my funny story.’”"

Upping its involvement in the 2020 primary, the Democratic Socialists of America are bringing on board a campaign manager to help run political operations in support of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
The group has posted a job listing, obtained by The Daily Beast, for an individual to run an independent expenditure arm on behalf of the Vermont Independent Democratic Socialist. The hire would “report to the Organizing Director and work closely with other staff to develop and strengthen Democratic Socialists of America’s campaign work to elect Bernie Sanders President,” the listing reads.
Known historically as a left-wing institution on the outer edges of the ideological spectrum, DSA has become a more potent political force as its ranks have grown. The organization now boasts more than 56,000 members, and its creation of a Sanders-specific political post reflects its increasing comfort in wading into national elections. The campaign manager, according to the listing, is expected to visit chapters an average of one week per month, oversee organizational efforts alongside the Bernie 2020 committee and manage at least one campaign organizer.
DSA has already endorsed Sanders’ campaign despite some pushback from some members due to the senator’s prior comments on reparations, which he refused to explicitly endorse. An IE arm would not be legally allowed to coordinate with the senator’s team. But it would allow DSA to spend additional resources that it could not do through its political action committee, which can only place $5,000 behind a federal candidate. According to an internal document sent to chapter leaders explaining their decision, the low limit combined with the desire to move the group’s agenda in more aggressive ways is why the organization went this route.
According to an official, the role that DSA would fill in bringing on a Sanders’ campaign manager is, in part, to keep pushing the senator on various issues. That includes areas where he and DSA are on the same page and areas where they disagree, including on issues like SESTA , a bill Sanders and his 2020 competitors voted for but which sex workers have said puts lives in danger."
"‘Bizarre, Dangerous, and Insulting’: Baby Nurses Fed Up With Trump’s Bogus Abortion Rants",www.thedailybeast.com,Emily.Shugerman@thedailybeast.com (Emily Shugerman),04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/neonatal-nurses-fed-up-with-trumps-bogus-rants-about-executing-babies,"TWISTED ‘Bizarre, Dangerous, and Insulting’: Baby Nurses Fed Up With Trump’s Bogus Abortion Rants They say his talk of executing babies distorts the palliative care they provide gravely sick infants. 04.30.19 5:01 AM ET Saul Loeb/Getty
President Trump’s latest rant about babies being executed after birth is riling up neonatal nurses, who say he’s twisted the palliative care they provide for the sickest of infants into an anti-abortion rallying cry that could endanger health providers.
Anna Schmidt, who has worked in a neonatal intensive care unit for five years, told the Daily Beast she was livid when she heard about Trump’s comments at a political rally in Wisconsin on Saturday.
“The families that I've worked with, where I've handed them their babies for the first and last time, they don't deserve this kind of thing,” she told The Daily Beast. “They don’t deserve to be vilified or to be called an executioner.”
Trump’s remark was a continuation of his attacks on later abortions, which he describes as “ripp[ing] babies from their mothers’ wombs right up until the moment of birth.” But while abortion providers may be used to such attacks, the president’s latest criticism has rankled a new group of medical professionals—nurses who take care of babies destined to die.
The nurses claim what they do is sensitive, personal, and has absolutely nothing to do with abortion . And they are not happy with the president’s claims.
“When a baby dies in the hospital it’s because something has gone very, very wrong,” said Julia Puler, a NICU nurse from Michigan. “I can’t point to a single case study of a healthy term newborn that was executed in a hospital. And the mere suggestions of that is just utterly bizarre and dangerous and insulting, frankly, for anyone who is a health-care professional.”
Trump’s latest line of attack started in February, when Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam—to the delight of conservatives —inaccurately described the effects of a bill expanding access to third-trimester abortions. Asked whether the bill would allow women to get an abortion during childbirth, Northam said infants with “severe deformities” would be delivered and kept comfortable while the family and physicians discussed the best course of treatment.
“The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,” he explained in a radio interview.
Trump jumped on the statement, tweeting that Democrats supported “executing babies AFTER birth.” He repeated the line at his State of the Union —as a way to “energize his political base” after an unpopular government shutdown, according to the Washington Post —and again at Saturday’s rally.
“The baby is born; the mother meets with the doctor,” he told the crowd. “They take care of the baby. They wrap the baby beautifully. Then the doctor and mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby.”
Doctors and nurses say Trump’s description is radically wrong. What Northam had described—and what Trump seized on—was not third-trimester abortion but palliative care, in which infants born with severe birth defects are kept comfortable while they are taken off life-sustaining treatment. Such care is provided to families of infants with “life-limiting” conditions, such as severe prematurity or a heart defect, that would require extraordinary interventions to keep them alive.
From the perspective of those in the room, it’s not a decision anyone makes lightly.
“Any time a parent has to make a decision about their baby, you can't imagine what it’s like for them. It's just heartbreaking,” said Amy Carle, a NICU nurse of 22 years. “And for him to so carelessly spout off that babies are getting executed is just disheartening for all these families who have to go through these kinds of choices.”
There are few studies on how many families choose palliative care for their newborns, and why. But when Puler, the NICU nurse from Michigan, tweeted in response to Trump’s comments on Saturday, the thread was flooded with replies from parents who had chosen to seek palliative care. Some wrote of babies born with tumors in their brains who never made a sound. Others wrote of severe disabilities caused by traumatic births. The thread was retweeted more than 50,000 times.
“Thank you for this thread,” one woman tweeted. “As someone who has experienced this, it means the world to me that you (and so many others) serve(ed) on a bereavement team, and that you are combating this sick rhetoric.”
Still, the “executing babies” line has proved popular with Republicans. GOP legislators in at least seven states have introduced so-called “born alive” bills this year, which would impose prison sentences on doctors who don’t provide medical care to infants born after an abortion attempt. Senator Ben Sasse introduced a version in the U.S. February—despite the fact that a 2002 federal law already grants any born-alive infant the rights of a person. (Executing such an infant, of course, is already illegal under infanticide statutes.)
Trump was responding to similar bills at his Wisconsin rally, after governor Tony Evers vowed to veto the state’s “born alive” bill. In fact, despite Trump’s support, no such bill has been signed into law. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed his state’s version of the bill this month, and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock is reportedly leaning toward doing the same.
But several NICU nurses told The Daily Beast they were concerned that if the bills didn’t pass, Trump’s rhetoric would incite anti-abortion zealots to do something more extreme.
“He's putting my profession in danger, and the doctors and the abortion clinics and all kinds of places,” said Carle, the NICU nurse of 22 years. “He's already spewed enough things that have created violence. This is just another notch in his belt.”"

Subscribe to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts
When Sacha Baron Cohen set out to dupe a vast array of powerful people on his recent show Who Is America? , he was forced to create a series of elaborate disguises so that no one would recognize him. Jena Friedman didn’t have that problem.
“Unlike Sacha’s show, it’s a character, but it’s not a big character,” Friedman tells me on the latest episode of The Last Laugh podcast . “So I can’t rely on disguises, I just have to rely on the anonymity I’ve worked so hard to achieve in my 13 years of comedy. You know, making sure your stand-up is just polarizing enough that people don’t take a chance on it. And so I’ve worked really hard on that and thankfully it’s helped cultivate this air of no one knowing me and that actually helps the show a lot.”
That ultra-dry sense of humor is put to glorious effect in Soft Focus , Friedman’s two-part special that aired on Adult Swim earlier this year and can still be viewed, for free, at AdultSwim.com .
The stand-up comedian took the skills she learned working as a field producer at The Daily Show —shepherding classic pieces from Samantha Bee, Michael Che, Aasif Mandvi and others—and put them through her own uniquely feminist filter to create one of the funniest shows far too few people have seen this year.
Highlights from our conversation are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts , the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts. How she gets real people to say outrageous things on camera
“We never lie to people. But we’re also not like, ‘We’re a comedy show with a feminist perspective!’ So it’s kind of a need-to-know basis. And when I was at The Daily Show , even when people do know you, you still get the craziest reactions from people. That show was on for like 14, 15 years by the time I got there and everyone who was being interviewed knew they were talking to The Daily Show . And still some people didn’t know it was comedy and the people who did, we got the reactions out of them that we wanted. And I think it’s because at the end of the day, people just want to be heard and they want a platform. I work really hard not to take people out of context. We’re not journalism, but I try to adhere to journalistic integrity to the extent that we can, because I think that’s really important to the process.” Giving dangerous people a platform vs. exposing their dangerous views
“We didn’t know before Trump, but now we know that exposure of toxic views is really unhealthy. I think you just have to be careful about what you put out. When I was at The Daily Show , Jon [Stewart] would never have us interview white supremacists because they are intellectually dishonest and fame-seeking and stupid. But if people like that are in proximity to power, you kind of have to expose them, but you have to be careful about what you air and how you portray them. And I’m still figuring it out. I think we’re all coming up to speed on free speech versus hate speech versus responsibility when you shine a light on these people. I think the media did such a disservice with the amount of attention it gave to Trump, which is partly why we are where we are. And I think we can all learn from that going forward but I don’t have answers.” Why she reads the YouTube comments about her show
“I do read the YouTube comments, because I can handle them. I have a hypercritical Jewish mother so it just feels like home. And in that piece we had this one statistic about campus assault and rape, which is that one in four undergrads have reported being assaulted or harassed on college campuses. There was a comment that was like, ‘Feminists lie about rape stats, they lie about global warming, they lie about’—and then the next comment was like, ‘Yeah, you’re right, they totally lie about rape stats but global warming’s real, man!’ So it was just funny to see our critics butting heads with each other.” On ‘The Daily Show’s’ ‘boys’ club’ reputation
“At the time, I was aware of that but I came from Letterman—I mean, I came from a situation where my boss had a very public sex scandal with a young blonde woman who looked like me. So I can only speak to my experience at The Daily Show and it was great. Jon was the best boss I’ve ever had. There were really smart women around. I got to work with Sam Bee, who has been a hero of mine forever. So I had a really great experience at The Daily Show . I think everything can be a boys’ club to some degree, but for people to be more cognizant about making things not a boys’ club, I don’t think hurts anyone... other than boys.” On writing for the ‘Roseanne’ reboot when Roseanne got fired
“So, Roseanne saw a set of mine on Conan and invited me to write for Roseanne . And I always liked her show and the legacy of the show back in the day. I was aware of her Trumpiness and I started following her on Twitter and I actually—just because her feed was so insane—I remember thinking, how does she have a show? I knew that she was a Trump supporter and I just felt like if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu and I have a very obvious liberal or progressive sensibility so I wanted to write for a Trump supporter and I wanted to write for a network. I was happy that ABC canceled her show. I think people need to be held accountable for their words. I wish more people were, not just women and women in comedy. And then when the show restructured, I was invited to go back and everybody was really kind and it was a cool experience to write on that show, but it was a different show than the one I’d signed up for.”

Joe Biden: Democrats May Have No Choice But to Launch Impeachment Proceedings Against Trump,www.thedailybeast.com,jamie.ross@thedailybeast.com (Jamie Ross),04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/joe-biden-democrats-may-have-no-choice-but-to-impeach-trump,"BACKED INTO A CORNER Joe Biden: Democrats May Have No Choice But to Launch Impeachment Proceedings Against Trump The former VP says House Democrats will have no alternative to impeachment if the president blocks Congressional investigations into his conduct. 04.30.19 8:17 AM ET ABC News
Joe Biden has warned Donald Trump that, if the president attempts to block Congress from digging deeper into the findings of the Mueller Report, then lawmakers will be forced to start impeachment proceedings.
In a Good Morning America interview broadcast early Tuesday, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for president said the Mueller report proved “beyond question” that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.
With the Democratic Party split over the political and electoral impact, Biden signaled that he may add a centrist voice to calls for impeachment proceedings.
He said it was up to the Democrats to step in where Special Counsel Robert Mueller left matters unfinished because he felt he didn't have the authority to investigate or prosecute further. “There are elements of the report, in the second phase of the report—about seven or eight things—that are left undone,” said Biden. “[Mueller] was not within his purview to investigate, he thought. The Congress is attempting to take that up.”
Biden urged Congress to carry on probing deeper into those issues and warned the president that, if he tries to get in the way of that process, he'll be in deep trouble. “If in fact they block the investigation, they have no alternative but to go to the only other constitutional resort they have, [which] is impeachment,” he said.
Biden added: “My job, in the meantime, is to make sure he's not back as president.”
The former vice president was boosted Tuesday morning by CNN/SRRS poll which gave him an 11-point bounce following his candidacy announcement last week, leaving him towering above his Democratic rivals. Thirty-nine percent of Democrats or Dem-leaning independents say he's now their top choice for the nomination, up from 28 percent last month.
However, Biden is still being dogged by one issue. He faced repeated questioning on Good Morning America about his previous over-friendly interactions with women, and was even warned by his wife Jill that he's going to have to change his ways during the campaign period.
“I think what you don't realize is how many people approach Joe. Men and women, looking for comfort or empathy,” said Dr. Jill Biden. “But going forward, I think he's gonna have to judge—be a better judge—of when people approach him, how he's going to react. That he maybe shouldn't approach them.”
Biden agreed, adding: “It's my responsibility to be more sensitive to whether or not someone wants me to reassure them or wants to say hello or wants to show affection toward. And that's my responsibility.”
The former vice president went on to say that he wants his campaign theme to be “Make America moral again,” adding: “[I want to] make America—you know, return to the essence of who we are, the dignity of the country, the dignity of people, treating our people with dignity.”
He refused to be drawn on whether he would select a female running mate—as rival candidate Sen. Cory Booker has done—saying it would be “presumptuous” to make a call on that at this stage.
“If you take a look at most of my staff,” he went on. “I mean, they ... reflect who we are. Men, women, African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic, Latino. I mean, so it would be a government that would represent everyone. Who that would be if I were fortunate enough to win ... I haven't made that decision.”
The CNN poll put Biden more than 20 points ahead of his nearest rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who holds just 15 percent support. The best-supported woman in the poll was Elizabeth Warren, lagging behind on 8 percent."

Scouted By The Beast
One of my favorite shirt types of all time was (well, is) a V-neck I bought in every color imaginable and wore regularly until I wore them out and had to replace them. Since then, still grasping at my love for a minimalist, short-sleeve, and plain top, I’ve been doing my best to elevate what I’m paying for so it sticks with me for the long haul and so I can bring it with me into an office setting and later into an after-hours setting. Some T-shirts can achieve this. Others have a hard time. Either way, I’ve rounded up some of the shirts that rise above the rest in giving you style, durability, comfort, and some athleisure-level qualities.
V-Neck T-Shirt , $29 at PrAna: This top-rated vee is comprised of organic cotton (60%) and recycled polyester (40%) and more than 100 reviewers leave it with a 4.8-star average rating. Perfect for the flexibility of the T-shirt and elegance of the V-neck in an eco-friendly shirt you can hike in with less guilt than normal.
The Air Crew Tee , $22 at Everlane: Another top-rated tee with nearly 400 reviewers leaving it a 4.6-star average rating, the Air is comprised of lightweight cotton that feels soft and breathes plenty.
Jamison V-neck , $48 at Ably: This shirt goes all the way — its fabric is designed to be water-repellant, stain-resistant, odor-resistant, and breathable. This is the kind of shirt you can sweat a little in, dry off, and keep moving. And since that pretty much defines my every day, I see shirts like this as a godsend since it includes that elegant V-neck design I lauded above.
Carlton Heavyweight Pocket Tee , $35 at Mott & Bow: I’m wearing this T-shirt as I write this and I couldn’t be more into it. I was at first suspicious of what “heavyweight” would mean for me because I easily sweat and work out to the point of drenched each morning, but slipping into the Carlton and walking to work this morning was great. The shirt has heft but breathes and remains cool to the touch, not to mention that neat chest pocket lets me carry a semblance of professionalism here in the office.
Convoy Tee , $78 at Olivers: This athleisure tee is made of 100% merino wool and is odor-resistant, water-repellant, and temperature regulating. The shirt is designed in an athletic silhouette with reverse raglan sleeve construction. The Convoy is able to take you from a casual Friday to the mountains and then out for the night in a style that stays cool.
Men's Pima Cotton Crew Neck T-shirt , $36 at Bombas: This medium weight T-shirt is comprised of Peruvian Pima cotton and is designed with soft seams and a tag-free neckline. It’s also soft and cool to the touch — and for each shirt bought, Bombas donates one to support the homeless .

Mayor Pete Accuser: This Was All a ‘Despicable’ Set-Up,www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/pete-buttigieg-accuser-hunter-kelly-says-jacob-wohl-and-jack-burkman-tricked-him-into-sex-assault-hoax,"LOSING THE PLOT Mayor Pete Assault Accuser: This Was All a ‘Despicable’ Set-Up Michigan college student Hunter Kelly says smear merchants Jacob Wohl and Jack Burkman tricked him into being part of a hoax. 04.30.19 11:56 AM ET Joshua Roberts/Reuters
The young man who accused Mayor Pete Buttigieg of sexually assaulting him fully recanted the accusations on Tuesday, saying he was tricked, enticed, and even intimidated into doing so by two of the most notorious smear merchants in politics.
In a new post on Facebook, Hunter Kelly recounted how a Medium post under his name, in which he said that he had been “raped” by Buttigieg, was written without his input and posted without his permission by Jacob Wohl .
Wohl is an infamous conservative provocateur known mainly for the inanity of the schemes he concocts. But the one he crafted with Kelly may have been the most absurd to date—a bizarre Coen Brothers-like plan that fizzled out right as it took off.
For a week, Wohl had been attempting to find gay Republicans who would levy accusations against Buttigieg, according to at least one Republican who was on the receiving end of the pitch and recorded parts of it for The Daily Beast.
Kelly appears to be the only one who took the bait. In his latest explanation of what happened, the Michigan college student said that Wohl reached out to him via Signal on April 25 after the two had interacted over Instagram. Wohl then pitched him on a plan to take down Buttigieg by coming up with a story that the South Bend mayor had sexually assaulted him during a visit he took to D.C. in February. Kelly conceded that no such visit ever occurred. In fact, he’d never been to D.C.
Wohl, according to Kelly, said the scheme was part of a “‘task force’ set up by the Donald Trump administration.” There is, however, no evidence of the administration’s involvement; a request for comment from the White House was not returned.
Kelly said that Wohl and his similarly infamous cohort, lobbyist Jack Burkman, booked him a flight from Michigan to Baltimore. From there, they drove to Burkman’s home in Arlington where Wohl showed him a draft of a statement detailing the bogus accusations against Buttigieg.
Kelly said he expressed concerns about the scheme but Wohl told him to sleep on it. When Kelly woke at around 11 a.m., Wohl “was already dressed in a suit because he ‘can’t do a Monday if he isn’t in a suit’” and—of more significance—the fabricated statement had been posted to Medium, along with fake Twitter and Gmail accounts in Kelly’s name.
According to Kelly, Burkman tried to calm his nerves by claiming that he was a “‘star’ and people are eating me up.”
The trio, according to Kelly, ate Subway sandwiches, during which Kelly continued to express his regrets. Burkman and Wohl tried to calm him down by promising to purchase “any house I wanted” and insisting that his family would “get over it.”
The two had plans for Kelly to follow up his initial accusations against Buttigieg with a press conference but they needed Kelly to sign off on the script. Kelly said that, at this point, the duo turned to intimidation, telling him that backing out and leaving was “not an option.”
Ultimately, Kelly extricated himself from the situation. “I pretended to be tired and ‘nap’ as a chance to pack my belongings while family was on their way to grab me,” he wrote. “Once I was told my family had arrived, I rushed downstairs and told Wohl I could not do this because that is not the type of person I am.”
Kelly said he was sorry he ever left Michigan.
“Jack Burkman may have promised me a lavish lifestyle, but at a price that would cost me the two most important things to me: honesty and integrity. Had I gone forward with this despicable scheme they concocted, I would have lost both of those things and became another one of their useless pawns.”
In a statement on Tuesday, Burkman acknowledged that he had worked with Kelly. But he insisted that Kelly had approached his firm with the story and not the other way around. Kelly, for his part, appears to be trying to make amends. In addition to posting about his recollections of his time with Wohl and Burkman, he also sent an email to Buttigieg’s office in South Bend.
A spokesperson for the mayor told The Daily Beast that the general email account received a note from someone they believe to be Kelly, in which there was a screenshot of a statement he had made recanting his initial accusations.
“We haven’t engaged and aren’t planning to engage on it,” said Mark Bode, a spokesman for the mayor’s office. READ THIS LIST"

The Venezuela crisis is entering its “final phase,” according to opposition leader Juan Guaido, who says the push to remove President Nicolas Maduro from power has begun. Fifty-two people were injured during protests in the capital city of Caracas, where video footage showed an armored vehicle running over a group of Guaido supporters. National security adviser John Bolton declined to call the violent clashes a coup, because the U.S. recognizes Guaido as the country’s leader. According to Bolton, Trump “has been monitoring it minute-by-minute throughout the day as have his advisers.” “... We want as our principal objective, a peaceful transfer of power and I will say again as the president said from the outset, that Nicolás Maduro and those supporting him, particularly those not Venezuelan should know all options are on the table,” Bolton said Tuesday.
In a video shot at a Caracas air base showing him surrounded by soldiers, Guaido called on Venezuelans and the military to join him to end Maduro’s “usurpation” once and for all. “The national armed forces have taken the correct decision, and they are counting on the support of the Venezuelan people,” Guaido said. “The moment is now.” Around 50 countries have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s interim president.

Several of the top editorial employees at the company formerly known as Gizmodo Media Group are departing amid restructuring that will result in at least 25 staffers exiting the company.
Multiple sources told The Daily Beast that editorial director Susie Banikarim and executive managing editor Alex Dickinson are out G/O Media, several weeks after the company was sold by Univision to private equity firm Great Hill Partners. Sources said Tim Marchman, a former top Deadspin editor and head of GMG’s special projects desk, was also fired.
A source with knowledge of the situation said the two editors’ exits were mutual, but part of a company restructuring effort launched Tuesday that will affect more than two dozen positions at G/O, which was renamed following the sale.
The source said most of those impacted come from the business and operations side, and that the company planned on adding new editorial staffers, including a new editorial leader, as early as this week. Multiple sources told The Daily Beast the company's new editorial director would likely be Paul Maidment, a former editor of Forbes.com.

Mohamed Noor said he fired to stop what he thought was a ‘threat.’ 04.30.19 6:12 PM ET Stephen Maturen/Getty
Former Minneapolis police officer Mohamed Noor was found guilty of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the 2017 shooting death of an unarmed woman who called police to report a possible crime.
The officer—who fired one shot that killed Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a 40-year-old dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia—was found not guilty of the most serious charge against him, second-degree murder.
The Hennepin County jury reached their verdict in two days, a quick conclusion after a highly publicized three-week trial to determine whether Noor, 33, was justified in his use of deadly force when he fatally shot Damond behind her home a month before her wedding.
Noor, who was emotionless as the verdict was read Tuesday, now faces life in prison.
At trial, prosecutors said Damond called police on July 15, 2017 to report a possible sexual assault after hearing a woman’s scream in the alleyway behind her home.
When police arrived, the yoga teacher and life coach, who had just moved to Minneapolis to live with her soon-to-be husband, approached the squad car on the driver’s side. Noor, sitting in the passenger seat, pulled out his gun and shot Damond in the stomach as she stood outside his partner’s window.
The former officer’s defense attorneys argued that Noor only fired his weapon to protect his “terrified partner,” Matthew Harrity, who said he heard a thump on their squad car and saw a figure “raising an arm” by the driver’s side window.
During her closing argument on Monday, prosecutor Amy Sweasy insisted there was “no conclusive proof” Damond “ever touched that car.”
Noor, who refused to speak to investigators or publicly comment on the incident, took the stand to testify in his own defense last week, arguing that it was his partner’s terrified expression and the surprising sight of a blonde woman raising her arm outside his partner’s window that made him jump into action. He said Harrity was having trouble removing his gun from his holster.
“There was a threat, and my intention was to stop the threat,” he said last week. “I fired once, and then the threat took a couple steps back.”
Harrity testified last week that he’d heard the woman “murmur” as she approached their vehicle.
“I had some weird feeling to my left side that I had to look over,” Harrity testified , adding that he immediately went for his firearm. “A silhouette of something.”
Under cross-examination, Noore admitted that the Australian native did not look dangerous.
“If I knew this would happen, I would never have become a cop,” he said at the end of his testimony.
Thomas Plunkett, Noor’s defense attorney, said in his closing argument on Monday that the incident was “a tragedy” but “not a crime.""
“Mr. Noor acted as he was trained. He acted as a reasonable police officer,” he said .
Noor, who was handcuffed and immediately taken into custody after the verdict was announced, will be sentenced on June 7. He is the first police officer in Minnesota to be convicted of an on-duty shooting."
Mueller Wrote to Barr Expressing Concern About His Presentation of Investigation’s Conclusions: WaPo,www.thedailybeast.com,julia.arciga@thedailybeast.com (Julia Arciga),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/mueller-wrote-to-barr-expressing-concern-about-his-presentation-of-investigations-conclusions-wapo,"FIRING BACK Mueller Complained to Barr About His Spin on Russia Probe The special counsel said the AG’s summary sowed ‘public confusion’ about the investigation’s conclusions. 04.30.19 7:21 PM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Photos from Getty
Special Counsel Robert Mueller wrote a letter to Attorney General William Barr complaining about how he “publicized” the conclusions of his investigation in summaries to Congress before the full report was publicly released.
Barr’s spin did not “fully capture” the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential links to the Trump campaign or the results of that investigation, Mueller wrote, adding that the summary has sowed “public confusion” about what the probe found.
Disclosure of the rebuke was made Tuesday night on the eve of Barr’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and drew instant criticism from Democrats.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who sits on the committee, said in a tweet that she was revising her questions for the attorney general, while others called on Barr to resign to or face impeachment.
Mueller fired off the letter to Barr on March 27, just three days after the attorney general sent his Mueller Report summary to Congress. A Justice Department official confirmed the letter to The Daily Beast, which was first reported by The Washington Post .
That summary, Mueller wrote, “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office’s work and conclusions,” according to the Post .
“There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation,” he continued. “This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.”
The letter also requested Barr release the report’s “introductions and executive summaries,” in order to “alleviate the misunderstandings that have arisen” among the public and Congress about the probe.
In the summaries Barr sent to Congress, he wrote that Mueller and his team found no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign to influence the election and “did not draw a conclusion—one way or the other” on the question of whether President Trump had obstructed justice. Barr said his office had determined the report did not outline actions that could support an obstruction charge.
After Barr got the letter, he called Mueller to discuss it, the Justice Department confirmed.
“In a cordial and professional conversation, the Special Counsel emphasized that nothing in the Attorney General’s March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading,” DOJ said in a statement. “But, he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the Special Counsel’s obstruction analysis. They then discussed whether additional context from the report would be helpful and could be quickly released.”
In the end, DOJ said, the two men decided that the full report should be released in one fell swoop rather than piecemeal.
Shortly before he released the full report in mid-April, Barr held a press conference where he said he disagreed with some of Mueller’s legal theories on the question of obstruction of justice.
His testimony Wednesday before the Judiciary Committee will mark the first time lawmakers have a chance to question Barr about the report since its release. "
2019 Tony Award Nominations: Change Is Coming to Broadway—Slowly,www.thedailybeast.com,tim.teeman@thedailybeast.com (Tim Teeman),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/2019-tony-award-nominations-change-is-coming-to-broadwayslowly,"WINNERS 2019 Tony Award Nominations: Change Is Coming to Broadway—Slowly The Tony nominations of ‘Choir Boy,’ ‘What The Constitution Means to Me,’ and ‘Gary’ show Broadway is changing. Then there’s the best play lockout of ‘Mockingbird’ and ‘Network.’ 04.30.19 7:17 PM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
It was a cheering Tony Award nominations day for productions bringing something different to Broadway, when “different” means playwrights and actors of color and women securing high-profile nominations. The full list of nominations is here .
The presence of Tarell Alvin McCraney’s Choir Boy and Heidi Schreck’s What The Constitution Means To Me in the Best Play category was welcome. Choir Boy ’s Jeremy Pope was a double nominee as lead actor in a play and featured actor in a musical ( Ain’t Too Proud: The Life and Times of The Temptations ).
Schreck’s brilliant, almost one-woman play about the Constitution is both a dramatically and culturally satisfying work. So, is Jez Butterworth's three-hour plus epic, The Ferryman , a dense, funny, and tense family and political drama set in 1980s Northern Ireland that deserves every award that can come its way.
The musical Hadestown , which received the most number of nominations (14), has music, lyrics and a book written by Anaïs Mitchell and is directed by Rachel Chavkin. André de Shields, one of its stars to be nominated for a Tony, recently spoke to The Daily Beast about the history of racism on Broadway.
The statistics in the present day tell their own stark story; the most recent Asian American Performers Action Coalition’s annual study of Ethnic Representation on New York City stages for the 2016–2017 season revealed, as Playbill reported in March , that 95 percent of all plays and musicals were both written and directed by Caucasian artists.
Playbill reported, “African-American playwrights were represented at 4.1 percent and MENA playwrights at 1.4 percent. According to the survey, the Broadway season featured no plays or musicals by Latinx, Asian-American, or American Indian/Native/First Nation playwrights, nor playwrights with disabilities.”
75.4 percent of all playwrights were male and 24.6 percent female. According to Playbill , “Eighty-nine percent of playwrights produced on Broadway were male and 11 percent female. Female directors fared only slightly better than female playwrights, representing 31.1 percent. Only 0.8 percent of directors included in the survey were non-binary.”
Two of the biggest, starriest Broadway productions of Tony season did not secure a Best Play nomination: To Kill a Mockingbird and Network were both locked out. While some surprise has been expressed about this, both are not sterling productions but both have standout performances that have been awarded with nominations (for Celia Keenan-Bolger, Jeff Daniels, and Gideon Glick in Mockingbird ; and Bryan Cranston in Network ).
The lockout for Glenda Jackson, who delivered a notable performance in a not-loved production of King Lear , was even starker in the Best Actress in a Play category; Ruth Wilson, doing double-duty as Cordelia and the Fool, received a featured actress nomination.
Annette Bening scored a nomination for All My Sons , as did Laurie Metcalf (for the underpowered, and un-nominated, Hillary and Clinton ) but Nathan Lane ( Gary: A Sequel To Titus Andronicus ), Tracy Letts ( All My Sons ), and John Lithgow ( Hillary and Clinton ) did not. Bertie Carvel, but not Jonny Lee Miller, was nominated for Ink ; Stephanie J. Block and Derrick Baskin, the solid helm-bearers of The Cher Show and Ain't Too Hot , were both nominated.
The nominations have awarded plays unusual for Broadway, like the barmy and grotesque Gary , and this is to be welcomed. Whether you love or hate it (it divided critics), the very presence of Taylor Mac’s play is to be welcomed. See the variety of musicals in the nominations— Tootsie , The Prom , Beetlejuice , Oklahoma! , Hadestown , Ain’t Too Proud , The Cher Show —and be happy alongside the traditionally brassy and bright contenders there are newer, friskier musicals.
This critic is rooting for as many awards for Oklahoma! as possible (particularly for Ali Stroker); its match-up against Kiss Me, Kate in the Best Revival of a Musical is an intriguing one as both are excellent, very different revivals. The winner will indicate if the tastes of Tony voters err towards the traditional or radical.
Poor old, critically panned King Kong lumbered home with very little but a gestural bit of love for the giant, extremely brilliant puppet itself. Shows including American Son , Pretty Woman , and The Lifespan of a Fact went completely unrewarded. “Producers are still making shows for a particular kind of audience with a particular level of income to spend. But—led by Hadestown, What The Constitution Means To Me, Choir Boy, and Oklahoma!—there is a refreshing variety across plays and musicals in this year’s Tony nominations”
Look at all the categories, and the competition between very different kinds of shows and performers will make for an intriguing Tonys night on June 9. The ceremony, hosted by James Corden, will be held at New York City’s Radio City Music Hall.
The nominations do not signal revolution. Producers are still making shows for a particular kind of audience with a particular level of income to spend. But—led by Hadestown , What The Constitution Means To Me , Choir Boy ,and Oklahoma!— there is a refreshing variety across plays and musicals in this year’s Tony nominations.
That variety will (hopefully) be fed and watered with theater-goers heading to see the nominated productions and performers, helping (hopefully) power more change and changes in perception and, ultimately, producer adventurousness.
Slowly, audiences are seeing, and rewarding, a new kind of Broadway show. The pace of this change remains the great unknown. READ THIS LIST"
"Venezuela Explodes Into Violence, With Desperate Citizens Capturing Carnage on Their Cellphones",www.thedailybeast.com,Annika Hernroth-Rothstein,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/venezuela-explodes-into-violence-with-desperate-citizens-capturing-carnage-on-their-cellphones,"‘FINAL PHASE’ Venezuela Explodes Into Violence, With Desperate Citizens Capturing Carnage on Their Cellphones After months of promises by the opposition, violent protests erupted on the streets Tuesday, with some military backing Juan Guaido—and others sticking with President Maduro. Marco Bello/Getty
It was the scene everyone had waited for.
Juan Guaidó was standing in the street outside La Carlota military airbase, flanked by military that for once, were there to protect him. By his side was Leopoldo Lopez , founder of the Primero Justicia party and Venezuela’s most famous political prisoner , who had just been released by his military captors.
“This is the final phase of our operation to topple the usurper,” Guaidó said in an impromptu speech released on Twitter early Tuesday morning, but while he was speaking, all eyes were on Lopez, a man many expected never to see alive in freedom again.
“Where is your guard?” a journalist yelled at Lopez and, just off camera, a man’s smiling voice can be heard saying, “I’m right here.”
It was a clear sign that something had shifted, and that the promises made by the opposition and its leadership hadn’t been as empty as many Venezuelans had started to fear. For months, Guaidó had hinted at secret negotiations taking place between the opposition and the military, but with every week that passed without any noticeable change, the public support began to waver.
Since that initial spark, massive clashes have erupted throughout the day in and around Caracas, with paramilitary colectivos out en masse, shooting live rounds at protesters in the streets and military fighting military, creating chaos and uncertainty as to who is on which side. In WhatsApp videos The Daily Beast receives in real time from sources on the ground one can see police officers actively helping protesters, switching sides as fights break out outside a central shopping mall in Caracas, and colectivos shooting at both groups as they run for cover. It is a war zone, only less structured, with no clear sides or definitive allies, and desperate citizens are capturing absolute carnage on their cellphones, filming tanks running over protesters and paramilitaries beating down the uprising.
One of the main questions now is if a violent and bloody suppression of these protests would trigger a foreign intervention, but given the lack of support for such a drastic measure, it seems unlikely. Omar, one of the protesters The Daily Beast spoke to earlier Tuesday, said it would take a catastrophe to make the world react. “I know it sounds cold, but I think that it would take a Tiananmen Square situation to get the U.S. or the EU to step into this mess.” — Omar, protester on the streets of Caracas
“I know it sounds cold, but I think that it would take a Tiananmen Square situation to get the U.S. or the EU to step into this mess,” he said. “A lot of people have to die, and die publicly and violently, for the rest of us to be saved.”
As for the reactions from the outside world, they are currently following the expected lines. The European Union released a statement Tuesday urging for restraint and calling for free elections, but there was no mention of whether it support or rejected the opposition’s attempt to oust President Nicolás Maduro.
In the U.S., individual lawmakers have been, while moderate in their language, more clearly in support of Guaidó. Sen. Jim Risch (R-ID), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated on Tuesday that “Guaidó is the lawful president,” and Sen. Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, placed the responsibility for an escalation with Maduro.
“The only person who can make this violent is Maduro, and the 20,000-30,000 human security agents who don’t belong in Venezuela and should be back in Cuba, and the criminal thugs that have been released from prisons to be used by Maduro against his people,” said Menendez. “Only he can make it violent.”
On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Russia of talking Maduro into staying put when he had been ready to leave the country. “He had an airplane on the tarmac, he was ready to leave this morning as we understand it and the Russians indicated he should stay,” Pompeo told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer.
While Maduro has yet to make a statement since the clashes broke out, Diosdado Cabello, the president of Venezuela’s Constitutional Assembly, has made several. In a radio address, he called upon all colectivos to prepare to defend Miraflores, the presidential palace, and to strike down anyone who tries to destroy the Bolivarian revolution.
“This coup d’état has failed,” he said, but given that the government is now mobilizing military and paramilitary troops at Miraflores, that seems to be a slight exaggeration.
In many of his speeches, Guaidó has spoken about the march on Miraflores, but most have interpreted that as a metaphor, rather than a statement of facts. Such a walk would in all likelihood end in a bloodbath, at least before the bulk of the military has turned, and attempting such an undertaking prematurely could mean walking right into the hands of a much superior opponent, crushing the last hope of an exhausted and impoverished population.

A federal judge ruled that a lawsuit from congressional Democrats alleging President Trump's private businesses violate the Constitution’s emoluments clause can move forward, The Washington Post reports. The Justice Department was attempting to dismiss the case, but U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ruled that Democrats had the right to sue Trump over his alleged violation of “gifts or payments from foreign governments” he had received through a number of his businesses. Judge Sullivan specifically noted that Trump had received hotel-related payments from foreign governments, licensing fees from foreign governments for his reality show The Apprentice , and intellectual property rights from China. This case is one of two cases involving Trump's alleged emoluments violations, with the other lawsuit—brought by the D.C. and Maryland attorneys general—stalled after DOJ lawyers blocked subpoenas for financial records from Trump's D.C. hotel."
Mueller’s Willing to Testify But Trump DoJ is Holding It Up: Dems,www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/robert-muellers-willing-to-testify-but-trump-department-of-justice-is-holding-it-up-dems,"04.30.19 8:59 PM ET Alex Wong/Getty
House Democrats tell The Daily Beast they’ve been told Special Counsel Robert Mueller is willing to testify before them about his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election , but the Department of Justice has been unwilling to set a date for it to happen.
The impasse comes as lawmakers have grown increasingly frustrated over Attorney General Bill Barr’s handling of the release of the Mueller probe and as other Trump associates have declined to appear before congressional committees .
Shortly after it was reported on Tuesday night that Mueller had written and called Barr to complain that the attorney general had not fully represented the special counsel’s findings, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) sent out a statement demanding both men appear before his committee and saying he had been stonewalled so far.
“The Attorney General has expressed some reluctance to appear before the House Judiciary Committee this Thursday,” Nadler said. “These reports make it that much more important for him to appear and answer our questions. The Department of Justice has also been reluctant to confirm a date for Special Counsel Mueller to testify.”
Nadler had sent a letter to DOJ following the department’s release of the Mueller Report asking that Mueller appear for questioning no later than May 23 . Two sources familiar with the conversations said the Judiciary Committee has been in regular contact with DOJ about setting a date for Mueller’s testimony and that those conversations were still going on. Committee sources said it was their impression that Mueller was willing to testify to discuss his findings, though it was unclear whether that would take place in public or behind closed doors.
But the DOJ has, according to multiple sources, not agreed to a date, citing Mueller’s continued status as a department employee—since the special counsel serves under the attorney general.
A Department of Justice spokesperson did not return a request for comment.
Barr, likewise, has been resisting congressional hearings, though mainly because he objects to the structuring of the proposed questioning. His reluctance has frustrated Democrats on the Hill, though he is slated to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday .
Last week, House Democrats held a caucus call in which they discussed their strategy for the Barr hearing and how to get the White House to cooperate on investigations. Subsequent conversations between senior members focused on whether impeachment proceedings were appropriate given Trump’s refusal to comply with subpoenas."

In a March 27 letter—just three days after Barr sent his report summary to Congress—Mueller said Barr’s own take on the findings “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office’s work and conclusions,” according to The Washington Post.

Gunfire erupted at the University of North Carolina Charlotte on Tuesday evening, leaving at least two people dead, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency. Four others were injured, two of them critically.
Police said one suspect was taken into custody and identified him as 22-year-old Trystan Terrell. NBC Charlotte recorded Terrell being led into Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department's headquarters. Officials reportedly told the outlet the suspect was a former student at the school. Police also said they have no reason to believe another person was involved in the shooting.
More than an hour after an emergency alert was sent out to students warning of an “active assailant” on campus, police officers continued to search room by room for students still hiding from the gunman.
Video taken by witnesses on campus showed students fleeing in a panic as police officers first rushed in following reports of shots fired at the school’s Kennedy administrative building. That was followed by an emergency alert from the university urging students to “secure [themselves] immediately” and to “run, hide, fight.”
According to local news station WSOC, the shots were reported around 5:45 p.m. SWAT and ATF were also reportedly on the scene and searching the Kennedy building.
One evacuated student told a WCCB reporter that she and her classmates were sitting listening to presentations when “someone opened a door and started firing.”
“And he kept shooting and I didn’t know what was happening…” she said. “I ducked as soon as I could, and then it just stopped.” READ THIS LIST"

Could a new AI analysis tool be a ‘game-changer’ for couples struggling with in-vitro fertilization, as one startup claims, or is it just the latest empty promise? 04.30.19 8:20 PM ET Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters
A new startup claims it can help women get pregnant by using artificial intelligence to grade their eggs—a technology that could save couples thousands of dollars and months of frustration on failed attempts at in-vitro fertilization.
The company, Future Fertility, has developed an AI analysis tool to test the quality of human eggs before they’re used in in-vitro fertilization. According to the company, the technology can currently predict whether or not an egg will be fertilized 90 percent of the time. Eventually, they hope to predict pregnancy outcomes based on a single picture of an egg.
“There’s a lot of missing information for physicians and for patients and we believe strongly that artificial intelligence can solve this riddle,” Dr. Dan Nayot, the company’s medical director, told The Daily Beast. “That’s the technology we’ve created here.”
The innovation, if it works, would be a welcome one. The average IVF cycle currently costs about $10,000 and results in a successful birth only 20 to 35 percent of the time. Once a woman is over 35, her chances are even lower than that. For most people looking to conceive, the process is both costly and exhausting.
Rene Bharti, the chairman of the Future Fertility, knows the frustration well. He first dreamed up the technology while he and his wife were trying to conceive via invtirofertilzaiton. Their doctor—Dan Nayot—told them a scoring system existed for embryos and sperm, but not for eggs. Combining Nayot’s medical experience and Bharti’s background in AI, the two founded Future Fertility in order to change that.
The AI program, Violet, is named after Bharti’s now 15-month-old daughter.
“I’m lucky enough that if we had to do four or five cycles [of IVF] I probably could get away with paying for it,” Bharti said. “But there are a lot people that … it’s a lot of money and it’s a game-changer, potentially.”
Charles Bormann, a chemist at Northwestern University, said his lab is currently testing a similar product and has seen comparable success rates. He called artificial intelligence “the future of IVF,” saying it could pick up on differences in eggs that humans cannot perceive, much less write into an algorithm. He suggested it could even help prospective mothers before the fertilization process starts, by guiding them in how many eggs to freeze.
Other experts are more skeptical. Norbert Gleicher, medical director of the Center for Human Reproduction, said he was unimpressed with Future Fertility’s claim that they can successfully predict fertilization 90 percent of the time.
“Every experienced embryologist who looks at an egg after retrieval can tell you whether the egg will be fertilized or not,” said Gleicher, who has taught obstetrics at Yale and New York University. “I wouldn’t spend a dollar on that.”
Future Fertility says internal tests prove Violet is more successful in predicting fertilization than an embryologist alone, and added that it is 65 percent successful in determining whether an embryo will survive more than five days. (They said they could not provide this data for review because of HIPPA law.) After the product is rolled out to more IVF clinics, Nayot said, they hope the technology will learn to predict outcomes even further down the line. The company says it hasn’t finalized pricing yet but it will most likely be determined on a country-by-country and clinic-by-clinic basis.
Still, Gleicher is doubtful that the product will make much of a difference. He said he has seen countless companies launch “innovative” IVF products in recent years, but none were able to substantially improve outcomes.
“Unfortunately we have witnessed a lot of startups in this arena coming and going with claims that are not true,” he said. “Sometimes the longer they stay in business the more negative impact they wind up having on IVF.”
One such failed start-up was OvaScience, which burst onto the scene in 2016 with the promise of extending women’s fertility windows. At one point, the company was valued at $1.8 billion. By 2018, after many of the company’s promises failed to pan out, its stock was essentially worthless.
Future Fertility’s embryology director, Jim Meriano, and Nayot, its medical director, both work with Dr. Robert Casper—one of the first endocrinologists to offer OvaScience’s product, even before it was approved by the FDA. At the time, fellow fertility experts raised questions about whether the technology was safe.
The Violet technology was trained, in part, at Casper, Nayot, and Meriano’s clinic. Nayot says the product is completely different from what OvaScience was developing, and is solely a diagnostic tool. He added that the company will be doing prospective studies to validate the accuracy of their predictions.
But even Borman, the scientist who called Future Fertility the “future of IVF,” urged caution in assessing new products.
“I just think people are very vulnerable when they're struggling with fertility,” he said. “So I think people are willing to pay whatever to have any sort of advantage, and that is not how you should be trying to market this technology.” READ THIS LIST"
‘Who Gives a F*ck’: Dems Defend Infrastructure Meeting With Trump,www.thedailybeast.com,Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey) asawin.suebsaeng@thedailybeast.com (Asawin Suebsaeng) sam.stein@thedailybeast.com (Sam Stein),05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dems-defend-infrastructure-meeting-with-trump-who-gives-a-fck,"04.30.19 10:20 PM ET Evan Vucci/AP
Things were loose and light at the White House on Tuesday as President Donald Trump hosted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and a delegation of Democratic lawmakers for a meeting billed as a discussion of infrastructure policy .
The president handed out Tic Tacs, peppered a Michigan lawmaker with questions about invasive fish, got reprimanded by Pelosi for having a loud side-conversation with Schumer, and even declared that he wanted a bill that “may not be typically Republican.” One source familiar with the meeting called it “uncharacteristically muted.” And when it ended, the parties had come to an unexpected agreement on a $2 trillion price tag for an infrastructure package—an ambitious, tentative agreement that is widely expected to hit the skids.
It was a rare bit of ostensible productivity made all the more remarkable for the fact that it came in the middle of the stormiest stretch yet for relations between Democrats and the president. There was, on Tuesday, no mention of Democrats having spent the last two weeks debating whether to impeach the president, or that the administration was in the middle of an epic stonewall of Democratic subpoenas and requests for documents , or that Trump’s personal lawyers had filed a lawsuit against the Democratic chairman of the House Oversight Committee.
“I thought it was very positive,” said Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, of the meeting. “It was not a traditional conversation, talking Democrat-Republican. It was about getting stuff done.”
But comity is not always a shared objective throughout politics. And no sooner had the meeting concluded than Democrats were wondering why their party’s leadership had called it in the first place.
“He’s an incumbent president,” Adam Jentleson, a top aide to former Senate majority leader Harry Reid, told The Daily Beast. “The strategy should be to explain to voters that he shouldn’t be re-elected and not give him reasons why he should be elected.”
“Why hand him a press conference that he derives far more value out of than Dems do in a week when the other news is him defying congressional oversight and him relitigating his Charlottesville comments?” he continued. “Democratic leaders are just profoundly scared of going toe to toe with Trump and want to find a way to work around him. But that’s just not possible in an election cycle when he is the incumbent president.”
Since winning back the House majority, Democrats have grappled with balancing their newfound power to provide real oversight and resistance of the Trump administration with the reality that if they want to pass anything into law, Trump’s signature is needed.
Tuesday’s meeting was the latest evidence that Democrats still haven’t found agreement about what that balance looks like—and that Trump’s looming reelection campaign is sparking strategic handwringing within a party that wants to defeat him but to pad their own résumé, too. Asked, for instance, about the fear expressed from some Democrats that a big bipartisan infrastructure package could considerably boost the president’s re-election chances, a senior House Democratic aide replied with exasperation. “You know what, who gives a fuck? Who. Gives. A. Fuck?... We ran on the issue of infrastructure. So I don’t know why it would be a surprise to anyone that if we can get a bill done we’d be advocating for that. We are not Republicans. We don’t put politics ahead of getting something done for our constituents. That’s not what we do.” — Senior House Democratic aide
“You know what, who gives a fuck?” the aide said. “Who. Gives. A. Fuck?... We ran on the issue of infrastructure. So I don’t know why it would be a surprise to anyone that if we can get a bill done we’d be advocating for that. We are not Republicans. We don’t put politics ahead of getting something done for our constituents. That’s not what we do.”
If there were ever low-hanging fruit for win-win cooperation on a shared policy goal, it would be infrastructure. Since Trump took office, Democrats have hoped that the real-estate mogul would eschew conservative dogma and embrace a high-dollar federal reinvestment in roads, bridges, airports, and more.
But the lack of progress has turned the issue into something of a Washington punchline. “Infrastructure Week,” and its various iterations, has amounted to a running inside joke among the White House senior staff, with Trump’s aides mockingly saying, “Happy Infrastructure Week!” at one another whenever the president would revive his infrastructure-spending talk or tweets, according to former and current officials.
Whenever Trump would demand that this be made a priority of the week or hour, White House aides would roll their eyes and few, if any, would take it seriously.
To Trump allies, the new Infrastructure Week feels a lot like the old Infrastructure Weeks: destined for inertia at best, implosion at worst. And practically everyone in the Trump orbit sees Democratic leadership as imitating progress without really wanting to give the president a policy win. A senior White House official characterized the situation grimly to The Daily Beast, saying that “people [in the Trump administration] who say that this time it’s going somewhere are lying to you,” and rhetorically asking: “How many times do we have to go through this?”
The exasperation is shared by Democratic lawmakers, some of whom stopped just short of declaring Tuesday’s meeting a total waste of time and effort. They cited past instances where the president unexpectedly endorsed their ideas during freewheeling White House meetings—like an assault weapons ban in 2018—only to revert to the GOP line later .
“I would love to be surprised,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI). “But there’s no reason to think this situation is any different than the previous 10 discussions and negotiations we’ve had in which you cannot nail down the administration’s position, and they episodically blow it all up, all the way up until the end, and then they blow it up finally.”
But other Democrats were quick to declare the infrastructure talks as a win-win and maintained that Pelosi, ever the strategist, has a plan at work in winning a three-dimensional political chess game on the issue. “She and Dems have nothing to lose by engaging him on infrastructure,” a Democratic strategist told The Daily Beast. “They ran on it, he wants it, and if he can’t deliver, it won’t be the Democrats who couldn’t get it done.”
Even if Trump and Democrats do deliver on a sweeping infrastructure package—handing the president a huge win heading into his reelection—a lot of Democrats said it would be worth it. “Our job is to get things done for the people, period, full stop,” said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), the Democratic Caucus chairman, when asked about the political risks. “The political chips will fall where they may.”
But if the spirit of bipartisanship was in abundant supply on Tuesday, the details were not. Even the more optimistic Democratic lawmakers acknowledge that fundamental elements of a proposal—such as how to pay for the infrastructure investment—remain incredibly vague.
Trump on Tuesday assured Democrats in the room the he would “lead on this.” And the expectation among aides was that the president and his Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, would come up with a list of pay-fors before talks could substantively move forward.
For more cynical-minded Democrats, that was, perhaps, the point of Tuesday’s gathering: not just to showcase that Democratic leadership wasn’t monomaniacally focused on oversight investigations but also to put the pressure on Trump to deliver, knowing he likely couldn’t.
“I think [Democrats are] betting this will die one way or another,” said former Reid aide Jim Manley, “whether because of Trump's incompetence or because it goes down in the Senate.”"
Sean Hannity Rails Against ‘Hysteria’ Over Mueller Letter: Why Is This a Story?,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/hannity-rails-against-hysteria-over-mueller-letter-why-is-this-a-story,"OUTRAGE Sean Hannity Rails Against ‘Hysteria’ Over Mueller Letter: Why Is This a Story? The Fox News star claims the ‘media mob’ is simply ‘smearing the president at every turn.’ Justin Baragona 04.30.19 11:12 PM ET
Fox News host Sean Hannity accused media outlets of spreading “fake news” Tuesday night for covering the blockbuster news that Special Counsel Robert Mueller complained to the Justice Department about Attorney General William Barr’s depiction of the full report on the findings of the Russia investigation.
During his opening monologue late Tuesday, the pro-Trump host expressed bewilderment at why this previously undisclosed letter by Mueller—revealed on the eve of Barr’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he is expected to be grilled about accusations he misled the public on the Mueller Report’s findings—would be newsworthy.
Instead of concentrating on, say, the fact that Mueller told Barr his summary “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the two-year investigation, creating “public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation,” the Fox News star latched onto a Department of Justice spokesperson’s statement claiming that Mueller had merely been upset over a “lack of context.”
“They debunk their own headlines!” Hannity exclaimed. “Now this time, predictable hysteria surrounding a so-called bombshell Washington Post —and then echoed by the New York Times —report that Robert Mueller wasn’t happy with Barr’s initial summary of his report.”
Accusing the media of being “purposely deceptive,” Hannity claimed the Justice Department’s statement on the matter had been “buried” in the Post report to hide a spokesperson’s assertion that Mueller said “nothing was inaccurate” and “nothing was misleading” in Barr’s summary.
“Why is this then a story?!” Hannity shouted. “After all, the Mueller Report is now completely out.”
The Fox News primetime star, who has spent the better part of two years calling the Mueller investigation a “witch hunt,” went on to claim that this latest story was “only about the media mob smearing the president at every turn.”
“It’s always Russia, Russia, Russia, collusion fantasies. They’ve just got to keep it alive, they can’t let it go. No collusion, no obstruction, no conspiracy,” he said. READ THIS LIST"

The results are brutal. Elise Thomas 03.23.19 10:39 AM ET
I n January 2019 during an outbreak of violence, a man in the town of Bambari in the Central African Republic lost his little finger. That fact is about the only thing about which everyone can agree.
The United Nations is investigating allegations that the man was abducted, held captive and tortured by Russian forces, who choked him with a chain and cut off his finger.
However, a spider's web of social media accounts, blogs and news media are claiming that the allegations are a plot by the French to undermine the Russians in CAR, as the Central African Republic is known, or that the U.N. is attempting to smear Russia's reputation with local people, or maybe, the trolls suggest, the victim is just a liar.
There is a war for mindshare taking place right now in the Central African Republic, where Russia is locked in an increasingly tense contest with France for political influence and access to resources. In it, a sustained campaign for narrative control is being waged across multiple fronts, both on the ground in CAR and online, reaching out to the country’s diaspora. It takes forms typical of 21st century information warfare sometimes, and other times uses techniques as old as village gossip.
Despite its immense resource wealth, CAR has one of the world's lowest per capita incomes and what money the government does have often is spent on weapons rather than on CAR's people. The former French colony with a current population of roughly 4.8 million people has been riven with violence for well over a decade, and the immense humanitarian crisis has left millions of civilians without access to food, medical care, education or safe water. A devastating civil war in 2013-2014 further destabilized the country, which is now 70 percent under the control of a complex constellation of armed groups.
In February 2019 Russia helped to broker a fragile peace agreement between rebel leaders and the government, but given this is the eighth such agreement since the beginning of the war, hopes are not high that it will lead to a lasting peace.
In this complex, violent political context, rumors can spread like wildfire—and technology is like gasoline on the flames. At one point during the conflict in 2014, the government even briefly tried to ban SMS messages in an attempt to stop the spread of anti-government messaging.
Social media are now adding a 21st-century sting to the centuries-old dynamic of rumor-mongering and gossip. Internet penetration in CAR remains among the lowest in the world, with only five percent of the population estimated to have access.
It is this very narrowness, however, which may make social media a potent asset in information campaigns in CAR. In a society where only the wealthy, the educated and the elite are likely to have access to the internet, social media becomes a tool for strategically targeting those groups, and thereby influencing important decision-makers and the people around them. Putin's Chef
Although so far only parts of the campaign can be proved to be linked to Russia directly, one of the key figures involved is Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who helped make him rich with enormous catering contracts. (He is often called Putin’s Chef.) Prigozhin is identified explicitly in an indictment by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller as the man behind the disinformation campaign that targeted the U.S. elections in 2017.
Russia has dramatically ramped up its presence across a number of African countries in recent months, including CAR, but the situation there is particularly striking. A former member of the Russian intelligence services, Valery Zakharov , has been installed as the top security advisor to CAR President Archange Touadera. Since May 2018, Russian private military contractors are also reported to be acting as the president’s personal bodyguards. Despite failing in its lobbying efforts to lift a pesky U.N. arms embargo, Russia has succeeded in sending at least nine arms shipments and hundreds of “military trainers” to CAR.
There are strong suspicions that these officially acknowledged personnel are not the only contingent of heavily armed Russians wandering around the country. Persistent reports point to the presence of the infamous Wagner Group mercenaries , many of them former members of the Russian special forces known as Spetsnaz now allegedly employed by Prigozhin, guarding valuable gold and diamond mining operations.
One of those operations is the enormous Ndassima gold mine near the town of Bambari, where the alleged kidnapping and torture is said to have taken place.
Owned on paper by a Canadian company, in reality the mine has been controlled by Seleka rebels, one of the warring factions, since 2012.
Now, however, various press reports suggest it has been taken over by Russian interests funneled through a locally registered company called Lobaye Invest, which in turn is a subsidiary of the St. Petersburg-registered company M Invest. Tracing a winding path through the layers of companies, the trail appears to end with, yes, Yevgeny Prigozhin.
The current allegations about the abduction and torture of a local man, Mahamat Nour Mamadou, are not the first time links have been drawn between mysterious violence and the presence of Russian mercenaries around Bambari. In August 2018 three Russian journalists were murdered while attempting to travel there to investigate the Wagner Group and the Ndassima gold mine.
Then as now, widespread suspicions that Russia may have had a hand in ordering the journalists’ killing were met with an online wave of alternative theories of varying levels of plausibility. And then as now, the theory which appeared the most—posted on news blogs (warning: graphic images) and posted , re-posted and shared over and over again by the same groups of Facebook accounts and pages—claimed that France, not Russia, was the party to blame for the murders.
It is not surprising that rumors would spring up around the killing of three foreign journalists in CAR. But there is good reason to believe that this was—and still is—more than just the natural degree of scuttlebutt surrounding mysterious deaths. Disinformation, Conspiracy, and Confusion
Three years after the Prigozhin’s campaign to twist the 2016 U.S. elections in favor of Donald J. Trump, as revealed in the Mueller indictments and other investigations, we we see that wherever Prigozhin and Russia’s interests go in CAR, a coordinated wave of Facebook accounts, “news” sites, radio stations and free print newspapers appear, all of them primed to push a supportive narrative or smear Russia’s opponents.
Parts of this war for hearts and minds are connected openly to Russian interests. In late 2018 Lobaye Invest and the Russian embassy created and began funding a local radio station, Radio Lengo Songo.
The embassy and Prigozhin’s mining company have also co-sponsored community events including the Miss Central African Republic beauty pageant , public screenings of Russian movies and local football and tae kwon do tournaments.
In an evident attempt to soften his image, presidential security advisor Valery Zakharov popped up in an unexpected role to open a center for mothers and children and donate a trampoline. An article was written on Corbeau News about the donation by local journalist Fred Krock, who also happens to have been appointed as the manager for the new Russian Embassy sponsored radio station.
Other parts of the information network are not openly connected to Prigozhin’s enterprises or the Russian embassy. What is clear, however, is that this web of Facebook accounts, groups, websites, blogs and print newspapers show a consistent and coordinated effort to push identical or near-identical content which supports pro-Russian and anti-French narratives, including spreading rumors that France is planning a genocide and supporting terrorism in CAR.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian, spoke out publicly in early 2019 about the “anti-French” rhetoric being promoted by Russia in CAR. He also openly acknowledged the presence of Wagner contractors, undermining repeated Russian denials that the mercenary group is operating in the country.
France has not been the information network’s only target. Russia opposes the U.N. arms embargo on CAR, and the role which the U.N. peacekeeping mission MINUSCA should play in the country has been a source of contention between Russia and France.
In November 2018 and then again in January 2019 MINUSCA was forced to issue public statements denying stories that the U.N. is plotting against the Central African government and its people; funding armed groups; supporting terrorism or deliberately allowing violent attacks to occur. MINUSCA says that these rumors are being spread both on social media and via free print newspapers, and has called for the parties responsible to stop—without directly naming who they believe to be behind the disinformation campaign. Prigozhin's Playbook
The information techniques and tactics on display—building coordinated networks to push content across multiple platforms, inflecting narratives and messages for specific audiences, exploiting pre-existing social divisions and amplifying conspiracy theories—are remarkably similar to those uncovered by investigators studying Prigozhin’s Internet Research Agency disinformation campaign targeting the U.S. presidential elections.
In a report for the U.S. Senate , researchers from the private information integrity company New Knowledge describe how Prigozhin's IRA created entire ""interlinked information ecosystems designed to immerse and surround target audiences."" These “media mirages” help to give narratives the appearance of legitimacy by making it seem as though they are being reported by multiple sources.
Similar structures are visible in the information network currently promoting Prigozhin's and Russia's interests in CAR. A number of the “news” websites are registered to the same IP addresses, for example, while at least eight Facebook pages that consistently push identical or similar content were all created on the same day in June 2018. All together, dozens of pages and groups likely to be part of the network were created in 2018, with several new ones also cropping up in the first two months of 2019. These pages are clearly targeted at different audiences, and often reflect the same narrative but with differences in tone and style.
The New Knowledge researchers note that while a lot of Western media coverage focused on the use of automation and bots in the U.S. operation, the IRA also relied heavily on human-run operations. This involved IRA employees creating fake Facebook personas, but it also involved co-opting real Americans to support their message, often unwittingly.
Human-run operations appear to play a major role in the information operation taking place in CAR, perhaps more so than in the 2016 campaign. This difference may be at least partially because it appears some individuals don’t need to be tricked into taking part—they just need to be paid.
According to some reports , local journalists are getting commissions to write and share pro-Russian, anti-French stories ( one report puts the going rate at around 20,000 CFA, or about $34.50 per article). This estimate seems high, however, in a country as poor as CAR. Such sums would make disinformation a very lucrative career indeed. Local people also are paid to manage “ news” websites and NGO Facebook groups which push content out to followers both in CAR and in the diaspora.
Based on observation it seems that a relatively small number of “core” individuals and/or personas are responsible for posting and sharing the majority of original content, while other accounts play a secondary role in liking, sharing and disseminating content.
Students are also being instrumentalized. Russia offers a number of scholarship programs in CAR, and some of the most active nodes in the information network appear to be CAR students currently studying in Russia. Young people are a particular focus of the network, which routinely posts content across a multitude of Facebook groups and pages specifically for young people in CAR.
One of the key findings of the New Knowledge research was the tactic of amplifying and exploiting conspiratorial narratives in the 2016 campaign. This same tactic is on full display in CAR.
After the horrific massacre of more than 60 people at a displaced persons camp near the town of Alindao in November, for example, within hours the network was pushing hard on a conspiracy theory that a French mercenary was involved in the atrocity, using as "" proof "" a picture of rebel leader Ali Darassa in which a white man's hair and arm are visible in the background.
It goes without saying that this is not proof of anything—just because a white man once walked across a field with Darassa doesn't mean he committed a massacre with him, and as the Russians are very well aware, the French are hardly the only white people in CAR.
Beyond taking advantage of any opportunity, even tragedy, to smear the French and to support Russia's strategic interests in CAR, a primary aim of the network appears to be to deflect, dismiss and redirect the not-infrequent allegations of violence or wrongdoing committed by Russian forces.
All of which brings us back to Bambari, and what exactly happened there over five days in January 2019. Bambari
In early January 2019, violence erupted in Bambari between government forces and fighters from Darassa’s group, the Union for Peace in the Central African Republic (UPC), an ex-Seleka militia group. The government and its Russian allies took several weeks to regain full control of the region, even with the help of Portuguese paratroopers deployed by MINUSCA to support CAR’s troops.
Such outbreaks of violence are not uncommon in Bambari since MINUSCA first helped to drive the UPC out of the town in 2017.
According to a U.N. report seen by Agence France Presse, it was during this time that the Bambari market trader named Mahamat Nour Mamadou says he was abducted by Russians and held captive for five days while they tortured him on suspicion of being a member of the rebel group.
""They took me to the town hall where the [CAR armed forces] and the Russians are based. The Russians questioned me, they asked me if I was a Seleka, if I had weapons,"" Mamadou told the AFP .
""They tortured me from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. They hit me with chains, iron batons, they cut me in the foot with a knife, and also on the arms and the shoulder. They broke a tooth with a brick,"" Mamadou said.
The AFP reports that Mamadou had deep scars and bruises across his body, marks around his wrists and ankles from being bound, slashes across his back believed to be from a knife, and that his little finger had been cut off.
While Mamadou’s allegation is still under investigation by the U.N., it is backed up by local reporting that describes attempts by the Russians to enter the hospital at Bambari to interrogate patients about their ties to the rebels. The same local article refers to a local man, presumably Mamadou, who was tortured and had his finger cut off.
Disturbingly, the article also says that Mamadou was the lucky one because he came out alive. According to the story (which should of course be taken with some skepticism) there was another man who was not so lucky, and his body was “packaged up” and put into a car by hooded men.
The response from the information network has been textbook: deny, deflect and redirect.
The immediate response was to dismiss the entire story as a fabrication by the French media to undermine the Russian military instructors. Some parts of the network even took the opportunity to demand that the Ministry of Defense kick the “imperialist French media” out of the country.
In the weeks since, the narrative has evolved (perhaps because it is rather difficult to deny that someone cut off Mamadou’s finger and caused his other injuries).
The basic outline of the story is the same—it’s a perfidious French plot against the innocent Russians—but the network seems to be floating different versions to see which sticks. Some variants claim that Mamadou is a rebel who lost his finger during the fighting, and that French special services found his finger and somehow used it to force him to tell a false story about being tortured by Russians.
Others are saying that Mamadou was briefly detained by CAR government forces and their Russian allies but was swiftly released, after which he was captured again and tortured by persons unknown, who promised not to kill him if he told the U.N. that the Russians did it.
Perhaps the most prominent version of the story is that Mamadou is being paid by the French or has been offered a French residency visa in the future for claiming that the Russians had tortured him.
Outside of the network’s whispering campaign, there appears to be no reason to think there was any French involvement in whatever did or did not happen to Mamadou.
Sharing multiple versions of the story, rather than coordinating around a single version as the network as in other cases, could be in order to figure out which version is the most effective—essentially, throwing everything at the wall and waiting to see what sticks. It could also be a tactic in itself, in order to muddy the waters and spread confusion.
As earlier mentioned, many elements of this information campaign cannot be connected directly to Yevgeny Prigozhin or to the Russian embassy. The facts around the torture allegations, the murders of the Russian journalists and the presence of Wagner Group mercenaries in CAR remain largely unconfirmed.
Whatever the truth about what is happening with the Russians in Bambari, however, one thing is clear: in the fight for influence in Africa, narrative control is a powerful weapon. And someone is wielding it in Russia’s interests."
How We Can Dim the Sun to Survive Climate Change,www.thedailybeast.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-solar-radiation-management-can-dim-the-sun-to-maybe-survive-climate-change,"SUNNY WITH A CHANCE OF PARTICLES How We Can Dim the Sun to Survive Climate Change Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Photos Getty All it takes is a fleet of planes spraying aerosols, diamond dust, or sea salt into the stratosphere. 05.01.19 5:11 AM ET
C limate change is here, whether you believe in it or not.
Fighting climate change is a different matter entirely. It’s political. The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has suggested carbon farming, or laying compost on undeveloped land to absorb carbon dioxide, as one of many viable plans that could help fight climate change.
But what if we could inject particles into the stratosphere to actually dim sunlight and reduce warming?
Solar radiation management, or SRM, is a serious option—one that scientists and policymakers are entertaining more and more. It works like this: A fleet of planes able to reach the stratosphere, originating from several equatorial regions around the planet, spray particles into the stratosphere regularly to reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the troposphere (where we are).
These particles can range from sulfate aerosols , currently one of the most popular nominees because of how they dim sunlight after a volcanic eruption. But some scientists are even considering the idea of spraying diamond dust into the atmosphere. Researchers are also looking into using sea salt to brighten clouds, which would make them more reflective of sunlight.
One big obstacle to any of these methods is cost. To successfully deploy SRM, it would take a powerful country with a lot of reach, like the United States, or a group of countries to be in charge of managing these efforts.
Despite the cost factor, SRM comes at a crucial point for our planet. If we do not drastically increase efforts to combat climate change, the U.N. claims we’re on a path to see global temperatures rise by 3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. To put that in perspective, sea level is expected to rise over 7 feet per degree of warming. The sweltering heat alone would kill millions. A 3-degree Celsius increase would have calamitous effects across the globe.
Politicians have proposed reducing emissions, but scientists aren’t waiting around, instead looking at how to geoengineer the atmosphere to fight climate change. Besides SRM, carbon dioxide removal (CDR)—or literally sucking CO2 out of the air—has also gained traction.
But even that has sparked controversy. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia recently blocked a U.N. effort to study the benefits and risks of certain geoengineering concepts that could help fight climate change, like CDR and SRM. Reports claimed the countries did this to protect fossil fuel industry interests. The United States’ U.N. ambassador’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
That frustrates scientists.
“Why should [this administration] look into addressing a problem they claim does not exist,” Alan Robock, a professor of environmental science at Rutgers University, told The Daily Beast. “Global warming is a real problem, and we need to know what the risks of geoengineering would be if we are ever tempted to use it.”
On the surface, SRM might seem like a recipe for a dystopian future. Just imagine a scene in a movie where the scientists say they made the wrong calculations and they’ve accidentally unleashed a permanent winter.
However, preliminary research indicates the technique is relatively safe. A recent study that was published in Nature Climate Change found that SRM could reduce precipitation in some places, since less evaporation would occur. Using SRM to reduce climate change-related warming by only half would not cause precipitation to decrease to a concerning level.
“There have been a number of studies in the last 10 years, most of which… found if it’s successful and well implemented, it could reduce the amount of change due to global warming without, as far as we know, unexpected consequences,” Lynn Russell, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of California, San Diego, told The Daily Beast.
Russell said one of the primary risks involved with SRM is that the atmosphere could respond to these particles in a negative way that we can’t yet predict. She said that years of research will be required before we’ll understand how the atmosphere might react to each kind of particle that might be used for SRM.
“What we don’t have a clear handle on is the feedback from the system,” Russell said. “We know that certain parts of the atmospheric system react with each other.” Russell added that altering the atmosphere in one area could create harmful effects in another area.
Beyond how the atmosphere might react to SRM, there are public health concerns. Scientists believe sulfate aerosol could not only damage the ozone layer, but also cause acid rain and further ocean acidification.
Additionally, Janos Pasztor, the executive director of the Carnegie Climate Geoengineering Governance Initiative, told The Daily Beast it’s not clear how dimming the sun might affect human health generally.
“It will be 1 to 1.5 percent less sunlight coming in on a regular basis, and that may not sound like a lot, but it could have an impact that we don’t understand at this point,” Pasztor said.
That said, reducing warming would have a lot of positive effects that outweigh turning the dimmer on the sun, slowing the melting of icecaps and preventing large regions of the planet from becoming unbearably hot, reducing the number of superstorms we’d have to endure.
“We know superstorms tend to be created because of extra heat in the ocean, so if you reduce that, then one would think… those risks would go down,” Pasztor said.
While geoengineering is promising, experts The Daily Beast spoke with emphasized not attempting it just yet until we completely understand side effects.
“There is not much money being spent on research in these areas, therefore not much is happening,” Pasztor said.
“What I would hope the world will avoid is a situation where we continue to emit greenhouse gases, don’t do much carbon dioxide removal—because it’s expensive and takes a long time to put in place—and suddenly in 10 to 20 years from now we find ourselves in a place where we’re on a dead end street and the only option is solar radiation modification.”"
