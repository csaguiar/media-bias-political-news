World Health Day is a chance to celebrate health and remind world leaders that everyone should be able to access the health care they need, when and where they need it
GENEVA, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 06th Apr, 2019) Each year on April 7th, the World Health Organization,WHO, celebrates World Health Day. World Health Day is a chance to celebrate health and remind world leaders that everyone should be able to access the health care they need, when and where they need it.
The WHO’s campaign for 2019 is focusing on ''Universal Health Coverage'' and ensuring that individuals across the world have access to the care that they need when they need it.
According to WHO, At least half of the world’s population still do not have full coverage of essential health services. About 100 million people are still being pushed into extreme poverty (defined as living on 1.90 USD or less a day) because they have to pay for health care. Over 800 million people (almost 12% of the world’s population) spent at least 10% of their household budgets to pay for health care. All UN Member States have agreed to try to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030, as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.
This year's campaign aims to improve understanding of universal health coverage and the importance of Primary health care as its foundation and to spur action from individuals, policy-makers and health-care workers to make universal health care a reality for everyone.
Advocacy events will be held around the world to fuel the momentum of the #HealthForAll movement and to highlight our goal of achieving a fairer, healthier world – in which no one is left behind.
The focus will be on equity and solidarity – on raising the bar for health for everyone, everywhere by addressing gaps in services, and leaving no one behind.
Universal health coverage means that all people have access to the quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. To make health for all a reality, governments need to invest in quality, accessible primary health care. Health workers need to care and advocate for patients and educate them on how to get and stay healthy. Individuals and communities need to be empowered to take care of their own health."

ICE Slams NJ For “Limited Cooperation” After Twice Deported Illegal Immigrant Charged With Raping And Murdering Stranger | Daily Wire,www.dailywire.com,Kassy Dillon,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.dailywire.com/news/45636/ice-slams-nj-limited-cooperation-after-twice-kassy-dillon,"Hollywood ICE Slams NJ For 'Limited Cooperation' After Twice Deported Illegal Immigrant Charged With Raping And Murdering Stranger ""ICE will seek taking custody of Rios-Doblado at the conclusion of his criminal proceedings, despite limited cooperation in the state."" Robert MacPherson/AFP/Getty Images April 6, 2019 views On Friday, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency criticized New Jersey for only offering “limited cooperation” after a twice-deported illegal immigrant was charged with kidnapping, raping, and murdering a woman. On March 24, the body of a 45-year-old nanny was discovered in a lake in Lincoln Park in Jersey City. Carolina Cano is believed to have been jogging in the park when she went missing. The cause of death was cited by the Regional Medical Examiner’s Office as strangulation and water submersion, according to the Washington Examiner . The suspect, 33-year-old Jorge Alberto Rios-Doblado, entered the U.S. illegally and was deported in 2003 and 2004 to his home country of Honduras, USA Today reported. It is unknown when he returned to the U.S. Rios-Doblado was charged with murdering, kidnapping, and raping Cano. He was seen on a surveillance video around the time Cano was murdered and near where her body was discovered, according to NJ.com . Cano and Rios-Doblado were reportedly strangers. Cano was an immigrant from Peru who has worked in the U.S. for two years. According to Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez, Rios-Doblado has no previous criminal record. NJ.com reports that if Rios-Doblado is convicted, he will serve his prison term in the United States before possibly being deported for the third time. He could face 30 years to life for murder if convicted. ICE is now criticizing New Jersey for a directive issued by Attorney General Gurbir Grewal in November which prevents the state and local police departments from “assisting federal immigration on authorities with ‘civil immigration law,’ with some exceptions,” reported USA Today. ""ICE maintains that cooperation by local law enforcement is an indispensable component of promoting public safety,"" the Newark ICE office said in a statement. ""ICE will seek taking custody of Rios-Doblado at the conclusion of his criminal proceedings, despite limited cooperation in the state.” On Wednesday, Grewal claimed the policy was inspired by “overly zealous enforcement of immigration laws” which may discourage people from reporting crimes to the police. ""Our job as state law enforcement officers is to enforce the criminal laws of this state and that's all we told our law enforcement officers through that directive,"" Grewal said to state lawmakers about the policy. ""We don’t enforce civil immigration deportation orders."" In an opinion piece on NJ1015 , radio host Dennis Malloy said that New Jersey’s policies are why Rios-Doblado was drawn to the state. “ Perhaps he was drawn to New Jersey due to the rhetoric of the governor and top state officials pledging not to cooperate with ICE in handing over illegal aliens in state custody,” Malloy wrote. “Maybe he just thought it was a nice place to live. There are possibly hundreds, maybe thousands like Rios, who've been deported and have criminal records, that feel New Jersey is a safe place to hide in plain sight.”
“ What happened to Ms. Cano was horrific, despicable and totally preventable,” Malloy added. “One of the few and more important responsibilities of our elected officials both state and federal is to maintain the safety of its citizens.”"

GABORONE, Apr 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :The European Union (EU) in partnership with the Southern African Development Community (SADC), has launched the ""Support to Peace and Security in the SADC region"" (SPSS) programme.
Launched by Jan Sadek, Ambassador of the European Union to Botswana and SADC on Friday, the program is designed to financially strengthen the capacity of the SADC Organ in its work to promote peace, security and democracy across the southern African region.
During the launch held in Gaborone , the capital of Botswana , Sadek emphasized that if a region is not peaceful and stable, and its citizens do not feel secure, it will not be able to sustain its development and reap the benefits of integration.
Hence, he said it is therefore natural that the EU engages with SADC in the peace and security area, as it believes that the security threats faced can only be tackled through cooperation and in the multilateral framework.
While the SADC region is relatively the most peaceful region in Africa , it continues to experience acts of low intensity conflict and related violence. Hence conflict prevention is seen as crucial.
The region faces a number of threats with potential impact on its security and stable democratic development such as political crisis, democracy and government deficits, uneven development and social inequality among others.
The region hosts two of the most poorly governed countries on the continent, namely Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo . Hence the launch of the support program is complementary to these challenges, Sadek said.
The program amounts to some 15 million Euro , and builds on the results of a previous program on regional political cooperation.
Though pleased with the EU's efforts, Lydia Mafhoko-Ditsa, Principal UN Women National Program Officer called on the EU and SADC to broaden the scope of peace and security to include human security challenges such as gender-based violence and human trafficking.
Peace and security efforts, she said, should include women , as women 's representation as witnesses, signatories or negotiators in formal mediation processes remains scarce.
Sharing her sentiments, Sadek said statistical evidence shows that when women are involved in peace processes, the likelihood of peace lasting more than 15 years increases by over a third. Moreover he assured her that this is one area the SPSS program will address."

Lahore (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News – 6th April, 2019) The Lahore High Court (LHC) has restricted the National Accountability Bureau ( NAB ) from arresting Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Hamza Shahbaz till Monday.
LHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Shamim Khan approved Hamza Shahbaz 's protective bail on Saturday.
The court ordered NAB not to arrest Hamza Shahbaz till April 8, Monday.
The chief justice has formed two member LHC bench to hear pre-arrest bail plea of Hamza Shahbaz .
The NAB team once again arrived at the Model Town residence of PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif to arrest his son and Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Hamza Shahbaz for involvement in money laundering on Saturday.
They said that they have arrest warrants against Hamza Shahbaz .
Hamza Shehbaz had challenged NAB arrest warrants against him in the LHC earlier today.

History against Tiger Roll's bid to emulate National legend Red Rum,www.urdupoint.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/world/history-against-tiger-rolls-bid-to-emulate-n-587535.html,"History Against Tiger Roll's Bid To Emulate National Legend Red Rum Faizan Hashmi 4 minutes ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 03:46 PM Tiger Roll will bid to succeed where 17 previous Grand National winners in the intervening years have failed and emulate Red Rum (1973/74) in winning the world's greatest steeplechase for a second successive time.
London, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Tiger Roll will bid to succeed where 17 previous Grand National winners in the intervening years have failed and emulate Red Rum (1973/74) in winning the world 's greatest steeplechase for a second successive time.
History may suggest the Gordon Elliott-trained star is up against it but punters do not believe that as they pile the money on ahead of the tape going up on the spine-tingling race at 1615 GMT at Aintree racecourse.
Tiger Roll could be the shortest-priced favourite since Red Rum went off at 7/2 in 1975 when he finished second.
A win for the Davy Russell-ridden favourite would strip the bookies of an estimated �200 million .
""He seems to be getting better,"" Russell told ITV.
""He is carrying more weight this year so it is a big ask.
""But the bigger occasion the better he is and he is a right character,"" added the 39-year-old Irishman.
Two former Grand National winning jockeys, AP McCoy and Mick Fitzgerald, believe he is an even better horse than last year when he just held off a charging Pleasant Company , who is back for revenge.
Ironically based on sheer weight of numbers Tiger Roll could be denied by another Elliott horse, as the Irish trainer handles 11 of the 40 runners -- a record in itself.
""I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I don't come from a horse background,"" the combative handler told BBC Sport.
""Everything I have, I've worked very hard for it.
""I've got five or six different owners, they've all paid their entry fee, they're all entitled to have a runner in the race ."" - 'Mentally he is in the right place' - The classiest horse in the race apart from Tiger Roll, whose short price is also due to a startling annihilation of a classy field in the Cross Country Race at the Cheltenham Festival last month, is top weight Anibale Fly.
He comes into this year's edition -- he was third last year in an Irish clean sweep -- on the back of a fine second in the Cheltenham Gold Cup.
However, trainer Tony Martin has had to bring in jockey Mark Walsh as a late replacement after Barry Geraghty's hopes of a second win in the race were dashed after he broke a leg in a fall on Friday.
History too could be made if either Lakeview Lad -- trained in Scotland by former stockbroker Nick Alexander -- or Vintage Clouds win as it would give former Blackpool Tower owner Trevor Hemmings a record fourth victory.
Another Scottish runner One For Arthur is bidding to repeat his success of 2017 -- one of a plethora of runners trained by women , in his case Lucinda Russell.
""Mentally he is in the right place, Aintree fences bring the best out of him,"" said Russell.
The odds are shorter on a woman training the winner this year than of either Lizzie Kelly on Tea For Two -- trained by her mother Jane Williams -- or top Irish jockey Rachael Blackmore on Valseur Lido becoming the first of their sex to win the race .
However, there have been a flood of bets for Kelly's ride, who has been an integral part of her establishing herself as a top jockey.
""I was still at university when I won a bumper on him at Wincanton, all those years ago. He's been part of my career at every stage,"" said the 25-year-old.
Russell's boyfriend Peter Scudamore won almost every major prize as a jumps jockey but, like fellow greats John Francome and Jonjo O'Neill, the National eluded him.
This is a fate that threatens to befall champion jockey Richard Johnson, who has his 21st try with Rock The Kasbah.
""I am not going to lose sleep if I never win it,"" said the popular 41-year-old.
""However, to have a picture on the wall of winning the Grand National, you would never get tired of looking at that."" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Mohannadi, one of six Asian Football Confederation delegates to be voted on to the powerful council, said the complaint claiming preferential treatment for Qatar was unfounded.
""The complaint had no grounds actually,"" Mohannadi said after the vote at the AFC Congress , held at a luxury hotel in Kuala Lumpur .
""I don't know what he had in his mind to file this complaint but we worked with them for a long time, with the Korean FA .
""We have a very good relationship with Mr Chung and I hope for their side that this won't spoil this relationship."" South Korea lodged its complaint with the AFC's electoral committee, saying Qatar offered AFC voters a free trip to Doha while a similar invitation to Seoul was disallowed.
But Chung, a scion of the Hyundai business empire, said he did not expect the electoral committee to reverse the result of the vote .
Asked whether he thought the campaign was unfair, Chung told AFP: ""Yeah, that's why we complained.""""I don't think the result will be reversed. We've done the voting already... if anything can be done I don't know, it's up to the electoral committee to decide,"" he added."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) The Air Force of the Libyan Government of National Accord (GNA) conducted airstrikes against the positions of the Libyan National Army (LNA) south of Tripoli , Arabic media reported on Saturday.
The strikes were carried out against the LNA positions in Garyan and Suq al Khamis, the Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper specified.
The situation in Libya escalated on Thursday as Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, commander of forces loyal to East Libya-based government , ordered an offensive to retake Tripoli from the GNA-backed forces. The LNA has already recaptured a number of settlements on its way to the capital, while leader of Libya 's UN-backed government Fayez Sarraj has ordered its troops to use force if necessary.
The escalation caught UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on his trip to Libya as part of the UN-led efforts to boost the political settlement of the Libyan conflict. On Friday, Guterres met with Haftar and then left Libya .
LNA spokesman Ahmed Al-Mismari said on Friday that Haftar's army was carrying out an offensive on Tripoli in several directions at once but has not yet entered the capital. He stated that he could not yet name the date of the end of the operation, but confirmed that the operation would continue until all objectives are completed."

Tehran, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Iranian authorities ordered the evacuation of six cities along the Karkheh river in southwestern Khuzestan province on Saturday after more rain sparked fears of new flooding, state news agency IRNA said.
Six cities alongside Karkheh river in southwestern Iran ""must be evacuated as soon as possible,"" Khuzestan governor Gholamreza Shariati told IRNA.
The oil-rich province of Khuzestan has an extensive range of dams, which have swelled upstream due to fresh downpours.
The floodwater's intensity has forced authorities to open emergency discharges at Karkheh dam , one of the largest in the area, thus sparking fears of fresh flooding.
The situation appears to be ""critical"", he said.
""We advise all women and children to be evacuated to shelters and youngsters to remain and help,"" he added.
Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli warned that up to 400,000 people in Khuzestan could be exposed to the floods, IRNA reported.
Iran, a usually arid country, has been hit by unprecedented flooding across most of the country since mid-March with 70 people killed, according to the country's emergency services.
Heavy rain was forecast for Saturday in Khuzestan.
The country's northeast was swamped on March 19 before the west and southwest of the country were inundated on March 25, killing a total of 45 people.
On April 1 the west and southwest were again swamped by floods when heavy rains returned to the area.
The government said the flooding had damaged nearly 12,000 kilometres (7,500 miles) of roads, or 36 percent of the country's entire network.
The worst hit in the latest deluge was Lorestan Province where in some cities whole neighbourhoods were washed away and many villages are still cut off.
Fourteen deaths have been reported from Lorestan so far."

MULTAN, Apr 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : Punjab Excise and Taxation Department is considering to issue universal number plates with an aim to facilitate vehicle owners locally.
Earlier, vehicle owners especially hailing from different cities of south Punjab and its adjacent areas were more interested for registration of vehicles with district Lahore . Citizens have to visit Lahore for the registration of vehicles .
This was informed by Excise and Taxation Officer Suhail Buzdar while talking to APP. The proposal will help reduce burden of work on Lahore office. The choice of Lahore related number plates would also automatically end because the number plates would be issued at provincial level.
If proposal is accepted, then, the local citizens will manage registration of their vehicles via online facility and they will not travel toward Lahore for registration of vehicles .
He further remarked that the revenue of Multan and other districts of south Punjab would also increase after universal number plates are introduced in the province."
World Health Day puts spotlight on countries to find sustainable solutions: TBHF Director,www.urdupoint.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/middle-east/world-health-day-puts-spotlight-on-countries-587499.html,"World Health Day Puts Spotlight On Countries To Find Sustainable Solutions: TBHF Director Faizan Hashmi 12 hours ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 03:15 PM The Director of The Big Heart Foundation, TBHF, has said that World Health Day, is designed to raise awareness about the importance of establishing the right to full universal healthcare for all, especially the poor, needy and refugees, whose care is a priority for TBHF
SHARJAH, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 06th Apr, 2019) The Director of The Big Heart Foundation, TBHF, has said that World Health Day, is designed to raise awareness about the importance of establishing the right to full universal healthcare for all , especially the poor , needy and refugees , whose care is a priority for TBHF.
Mariam Al Hammadi stressed that TBHF has the unwavering support of H.H. Dr. Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah , and his wife , H.H. Sheikha Jawaher bint Mohammed Al Qasimi, Chairperson of TBHF. The Foundation's humanitarian programmes seek to build and nurture cooperation to lay the foundation for strategies and initiatives aimed at tackling health issues faced by refugees and the poor around the world , she explained.
She added that the delicate situation of the health care sector, and the dire conditions of the poor and the refugees specifically, demands that all stakeholders transform their humanitarian work from temporary projects into sustainable solutions to support the health sector, to provide appropriate continuous health services for the community.
Al Hammadi stressed that the principle of empowerment is more important and beneficial than temporary projects and aid. She emphasised that TBHF works towards developing the capabilities of the communities, and not carrying out the work on their behalf.
The TBHF Director noted that the foundation is a major contributor to addressing global health challenges, which is witnessing a significant deterioration in developing countries. According to the World Economic Forum in 2018 , six million children die due to the lack of basic health treatments. There is also a shortage of up to six million health workers, with a bleak forecast of rising numbers over the next ten years.
She noted that the adoption of the latest technologies in training health care workers on the skills of first aid and rescue requires a few weeks of training at a small cost of US$2,000 per staff member. The director said that the training is considered a sustainable solution, aligned with the TBHF strategy and the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals.
""Proactive action is needed to address the roots and causes of problems such as hunger, contamination of food and water sources, illiteracy and lack of health awareness in some societies. To this day, medical relief teams continue to deploy after deteriorating health conditions occur. This can be pre-empted through data analysis and monitoring of health cases in the early stages, where action plans can be put in place for medical teams to carry and tackle early on,"" Al Hammadi continued.
The Director added that aside from emergency relief efforts like food and cadre, TBHF works on sustainable projects to aid those in need. In 2018 , the foundation funded a total amount of AED47,896,662 to upgrade the main building of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute. They also advanced the services offered at ‘The Big Heart Clinic’ which was launched in 2015 to improve the health conditions of nearly 24,000 Syrian refugees in the Zaatari camp in Jordan , as well as building a hospital in the city of Cox Bazaar in Bangladesh to serve Rohingya refugees .
Al Hammadi concluded that aside from the right to health - which is a human right in international agreements - the vision of TBHF also aims to avoid any consequences resulting from bad health care and infrastructure in poor communities, due to its devastating impact on humankind, and the sustainable development journey of the world .

Rome, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) : Italy on Saturday marked 10 years since a devastating earthquake hit L'Aquila , killing 309 people and destroying much of the historic city.
A ceremony in L'Aquila , northeast of Rome , remembered the dead and the 1,600 injured when the devastating quake hit in the early hours of April 6, 2009.
""The path of reconstruction has begun, but it is necessary to proceed with strength because a lot still needs to be done,"" Italian President Sergio Mattarella said.
""Numerous houses await renovation, vast artistic heritage has been damaged in artistic centres partly destroyed by the earthquake ,"" Mattarella said in a commemorative message.
The quake left at least 80,000 people homeless in the rugged Abruzzo region, and the city has battled to build quake-proof housing for them in so-called New Towns.
Quake-resistant Progetto C.A.S.E. (meaning ""homes project"") apartment blocks now house 17,000 people.
""The wound of a local community is a wound of the national community,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said.
""Ten years have passed since the earthquake in L'Aquila and we still have the duty of memory: many have lost loved ones, many continue to suffer,"" Conte wrote on Facebook .
L'Aquila's elegant buildings and squares -- which span the medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods -- are slowly being renovated and businesses are reopening.
The quake spurred emergency services to reorganise their disaster response in a country that is frequently struck by devastating seismic activity.
""I still have a deep memory, especially of the Red Cross volunteers from L'Aquila , struck by the devastation in their homes and their families,"" said Italian Red Cross president Francesco Rocca.
""In spite of everything, they put on their uniforms and set to helping their fellow citizens,"" said Rocca, who is also head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
""For the Italian Red Cross, the earthquake in L'Aquila marked an organisational, historical and human turning point that marked us deeply."""

Mal, Maldives, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :The Maldives on Saturday held its first parliamentary election since former strongman leader Abdulla Yameen was forced to stand down, with his arch-rival expected to make a big comeback in the vote .
Mohamed Nasheed, another former president, is the highest profile candidate up for election for the 87-member People's Majlis, or parliament .
He returned from an enforced exile abroad after Yameen lost an election in September to Nasheed's deputy, Mohamed Ibrahim Solih.
Solih said he expected Saturday's poll to return a strong legislature led by his Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP).
""I want to stress that I would like the next parliament to be made up of members who are familiar with our policies, and fully support it,"" Solih told a campaign rally on Thursday night.
Nasheed is widely expected to play a key role in the new legislature.
He was jailed for 13 years on a controversial terrorism charge when Yameen was in power. However, the conviction was overturned last year after the presidency changed.
The opposition coalition that helped Solih win has come apart, with constituent parties going their separate ways for Saturday's election .
Election commissioner Ahmed Shareef told reporters preparations had been completed for Saturday's vote and there had been no complaints of irregularities.
Voting will take place for overseas Maldivians in neighbouring India and Sri Lanka , as well as London .
Former president Yameen is not a candidate, but his Progressive Party of Maldives is seen as the main challenger to the MDP.
Last week, the High Court ordered authorities to lift a freeze on Yameen's bank accounts holding about $6.5 million . But it said a money laundering case against him would proceed.
Yameen received the payments just before he lost his re-election bid. Since then, all dissidents have returned to the Indian Ocean archipelago and most have had their convictions quashed.
The Maldives was on the verge of being slapped with Western-led sanctions before Solih won the presidential election on a pledge to end corruption in the country best known for its luxury tourism. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Bangkok, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :The telegenic leader of an anti-junta political party who rose to prominence in Thailand 's election last month was charged with sedition Saturday, drawing hundreds of his supporters onto the streets urging him to ""fight"".
Billionaire Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit heads the youth-oriented Future Forward Party which won more than six million votes in the March 24 poll, the first since a 2014 coup, with its message of ousting the military from politics .
It had joined an anti-junta coalition with six others claiming the right to form a government in the aftermath of the disputed vote whose full results are expected by May 9.
Earlier this week he posted on Facebook that police had summoned him to appear on Saturday to face a sedition charge relating to an anti-junta rally in 2015 .
He said the charge was ""politically motivated"".
Hundreds turned up on Saturday morning in front of Pathumwan police station in downtown Bangkok , wearing T-shirts bearing the tycoon's face and shouting ""Save Thanathorn!"" while waving placards that said ""Military, get out!"" While inside, he and his party members tweeted out photos of what was happening, showing Thanathorn affixing his fingerprints on the charges and representatives from foreign embassies and the UN observing the police procedure.
More than two hours later, he emerged from the station and told reporters he had been charged with ""inciting unrest.... helping the suspect escape... and the illegal assembly of more than ten people"" for his actions in 2015 .
""We believe we are innocent. I did everything in good faith,"" he said, denying the charges.
Before leaving the police compound, Thanathorn flashed a three-finger salute, a resistance symbol borrowed by Thailand 's anti-junta movement from the Hollywood movie ""The Hunger Games"", as his supporters did the same while shouting ""Thanathorn, fight, fight!"" The charismatic leader is already being investigated under Thailand 's Computer Crimes Act for allegedly spreading false information when he criticised the junta in a Facebook Live discussion last year.
Supporter Woranuch Sirithonchai, who travelled three hours from her coastal hometown of Rayong , said she supports Future Forward's anti-junta policies and ""progressive thinking"".
""This incident happened since 2015 so why do they just summon him now? It's because he has gained popularity,"" she said. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

London, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Saturday the government had ""no red lines"" in talks with the main opposition party to break the deadlock in parliament over Brexit .
""Our approach to these discussions with Labour is that we have no red lines,"" he told reporters at a meeting of European finance ministers in Bucharest .
""We are expecting to exchange more texts with the Labour Party today, so this is an ongoing process and I expect we will reach some form of agreement ,"" Hammond added.
Senior ministers are negotiating with Labour leaders in a bid to find a compromise to end months of political crisis and allow Britain to leave the European Union smoothly after 46 years of membership.
But after three days of discussions, Labour said Friday it was ""disappointed"" by the failure to offer ""real change or compromise"" to Prime Minister Theresa May 's unpopular Brexit divorce deal.
MPs have rejected her agreement finalised with European leaders last November three times, delaying Britain's original March 29 exit date and throwing the process into chaos.
Ahead of an EU summit on Wednesday, May was forced to ask for another extension, until June 30, to prevent the country crashing out the bloc next Friday.
However with European leaders growing increasingly impatient at the paralysis in Westminster, they could offer just a shorter postponement -- or a longer period of up to a year.
The other 27 EU nations must give unanimous backing to any deadline extension.
Hammond, who backed Remain in Britain's 2016 referendum and is seen as favouring as soft a Brexit as possible, urged his divided Conservative colleagues to show flexibility.
""We should be open to listen to suggestions that others have made and some people in the Labour Party are making other suggestions,"" he said.
Labour is pushing May to accept a much closer post-Brexit alliance with the EU that includes participation in a customs union.
The prime ministers has previously dismissed the idea because it bars Britain from striking its own trade deals with global giants such as China and the United States .
But after Brexit hardliners in her own party repeatedly refused to back her plan over fears it would keep the country too closely aligned with Europe , she last week turned to Labour -- infuriating many Conservatives.

CARACAS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) Venezuelan opposition is coordinating with allies the measures to prevent the exports of Venezuelan oil to Cuba , opposition leader Juan Guaido, who proclaimed himself country's interim president, said on Saturday.
On Friday, the United States sanctioned 34 vessels tied to the Venezuelan PDVSA oil company , controlled by the government of President Nicolas Maduro, and two companies that allegedly transport oil from Venezuela to Cuba . Moreover, a senior official from the administration of US President Donald Trump said the latest round of sanctions was introduced at the request of the Venezuelan opposition-led National Assembly .
""In coordination with our allies, we are taking measures to prevent the deliveries of oil belonging to Venezuelans to Cuba ,"" Guaido said on Twitter without naming the allies.
The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry strongly condemned the US move, noting that Caracas would respond to these sanctions in an appropriate legal way.
Venezuela has long been suffering from an acute economic crisis exacerbated by the US sanctions against the country.
In January , US-backed Guaido illegally declared himself interim president of Venezuela after disputing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's reelection in May . Washington immediately endorsed Guaido and called on Maduro to step down.
Maduro has accused the United States of trying to orchestrate a coup in order to install Guaido as a US puppet. Russia , China , Cuba , Bolivia , Turkey and a number of other countries have voiced their support for Maduro as the only legitimate president of Venezuela ."

Christchurch, New Zealand, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :The Canterbury Crusaders swamped the ACT Brumbies with a five-try second-half revival while an Israel Folau Super Rugby try-scoring record was not enough to stop a Blues victory over the NSW Waratahs on Saturday.
The table-topping Crusaders, returning to their home base for the first time since the Christchurch mosque massacres, came from 0-7 down at half-time to beat the Brumbies 36-14 in Christchurch .
Folau scored for the Waratahs midway through the first half against the Blues for his 60th try , eclipsing the previous record of 59 by New Zealander Doug Howlett who retired 12 years ago.
But it was the resurgent Blues who celebrated at the final whistle with a 32-29 victory to complete four consecutive wins for the first time since 2011.
The gunning down of 50 Muslims by an alleged white supremacist has forced the Crusaders to rethink its branding given the link to the medieval Crusades, and the familiar sword-wielding knights on horseback have been dropped from the pre-match entertainment.
But they retained their familiar ability to find an extra gear when under pressure to retain their position at the head of the table.
The penalties that blighted their first half -- when they conceded eight -- disappeared and they found the precision that was missing from their early play.
Captain Matt Todd said the first-half discipline ""was not good enough. They put us under a lot of pressure but we responded which was good.
""We were confident if we held the ball we could get points in the second half. "" The Brumbies, missing injured Wallaby flanker David Pocock and resting three other Wallabies had a game plan to rattle the Crusaders.
It worked for 40 minutes and they scored the only points in the first half with a converted try by Christian Lealiifano after Owen Franks, who led the Crusaders on to the field to mark his 150th game with the club, was yellow-carded for a dangerous tackle.
But the second 40 minutes was a different story, starting with the first of Sevu Reece's two tries three minutes after the restart.
Right wing Will Jordan also bagged a double with Jordan Taufua crossing the line as well before Tevita Kuridrani scored a late consolation try for the visitors.
The Blues had raced to a 17-0 lead with tries to Tom Robinson and Caleb Clarke and an Otere Black penalty when Folau swing the momentum the Waratahs' way with his try .
Will Miller scored just on half-time to close the gap to 17-14.
In the second half both sides cancelled each other out with TJ Faiane and Ma'a Nonu scoring for the Blues and Black adding a penalty while Alex Newsome and Jake Gordon scored for the Waratahs with a penalty from Bernard Foley.
Blues captain Patrick Tuipulotu said while four wins in a row was satisfying, letting a 17-point lead slip showed there is a lot of room for improvement.
""I'm proud of the way we came back in the last 10 (minutes) to hold them out. There's still plenty to work on if we want to get better,"" he said."

Truth always prevails: PM Imran after US rejects Indian claims of hitting F-16,www.urdupoint.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/truth-always-prevails-pm-imran-after-us-reje-587454.html,"Truth Always Prevails: PM Imran After US Rejects Indian Claims Of Hitting F-16 Mahnoor Sheikh (@mahnoorsheikh03) 14 hours ago Sat 06th April 2019 | 01:58 PM Taking to Twitter, the prime minister said that the truth always prevails and it is always the best policy.
Lahore (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News – 6th April, 2019) Prime Minister Imran Khan has reacted to the report by US publication that rubbished Indian claim of hitting Pakistan’s F-16.
Taking to Twitter , the prime minister said that the truth always prevails and it is always the best policy.
“The truth always prevails and is always the best policy. BJP's attempt to win elections through whipping up war hysteria and false claims of downing a Pak F 16 has backfired with US Defence officials also confirming that no F16 was missing from Pakistan 's fleet,” he wrote.
India's claim that its fighter pilot shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet in a dogfight in February is wrong, Foreign Policy, a prestigious American magazine, said in a report quoting US defense officials.
""Two senior US defence officials with direct knowledge of the situation told Foreign Policy that U.S. personnel recently counted Islamabad 's F-16s and found none missing,"" the magazine said in a report published on Thursday.
India had claimed that in an aerial duel on February 27 - a day after its war planes dropped bombs in Balakot that Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman had engaged with one of the Pakistani fighter jets that targeted Indian military facilities and shot it down before he was hit and forced to eject.
Varthaman was captured by Pakistan Army was returned to India amid attempts to de-escalate the crisis between the two sides.
The Indian Air Force had on February 28 displayed pieces of the AMRAAM missile, fired by a Pakistani F-16, as evidence. But that, by itself, does not offer any clues on whether Varthaman had shot down a Pakistan Air Force F-16, as has been repeatedly claimed by the government and the IAF.
According to the Foreign Policy magazine, Pakistan invited the United States to physically count its F-16 planes after the incident as part of an end-user agreement signed when the foreign military sale was finalized.
""A US count of Pakistan 's F-16 fleet has found that all the jets are present and accounted for, a direct contradiction to India 's claim that it shot down one of the fighter jets during a February clash,"" correspondent Lara Seligman of the magazine reported.
The count has been completed, and "" all aircraft were present and accounted for"", an American official is quoted as saying. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Bangkok (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 06th April, 2019) The leader of a new political party that did well in Thailand 's election last month has appeared at a police station to face charges of sedition.Scores of supporters greeted Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, the leader of Future Forward, at the Bangkok offices.Thanathorn says an allegation, from 2015 , that he aided a protest leader is politically motivated.The ruling military and an opposition coalition are both vying to form the next government following the polls.At 40, he is the young and charismatic head of the Future Forward Party, which has appealed strongly to young voters and opposes the military government , which has been in charge of Thailand since 2014.Future Forward did well in March 's election , finishing a strong third, gathering 6.2 million votes.It has since joined a ""democratic alliance "" to try to prevent the 2014 coup leader and current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha from staying in power.They date back to 2015 and allege Thanathorn gave assistance to the leader of anti-coup protesters, who violated laws on crowd gatherings.Thanathorn is accused of breaking three articles of the Thai criminal code and could face up to nine years in prison if found guilty.He could also be disqualified from parliament .The charges have been filed by an officer in the ruling government .Commenting on the delay in bringing the charges, police said there had been several reshuffles of personnel. Thanathorn is also facing a cybercrime charge for allegedly spreading false information.Earlier in the week he said the charges were politically motivated, adding: ""The dark influence will not leave Future Forward Party alone.""As he left the police station on Saturday, he asked: ""Why does this come a week after the election?""We believe in our innocence This isn't about me.
This is about everyone who fights for justice.""Scores of supporters, many wearing the party's orange colour, shouted slogans backing Thanathorn.They held up posters with the trending #SaveThanathorn hashtag and slogans such as ""end the age of the dinosaur"".The election results are not scheduled to be ratified until 9 May .Preliminary results suggest the party backing Gen Prayuth won the most popular votes, ahead of the Pheu Thai party, which is allied with exiled former PM Thaksin Shinawatra.But a complicated system of allocating seats in parliaments based on vote share , introduced by the military, means it remains unclear how many seats each party will ultimately have, hence the uncertainty on the next government .The Election Commission has been indicating that fewer seats than expected will be given to Future Forward and Thanathorn's supporters view the latest criminal charge against him as part of a wider campaign to keep his party out of power.
