Sen. Portman: 'Money is not enough' to fix the border crisis,www.foxnews.com,Victor Garcia,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-portman-money-is-not-enough-to-fix-the-border-crisis,"“Money is not enough because until you change the laws you&apos;ll continue to have this magnet, people come into United States,” Portman told guest host Sandra Smith . Portman laid out the asylum situation and how he said it is adding to the problems with illegal immigration.
“Here&apos;s the problem, Sandra. When someone comes (to the) United States and they&apos;re a family from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, they&apos;re being told by the traffickers, and it&apos;s true, you ask for asylum and then during the time at which you have to wait for your asylum hearing you&apos;re allowed to go into the United States into the community,” Portman said.
The senator added that around “85 percent” of those applying for asylum are turned down but that the process takes so long many disappear into the United States while the process is taking place.
Portman also reacted to President Trump speaking about family separation on the border and blaming his predecessor.
“The cages that were shown, very inappropriate, they were built by President Obama and the Obama administration –not by Trump,” Trump said Tuesday at the White House.
Portman supported Trump and once again noted it was up to Congress to enact change in order to solve these problems.
“I do not support separating the families but I do support changing that Flores decision so you can keep people in a family unit. That&apos;s the whole point. And that&apos;s what the president has called for. It requires a change in law. You can&apos;t just do it through executive action or more money,” Portman said.
“It&apos;s a change in the law to be able to say ‘well, Congress has looked at this. We&apos;ve decided this is not working.’”

NYC health officials warn against 'measles parties' amid biggest outbreak in decades,www.foxnews.com,Nicole Darrah,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/health/nyc-health-measles-parties-outbreak,"Such parties involve intentionally exposing unvaccinated children to other children with a disease, with the intent that they would get the disease themselves. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ""strongly recommends against hosting or participating in these events."" ""We are concerned about families having measles parties,"" New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said at a news conference, emphasizing that ""we live in a different world now.""
Rockland County, NY declares state of emergency following measles outbreak ""There are many more individuals who are living with chronic diseases, who are surviving cancer, and so we don&apos;t want children or adults to be unnecessarily exposed to measles"" due to ""measles parties,"" she told reporters.
The health order that was declared on Tuesday covers people who live in four ZIP codes in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, where more than 250 people have contracted measles since September.
All unvaccinated people in those areas who may have been exposed to the virus are required to get vaccinated, including children older than 6 months, according to the order. Those who didn’t get the vaccine or are not immune to the virus may be fined $1,000.
The health commissioner said that ""nearly all"" measles cases in New York City have been associated with the Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn, and the outbreak is the largest since 1991.
Barbot said that the majority of religious leaders in the large Orthodox communities support vaccination efforts, but that rates have remained low in some areas because of a resistance ""fueled by a small group of anti-vaxxers in these neighborhoods.""
Earlier this week, the city ordered religious schools and day care programs serving that community to exclude unvaccinated students or risk being closed down.
Video In the city alone, 285 cases have been confirmed — 246 of which have been in children. Barbot said that 21 people have been hospitalized, and five have ended up in the intensive care unit.
When questioned whether an order to vaccine people was legal, Mayor Bill de Blasio said yes, noting his office is ""absolutely certain we have the power to do this.""
The measles vaccine , which the CDC recommends children get two doses of, is 97 percent effective, according to health officials. Called MMR, it protects against measles, mumps and rubella.

"More than 100,000 migrants apprehended or turned away at border in March, CBP reveals",www.foxnews.com,Samuel Chamberlain,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/more-than-100000-migrants-apprehended-or-turned-away-at-border-in-march-cbp-reveals,"Immigration attorney: Congress has to act on border crisis More than 103,000 migrants were turned away from or apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border last month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced Tuesday, an increase of nearly 106 percent over the same period last year. In all, CBP said it apprehended 92,607 people, including 53,077 family units (a 45.3 percent increase over February) and 8,975 unaccompanied minors (a 31 percent increase over February). Another 10,885 migrants were deemed ""inadmissible"" by immigration authorities.
The total number of 103,492 apprehensions or rejections is the highest of any month over at least the past six years, topping February's mark of 76,535 apprehensions or rejections. The 92,607 apprehensions was the highest total since 91,566 migrants were apprehended in April 2008.
The numbers were made public hours after a top Border Patrol official told lawmakers that authorities has apprehended more families illegally crossing the border between October 2018 and February of this year than during all of the 2018 fiscal year (Oct. 1, 2017-Sept. 30, 2018).
""Much media attention has focused on caravans coming across from Central America,"" Rio Grande Valley Sector Chief Patrol Agent Rodolfo Karisch told the Senate Homeland Security Committee. ""But the fact is that RGV is receiving caravan-equivalent numbers every seven days."" Border Patrol official describes caravan-size influx of migrants arriving in his sector every week
The numbers were announced two days after the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in a shakeup orchestrated by President Trump, who has been frustrated by his administration's inability to stem the tide of migrants from Central America and other parts of the world. Karisch said Tuesday his sector has apprehended people from 50 different countries, including China, Bangladesh, Turkey, Egypt and Romania.
The president also abruptly pulled the nomination of Ron Vitiello to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) last week, saying he wanted to go “in a tougher direction.” National Border Patrol Council says McAleenan has a tough job ahead of him
Trump's choice to replace Nielsen as acting director, Kevin McAleenan, is a longtime CBP official who the president tweeted Sunday would do a ""fantastic job."" Trump also told reporters Tuesday that he was ""not looking"" to revive his administration's zero tolerance policy of separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border that caused an international uproar last year.
However, the president also noted that ""once you don't have [zero tolerance], that's why you see many more people coming. They're coming like it's a picnic because let's go to Disneyland.""

""Border Patrol continues to apprehend record numbers of people who purposely violate U.S. immigration laws, we are taken advantage of by gaps in our legal frameworks and that undermine the rule of laws.”

Both men have pushed back on the issue in the past.
Video The presidential hopeful from Vermont has refused to release his records before, as when he ran for the high office against Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Pressure has mounted on Sanders again, now that congressional Democrats have pushed for the release of six years of returns by Trump.
“Not being a billionaire, not having investments in Saudi Arabia, wherever he has investments, all over the world, mine will be a little bit more boring,” Sanders told The Times, attempting to draw a stark contrast between his returns and Trump&apos;s.
Sanders and his wife - they say they do their own taxes, without the help of an accountant - earned just over $205,000 in income in 2014, but in 2017, a year after he lost the Democratic nomination to Clinton, Sanders earned an estimated $1.06 million.
So how did the Democratic socialist join the ranks of those more affluent parties he&apos;s targeted most? Book sales, he says.
“I wrote a best-selling book,” he told The Times. “If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.”

'American Psycho' author Bret Easton Ellis wants 'apology' from media over Mueller report coverage,www.foxnews.com,Mariah Haas,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/american-psycho-author-bret-easton-ellis-wants-an-apology-from-media-over-mueller-report-coverage,"On his newest podcast , Ellis slammed the ""crazy dishonest press"" for ""misleading the country for the last two years,"" according to The Wrap. Late last month, Mueller&apos;s office handed its final report of its Russia investigation to the Department of Justice. The long-awaited report , according to a letter to Congress released at the time by Attorney General Bill Barr, concluded that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign. Mueller’s investigation, which was initially ordered to look into the 2016 election in 2017, went on for almost two years.
“I want to state that I am not a Republican, I am not a conservative, I am not part of the right wing, I did not vote for Trump, I am not part of the alt-right, I am not interested in politics,” Ellis began.
Video “Because I make fun of hysterical liberals — and why shouldn’t I?"" he continued. ""I live with one — as well as the crazy dishonest press, people think I am defending Trump. I don’t think it is about defending Trump at all, who I don’t care enough about, as much as it is about being lied to by the media.""
Ellis went on to say that ""there is no way to get around the fact that the mainstream media misled the country for the last two years.""
""Period,"" he noted. ""I’m not saying that as a conservative, or as a liberal. I’m saying it simply as a witness.”
“This was the dead-end result of the mass psychosis on the left, the dead-end of Trump derangement syndrome, that is alive and well in our country, especially in the media, and is making them all look like fools.
— Bret Easton Ellis Ellis added that the full Mueller report has not been made public yet. On Tuesday, Barr vowed to release a redacted version ""within a week,"" as he pushed back at Democrats blasting him for what they called his ""unacceptable"" handling of the initial summary.
“There can be horrible shocking things in it that will implicate everyone from Don Jr. to Ivanka to Jared to Kid Rock,"" Ellis said before demanding an apology from his ""friends"" who perpetuated ""that the Mueller report was definitely going to implicate Trump in collusion with Russia.""
""With that in mind, however, I would like an apology,” Ellis said. “From every one of my friends or acquaintances or anyone I encountered on social media or watched blather away on TV for the last two years who insisted that the Mueller report was definitely going to implicate Trump in collusion with Russia, and will determine that the Russians stole the 2016 election away from Hillary Clinton and our whole national nightmare will finally be over, because the Mueller report will implicate Trump and he will be impeached. I want an apology.”
“But I’m not going to get an apology,"" he lamented, per The Wrap. ""Because y’all is f--ing crazy.""

Gutfeld on MSNBC saying Trump is guilty of workplace violence,www.foxnews.com,Greg Gutfeld,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gutfeld-on-msnbc-saying-trump-is-guilty-of-workplace-violence,"OPINION Published 18 hours ago Gutfeld on MSNBC saying Trump is guilty of workplace violence By Greg Gutfeld | Fox News Facebook Twitter Flipboard Comments Print Email According to the hair-on-fire media out there chasing ambulances down Pennsylvania Avenue, there&apos;s been a report of workplace violence in a large white residence.
Commenting on President Trump firing officials at the Homeland Security Departmen t, a guest on MSNBC said: “What we talked about was a possible analogy between what we’re seeing in the president and studies of violence and acting out, particularly workplace violence.... The question we have to ask ourselves, from a behavioral sense, is are we watching a president essentially on his way to what we call a flash point, and are we beginning to see him act out in the form of purging and mass firing and completely not listening to any logic?
“Are we essentially watching a workplace violence incident play out at the highest level of our government, and is he acting out now, and where does this go if I’m right about that?”
That might be the most insane thing ever said on MSNBC – and they employ Chris Matthews.
You wonder why America thinks the media is less trustworthy than lawn darts? It’s because the media seriously entertain ideas like that. Firing someone is now workplace violence.
Maybe it feels like that for nonskilled people in the media, who know they can’t be employed anywhere else, except maybe a carnival dunk tank. They never get fired, they only fail up the primetime lineup. Until they get jobs running CNN.
Yet these are the same clowns who lied that President Trump called immigrants “animals,” when he was talking about the MS-13 criminal gang.
How predictable: these goofs were more offended over calling killer thugs ""animals"" than by the acts by the gangs themselves. But that’s the media&apos;s way of operating. Everything is a crisis, except the actual crisis.
We&apos;ve all had a friend who – when the booze ran out at a party – would drink from abandoned cups and polish off the Listerine.
That&apos;s the media. With the collusion keg empty, they&apos;re now desperately looking for anything to numb the pain.
So we’re back to President Trump’s personality. He&apos;s mean! Unstable! When he doesn&apos;t like a situation, he changes it! Did you hear? He fires people!
I once worked for somebody like that. In fact, she fired me. But that’s what bosses do in the real world. The real world. The media should check it out sometime. It’s really the only show in town and they can&apos;t stand it, because they wouldn’t last a minute.

"Man, 80, charged in 1973 killings of women in beach cottage",www.foxnews.com,BEN FINLEY,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/man-80-charged-in-1973-killings-of-women-in-beach-cottage,"Email NORFOLK, Va. – An 80-year-old New York man has been arrested on charges that he killed two young women in a beach cottage nearly half a century ago in Virginia, police said Tuesday. Ernest Broadnax was arrested in New York City on Monday and faces two counts of second-degree murder and one count of rape in Virginia Beach. The slayings occurred in the summer of 1973.
Virginia Beach police did not say how they linked Broadnax to the killings. They said their cold-case unit began to pursue a ""strong lead"" last year and sought out ""advanced forensic technology.""
Broadnax, who lives in New York City's Queens borough, is waiting to go through extradition in New York, police said. It's unclear if he has an attorney.
For decades, the case haunted the coastal city in Virginia and the officers who launched the investigation.
Friends Janice Pietropola and Lynn Seethaler were from the Pittsburgh area and had rented a cottage about a block from the Atlantic Ocean.
Concerned when the two 19-year-olds missed their checkout time, an employee opened the door of their rented cottage, peered inside and discovered their bodies.
Pietropola was shot three times in the right side of the head with a .22-caliber gun. She also was raped and strangled.
Seethaler was shot twice in the right side of the head and face. Her neck was slashed with a wine bottle, and she also was strangled.
Every available detective was put on the case. There were hundreds of interviews and thousands of communiques with police elsewhere.
""We did everything we could,"" then-police Capt. William Haden told The Associated Press in 1998. ""We flew in the helicopter, we searched rooftops, we climbed into manholes.""
During their week in Virginia, Seethaler and Pietropola met several men on the beach and had gone on dates. On two occasions, they invited some of their new acquaintances back to the cottage for beers.
The contents of the women's purses had been dumped on the cottage floor, but robbery never was considered a motive.
Police didn't know if the killer knew the women, or if the victims were picked at random.
For Haden, the case became personal. The crime happened on his 31st birthday, and he said he felt as if the young women's parents had entrusted their daughters to his care.
More than a decade after the killings, Haden flew to Los Angeles to investigate two suspects arrested on an unrelated crime whose names had surfaced in the Virginia Beach investigation. But he couldn't connect them to the slayings.
""I have always referred to them as 'my girls,'"" he said in 1998. ""I still don't know why this case was so personal. There is no way I can describe that to you.""
Virginia Beach police said in their statement Tuesday that they never gave up. The cold case unit began ""aggressively researching"" a strong lead that came in last fall.
They enlisted help from various law enforcement agencies, ranging from the FBI and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to units within the New York Police Department.
""Their dedication and tenacity paid off,"" Virginia Beach police said. Trending in US"

Rainbolt-Forbes didn&apos;t name Boren, but his attorneys have confirmed he was the target of the probe. ""We are satisfied that the investigation by Jones Day was fair, non-biased, thorough and objective,"" Rainbolt-Forbes said. ""We consider this is a very serious matter, and we will carefully consider what we learned today, and we will respond in a timely and prompt manner in accordance with the university&apos;s existing policies and procedures.""
Former OU student Jess Eddy has claimed Boren made unwanted sexual advances and touched him inappropriately on several occasions when he worked as a teaching aide for the former Oklahoma governor and U.S. senator more than a decade ago. Boren, through his attorneys, has denied wrongdoing.
Eddy appeared at Tuesday&apos;s meeting and told reporters he believes the university doesn&apos;t intend to adequately investigate his claims.
""I have no confidence in Jones Day or the university,"" Eddy said.
Eddy previously acknowledged in an interview The Associated Press that he first denied the allegations to Jones Day investigators during a meeting in February and provided a signed statement to Boren&apos;s attorney on March 14 again denying the claims. But he said he later decided to publicly acknowledge that the allegations were true after he ""started to realize the implications of what I was doing by concealing my truth.""
""Thinking that there might be others like me began to just haunt me,"" he said.
Eddy also acknowledged calling Boren personally and asking for financial compensation.
Boren&apos;s attorney Clark Brewster said Eddy&apos;s inconsistent statements and attempt to seek money from Boren harm his credibility.
""We&apos;ve been fully cooperative and transparent, and obviously I&apos;m not privy to the (Jones Day) report that was generated based on their interviews and investigation, but I&apos;m confident that President Boren was not engaging in any inappropriate conduct,"" Brewster said.
Brewster said he&apos;s unaware of any other person who has made allegations of sexual misconduct against Boren.

FILE - In this Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2017 file photo, U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi, center-right, visits a hospital as he tours Dadaab refugee camp, hosting over 230,000 inhabitants, in northern Kenya. An internal United Nations document obtained by The Associated Press on Friday, March 29, 2019 says Kenya again seeks to close the Dadaab camp that hosts more than 200,000 refugees from neighboring Somalia. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis, File) UNITED NATIONS – The U.N. refugee chief said Tuesday he has never seen ""such toxicity, such poison"" in politics, the media, social media and every day conversation focused on refugees, migrants and foreigners. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said the March 15 attack on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand that killed 50 Muslim worshippers was the result ""of that toxic language of politics.""
Grandi urged countries everywhere to take ""a leaf from the exemplary response of the people and the leadership of New Zealand"" in responding to the ""toxic trends"" by restating the values that underpin global solidarity and ""reaffirm that our societies will not be really prosperous, stable and peaceful if they do not include all.""
An Australian white supremacist, Brenton Harrison Tarrant, who has been charged with the mosque killings which included many immigrants, livestreamed the shootings and sent out a lengthy manifesto. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said the world has been stuck in a vicious cycle of extremism which must end, and she will never utter his name and give his views the oxygen he wanted.
Grandi told the Security Council ""there is unprecedented stigmatization of refugees and migrants,"" and responses are increasingly inadequate.
He said he has worked with refugees for over three decades and has seen ""much solidarity, even heroism in some of the responses that are provided on the ground"" to help them.
And ""that solidarity is still very strong"" in many parts of the world, from African villages to the border between Bangladesh and Myanmar, to communities in Latin American helping Venezuelans, Grandi said.
""But also in these 3 1/2 decades I have never seen such toxicity, such poison in the language of politics, in media, in social media, even in everyday discussions and conversations around this issue — toxicity that focuses sadly, tragically, often, on refugees, on migrants, on foreigners,"" he said. ""That should be of concern to us all.""
Grandi added that ""many politicians believe that — and I think they are proven right — that doing this expands their consensus.""
But he said this is wrong and unfair to people ""that are fleeing because they seek safety from war, from persecution.""
He said the mosque attacks in New Zealand showed this has become an issue of security and stability for all countries — and governments need to address the issue of language on social media and in politics.
""It is an issue if left unchecked may have very grave consequences, not only for our work but for the world in general,"" Grandi warned. Trending in World"

Barr, the editor told Baier as a member of the panel, has ""done everything by the book."" This, in contrast to Comey, who he said ""went ahead and inserted himself into the public sphere with his announcements about the investigations.""
“He has done exactly what one would expect from someone who follows the book.”
Barr testified before a congressional panel on Capitol Hill on Tuesday in his first appearance since releasing a four-page summary of Special Counsel Robert Mueller&apos;s Russia investigation. Despite the Democratic criticism, he said his office is hard at work preparing to release the report (with redactions) “within a week.”
House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., accused Barr of seeming to ""cherry pick"" from the report to ""draw the most favorable conclusion possible for the president"" during her opening statement.
Other Democrats made similar comments as Barr appeared before the House Appropriations Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee for a hearing originally meant to address Barr’s fiscal 2020 spending request for the Justice Department.

But Trump chose Kevin McAleenan, the head of Customs and Border Protection, as acting secretary. That meant Grady had to resign or be fired.

Sources told Fox News on Monday that Alles was notified 10 days ago to ""prepare an exit plan,"" in a signal that a transition in leadership at Homeland Security was imminent.
Trump has long signaled his displeasure with the rising number of illegal immigrants attempting to enter the country.

The agency said Tuesday that it apprehended 92,607 people at the U.S.-Mexico border in March.
Just over 53,000 of the people apprehended were parents and children traveling together, which the Border Patrol refers to as ""family units."" That breaks a record set in February, when the agency apprehended 36,000 parents and children. Another 8,975 were children traveling alone.
The large numbers of families have forced many line agents into humanitarian roles and have strained detention facilities built when the Border Patrol primarily apprehended single adult men.

He also spoke about America's immigration situation, saying that sending troops to the southern border is not an unprecedented mission. In an exclusive interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier on Tuesday, Shanahan seemed to echo President Trump's sentiment that the biggest threat America faces is the modernization of China.
“China is a threat economically and diplomatically. I think it's time we address some of these issues -- militarization of the South China Sea, the Communist Chinese Party launching cyberattacks against the U.S., theft of intellectual property, and a significant expansion of military capability.”

He also called circumstances at the border -- scene of surging numbers of asylum seekers and migrants -- as an “emergency” that calls for some focused conversation.
“I saw a lot of intensity to solve a problem, that's not tension,"" he said. ""This is a very focused effort. The border is a serious situation.”
Shanahan said it isn’t unusual that the president would ask for troops to be sent to the southern border. He noted that the two previous administrations had similar arrangements: “This isn’t a new one.”

“They gave the ultimate sacrifice for which we can never repay,” he said, offering his condolences. “We’re at war. What you see are the casualties of war. In parallel, there is a peace negotiation process, and probably the best possibility of peace in 40 years is at hand.”
Shanahan said that the DOD is exercising the “South Asia Strategy,” which requires peace talks with the Taliban to work. Video

Capri Cafaro: Tim Ryan is the 2020 Democrat that Republicans should worry about,www.foxnews.com,Capri Cafaro,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/capri-cafaro-tim-ryan-is-the-2020-democrat-that-republicans-should-worry-about,"Democratic Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan introduced himself to the nation on the daytime talk show, ""The View."" He followed his public announcement with a rally in his congressional district and an obligatory appearance on one of the Sunday shows. I’m sure there are some out there who are rolling their eyes at the prospect of yet another candidate in an already crowded Democratic primary. Even more are probably asking, “Who is Tim Ryan and why should I care?”
Tim Ryan is my congressman, and you should care because he is one of the few Democrats, if not the only one, who has a real shot taking on President Trump in a general election. I have known Tim Ryan for the better part of two decades. We are from the same county and both served our community — four years apart — in the same state Senate seat.
Before I go any further, I want to make some things very clear. Tim Ryan did not ask me to write this article. We have not discussed what I would say in this column. I did alert him to the fact that I was planning to write a piece on his presidential bid. That’s as far as it goes. So I want you to know this article is not some inside job set up by the Ryan camp. It also has nothing to do with any future political aspirations some think I have. I am simply stating my views about a candidate who I think can win and why.
Ryan has been the underdog throughout his political career. He won a seat in the state Senate by beating much more well-known and established candidates. His success was built on sheer sweat equity — by going door to door and developing a grassroots movement from scratch.
A few years later, Ryan beat a long-time incumbent for a congressional seat that changed due to redistricting. No one thought a kid under 30 was going to beat a seasoned member of Congress, but he did. Ryan’s underdog story can similarly propel him to defy the odds on the national stage.
What makes Ryan different from the rest of the Democratic field? He grew up in the heart of the American industrial Midwest. He represents communities in northeastern Ohio that voted Democrat for generations — until Donald Trump came along. Unlike many candidates who are veering to the far left, Ryan understands that the economy, education and health care are the issues that drive heartland voters.
From the first interviews of his presidential campaign, Ryan has been speaking out about the perils of China, the need to reform trade, and to invest in reinvigorating communities that have been left behind. On CBS’ ""Face The Nation,"" Ryan noted that such revitalization efforts would need a balanced partnership between the public and private sector.
A well-executed 50 state delegate strategy could spell primary victory for Ryan.
Tim is an approachable, straight-talking former football star turned public servant. Tim could be your brother, your neighbor, or your kid’s coach. He is also quick to tell you about his yoga practice and commitment to mindfulness.
In some ways, Tim Ryan is the Gen X answer to Joe Biden. He can connect with working men and women in a genuine way while understanding the nuances of 21st century American culture, politics and economic innovation. Ryan can connect with our roots while embracing our future.
Over the last few months, Democrats have gone through love affairs with a variety of presidential hopefuls, from Kamala Harris to Beto O’Rourke. I happen to think this crowded Democratic primary plays to Tim Ryan’s advantage. With so many candidates occupying the progressive corner of the party, it opens up an opportunity for someone more moderate to consolidate votes and campaign contributions from across the country — while the progressives are competing over the same slice of electoral pie. A well-executed 50 state delegate strategy could spell primary victory for Ryan.
Ryan is the Democrat best positioned to beat Trump because he is young, from the Midwest and able to win with Democrats who voted for Trump in 2016. And the GOP is already showing signs of concern about Ryan. The Republican National Committee wasted no time to take shots at him, calling Ryan a “backbencher … who has no chance of becoming president.”
It sounds like Ryan becoming president is exactly what Republicans are worried about.

"Barr assembles 'team' to look into counterintelligence investigation on Trump campaign in 2016, official says",www.foxnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-assembles-team-to-look-into-counterintelligence-investigation-on-trump-campaign-in-2016-official-says,"Last Update 10 hours ago Barr assembles 'team' to look into counterintelligence investigation on Trump campaign in 2016, official says Attorney General Barr says he will release a redacted version of the Mueller report Barr testifies as Mueller report release approaches; Catherine Herridge reports from Capitol Hill. Attorney General William Barr has assembled a ""team"" to investigate the origins of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, an administration official briefed on the situation told Fox News on Tuesday. Republicans repeatedly have called for a thorough investigation of the FBI's intelligence practices and the basis of the since-discredited Russian collusion narrative following the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe -- and they now appear to have assurances that a comprehensive review was underway.
The FBI's July 2016 counterintelligence investigation was formally opened by anti-Trump former FBI agent Peter Strzok. Ex-FBI counsel Lisa Page, with whom Strzok was romantically involved , revealed during a closed-door congressional interview that the FBI “knew so little” about whether allegations against the Trump campaign were “true or not true” at the time they opened the probe, noting they had just “a paucity of evidence because we are just starting down the path” of vetting the allegations.
GOHMERT UNLOADS ON 'SMIRKING' STRZOK, ASKS IF HE LIED TO CONGRESS LIKE HE LIED TO HIS WIFE WHILE CHEATING ON HER
Page later said that it was “entirely common” that the FBI would begin a counterintelligence investigation with just a “small amount of evidence.”
Former FBI Director James Comey would testify later that when agency initiated its counterintelligence probe into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government, investigators ""didn't know whether we had anything"" and that ""in fact, when I was fired as director [in May 2017], I still didn't know whether there was anything to it.""

Barr told lawmakers at a contentious hearing earlier Tuesday that he was reviewing the bureau's “conduct” in particular during the summer of 2016. The attorney general's explosive testimony marked his first Capitol Hill appearance since he revealed the central findings of Mueller’s investigation, and he indicated the full report -- with redactions -- would be made public within the week.
Mueller's investigation completed last month without securing the indictment of a single American for collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice, ""despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.""
“I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016,” Barr said at the hearing.
FBI BLAMES SYSTEM-WIDE SOFTWARE FAILURE FOR MISSING STRZOK TEXTS; STRZOK'S MUELLER PHONE TOTALLY WIPED
Barr also was questioned about the initial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants approved to surveil members of the Trump campaign, including former Trump aide Carter Page.
Republicans have called for a careful review as to whether the FBI, in violation of Page's constitutional rights and FBI procedures, misled the FISA court or withheld exculpatory information, and Barr testified that a DOJ review of the FBI's FISA practices was in progress.
The FBI's ultimately successful October 2016 warrant application to surveil Page, which relied in part on information from British ex-spy Christopher Steele – whose anti-Trump views are now well-documented – flatly accused Page of conspiring with Russians. Page has never been charged with any wrongdoing, and he since has sued the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for defamation. President Trump vows to release FISA documents
What could we learn from them? Republican strategist Ned Ryun weighs in.
The FBI assured the FISA court on numerous occasions -- in the October 2016 warrant application and in subsequent renewals -- that other sources, including a Yahoo News article, independently corroborated Steele's claims, without evidence to back it up. It later emerged that Steele was also the source of the Yahoo News article, written by reporter Michael Isikoff.
The FBI also quoted directly from a disputed Washington Post opinion piece to argue that Trump's views on providing lethal arms to Ukraine, and working towards better relations with Russia, was a possible indicator that the campaign had been compromised.
The Trump campaign, at the time, supported only providing only defensive arms to Ukrainians, and rejected a single Republican delegate's proposed platform amendment that called for providing lethal arms. Later, the Trump administration changed course and approved lethal arms sales to Ukraine.
The FBI did not provide its own independent assessment of whether the Washington Post opinion piece contained accurate information, and did not mention that the Obama administration had the same policy towards arming Ukraine as the one Trump's team supported.
The FBI also did not clearly state that Steele worked for a firm hired by Hillary Clinton's campaign. Instead, the FBI only indicated that Steele's dossier was prepared in conjunction with a presidential campaign.
TRUMP VOWS TO DECLASSIFY, RELEASE FISA DOCS, RELATED MATERIALS NOW THAT MUELLER PROBE IS OVER
Fox News exclusively obtained internal FBI text messages last month showing that just nine days before the FBI applied for the Page FISA warrant, bureau officials were battling with a senior Justice Department official who had ""continued concerns"" about the ""possible bias"" of a source pivotal to the application.

Fox News also has been told the Justice Department's Inspector General (IG) was looking separately into whether Comey mishandled classified information by including a variety of sensitive matters in his private memos.
A DOJ court filing on Monday night revealed that Comey incorporated into his private documents, among other key details, the name and code name of a confidential human source.

"Jobs, caste and giveaways: Indian voters go to the polls",www.foxnews.com,ASHOK SHARMA,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/jobs-caste-and-giveaways-indian-voters-go-to-the-polls,"The last time the BJP sought a second term was 2004, when it spent millions on an ad blitz projecting India as an economic powerhouse. The voters didn&apos;t buy it. Election results showed that people voted according to their caste, an ancient hierarchy in India that is outlawed by the constitution but still vital in Indian politics.
Hindus comprise about 80% of India&apos;s 1.3 billion people, so the BJP is invoking its Hindu nationalist roots, with Modi at the forefront against the threat of Pakistan, India&apos;s Muslim-majority archrival.
Voting will take place in seven phases over six weeks beginning Thursday. Nearly 900 million people, including 15.9 million first-time voters, are eligible to cast ballots in the world&apos;s largest democratic exercise. Around a million polling stations will be set up, and voters will choose 543 members of the Lower House of Parliament.
A look at some of the key election issues and factors:
___
JOBS
Even though India continues to be one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, the Modi-led government&apos;s performance on the economy has come under criticism.
A November 2016 demonetization program aimed to curb black market money by taking some rupee notes out of circulation. But it ultimately hurt the poor, and India&apos;s central bank said later that most of the illicit funds had re-entered the banking system.
According to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy, employment contracted in the year following demonetization by 3.5 million jobs. The think tank said unemployment reached 7.4% in December 2018, its highest rate in more than two years.
Public subsidies to farmers have failed to steady India&apos;s agricultural sector.
The first item in the opposition Congress party&apos;s election manifesto describes a plan for creating jobs. It also promises an income subsidy program for the poorest families and for farmers.
___
KASHMIR
Amid growing scrutiny of Modi&apos;s economic record, a suicide attack in Kashmir killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers in February, helping the BJP hone its nationalist pitch.
Analysts say Indian airstrikes inside Pakistan in response to the attack gave Modi a pre-election boost. BJP leaders quickly made national security a central plank of their campaign.
In northern parts of the country bordering Pakistan, anti-Pakistan sentiment has always been strong because of the bloodshed during the countries&apos; partition in 1947 and three wars since then.
But anti-Muslim sentiment in India has become more common and more violent since the BJP came to power in 2014. At least three dozen Muslims have been lynched by self-styled Hindu vigilante groups or mobs on suspicion of illegally moving cows, sacred to Hindus, or eating beef, according to Human Rights Watch.
___
CASTE
The BJP is mainly supported by upper-caste Hindus, while struggling to make headway with lower-caste voters and non-Hindus.
Successive governments have sought to redress discrimination against those on the lower rungs by setting up quotas for government jobs and university spots.
Currently, just under half of all government jobs and places in state-funded schools are allocated to the lower castes.
With an eye toward elections, Modi&apos;s government last year passed a law carving out 10% quotas for lower-income Indians belonging to higher castes.
___
POLITICAL PUZZLE
Modi has been on an electoral blitzkrieg across this vast country, promoting government development projects while blasting the alleged corruption within the opposition Congress party, a dynasty that began with India&apos;s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.
Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi ruled the country for about a half a century after India won independence from Britain in 1947. Rajiv Gandhi&apos;s son, Rahul Gandhi, is now the Congress party leader and a potential candidate for prime minister if the opposition can stitch an alliance to stop the Modi juggernaut.
That&apos;s easier said than done. Despite Congress victories in three key state elections in December, bucking a string of losses to the BJP since 2014, Gandhi has struggled to marshal widespread support for his beleaguered party, even after bringing his popular sister, Priyanka Gandhi, into the fold.
The Gandhis would have to unite the opposition in order to take on BJP candidates in the vote-rich states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Delhi. A split in opposition votes would likely benefit the BJP.
___
GIVEAWAYS
Giveaways are essential in Indian politics.
Some 270 million people — roughly 22% of the country&apos;s population — live in poverty, making giveaways particularly attractive to voters.
In the past, farmworkers were offered cows and goats.
In its interim budget in January, the Modi-led government announced that farmers would be paid 6,000 rupees ($85) annually, benefiting as many as 120 million households.
The Congress party waived farmers&apos; bank loans in the three states it won in December. It promised in its election manifesto to waive outstanding farmer loans elsewhere, and to decriminalize farmer loan defaults.
___
SYMBOLS
A ladder, hand pump, bicycle, bow and arrow, bungalow, book, mango and banana are just some of the many objects voters will see on their electronic ballots, symbols of the dozens of political parties and independent candidates in the fray.
Since only about a fifth of India&apos;s population could read or write at the time of the country&apos;s first election in 1951, the symbols were introduced on ballot papers to help the unlettered cast their votes.
Nearly three-quarters of Indians can now read, but the icons remain evocative political symbols.
Among the best-known symbols are the lotus flower for the governing BJP, and the outstretched palm-facing hand for Congress.
The Aam Aadmi Party, or the Common Man&apos;s Party, which rules the state of Delhi, chose a broom as its election symbol, reflecting its pledge to sweep the political system clean of corruption.

"Leslie Marshall: Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez are in a power struggle, with Pelosi winning News",www.foxnews.com,Leslie Marshall,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/leslie-marshall-pelosi-and-ocasio-cortez-are-in-a-power-struggle-with-pelosi-winning,"While Pelosi is a practical politician looking to pass legislation that can become law, Ocasio- Cortez seems more interested in advocating revolutionary changes that can excite those on the far left – but have no chance of becoming law. In an interview published Monday in USA Today , Pelosi didn’t criticize Ocasio-Cortez by name, but it was obvious who the speaker was referring to her when Pelosi said: “While there are people who have a large number of Twitter followers, what&apos;s important is that we have large numbers of votes on the floor of the House.”
USA Today also Quote: d Pelosi as saying: “I’m a progressive from San Francisco. I think I can have some credentials on the left, as a person who has represented a very liberal city. But you have to govern mainstream.”
Ocasio-Cortez, a freshman House member who calls herself a socialist and represents part of New York City, has nearly 4 million Twitter followers. She’s been the focus of an enormous amount of media attention and received both praise and criticism for her advocacy of radical positions, such as supporting big tax increases for the wealthy and massive new government programs.
One of the programs Ocasio-Cortez has called for is the Green New Deal, which would dramatically alter American society in an effort to reduce climate change and income inequality.
The Green New Deal calls for ending the use of oil, natural gas and coal to produce energy in 10 years; creating a single-payer health care system for everyone in the U.S.; guaranteeing everyone who wants to work a federal job; providing a guaranteed income even to people “unwilling to work;” providing universal access to healthful foods; upgrading every home and commercial building in the nation for energy efficiency; tuition-free public colleges; and other actions.
Pelosi is 79 and nearing the end of her long career. Ocasio-Cortez is only 29 – young enough to be Pelosi’s granddaughter – and is just beginning what seems to be a very bright (and potentially long) political future.
Critics say the Green New Deal would be impossible to achieve and unaffordable, costing as much as $93 trillion – or the equivalent of $600,000 for every U.S. household.
At the start of the current congressional session in January, it seemed that Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez were going to be sisters-in-arms, fighting for the Democratic agenda and against President Trump. The strong women shared the cover of Rolling Stone magazine with smiles on their faces. And Ocasio-Cortez cast her vote for Pelosi to become speaker of the House.
But what has transpired since seems to be a power struggle between two women with two entirely different backgrounds and two very different political styles.
Pelosi is 79 and nearing the end of her long career. Ocasio-Cortez is only 29 – young enough to be Pelosi’s granddaughter – and is just beginning what seems to be a very bright (and potentially long) political future. She’s too young to run for president, but her most enthusiastic supporters have called for her candidacy once she hits the minimum age of 35 to be eligible to hold our nation’s highest office.
One could argue that Pelosi is looking at what she and the Democratic-controlled House can accomplish in the short-term, helping to secure her legacy. In contrast, Ocasio-Cortez is looking at far-reaching ideas to transform America in the long run. In other words, Pelosi is concerned with today, Ocasio-Cortez with tomorrow.
For those keeping score, Pelosi – with the power of the speakership – has been winning the battles between her mainstream Democrats and Ocasio-Cortez’s smaller socialist faction of the party. Sometimes it seems like Pelosi is the adult in the room, schooling the newcomer as to how things are done in Washington.
Let’s take a look at the Green New Deal. Although Ocasio-Cortez proposed it, she must realize it has little chance of approval even in the Democratic-controlled House, and no chance of approval in the Republican-controlled Senate. And to no one’s surprise, President Trump has made clear that he opposes it.
Pelosi is clearly a strong believer in the old saying that “politics in the art of the possible.” She understands that the Green New Deal is not only too ambitious to become law but faces too many hurdles to be funded and implemented.
And Ocasio-Cortez has at times acted more like an outsider protesting the status quo than an insider elected to pass legislation. Last November – after she was elected but before she took her House seat – she joined environmental activists storming Pelosi’s office and live-streaming the event. Pelosi calmly said she supported the enthusiasm of the demonstrators, but clearly stood her ground.
Ocasio-Cortez stood down. And when Pelosi put together a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, she selected Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., to lead it. Ocasio-Cortez isn’t even on the committee, which will consider legislation dealing with climate change.
Pelosi has proven for decades that she an extraordinarily skilled negotiator and legislative tactician. She has earned respect from leaders in both parties, including President Trump, who we caught kissing her on the cheek after their most recent meeting.
And while Ocasio-Cortez is focused on far-left ideological purity in the Democratic Party – she was elected by defeating a veteran mainstream Democratic House member in a primary – Pelosi is focused on ensuring Democrats keep majority control of the House with as many seats as possible. That means Pelosi will support Democratic moderates who can win in districts that voted for Trump in the presidential election.
For now, Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez can coexist in the Democratic Party. But in the 2020 general election the two will have to learn how to unite – not only on issues, but in support of candidates who can win.
Without unity among Democrats – in the center, left and far left – Democrats could face a repeat of the 2016 election, when Republican Trump captured the White House and Republicans kept majority control of both the House and Senate. That’s the last thing any Democrat should want to see.

Tukwila Police released footage Tuesday that showed the moment when Tom and Linda Cook’s Ford Edge was struck by the wooden utility pole with live wires.
Police responded to the emergency call Friday at around 3:50 p.m. that the vehicle was struck by a powerline. First responders had to wait about an hour to pull the Cooks from the SUV because they had to wait for the power to be turned off.

“Just by looking at the damage to the vehicle on scene, it appeared that the injuries would be serious and or even fatal,” Tukwila Police said in a statement.
""Seeing the photos of the vehicle, if I had seen those photos as a bystander or after the fact and I looked at the photos, I would have said somebody died in the car,"" Tom Cook told KOMO-TV.
Two people were trapped in the SUV for about an hour after several power poles came crashing down on East Marginal Way on Friday, according to Tukwila police. (Ellen M. Banner/The Seattle Times via AP)
“The firefighters said... had it hit to the left or the right, it would have come down on one of us.""
The two were rushed to a nearby hospital where they were treated for minor cuts and bruises and released that same night.
Seattle City Light later revealed that 26 utility poles came down on Friday, affecting approximately 16,500 people. Those poles had last been inspected in 2016 and none were identified as “posing a public safety hazard” at the time.

Red Cross visits to Venezuela jails include military prisons,www.foxnews.com,JOSHUA GOODMAN and JAMEY KEATEN,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/red-cross-visits-to-venezuela-jails-include-military-prisons,"The fact that the visits include military prisons, which hadn&apos;t been previously reported, was confirmed to The Associated Press by a human rights lawyer and family members of those detained. International Red Cross President Peter Maurer on Wednesday wraps up a five-day visit to Venezuela, where the Geneva-based group is among international organizations trying to carve out a space to deliver badly needed humanitarian aid and technical assistance free of the winner-take-all politics contributing to the country&apos;s turmoil.
Red Cross representatives visit prisons every year in more than 100 countries, following an established protocol allowing it to verify conditions of confinement and hold private conversations with inmates in which they can voice complaints and send messages to loved ones.
But the group had been denied access in Venezuela at least since 2012.
The renewed visits in Venezuela began March 11 when a Red Cross delegation visited a model prison in Caracas, the Simon Bolivar Center for the Formation of New Men. Eighty-seven foreigners are being held.
But more significant was the visit two weeks later to the military-run Ramo Verde prison outside Caracas, which holds 69 people the opposition considers political prisoners.
Sandra Hernandez, whose husband, Sgt. Luis Figueroa, has been jailed at Ramo Verde since January for leading a military uprising against Maduro, was present last week when a white-colored vehicle emblazoned with the international Red Cross&apos; logo pulled up to the prison entrance.
She was there for her once-a-week visit, delivering basic staples — pasta, rice and cheese — that have become harder to afford since she was fired from her $7-a-month job as a teacher in what she said was retaliation for her husband&apos;s opposition to the government.
She said that if not for remittances sent by a relative in Spain, her husband could starve on the scant rations provided by prison authorities.
While her husband told her he wasn&apos;t among the small group of prisoners allowed to speak with the Red Cross representatives, she was hopeful the visit would help improve dire conditions for all inmates, many of whom she said are suffering from lack of medical attention and claim to have been tortured. The AP was unable to independently verify those claims.
""It&apos;s very important they talk to prisoners and see firsthand what&apos;s happening inside,"" she said.
Red Cross officials declined to comment and the group has made little mention of the prison visits, saying only in a Tweet that it had begun visiting jails under the auspices of civilian penitentiary authorities. It made no mention of the visits to the military-run facilities. The organization commonly avoids describing such visits except in a ""confidential dialogue"" with officials
Prisons Minister Iris Varela has said the visit to the civilian facility, and others to come, were part of an effort to share with the world Venezuela&apos;s positive experience rehabilitating inmates.
Left unsaid by both sides was that the Red Cross had also secured access to military detention facilities.
The majority of people held at the Ramo Verde are military personnel accused of plotting to overthrow Maduro. Many more, including five oil executives with U.S. passports, are being held in the basement jail of the military counterintelligence headquarters in the capital.
""This is an important first step, but make no mistake, it&apos;s also an attempt by Maduro to gain legitimacy with the international community,"" said Alfredo Romero, a human rights lawyer who was told of the Red Cross visit by prison workers when trying to visit clients at Ramo Verde. ""It&apos;s not in itself going to change the government&apos;s willingness to improve conditions.""
A senior government official played down the significance of the Red Cross visits, describing them as part of a broader push to work more closely with several international agencies, including the World Food Program and the Pan American Health Organization. The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to lack of authorization to discuss those talks publicly.
The international Red Cross&apos; sister organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, recently said it had received a waiver from Maduro to deliver aid to some 650,000 people in Venezuela beginning this month. Maduro has long denied a humanitarian crisis, considering aid offers a ""Trojan horse"" to pave the way for a foreign military intervention.
Similarly, opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who is recognized by 50 nations as Venezuela&apos;s rightful leader, has tried to control the distribution of U.S.-supplied aid in a bid to weaken Maduro&apos;s grip on power.
In another attempt to counter growing criticism, Maduro last month welcomed a delegation sent by the United Nations&apos; High Commissioner for Human Rights. He previously had called such visits a politically biased threat to Venezuela&apos;s sovereignty.

In the bottom of the eighth inning, the Dodgers’ Enrique Hernandez sent a Mike Mayers pitch deep into left field. Thinking the ball was headed into the bullpen, Ozuna climbed a fence and held out his glove in anticipation of a catch.
After realizing he’d miscalculated, Ozuna leaped off the fence and faceplanted onto the warning track as the ball landed closer than he had expected."
Time runs out for prisoner trying to prove his innocence,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/time-runs-out-for-prisoner-trying-to-prove-his-innocence,"Attorney Staples Hughes said a client who also was convicted in the case told him not long after the 1984 slayings of a Fayetteville couple that Hunt wasn&apos;t involved. Hughes risked disbarment when he told a judge in 2007 about the confession, after the client, Jerry Cashwell, had died. ""If you believe what my client told me, and I believe my client, that Mr. Hunt didn&apos;t do this, then it just becomes so terrible and so sad,"" Hughes told The Associated Press.
Hunt, 59, died alone Feb. 13 at Rex Hospital in Raleigh, where he had been taken about a week earlier for treatment of heart problems, his daughter, Heather Allen, told the AP. Prison officials didn&apos;t tell Hunt&apos;s relatives that he&apos;d been moved from Maury Correctional Institution to the hospital until the family got word he had died, Allen said. He&apos;d spent more than half his life in state prisons.
The AP received a tip that Hunt had died and is the only news organization to interview members of the families of both Hunt and the Matthews&apos; couple since his death.
Hunt, Cashwell and a third man were convicted in the deaths of Roland and Lisa Matthews, who were shot and stabbed in their home in Fayetteville. Their 2-year-old daughter was found in a bedroom, physically unharmed.
Prosecutors said the couple was killed because Roland Matthews stole marijuana from Hunt, who ran a drug ring.
The only physical evidence tying Hunt to the crimes was a lead-content comparison of bullets that Hunt owned to bullets found at the crime scene — a comparison technique the FBI abandoned in 2005 after the method faced scientific criticism. Other evidence included testimony from an associate who received immunity and from a prison informant.
That&apos;s not to say Hunt had no criminal history.
In November 1985, Hunt was sentenced for felony drug possession and other charges. He was released in September 1986. Less than a month later, on Oct. 17, 1986, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Hunt&apos;s supporters were certain the lack of physical evidence, along with Cashwell&apos;s posthumously released confession, would eventually free him in the murder case.
But it didn&apos;t. Judges repeatedly ruled against him. North Carolina&apos;s unique Innocence Inquiry Commission couldn&apos;t take his case because there was no new evidence, said Chris Mumma, executive director of the nonprofit N.C. Center on Actual Innocence, which handled Hunt&apos;s case at one point.
Yet Hunt believed until the end that he would be exonerated, his daughter said. ""He never let go of hope,"" Allen said.
He told her ""If they don&apos;t find out while I&apos;m here, hopefully the truth will come out when I&apos;m not here,"" she said. ""... He always talked about the Lord and he always believed things would come to a light one day.""
Hughes, now 67, kept Cashwell&apos;s confession secret because of attorney-client privilege until after Cashwell died by suicide in prison in 2002. Hughes signed an affidavit for Hunt&apos;s attorneys in 2004. When Hughes came forward at a hearing for Hunt in 2007, the judge admonished him and reported him to the State Bar, which declined to take action against him.
Last fall, Hughes visited Hunt for the first time in prison. They talked for more than two hours.
""He completely understood the situation I was in,"" Hughes said. ""He bore me no ill will.""
But in his last few phone calls with his daughter, Hunt shared his worries about his health and the lack of care he believed he received behind bars, Allen said. When Allen received his personal belongings from prison officials, she found complaints about his medical care.
Correction Department spokesman John Bull said laws prohibit him from discussing a prisoner&apos;s health record. He said he&apos;d share the Hunt family&apos;s concerns with prison medical officials.
The victims&apos; family, meanwhile, is certain of Hunt&apos;s guilt and relieved he&apos;s finally gone.
Roland Matthews&apos; sister, Paula Holland of Hope Mills, believes Hughes lied about Cashwell&apos;s confession. When asked what trial evidence convinced her of Hunt&apos;s guilt, Holland responded: ""Because of who he is. Because of who he was. Because of his reputation.""
Holland said her niece, Crystal Mayfield, was 22 months old when her parents were killed. She was found sitting on her bed, with her dog.
And when an exonerated ex-prisoner commented in a public Facebook post that Hunt died an innocent man, Mayfield responded: ""I am very relieved that justice has finally been served and my family can have some peace now.""
Mayfield didn&apos;t reply to a Facebook message from the AP. Her relatives said she didn&apos;t want to be interviewed.
It&apos;s not uncommon for prisoners who have evidence of innocence to die in custody. Responding to an email query, lawyers nationwide listed cases in multiple states where prisoners with strong evidence, including DNA, have died awaiting a chance to prove their innocence.
At least 21 people have been exonerated posthumously, with about half dying in prison, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.
Hunt, who learned to read and write in prison, was a woodworker. He enjoyed reading about log cabins and talked about the one he&apos;d build when free, his family said. He used plastic knives and wood from pallets to carve animal figures, then dyed them with coffee grounds and decorated them with pastel crayons, Allen said.
The victims&apos; family thinks Allen is lucky to have those memories.
""Lee Wayne Hunt was very fortunate,"" Holland said. ""His family could go to prison and visit him. The only joy we had left was putting flowers on my brother&apos;s grave. I hate it for them, but I hate it for us, too ... We didn&apos;t take his life. ... We just had to wait and bide our time.""
Hunt&apos;s supporters believe time did him no favors.
""Everything I knew about this case makes me believe he didn&apos;t do this,"" Hughes said. ""And that&apos;s pretty terrible. I had hoped this would turn out different. And it didn&apos;t. It just turned out overwhelmingly sadly.""

Bodycam footage may be shown at Minneapolis officer's trial,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/bodycam-footage-may-be-shown-at-minneapolis-officers-trial,"Mohamed Noor and his partner did not have their body cameras turned on when Noor shot Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia. She was shot just minutes after she called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home in July 2017, and the officers switched on the cameras after the shooting. The judge hearing the trial initially ruled that the footage would be shown only to the jury, citing Damond&apos;s privacy and the fact that the footage shows her partially unclothed as the officers try to resuscitate her. The judge relented Monday after a challenge led by media outlets.
Noor, 33, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Damond&apos;s death. In opening statements Tuesday, his attorney said Noor was reacting to a loud noise and feared an ambush, calling the shooting ""a perfect storm with tragic consequences.""
Noor and his partner were rolling down a dark alley in response to the 911 call from Damond when a bicyclist appeared in front of them and they heard ""a bang,"" defense attorney Peter Wold said.
""It is the next split second that this case is all about,"" Wold said.
Noor fired a single shot, killing Damond, whose death rocked both countries and led to changes in the Minneapolis Police Department. The shooting came just two weeks after an officer in New York was ambushed and killed in a parked vehicle.
Attorneys for Noor, who was fired after being charged in the case and has never talked to investigators about what happened, argued that he used reasonable force to defend himself and his partner from a perceived threat. But prosecutors say there is no evidence he faced a threat that justified deadly force.
Prosecutor Patrick Lofton, in his opening remarks, questioned a statement from Noor&apos;s partner, Matthew Harrity, that he heard a thump right before the shooting. Lofton said Harrity never said anything at the scene about such a noise, instead mentioning it for the first time some days later in an interview with investigators.
Investigators found no forensic evidence to show that Damond had touched the squad car before she was shot, raising the possibility that she had not slapped or hit it upon approaching the officers, Lofton said.
Besides Noor and Harrity not having their body cameras on until after the shooting, other officers who responded to the scene did not consistently have their cameras switched on either, Lofton said.
A sergeant taking statements had her camera on when she talked to Harrity, but it was off when she talked to Noor.
""We&apos;ll never hear what he said,"" Lofton said.
Damond, 40, was a life coach who was engaged to be married in a month. Noor is a Somali American whose arrival on the force just a couple of years earlier had been trumpeted by city leaders working to diversify the police force.
Damond called 911 twice that night, then called her fiance and hung up when police arrived, Lofton said. One minute and 19 seconds later, she was holding her wounded abdomen and saying, ""I&apos;m dying,"" Lofton added.
Damond&apos;s fiance, Don Damond, was the first witness for prosecutors. Damond sobbed as he described calls from investigators the night of Justine&apos;s death, saying he wasn&apos;t told an officer had shot her until a second phone call.
He said calling Justine&apos;s father in Australia was ""painful, and traumatic, and the worst phone call I&apos;ve ever had to make in my life."" Members of Justine&apos;s family from Australia, including her father, stepmother, brother and sister-in-law, were in the courtroom Tuesday. Her father cried during portions of Damond&apos;s testimony.
Justine Damond had taken her fiance&apos;s name professionally before their marriage.
Noor&apos;s attorneys have not said whether he will testify. If he does, prosecutors may be able to introduce some evidence that the defense wanted to keep out of the state&apos;s case, including that he has refused to talk to investigators. They also could bring up a 2015 psychological test that showed Noor disliked being around people and had difficulty confronting others. Despite that test, a psychiatrist found him fit to be a cadet officer.
The shooting raised questions about Noor&apos;s training. The police chief defended Noor&apos;s training, but the chief was forced to resign days later. The shooting also led to changes in the department&apos;s policy on use of body cameras.

Israel's Netanyahu appears headed toward 5th term as PM,www.foxnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israels-netanyahu-appears-headed-toward-5th-term-as-pm,"The outcome affirmed Israel&apos;s continued tilt to the right and further dimmed hopes of a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Re-election will also give Netanyahu an important boost as he braces for the likelihood of criminal charges in a series of corruption scandals. With 97.4% of the vote counted, Likud and its traditional political allies were in command of a 65-55 majority in parliament. A couple of small parties were still teetering along the electoral threshold and fighting for their survival, so the final makeup of the next parliament has yet to be decided. In any case, the country now faces what could be weeks of political negotiations over the composition of a ruling coalition.
But under nearly every scenario, Netanyahu was the big winner.
The long-time Israeli leader had fought a tight, ugly race against centrist ex-military chief Benny Gantz, whose nascent Blue and White party emerged as a viable alternative to Netanyahu&apos;s decade in power. The near-final results showed it deadlocked with Likud at 35 seats. But most of its support seems to have come at the expense of the venerable Labor and leftist Meretz parties, who both earned historic lows in Tuesday&apos;s election.

Together with his current Jewish ultra-Orthodox and nationalist partners, Netanyahu should have no trouble building a coalition government that has a majority in the 120-seat parliament.
With a victory, Netanyahu would capture a fourth consecutive term and fifth overall, which this summer will make him Israel&apos;s longest-ever serving leader, surpassing founding father David Ben-Gurion.
""It&apos;s a night of tremendous victory,"" Netanyahu told supporters early Wednesday. ""I was very moved that the nation of Israel once again entrusted me for the fifth time, and with an even greater trust.""
He said he had already begun talking to fellow right-wing and religious parties about forming a new coalition.
""I want to make it clear, it will be a right-wing government, but I intend to be the prime minister of all Israeli citizens, right or left, Jews and non-Jews alike,"" he said.
Netanyahu&apos;s message of unity was a sharp contrast from his campaign theme in which he accused Gantz of conspiring with Arab parties to topple him. Arab leaders accused Netanyahu of demonizing the country&apos;s Arab community, which is about 20 percent of the population.
His attacks on the Arab sector fueled calls for a boycott and appeared to result in relatively low turnout by Arab voters.
Though the Palestinian issue was rarely mentioned in the raucous campaign, Netanyahu had in the final stretch pledged for the first time to annex parts of the occupied West Bank in a desperate bid to rally his right-wing base. Netanyahu has welched on election eve promises before, but should he follow through on this one, it would mark a dramatic development and potentially wipe out the already diminishing hope for Palestinian statehood.
The 69-year-old prime minister has been the dominant force in Israeli politics for the past two decades and its face to the world. His campaign has focused heavily on his friendship with President Donald Trump and his success in cultivating new allies, such as China, India and Brazil.
But his corruption scandals created some voter fatigue. Along with two other former military chiefs on his ticket, Gantz was able to challenge Netanyahu on security issues, normally the prime minister&apos;s strong suit, while also taking aim at the prime minister&apos;s alleged ethical lapses.
Israel&apos;s attorney general has recommended charging Netanyahu with bribery, breach of trust and fraud in three cases. He will only decide on indicting him after a legally mandated hearing. Legal experts expect at least some charges to be filed, which could set the stage for a short term for Netanyahu and another round of elections soon.

Close-to-complete unofficial results indicated on Wednesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is headed to a fifth term, with the expected support of nationalist and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties.

(AP Photo/Vincent Yu) HONG KONG – A Hong Kong court has extended bail for nine pro-democracy protest organizers convicted of public nuisance offences as they await sentencing. The guilty verdicts handed down Tuesday against the nine were condemned by rights activists as a likely sign of more restrictions on free expression in the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.
The defendants left court on Wednesday and will be sentenced April 24.
The nine were leaders of 2014's nonviolent ""Occupy Central"" campaign, also known as the ""Umbrella Movement"" after a key symbol of defiance against police adopted by the street protests that shut down parts of the financial hub for 79 days.
Protesters demanded the right to choose Hong Kong's own leader rather than merely approve a candidate picked by Beijing but failed to win any concessions from the government. Trending in World"

"Wreckage of missing Japan's F-35 fighter jet found, pilot remains missing",www.foxnews.com,Lukas Mikelionis,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/wreckage-of-missing-japans-f-35-fighter-jet-found-pilot-remains-missing,"The Japanese defense ministry said the male pilot, who’s in his 40s, remains missing. The fighter jet went off the radar while flying off the eastern coast of Aomori, just about half an hour after taking off the Misawa air base with three other F-35As.
It remains unclear what caused the crash, Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya told reporters, adding that 12 other F-35s at the base will be grounded.
“We have collected parts from the jet fighter&apos;s tail fin so we [believe] it crashed,” Iwaya said, according to the BBC .
“We have collected parts from the jet fighter's tail fin so we [believe] it crashed.”
— Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya The U.S. military supported the Japanese allies in the search of the jet and the pilot. The U.S. Navy’s 7th fleet, P-8A maritime patrol aircraft, and a guided-missile destroyer are continuing to assist Japanese-led search and rescue efforts for the pilot.
Some have warned that the crashed jet could have caused major security concern had the wreckage been first discovered by China or Russia, both of which long hoped to get their hands on the state-of-the-art military technology produced by the U.S.
Iwaya said that the pilot sent a signal to abort the mission, according to the broadcaster. Shortly after the signal, all communications with the fighter jet were lost.
Japanese military began deploying the U.S.-made F-35s since last year in an effort to ramp up defense spending amid threats from North Korea and China.
The government of Japan is also seeking to 147 F-35s, including 105 F-35As, costing about $90 million each.

A Canadian family decided to keep driving when its 87-year-old patriarch died in the backseat of their car while returning home from a Florida vacation last month to avoid paying for U.S. health care , reports said. When Fernand Drapeau’s wife and son reached the U.S.-Canada border on March 31, authorities stopped and searched the car. Inside they found Drapeau, who appeared to have died from a heart attack at least a day before arriving at the border, the Vancouver Sun reported.
The family cited the high cost of U.S. health care, plus the cost of shipping the body back to Quebec as the reason for not stopping at a hospital, CTV News reported.
Border officials said it was the first time that such an incident has occurred.
No charges have yet been filed in the case. Authorities are continuing to investigate. Trending in US"

Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa has apologized to shareholders for the unfolding scandal at the Japanese automaker and asked for their approval to oust from the board former Chairman Ghosn, who has been arrested on financial misconduct charges. Saikawa and other Nissan Motor Co. executives bowed deeply at a Tokyo hotel Monday, April 8, 2019, where the extraordinary shareholders' meeting was being held. (Sadayuki Goto/Kyodo News via AP, File) TOKYO – The lawyers for Nissan's former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was sent back to detention while out on bail, have filed a protest with the Japanese Supreme Court. The appeal was filed Wednesday.
Lawyer Junichiro Hironaka told reporters that Ghosn's fourth and latest arrest is unfair.
Ghosn was arrested in November, released on bail last month but re-arrested last week.
Multiple arrests and long detentions are routine in Japan, but arresting a suspect who cleared bail is unusual.
Ghosn's detention has been extended through Sunday but may be prolonged. He is charged with falsifying financial documents and breach of trust. He says he is innocent.
The latest arrest is over suspicion Nissan money paid to a dealership that was diverted to a company effectively controlled by Ghosn. Trending in World"

German: Police raids against suspected far-right extremists,www.foxnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/german-police-raids-against-suspected-far-right-extremists,"Email BERLIN – Police have raided more than 30 premises linked to suspected far-right extremists in Berlin and three other eastern German states. German news agency dpa reported that the raids early Wednesday were mainly centered on Brandenburg state and the region around Cottbus, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the capital.
According to Brandenburg police, the investigation focuses on about 20 people with ties to Germany's hooligan, martial arts and right-wing extremist scene.
Cottbus has a comparatively large neo-Nazi scene affiliated to the city's main football team, Energie Cottbus.
The raids come a day after authorities in Austria searched dozens of homes in several states, seizing weapons and large amounts of banned propaganda material.

In this photo taken Wednesday, March 6, 2019 in Raleigh, N.C. Heather Allen holds a photo of her father, Lee Wayne Hunt, from his memorial. Even though Lee Wayne Hunt died as a prisoner found guilty of a double murder, his family says he never gave up hope of proving his innocence. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome) RALEIGH, N.C. – Lee Wayne Hunt died a prisoner, officially deemed guilty of a double murder — even though a co-defendant absolved him in a conversation with a lawyer that remained secret for decades. Attorney Staples Hughes said a client who also was convicted in the case told him not long after the 1984 slayings of a Fayetteville couple that Hunt wasn't involved. Hughes risked disbarment when he told a judge in 2007 about the confession, after the client, Jerry Cashwell, had died.
""If you believe what my client told me, and I believe my client, that Mr. Hunt didn't do this, then it just becomes so terrible and so sad,"" Hughes told The Associated Press.
Hunt, 59, died alone Feb. 13 at Rex Hospital in Raleigh, where he had been taken about a week earlier for treatment of heart problems, his daughter, Heather Allen, told the AP. Prison officials didn't tell Hunt's relatives that he'd been moved from Maury Correctional Institution to the hospital until the family got word he had died, Allen said. He'd spent more than half his life in state prisons.
The AP received a tip that Hunt had died and is the only news organization to interview members of the families of both Hunt and the Matthews' couple since his death.
Hunt, Cashwell and a third man were convicted in the deaths of Roland and Lisa Matthews, who were shot and stabbed in their home in Fayetteville. Their 2-year-old daughter was found in a bedroom, physically unharmed.
Prosecutors said the couple was killed because Roland Matthews stole marijuana from Hunt, who ran a drug ring.
The only physical evidence tying Hunt to the crimes was a lead-content comparison of bullets that Hunt owned to bullets found at the crime scene — a comparison technique the FBI abandoned in 2005 after the method faced scientific criticism. Other evidence included testimony from an associate who received immunity and from a prison informant.
That's not to say Hunt had no criminal history.
In November 1985, Hunt was sentenced for felony drug possession and other charges. He was released in September 1986. Less than a month later, on Oct. 17, 1986, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Hunt's supporters were certain the lack of physical evidence, along with Cashwell's posthumously released confession, would eventually free him in the murder case.
But it didn't. Judges repeatedly ruled against him. North Carolina's unique Innocence Inquiry Commission couldn't take his case because there was no new evidence, said Chris Mumma, executive director of the nonprofit N.C. Center on Actual Innocence, which handled Hunt's case at one point.
Yet Hunt believed until the end that he would be exonerated, his daughter said. ""He never let go of hope,"" Allen said.
He told her ""If they don't find out while I'm here, hopefully the truth will come out when I'm not here,"" she said. ""... He always talked about the Lord and he always believed things would come to a light one day.""
Hughes, now 67, kept Cashwell's confession secret because of attorney-client privilege until after Cashwell died by suicide in prison in 2002. Hughes signed an affidavit for Hunt's attorneys in 2004. When Hughes came forward at a hearing for Hunt in 2007, the judge admonished him and reported him to the State Bar, which declined to take action against him.
Last fall, Hughes visited Hunt for the first time in prison. They talked for more than two hours.
""He completely understood the situation I was in,"" Hughes said. ""He bore me no ill will.""
But in his last few phone calls with his daughter, Hunt shared his worries about his health and the lack of care he believed he received behind bars, Allen said. When Allen received his personal belongings from prison officials, she found complaints about his medical care.
Correction Department spokesman John Bull said laws prohibit him from discussing a prisoner's health record. He said he'd share the Hunt family's concerns with prison medical officials.
The victims' family, meanwhile, is certain of Hunt's guilt and relieved he's finally gone.
Roland Matthews' sister, Paula Holland of Hope Mills, believes Hughes lied about Cashwell's confession. When asked what trial evidence convinced her of Hunt's guilt, Holland responded: ""Because of who he is. Because of who he was. Because of his reputation.""
Holland said her niece, Crystal Mayfield, was 22 months old when her parents were killed. She was found sitting on her bed, with her dog.
And when an exonerated ex-prisoner commented in a public Facebook post that Hunt died an innocent man, Mayfield responded: ""I am very relieved that justice has finally been served and my family can have some peace now.""
Mayfield didn't reply to a Facebook message from the AP. Her relatives said she didn't want to be interviewed.
It's not uncommon for prisoners who have evidence of innocence to die in custody. Responding to an email query, lawyers nationwide listed cases in multiple states where prisoners with strong evidence, including DNA, have died awaiting a chance to prove their innocence.
At least 21 people have been exonerated posthumously, with about half dying in prison, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.
Hunt, who learned to read and write in prison, was a woodworker. He enjoyed reading about log cabins and talked about the one he'd build when free, his family said. He used plastic knives and wood from pallets to carve animal figures, then dyed them with coffee grounds and decorated them with pastel crayons, Allen said.
The victims' family thinks Allen is lucky to have those memories.
""Lee Wayne Hunt was very fortunate,"" Holland said. ""His family could go to prison and visit him. The only joy we had left was putting flowers on my brother's grave. I hate it for them, but I hate it for us, too ... We didn't take his life. ... We just had to wait and bide our time.""
Hunt's supporters believe time did him no favors.
""Everything I knew about this case makes me believe he didn't do this,"" Hughes said. ""And that's pretty terrible. I had hoped this would turn out different. And it didn't. It just turned out overwhelmingly sadly.""
