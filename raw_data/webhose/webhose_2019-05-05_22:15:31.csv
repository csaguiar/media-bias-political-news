Many thousands of roads, bridges and buildings have been destroyed.So far, 86,000 people are living in emergency shelters, of which about 1,000 were airlifted to safety.Aid agencies are struggling to cope with the demands and Iran 's state budget is under pressure due to US sanctions on energy and banking.Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has accused US sanctions - reimposed after President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last year - of impeding aid efforts to affected areas, saying that it has caused a shortage of rescue helicopters.""This isn't just economic warfare; it's economic terrorism,"" Zarif tweeted on April .The government has maintained that people, especially farmers, will be compensated for their losses.The head of Iran 's elite Revolutionary Guards said the armed forces were ""using all their power"" to minimise damage."

CAPE TOWN, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Friday reaffirmed its support for South Africa to end child abuse in the country that has been plagued by the scourge for long.
""UNICEF's core focus in South Africa is on ending violence against children,"" the organization said in a statement emailed to Xinhua.
UNICEF was reacting to allegations of serious child abuse at a South African nursery school where a female caregiver physically abused young children.
A video showing the abuse has gone viral on social media , and UNICEF said it was ""appalled at the content of the video showing the caregiver at the creche physically abusing young children whilst the other caregiver was capturing the horrifying footage."" The Carletonville nursery school in Gauteng Province, northeastern South Africa , has been closed and the caregiver in question has been arrested following public outrage over the incident.
The fact that this incident occurred in what is considered a ""safe"" space, namely, a nursery school, denies these children their dignity and their right to be secure, UNICEF said.
The organization said it would like to see the perpetrators of this crime facing the full might of the law so that this acts as a deterrent.
UNICEF cited statistics which show that one in three children experience violence in South Africa , often by an adult who is supposed to be taking care of them.
UNICEF said it has been assured by the progressive legal framework in this country that justice will be served and that the children and the families affected will receive necessary support.
Both the Constitution of this country and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, of which South Africa is a signatory, remind people that every child in South Africa has the right to be protected from all forms of violence, abuse, exploitation and neglect in their homes and in their communities, said UNICEF.
The United Nations has ranked South Africa as among the world 's 10 most violent nations. According to police , 800 to 900 children are murdered every year in the country."

The real point of contention of Trump's national emergency declaration & its supposed precedent,defendingthetruth.com,Neil (invalid@example.com),04-06-2019,2019,4,https://defendingthetruth.com/threads/the-real-point-of-contention-of-trumps-national-emergency-declaration-its-supposed-precedent.110806/,"#1 Normally when something's an emergency, it's something like a house catching on fire or someone having a stroke - something that wasn't happening before but is happening now, has a high degree of impact, and needs immediate attention. That doesn't mean that something that has been occurring for quite a while isn't an emergency; the fact that something is having a high degree of impact and needs immediate attention is what makes it an emergency, regardless of whether or not it commenced during a certain president's administration. Just because up to now something wasn't declared an emergency, that doesn't mean or prove that an emergency condition doesn't exist. The reason Trump had to declare that an emergency is an emergency is to follow legal procedures to take action. There's also this notion that some sort of slippery slope that comes from the precedent of declaring the illegal border crossings an emergency; there is no precedent or slippery slope problem. For example, there's this idea that it could set a precedent for some future president to declare an emergency for gun violence. Before I get to the main point, there's a problem with the notion of ""gun violence"" as though it's the only type of violence that's unacceptable; it implies that other types of violence are ok. There is an emergency when there's a big problem with violence, regardless of whether or not it involves guns. Violence in all its forms is a problem that always ought to be dealt with, and if it's a problem that's getting worse or an ongoing problem, then maybe an emergency ought to be declared. Personally I don't get why they don't declare martial law in places where there are problems with gangs or violence in the streets, until the problem goes away. There's also this ridiculous non sequitur notion that declaring an emergency for ""gun"" violence thus means confiscating guns. Well for one thing that begs the question of about the role that existing gun grabber laws play in causing the existing ""gun"" violence problem in the first place. The logical course of action for dealing with ""gun"" violence is to get rid of the gun grabber laws responsible for the problem, and giving people their guns back, or in general arming or letting law-abiding citizens be armed."

According to Kashmir Media Service, the authorities imposed restrictions in downtown Srinagar on Friday following massive protests inside the Central Jail Srinagar , the previous night. The authorities had also sealed the Jamia Masjid and placed the Mirwaiz, who delivers weekly Friday sermon at the historic mosque , under house detention.
Mirwaiz Umar Farooq in a statement issued in Srinagar said that preventing the people from offering congregational prayers at the grand Masjid , following the Shab-e-Meraj, had deeply hurt the religious sentiments of hundreds of the masses.
He said repeated locking down of the grand mosque is unacceptable. He said that while entire Muslim Umaah was observing Meraj-e-Alam with religious fervour, thousands of Kashmiri people were deprived of their religious right and stopped from attending the traditional religious event at Jamia Masjid as stringent curbs were in place amid heavy deployment of Indian troops and police personnel."

WASHINGTON, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Non-resident capital flows into China reached 485 billion U.S. Dollars in 2018 , and are expected to grow by 90 billion dollars, or 18.6 percent in 2019 , new data from the Institute of International Finance (IIF) showed.
According to the capital flows report released by the IIF on Friday, China 's net foreign direct investment (FDI) bounced back from an outflow of 42 billion dollars in 2016 to an inflow of 107 billion dollars last year.
The IIF, a Washington-based association of global financial institutions, predicts China 's net FDI to be around 70 billion dollars per year in 2019 and 2020 .
The report noted that China attracted large portfolio inflows last year, with its bond market bringing in 100 billion dollars in 2018 , up from 88 billion dollars in 2017 . China also attracted 61 billion dollars of equity inflows last year, up from 36 billion dollars of inflows in 2017 .
The IIF report expects net portfolio flows into China to reach 105 billion dollars and 111 billion dollars in 2019 and 2020 , respectively.
The report forecasts a ""relatively modest"" rebound in non-resident capital flows to emerging markets this year and next year, due to loose monetary policy in developed economies such as the United States , Europe and Japan .
The IIF projected inflows of 1,260 billion dollars for emerging markets in 2019 , up from 1,135 billion dollars in 2018 , with a further modest recovery next year.
""Overall, however, we believe the world is a more difficult place for emerging markets that depend on foreign capital inflows,"" the report said."

Kuala Lumpur, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Asia's football chief and FIFA 's second-in-command Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al Khalifa received a fresh, four-year term on Saturday, triggering complaints from campaigners who said regional soccer was in ""crisis"" over human rights.
The Bahraini royal, who was standing unopposed for the second straight occasion, was elected in his absence at the Asian Football Confederation Congress in Kuala Lumpur , which he skipped following the death of his mother on Wednesday.
Sheikh Salman was criticised by rights groups this year for his silence over the case of Bahraini refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi, who was detained in Thailand and threatened with extradition to Bahrain .
Araibi, who was released following an international outcry, believes he was targeted for claiming Sheikh Salman was involved in a crackdown on anti-government protests in 2011 which included the arrest and alleged torture of footballers.
The former Bahrain FA chief has long refuted the accusation, which was aired when he first came to power at the AFC in a landslide election in 2013.
Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said "" Asian football is in a crisis"", accusing Sheikh Salman and others of failing to protect human rights.
""Sheikh Salman should commit to uphold and to carry out FIFA 's 2017 Human Rights Policy, including in his home country,"" Worden wrote in a commentary responding to his re-election.
However, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said Asia was showing unity and ""stability"" by re-electing Sheikh Salman, who sent a statement expressing his ""heartfelt apologies"" for his absence.
The Bahraini pointed to a record commercial deal struck last year, and said it would not have been possible without good governance and reforms to AFC competitions.
""Together, we will grow stronger. Together, Asian football will grow stronger,"" Sheikh Salman said."

Microsoft joins race to clean up shipping with data - The Providence Journal,www.providencejournal.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190406/microsoft-joins-race-to-clean-up-shipping-with-data,"By Emily ChasanBloomberg Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 11:16 AM
At noon every day — when the sun is directly overhead — the world's fleet of commercial maritime ships report their position, speed and weather conditions. It's the primary way ships track how much fuel they're burning and how to to use less of it, and they've been doing it this way for at least 200 years.
Surely there's a better way, and the world's biggest tech firms are investing millions to figure it out before fuel prices spike under new shipping rules in January.
Microsoft Corp.'s venture arm, M12, just announced it's leading an $1-million Series A funding round for Nautilus Labs, a New York startup that uses artificial intelligence for fuel efficiency on ships. California's NVIDIA Corp. is working with another AI startup in San Francisco. Japan's Hitachi Ltd. is pursuing similar technology in Europe.
Maritime ships, which transport around 90 percent of the world's goods across the seas, generate about 3 percent of global carbon emissions. They also waste a lot of fuel because of poor decisions.
""Most companies don't know or aren't confident about how much fuel their ships actually consume,"" said Matt Heider, chief executive of Nautilus Labs. More frequent data on weather patterns and vessel speed could help reduce fuel use, he said.
That's where the tech companies come in. Nautilus says it can use artificial intelligence to deliver real-time analytics and alerts to ship crews that could help save more than 10 percent on emissions in a single voyage. For example, if a ship learns it's traveling too fast at night, it could slow down to save fuel.
That's increasingly important, as new international rules will require ships to reduce their pollution. Collectively, commercial ships already consume $100 billion a year of the world's dirtiest sulfur-rich fuel oil, representing about 5 percent of global oil demand.
Cleaner, higher-grade fuel and biofuel are more expensive, an added incentive for companies to use less. Improving efficiency with data is potentially cheaper and faster than some of the other efforts under way now, including installing scrubbers on commercial ships that keep sulfur out of the air and developing new wind and air bubble technologies to reduce friction on their vessels."

Islamabad (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 06th April, 2019) New research shows that people who follow a keto diet to lose weight or treat diabetes should avoid sudden spikes in blood sugar levels.Diets require discipline, and it is not always easy for people to follow them without indulging in a ""cheat day."" One day may not make a big difference in the long-term, but a recent study from the University of British Columbia in Okanagan, Canada (UBCO), found that when it comes to the keto diet, a single dose of carbohydrates may have dangerous side effects.The keto diet aims to provide the body with more calories from protein and fat and less from carbohydrates.
Ratios depend on the individual's body mass and activity level, but they usually stay in the following ranges: 60-75 percent of calories from fat , 15-30 percent of calories from protein, and 5-10 percent of calories from carbohydrates.When the body receives less than 50 grams of carbohydrates a day, it will run out of its preferred fuel source glucose and this will happen 3 to 4 days after the beginning of the diet.
At this point, the body will start to break down protein and fat to get energy. This metabolic process is calledketosis.People often use the keto diet to lose weight , but this method can also help to manage certain health conditions, including diabetes.
Studiesshowed that the keto diet might help to control hunger and reduce body weight , and it may lower blood sugar levels in those with diabetes.""The ketogenic or keto diet has become very common for weight loss or to manage diseases such as type 2 diabetes,"" says Jonathan Little, senior author of the recent study and associate professor in the school of Health and Exercise Sciences at UBCO.Little explains that during ketosis, the body's chemistry changes.
The process in which the body starts to aggressively burn its fat stores to get energy may lead to significant weight loss and improvement in symptoms of diseases, for example, type 2 diabetes.It is common for people to indulge in ""cheat days,"" and so researchers at UCBO wanted to know what happens when people reintroduce a dose of glucose to the body.
The study was looking for inflammatory responses or reduced tolerance to blood glucose.""Since impaired glucose tolerance and spikes in blood sugar levels are known to be associated with an increased risk in cardiovascular disease, it made sense to look at what was happening in the blood vessels after a sugar hit,"" says Cody Durrer, study first author and doctoral student at UBCO.Nine healthy young males participated in this study, which appears in the journal Nutrients.
The researchers asked them to follow a 7-day high fat , low-carbohydrate diet that was similar to the keto diet, consisting of 70 percent fat , 10 percent carbohydrates, and 20 percent protein. They also had to consume a 75-gram glucose drink before and after the diet.The inflammatory and blood glucose concerns were not what the researchers discovered, however.""What we found instead were biomarkers in the blood , suggesting that vessel walls were being damaged by the sudden spike in glucose,"" Durrer continues.The results were alarming because even though the participants were all young males, the condition of their blood vessels after consuming the glucose drink was more similar to that of people with poor cardiovascular health.Little explains that the damage to blood vessels is due to the body's own metabolic response to spikes in blood sugar levels, which may lead to the death of blood vessel cells.Researchers cautioned that the study only included nine people, and more work is needed to verify the results.
However, it still points to worrying issues, the senior author suggests.""My concern is that many of the people going on a keto diet whether it's to lose weight , to treat type 2 diabetes, or some other health reason may be undoing some of the positive impacts on their blood vessels if they suddenly blast them with glucose,"" Little concludes.These findings should give those on a keto diet pause when considering a ""cheat day.""The data suggest that the keto diet is not something that people should do for 6 days a week and take a day off.
This consideration is especially important for people who are at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease."

Islamabad (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 06th April, 2019) A major study has found that unhealthful eating is responsible for more deaths worldwide than any other risk factor, including smoking.The Global Burden of Disease Study looked at dietary consumption between 1990 and 2017 in 195 countries, focusing on 15 types of food or nutrients.In a paper that features in The Lancet, the study investigators conclude that, due to its contribution to noncommunicable diseases, poor diet accounted for 1 in 5, or 11 million , adult deaths in 2017 .The vast majority of those deaths, around 10 million , were from cardiovascular disease.
The rest were mainly from cancer and type 2 diabetes.Ranking the countries from lowest to highest rates of diet-related deaths puts Israel first, with 89 deaths per 100,000 people, and Uzbekistan last, with 892 per 100,000.The United States , with 171 deaths per 100,000, comes in at 43rd place and the United Kingdom at 23rd, with 127 deaths per 100,000.
India is in 118th place, and China is in 140th.""This study,"" says study author Dr. Christopher J. L. Murray, who is director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle , ""affirms what many have thought for several years that poor diet is responsible for more deaths than any other risk factor in the world .""In their analysis of global diets, the researchers looked at 15 items: fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, legumes, whole grains, fiber, calcium, milk,omega-3 fatty acids from seafood, polyunsaturated fats, trans fats, red meat, processed meat, sugary drinks, and sodium.They found that the global diet in 2017 contained less than the ideal amounts of nearly all healthful food items.
The biggest deficiency was in nuts and seeds, milk, and whole grains.Consumption of nuts and seeds, for instance, was on average only 3 grams (g) per day, or around 12 percent of the optimal intake.Consumption of milk was only 16 percent of optimal intake and whole grains was only 23 percent.Alongside these, daily intakes of unhealthful dietary items ""exceeded the optimal level globally."" Sugary drink consumption, for example, ""was far higher than the optimal intake,"" followed by the consumption of processed meat and sodium.
Red meat consumption was just above the optimal level.An important finding of the study was that insufficient intake of healthful foods could be just as, if not more, damaging than eating too many unhealthful foods.The authors note that the diets that related to the most deaths were ""high in sodium, low in whole grains, low in fruit, low in nuts and seeds, low in vegetables, and low in omega-3 fatty acids.""They found that each of these dietary factors accounted ""for more than 2 percent of global deaths.""In addition, just three of these whole grains, fruits, and sodium accounted for more than half of the diet-related deaths and two-thirds of the years lost to diet-related ill health and disability.Dr.
Murray says that these results contrast with the fact that, over the last 20 years, policy discussions have tended to focus more on restricting unhealthful foods.He and his colleagues suggest that campaigns should concentrate on rebalancing diets.
They also urge that any changes to food production and distribution aimed to achieve this must consider the environmental impact on the climate, land, water , and soil.In a linked editorial, Prof.
Nita G. Forouhi and Prof. Nigel Unwin, both of the Medical Research Council Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge in the U.K., agree with the authors in that ""in a global context,"" and despite its limitations, the study offers ""evidence to shift the focus"" from restricting unhealthful food items to increasing healthful ones.They suggest that it confirms a need to emphasize foods rather than nutrients.
However, they also highlight some of the challenges of shifting the global diet toward a more healthful one, such as the ""prohibitive"" costs of fruits and vegetables.For example, in low-income countries, ""Two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day per individual accounted for 52 percent of household income,"" compared with just 2 percent in high-income nations.While sodium, sugar, and fat have been the focus of policy debates over the past two decades, our assessment suggests the leading dietary risk factors are high intake of sodium or low intake of healthy foods, such as whole grains, fruit, nuts and seeds, and vegetables.""

Can scientists 'hack' memory?,www.urdupoint.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/can-scientists-hack-memory-587388.html,"Can Scientists 'hack' Memory?

Islamabad (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / Online - 06th April, 2019) Modern science brings us endless possibilities to help our bodies and our minds stay healthy, but some recent scientific pursuits have also been the center of controversy.
One of these is researchers' interest in manipulating memories. Is this feat possible, and if so, why would we want to achieve it?Our memories make up so much of who we are, and the things we remember can often define our experience of the world .And while positive memories can help us grow and thrive, negative memories do not always have such welcome effects.Sometimes, unpleasant memories can be part of a learning curve getting scalded with boiling water means that next time we will be more careful when handling the kettle.However, there are also memories that are truly traumatic, and recalling them can lead to distress and serious mental health conditions, such aspost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).The study of memory formation, recall, and forgetting attracts a lot of attention and curiosity among neuroscientists, psychologists, and even researchers from the humanities, as there is still so much we do not fully understand about the processes surrounding memory.And, while we still need to find out more about how memories form in the brain, researchers in recent years have started investigating the possibility of manipulating memories particularly negative ones to see if they can weaken or remove them altogether.In this Spotlight feature, we look briefly at why we remember and why we naturally forget.
We also explore some studies that have delved into memory manipulation, explaining how researchers aim to achieve it, and why.When the brain encodes information, those data become stored in groups of neurons that synapses or links that allow brain cells to ""communicate"" connect together.Scientists typically associate stronger synapses with a better memory, and the brain constantly ""updates"" synaptic connections, forming new ones or strengthening old ones, as new memories build or we update older ones.However, synapses can also become weaker if they are not activated often enough, and the brain often loses some of these connections altogether.
Thus, forgetting can occur naturally and, indeed, researchers argue that forgetting is a crucial part of learning and creating new memories.Medical news Today spoke to Sam Berens, Ph.D., who is currently a research assistant at the University of York in the United Kingdom , and he explained to us that natural forgetting can be due to a few different reasons.""Forgetting occurs because it would not be energy efficient to indefinitely maintain all the memories that we form each day,"" he explained, adding that it ""also seems to be a natural consequence of neurogenesis the process that creates new brain cells in support of future learning.""""Because of this, clearing old and unused memories may be directly related to our ability to learn new things,"" he told MNT .But scientists continue to explore the many complications that riddle memory recall and formation.
For instance, not all our memories are correct, and sometimes our brains ""implement"" forgetting as a defense mechanism.Past research has shown that social interactions can influence a person's memory of an event , as can what other people remember or claim to remember about the same event .According to a report in the journalScience, ""conformity may present in two forms, which initially convey similar, explicit behavior but are fundamentally different."" These are:* Private conformity, in which ""an individual's recollection may genuinely be altered by social influence, resulting in long-lasting, persistent memory errors.""* Public conformity, in which ""individuals may choose to outwardly comply, providing an account that fits that of others, but inwardly maintain certitude in their own original memory.""However, while public conformity does not actually affect an individual's own memory perception, engaging in this process could lead to that person influencing others' memory of the event .At the same time, the reports' authors note, ""memory conformity may also serve an adaptive purpose because social learning is often more efficient and accurate than individual learning,"" which is not always reliable.For instance, as studies have shown, the process of memory retrieval can mean that the original memory is rewritten with the memory of that memory so that the original memory becomes warped.A study appearing in the Journal of Neuroscience calls this ""retrieval-induced distortion,"" and explains that the distortion could occur either because the retrieval process modified the memory, ""or because it led to the formation of new [...] associations"" that ""got stuck,"" so to speak, to the original memory.""A memory is not simply an image produced by time traveling back to the original event it can be an image that is somewhat distorted because of the prior times you remembered it,"" says Donna Bridge, one of the study authors.Memories aren't static.
If you remember something in the context of a new environment and time, or if you are even in a different mood, your memories might integrate the new information.""On top of the issues surrounding how we remember the things that we remember, there is also the problem of why we forget, and some researchers note that forgetting sometimes occurs as an adaptive mechanism. One way in which forgetting can be adaptive, Berens told MNT , is that, by letting go of irrelevant details, our brains are then better able to recall important information.""[M]y own work suggests that forgetting specific details of an event allows us to focus on the bigger picture and pull out general patterns that can predict the future,"" he explainedFor instance, remembering exactly which trees in the forest bear the most delicious fruit is only useful until you have eaten all of that fruit.
Instead of remembering the specifics trees, it may be best to remember the general area of a forest that has the best trees.""""This sometimes involves forgetting specific details [...] and blurring together many experiences in order to pull out a general pattern,"" Berens continued.The researcher also noted that another way in which forgetting can be a helpful process is by placing negative memories out of reach so that they are less distressing to the person they affect.""Memories for emotional or traumatic events lose their emotional tone over time,"" said Berens, and ""this can help us reappraise and learn from past experience without the need to reexperience all the associated emotions at the same time.""But what happens when traumatic memories persist and resurface unbidden? Experts call this the ""intrusive reexperiencing of trauma,"" and it is a core feature of PTSD.Individuals who experience PTSD may spontaneously recall a traumatic memory, or feel as if they are going back into the context that produced the trauma.This effect can cause the person severe distress and lead to erratic behaviors as a coping strategy.For this reason, some scientists have wondered what approach they could take to weaken or manipulate negative memories and lessen their effect.
And, we already know that it is possible to interfere with a memory and stop it from solidifying.""[M]emories can be actively weakened after formation,"" Berens told us, explaining that this is ""a process distinct from forgetting.""""Firstly, there seems to be a time window after memory formation where memories are particularly weak and sensitive to interference where conflicting information can overwrite the contents of a memory.
[...] Memories can also be weakened by the simple act of retrieval... Yes, simply recalling a memory makes it more susceptible to being weakened, distorted or erased.""Berens further explained that the drug Propranolol, which doctors can prescribe for PTSD, already goes some way towards weakening distressing memories to dampen their effect.""This is how Propranolol is being used to help patients with PTSD,"" he explained, adding that ""[f]irst the patient recalls the trauma, which weakens the memory, then the Propranolol is given, which stops the emotions from being re-encoded as a new memory.""Nevertheless, researchers are still on the lookout for other ways of interfering with memory formation and recall.
Such studies could help not only find novel treatments for PTSD and other phenomena such asphobias, but they might also reveal new information about how memory-related brain mechanisms work.To try and understand whether or not we can artificially manipulate memories, a team of researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge first tried to instil false memories in mice.This initial study, which appeared in Science in 2013, used an optogenetic technique to manipulate the formation of a ""hybrid"" memory in the mice's brain.
This method requires the use of light beams to activate neurons that researchers have engineered to respond to this stimulus.In the study, the team led by Prof. Susumu Tonegawa used optogenetic methods to synchronize two groups of neurons one in the hippocampus, which activated a spatial memory, and one in the amygdala, which activated a fear memory.The experiment was successful the mice started associating fear with a space where they had never actually had a bad experience.In a further study by the same team which they published in Nature in 2014 Tonegawa and colleagues managed to use the same technique to ""switch off"" negative associations in the brains of mice.But are such studies in animals truly indicative of what would happen in the human brain under similar circumstances?Berens told us that, while there are indeed some discrepancies between human brains and the brains of nonhuman mammals that researchers usually work with, the similarities are strong enough to give us a good idea of how human brains would work in the same context.""We really are very similar to non-human mammals like mice and rats in many important ways,"" Berens explained for MNT .
""The same memory formation and consolidation process that help us learn to read and write also operate in rats and mice with only very minor differences,"" he said.""Memories warm you up from the inside.
But they also tear you apart,"" writes author Haruki Murakami in the novel Kafka on the Shore, and we still have a way to go in learning how best to use our memories for growth, and to stop them from becoming an obstacle. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

GENEVA, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News / WAM - 06th Apr, 2019) The UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR , said on Friday that it is expanding preparations and empowering Rohingya refugees who are at risk ahead of monsoon rains in Bangladesh .
Emergency preparations and training of Rohingya refugees as first responders in Cox’s Bazar are being ramped up as the first monsoon rains of 2019 are expected in weeks.
UNHCR spokesperson, Andrej Mahecic, said that last year's monsoon season was a ""major test"" for humanitarian agencies and the Bangladesh government . Refugee lives in the hilly settlements of Cox’s Bazar area remain at risk from potential landslides, flash floods, and the unpredictability of impending cyclones and monsoon rains .
""Many families had built shelters wherever they could find space, often on steep slopes or areas prone to flash floods from heavy rains , and their immediate safety was at risk,"" he explained.
""The situation requires a robust humanitarian response, centred on the needs of both refugee and Bangladeshi communities,"" Mahecic affirmed.
The spokesperson said that this year, work is ongoing to further fortify essential infrastructure and strategically pre-position relief items in the refugee settlements. ""Emergency stocks to deal with pre- and post-disaster situations, equipment, and other essentials are being placed throughout the camps.""
""UNHCR’s efforts are also focused on training and building the lasting capacity of refugee communities who will be at the centre of any response, including their ability to prepare and respond to natural disasters alongside UNHCR field teams and other humanitarian partners,"" he continued.
To date , there are over 850,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh , with the concentration of refugees in Cox’s Bazar now amongst the densest in the world .

Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, on Friday, was an eye-opening opportunity, revealing the vast potential of the emirate as a world-class hub for development.
""I am very impressed with the very coherent narrative about where Ras Al Khaimah wants to go and develop itself. His Highness was very good at explaining that he wants to put the human element at the centre, tracking talents, tracking companies and getting Ras Al Khaimah to be a world-class hub for development, he said.
The Danish Ambassador said he was also impressed when he visited Ras Al Khaimah Ceramic, a key industrial player in the emirate.
""One of the things I noticed was the coherence and the ambition all the way from His Highness to the free zone people to the individual companies, and that is confidence-inducing when you see commercial opportunities in places like Ras Al Khaimah,"" Mellbin enthused.
He said he sensed a serious business environment that offers real opportunities and it opens doors to a lot of people to consider this place for investment. ""In a world where you have stiff competition, we have Dubai and Abu Dhabi which have a larger world recognition as brands and Names , it is very important for a place like Ras Al Khaimah to have these kinds of indicators to back up their business proposals and their value proposition. ""
On the potentials of growth for Ras Al Khaimah, the ambassador said, ""I see potentials in two specific dimensions, one is public-private partnerships which would encompass energy, environment and circular economy. I also see an opportunity in logistics which is quite important.""
""I will be looking to have discussions with Danish companies within those three sectors. We do have companies who want to move business to Ras Al Khaimah. I will come back to them and talks to them about what I have seen here today,"" he continued, adding that there are ""awesome opportunities, but the whole port sector is very competitive. I have seen the division of labour . I see the best opportunities in moving the logistics sectors towards what people call Industry 4.0. We would like to explore more when it comes to digitisation and logistics.""
He concluded by saying Denmark wants greater diversity in its business relationships with the UAE . ""There are opportunities, we need ambitious partners at the other side of the table, and we certainly get that from His Highness, from the free zones and ports here, and from individual companies, wherever there are opportunities, we will pursue them."""

CARACAS (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) The Venezuelan authorities consider it unacceptable the introduction of the US latest round of economic sanctions targeting the country's oil sector and Caracas will respond to them in an appropriate legal way, the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry said.
On Friday, the United States sanctioned 34 vessels tied to the Venezuelan PDVSA oil company , controlled by the government of President Nicolas Maduro, and two companies that allegedly transport oil from Venezuela to Cuba . Moreover, a senior official from the administration of US President Donald Trump said the latest round of sanctions was introduced at the request of the Venezuelan opposition-led National Assembly .
""The government of the Bolivarian Republic categorically rejects the US government 's attack on the Venezuelan oil industry and its economic sovereignty ... Venezuela [views the new sanctions] as the unacceptable, cynical and criminal decision of the Donald Trump administration that takes measures violating international law as well as those economic and commercial principles that [this administration] defends,"" the statement published by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza on Twitter , said.
The Foreign Ministry considers it to be ""surprising"" that the United States , a member of the World Trade Organization, that claims to be a defender of liberal principles, ""violates the most basic economic and trade rights in order to worsen the situation for the Venezuelan and Cuban people as well as for companies and trade associations that would have to enjoy the protection of international law. ""
The Foreign Ministry said that Caracas will respond to these sanctions in an appropriate legal way adding that these ""imperialist actions will not prevent the cooperation of free and independent peoples.""
Venezuela has long been suffering from an acute economic crisis exacerbated by the US sanctions against the country.
Moreover, since January , the country has seen political turmoil which erupted when opposition leader Juan Guaido, supported by the United States , proclaimed himself Venezuela 's interim president. Moreover, Washington froze PDVSA's US-based oil assets in a bid to step up pressure on Maduro.
Maduro, supported by China and Russia among other states, in his turn, slammed the US ""imperialist"" moves and accused Guaido of plotting to overthrow him with backing from Washington ."

Caracas, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Venezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido urged his supporters to demonstrate in the streets Saturday to maintain pressure on his rival President Nicolas Maduro, amid rising anger over the collapse of public services.
Thousands of opposition supporters are expected to march through the capital Caracas from 11:00 am on Saturday as Venezuela 's power struggle is exacerbated by massive blackouts and the collapse of water supplies.
Guaido, recognized as interim president by more than 50 countries, said in a Twitter message on Friday: ""Let's remain firm in the streets, this fight is for the lives of all Venezuelans."" Maduro, who blames US-backed sabotage on recent blackouts that deprived millions of power, has also called a pro-government march in Caracas , urging his supporters onto the streets for a "" March in defence of peace."" Guaido said earlier this week he feared abduction by government agents after pro-Maduro lawmakers stripped him of his parliamentary immunity on Tuesday and authorized the country's top court to prosecute him for proclaiming himself president.
The United States , among the first countries to recognize Guaido when the National Assembly leader proclaimed himself interim president on January 23, meanwhile kept up the international pressure on Maduro to step down.
Vice President Mike Pence announced fresh sanctions against 34 vessels belonging to Venezuela 's state oil company and two companies that ship crude to Cuba .
""The United States will continue to exert all diplomatic and economic pressure to bring about a peaceful transition to democracy ,"" Pence said in a speech in Houston , Texas.
""Venezuela's oil belongs to the Venezuelan people,"" he said.

"" Algeria is following the developments in Libya with great concern and calls on all the sides to be reasonable ... Any military escalation can hamper the ongoing [peace] efforts and slow down the process of settling the crisis which this brotherly neighboring country is going through,"" the ministry said in a statement, as quoted by El-Bilad newspaper.
The situation in Libya escalated on Thursday when Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, leading the Libyan National Army (LNA) ordered an offensive to retake Tripoli from the rival Government of National Accord (GNA). The LNA has already recaptured a number of settlements on its way to the capital, while GNA Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj has ordered troops backing him to use force if necessary.

Steven Adams slammed home a dunk on a pass from Westbrook to give Oklahoma City a 92-86 lead late in the third quarter.
Westbrook and Grant drained consecutive threes to make it 113-101 at the six minute mark of the fourth. Grant finished off a lob from Dennis Schroder to extend the lead to 14 and the Thunder never looked back.

New Delhi, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :India's alpha-male Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces three formidable women looking to spoil his chances of winning a new term in elections beginning next week.
AFP profiles them here: - 'Big sis' - Feisty and fiery Mamata Banerjee is the first female chief minister of the eastern state of West Bengal -- home to more people than Germany -- where Modi's right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) needs to do well.
The diminutive 64-year-old is one of Modi's most vociferous critics and has been working to cobble together an anti-Modi alliance .
""We can tell you one thing, that we are all together against the BJP government to save the nation,"" she says.
Banerjee, whose Trinamool Congress party rules the roost in West Bengal, has succeeded in keeping the BJP at bay so far despite the growing popularity of Modi.
The former national railways minister known as ""didi"", or big sister, enjoys a mass following not least because of her humble upbringing and lowbrow style.
""Banerjee is a very important leader. She is a struggler and a fighter to the core,"" Manisha Priyam, a Delhi-based political analyst, told AFP.
""If she does well in the state, she will be an important player in the formation of a government ."" A budding poet , painter and author -- Banerjee dons many hats. While her fans swear by her oil paintings and poems, critics deride her work as trash.
- Lower-caste champion - Known as the ""Dalit Queen"", Mayawati, 63, has had a colourful career as champion of lower caste Dalits. She wields considerable influence in 200-million-strong Uttar Pradesh, India 's most populous state and the election 's biggest prize .
Her Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was decimated in the 2014 polls but she has stitched up an alliance with her sworn enemy, the Samajwadi Party.
Analysts blamed her 2014 rout on her penchant for extravagance -- she once sent her private jet to pick up a pair of sandals according to leaked US cables -- and a controversy over building concrete parks full of statues of herself.
But if her party performs well this time, she could once again play a pivotal role in coalition negotiations.
She has hit the right notes so far, calling out the BJP for its ""divide and rule communal politics"" while cosying up with her once arch-rival Akhilesh Yadav who helms the Samajwadi Party.
""She does have a cadre which has been built up astutely. No politics can go ahead in UP by disrespecting her. No one can afford to take her lightly,"" said Priyam.
- Indira reborn? - The youngest scion of the famed Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra entered the family business of politics in January after years of steering clear -- and has made a splash.
And what could be a better battleground for the charismatic younger sister of PM-hopeful Rahul Gandhi than Uttar Pradesh -- the Hindu heartland where Modi has his core support base.
Priyanka, 47, has been tasked with reviving the Congress party in the state, where it was thrashed in 2014 polls -- winning just two of the 80 parliamentary seats in contrast to BJP's 71.
She seems to have taken the challenge head-on, launching her campaign in Modi's constituency of Varanasi on a motorboat that traversed the Ganges, a river revered by Hindus.
The symbolism was not lost on analysts, saying her move was aimed at snuffing out criticism that her Congress party has been ignoring majority Hindu voters and appeasing India 's 170 million Muslims .
Her fans say her common touch, as well as her appearance, are reminiscent of Indira Gandhi, her grandmother who was India 's first woman prime minister -- and a divisive figure assassinated in 1984. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

The top bid from France 's Engie and Canadian investment fund Caisse de Depot and Placement du Quebec for 90 percent of TAG includes $800 million in debts, Petrobras said in a statement.
""After adjustments, the transaction, when completed, will represent to Petrobras a total estimated value of US$8.6 billion ,"" it said.
""We clarify that the transaction is still subject to approval by Petrobras governance and competitive defense bodies. "" The deal represents Petrobras' biggest asset sale , Bloomberg reported. The company hopes to sell about $27 billion in assets to reduce its debt and focus on oil .
Petrobras, which has been at the center of the biggest corruption scandal in Brazil 's history, is also trying to repair its reputation with investors.
Large construction companies had paid bribes to politicians to secure contracts with Petrobras, which knowingly overpaid on those deals.
Petrobras registered its first profit in five years in 2018 . The company 's debt also dropped 18 percent to $69.4 billion ."

Bamako, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :At least 30,000 people marched in Mali 's capital Bamako Friday in protest at a surge of violence in the centre of the country before police used tear gas to disperse the crowds.
The demonstrators were also protesting against what they described as President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita's failure to stop the attacks.
The protest was called by Muslim religious leaders, organisations representing the Fulani herding community, opposition parties and civil society groups.
Fulani associations last week twice called, and postponed, demonstrations in Bamako to condemn the massacre of around 160 people in the village of Ogossagou on March 23.
The slaughter is alleged to have been carried out by members of the Dogon ethnic group -- a hunting and farming community with a long history of tension with the nomadic Fulani over access to land.
""My Fulani brothers, revenge is not the solution; my Dogon brothers, you must lay down your weapons,"" influential imam Mahmoud Dicko, who presides over the Islamic High Council ( IHC ), told the crowd.
Police said around 30,000 people took part in the march and mass prayer Friday, while organisers estimated the figure at 50,000.
Protesters, including women in black veils, shouted slogans hostile toward Keita, including ""IBK get out"", using the president's initials.
""Our children, our husbands and our parents are dying because of the bad government of IBK and his clan,"" Mariam Fomba, the widow of a soldier, told AFP.
""Enough is enough, we cannot continue with this regime."" Police later dispersed the demonstrators with tear gas when the protest began to head for the home of Prime Minister Soumeylou Boubeye Maiga, burning tyres and throwing stones at officers.
The Fulani association Kisal, in a statement, said: ""The Malian people came out today as one man , to say no to violence and no to ethnic cleansing."" The UN rights office said at least 153 people were killed and 73 injured in last month's attack in Mali 's restive Mopti region. Local officials and security sources later said the death toll had climbed to 160.
Mali has been struggling to return to stability since Islamist extremists took control of the country's north in early 2012, prompting a military intervention by France .
Extremism and lawlessness continue, sharpening ancient rivalries in the ethnic mosaic of central Mali .
On Thursday, a UN official said Mali was in dire need of humanitarian aid, with more than three million people requiring food and basic assistance.
Jihadist attacks have also spread to Burkina Faso , Chad and Niger , forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Washington, April 5 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :The United States on Friday announced sanctions on ships of Venezuela 's state oil company and companies that link it to key ally Cuba , hoping to cut off vital lifelines for President Nicolas Maduro.
Vice President Mike Pence unveiled the latest measures in Washington 's bid to oust Maduro, a leftist firebrand who has nonetheless held on to power for more than two months, and vowed further pressure on Cuba -- a bugbear of the United States for a half-century.
""Venezuela's oil belongs to the Venezuelan people,"" Pence said in a speech at Rice University in Houston .
""Those looking on should know this: All options are on the table. And Nicolas Maduro would do well not to test the resolve of the United States of America,"" he said.
""The United States will continue to exert all diplomatic and economic pressure to bring about a peaceful transition to democracy ,"" he said.
The Treasury Department said it was designating 34 vessels of state oil company PDVSA as blocked property, meaning that the United States will prohibit all transactions with them.
It also targeted a tanker that ships crude oil from Venezuela to Cuba , the Despina Andrianna, as well as two shipping companies that own or register the vessel. One is based in Liberia and the other in Greece , one of the sole Western nations that backs Maduro.
Pence also hinted that President Donald Trump 's administration will take further action against Cuba as it considers allowing exiles to sue over property seized by the communist authorities.
""In the coming weeks, the United States will be taking even stronger action against Cuba . In this administration, I promise you, it will always be Que Viva Cuba Libre,"" he said, using the Spanish for ""Long Live Free Cuba ."" The push on Cuba is a sharp change from the previous administration of Barack Obama , who said that the longtime US effort to isolate the island had failed and re-established diplomatic relations.
A Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States estimated that Venezuela delivered 50,000 barrels a day to Cuba -- a critical amount for the island, which in turn provides security, intelligence and other services for Maduro.
""By severely impacting the shipment of that oil and the ability to get that oil from Venezuela to Cuba , there is going to be a recalibration of that relationship. This is the first step in the pressure,"" the official said.
But Maduro also still enjoys support from China , which has lent $60 billion over the past decade to Venezuela , and Russia , which has sent military experts to Caracas and says the United States is attempting a coup.
The United States itself was a key market for Venezuelan oil through Citgo, a subsidiary of PDVSA, but Washington has forced the operator to place earnings in a blocked account. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

New York, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :The art of rock and roll is getting its due at an upcoming show at New York 's Met museum, which is decking its halls with instruments from the genre's greats.
The storied Manhattan institution has amassed a staggering collection of rock memorabilia and instruments from superstars including Chuck Berry, Eric Clapton, Prince, Joan Jett, Joni Mitchell , Bob Dylan, Keith Richards, Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Presley for the show ""Play It Loud: Instruments of Rock & Roll,"" set to open Monday.
The exhibit put on in partnership with the Cleveland-based Rock & Roll Hall of Fame celebrates ""tools of innovation and outstanding artistic innovation,"" Max Hollein, the Metropolitan Museum's director, told journalists at a preview.
The more than 130 instruments from 1939-2017 in the show are organized to depict how musicians used and advanced emerging technologies throughout the 20th century to create new sounds and styles.
In addition to instruments, the Met is displaying flamboyant costumes of rockers along with show memorabilia like gig posters and even the remnants of smashed guitars.
""Instruments are some of the most personal objects connected to musicians, but as audience members we are primarily used to seeing them from far away, up on a stage in performance."" said Jayson Kerr Dobney, the show's curator.
""This exhibition will provide a rare opportunity to examine some of rock and roll's most iconic objects up close."" - 'Holy grail' - Steve Miller -- whose Steve Miller Band is known for such hits as ""The Joker"" and ""Fly Like An Eagle "" -- told journalists that ""he was stunned by the power and the elegance and the intelligence"" of the show, which he loaned several guitars to.
He praised curators for their work to ""cut through years of nonsense designed to trivialize these instruments. "" Led Zeppelin's Jimmy Page, whose iconic ""Stairway to Heaven"" guitar is on display, voiced awe at making it into the Met, which he dubbed ""the holy grail."" ""For me to be here... I never would've even dreamt about it, even as a kid,"" Page said. ""I was really keen to be able to loan whatever I could to make it come alive."" The show came under some criticism when it was announced, because the initial teaser before the full list of more than 80 artists was released spotlighted just one woman , Grammy-winning contemporary rocker St. Vincent.
Indie rockstar Neko Case voiced her anger, tweeting ""Do you really think NO OTHER WOMEN , OR FEMALE IDENTIFYING performers contributed to rock n' roll?"" But the show was ultimately more inclusive than it first appeared, and Dobney addressed the gender issue in the show's catalog: ""Rock and roll was for many years a boys' club,"" he writes with Hall of Fame curator Craig Inciardi.
""In the 1950s and 1960s, and even beyond, the women in rock and roll bands, were primarily limited to vocals, the reason they were under-represented in these pages."" Along with Jett and Mitchell a number of female performers are represented including Patti Smith and Lady Gaga, whose enormous futuristic piano is featured in the exhibit to run from April 8 until October 1.
At the show's preview Don Felder of The Eagles played the intricate solo from the band's hit "" Hotel California."" He said that after arriving in New York as a 20-something, ""the very first thing I did the following day is I came to the Met.""""It's such an incredible honor that 50 years later, this guitar would be hanging"" here, Felder said of his double-neck Arctic White instrument."

In an editorial on Saturday, the Gulf news added, ""As present-day stewards of this green planet, our actions and inaction are harming it for the generations to come.""
""The annual State of Global Air report, published on Wednesday, should serve as a clarion call that we must act urgently to improve the quality of our air. Why? Because lives literally depend on it, and the young are most vulnerable. Simply put, the life expectancy of children born today will be shortened by 20 months on average by simply inhaling the toxic air that is widespread across the globe.
"" Poor air quality was responsible for one in 10 early deaths in 2017 alone, according to the study. And things certainly haven’t improved since then,"" the English language daily continued.
It added, ""Here, between the middle East and South Asia , the issue of poor air quality is acute. It’s a bigger killer than malaria and road traffic accidents and is almost akin to the death rates resulting from smoking.""
""In sub-Saharan Africa , every new person born today will likely live 24 months less than expected and poor air quality - caused by traffic , industrial emissions, poor indoor air and smoke from cooking fires - is to blame,"" concluded the Dubai-based daily."

New York, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :A movie produced by a Christian studio about a former employee of an organization that provides abortions who became a ""pro-life"" activist is proving to be a surprising box office hit.
""Unplanned,"" which was released in theaters on March 29, has pulled in more than 8.6 million Dollars in North America, according to Box Office Mojo.
That put the film in an unexpected fourth place for the week behind the much bigger budget pictures ""Dumbo,"" ""Us,"" and ""Captain Marvel."" ""Unplanned"" comes amid a resurgent campaign in the United States by opponents of abortion, which was legalized in the United States in a landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision.
Among those promoting the movie has been the deeply religious vice president, Mike Pence.
""So good to see movie theaters across the country showing @UnplannedMovie,"" Pence tweeted. ""More & more Americans are embracing the sanctity of life because of powerful stories like this one."" Building on its early buzz, ""Unplanned"" is to be shown in more than 1,500 theaters across the United States this weekend, up from 1,059 the weekend of its release.
- 'R' rating - Produced by the self-described Christian studio Pure Flix, ""Unplanned"" was launched with little advertising because most cable tv channels reportedly refused to air ads for the film .
Anti-abortion groups have denounced this as part of an orchestrated campaign which they claim also included the film being attributed an ""R"" rating by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).
An ""R"" rating requires anyone under the age of 17 going to a movie to be accompanied by a parent or adult guardian.
Fueling the criticism was the brief suspension by Twitter of the movie 's account, which the company attributed to a technical problem.
Writing in The Washington Post , columnist Marc Thiessen called ""Unplanned"" the "" movie abortion supporters don't want you to see. "" ""Unplanned"" is based on a book by the same name by Abby Johnson, a former director of an abortion clinic in Bryan , Texas, run by Planned Parenthood, the largest family planning organization in the United States .
Johnson recounts in the book how she had a ""spiritual awakening"" after personally assisting with an abortion.
- 'Propaganda' - ""Unplanned"" has been dismissed by some critics as propaganda.
""There have been films that treated Nazi doctors conducting evil experiments in concentration camps more sympathetically,"" said Frank Scheck in The Hollywood Reporter.
Writing in the trade publication Variety, Owen Gleiberman said ""Unplanned"" ""isn't a good movie , but it's effective propaganda."" ""'Unplanned' preaches to the pro-life choir, and it does so by making a case against abortion that's absolutist and extreme,"" Gleiberman said.
The movie 's co-director Cary Solomon shrugged off the criticism.
""We didn't turn this into a propaganda piece,"" Solomon said in an interview with AFP. ""We refused to do that.
""We wanted to tell a true life story and let the truth be interpreted by people that see it,"" he said.
""It's an exact retelling of the book,"" Solomon said. ""Everything in the movie is based on her true story.
""We didn't fabricate anything, we didn't make anything up."" Most US states allow abortion up until 24 weeks.
But there have been attempts in a number of states to restrict the practice.
In Georgia , for example, state lawmakers last month passed a bill that would ban abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks.
The bill is awaiting signature by the governor and is expected to be challenged in the courts. Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

In all , 42 activists who were serving prison terms of up to 20 years had their sentences confirmed by the court in the western city of Casablanca .
The ruling was met with cries from relatives of ""long live the people"" and ""corrupt state"".
The Al-Hirak al-Shaabi, or ""Popular Movement"", protests took hold of the country's northern Rif region in October 2016 .
The social unrest was sparked by the death of a fisherman and spiralled into a wave of demonstrations demanding more development in the neglected region and railing against corruption and unemployment.
Authorities accused the activists, who were first sentenced in June last year, of having separatist aims.
The movement's leader Nasser Zefzafi and three others received sentences of 20 years for threatening the security of the state.
Other sentences confirmed on appeal range from one to 15 years."

Sydney, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - APP - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :A fast-rising teen sensation has been breaking junior athletics records this week, sparking a tug-of-war between Australia and France to secure his services for the 2024 Paris Olympics , and even the Tokyo Games next year.
Sasha Zhoya, 16, burst onto the scene at the Australian Athletics Championships in Sydney , winning the under-20 pole vault with a height of 5.56 metres, just shy of the qualifying standard for the world championships.
No 16-year-old has ever jumped higher.
The Perth-born Zhoya also defied a headwind to clock 13.05 seconds and win the under-18 110m hurdles -- another under-16 world best .
That came a day after he clinched gold in the under-20 200m, finishing in 21.18, narrowly outside the Australian record.
John Steffenson, who won silver with Australia in the 4x400m relay at the 2004 Athens Olympics , said his potential was ""out of this world "".
""Right now, whatever he wants to achieve he will achieve, it's up to him. There's no ceiling,"" he told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Saturday.
While his exploits have athletics commentators in Australia fawning, France has also taken notice with Zhoya eligible for both countries.
He was born and brought in Australia , but his mother is French and he has until December to decide which country to represent at the 2020 world junior championships -- and potentially the Tokyo Olympics next year.
""They're both offering some amazing things,"" he told reporters of Australia and France .
""I want to keep a clear head and leave that decision until later in the year.
""Right now it's stressful; I'm trying to put it in the back of my mind and not think about it during comps. But it's definitely popping into my head every 30 seconds."" Zhoya, who sports diamond studs in both ears, is fast-earning a reputation for his swagger and readily admits his ambition is to become one the biggest Names in track and field -- citing sprint king Usain Bolt as an inspiration.
""To be No.1 in the world out of everyone that does athletics, that's the dream. I want to show the world what I can do,"" he told the West Australian newspaper in December .
""Not everyone can be Usain Bolt, but I'm going to work my butt off to be Usain Bolt as Sasha Zhoya."""

Brussels, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Brussels' famous landmark, the Manneken-Pis, is an insouciant celebration of going with the flow -- but even carefree little boys can go too far.
City authorities recently discovered that a fault in the 400-year-old statue's plumbing was causing him to pee away 2.5 tonnes of water a day.
In 2019 , such waste is an environmental no-no.
A missing part in the guttering under the diminutive statue's fountain sent his public urination directly down the drain.
It may not be the most overwhelming torrent, but it was building up over time -- to the equivalent daily water use of five Belgian households.
No-one is quite sure how long Brussels ' celebrity has been suffering the leak. ""We prefer to look to the future,"" says city engineer Regis Callens.
And the future is recycling. Henceforth, the Manneken's pee will loop through a recuperation tank to be pumped back through his bronze bladder.
""So it's really a closed circuit. There's no more waste,"" says Callens, giving journalists a tour of the hidden pipework.
Brussels was able to detect the anomalous overflow thanks to new electronic monitors dotted around the municipal system.
""We want to develop a real policy of limiting waste,"" said the city's new mayor, Benoit Hellings, from the green Ecolo party."

MEXICO CITY (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez denounced the United States ' latest round of economic sanctions targeting Venezuela 's oil sector as ""economic piracy.""
On Friday, the United States sanctioned 34 vessels tied to the Venezuelan PDVSA oil company , controlled by the government of President Nicolas Maduro, and two companies that allegedly transport oil from Venezuela to Cuba . Moreover, a senior official from the administration of US President Donald Trump said the latest round of sanctions was introduced at the request of the Venezuelan opposition-led National Assembly .
""I denounce the escalation of #US ""Monroeist"" aggressions against #OurAmerica and the use of scandalous lies against #Cuba. I strongly reject the new economic piracy measures adopted by Washington to damage #Venezuela and steal its resources. They'll fail,"" Rodriguez wrote on Twitter on Friday.
Venezuela has long been suffering from an acute economic crisis exacerbated by the US sanctions against the country.
Moreover, since January , the country has seen political turmoil which erupted when opposition leader Juan Guaido, supported by the United States , proclaimed himself Venezuela 's interim president. Moreover, Washington froze PDVSA's US-based oil assets in a bid to step up pressure on Maduro.
Maduro, supported by China and Russia among other states, in his turn, slammed the US ""imperialist"" moves and accused Guaido of plotting to overthrow him with backing from Washington ."

QUITO (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) Carlos Poveda, a lawyer of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in Ecuador , told Sputnik that he considered certain moves by the Ecuadorian authorities as signs of their intention to expel the activist from his asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London , where he has been living since 2012.
On Thursday, the whistleblowing platform quoted a high-level source in Ecuador as saying Assange would be expelled from the embassy within ""hours to days."" WikiLeaks added that Quito had an agreement with the UK government for Assange's arrest. The suggestion followed the statement by Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno that the activist's fate would be decided in the short term. Both Moreno and Foreign Minister Jose Valencia have pointed to the alleged role of WikiLeaks and Assange in the leak of the so-called INA papers that led to a corruption scandal involving the president. Moreover, Ecuador 's Attorney General Inigo Salvador reportedly said on Thursday the authorities had offered Assange to either surrender to London or stay in the embassy under the strict rules imposed on him by Quito .
""There are certain signs [of the Ecuadorian authorities' readiness to end Assange's asylum] which are constantly and daily being created by the president, the foreign minister and the attorney general. This makes us predict such a development,"" Poveda said.
Moreno came to power in May 2017 and since then, he has repeatedly said he wanted to settle the issue of Assange's status through legal measures. Last December , Moreno said he was uncomfortable with Assange staying in the embassy for so long and suggested that the whistleblower could leave the facility, but he would face jail time in the United Kingdom for violating bail terms.
Assange has said he was remaining inside the embassy for years because of fear of being extradited to the United States due to his role in high-profile leaks of classified US documents. Moreover, media reported that Quito had allegedly reached an agreement with Washington to extradite Assange in return for some debt relief.
The whistleblower entered the embassy after he was released on bail by the UK authorities in a Swedish-led investigation into an alleged sexual assault committed by Assange. The Swedish authorities dropped their charges against the Australian activist in 2017 . Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

Berlin, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Right-wing populist parties are gearing up to campaign for European Parliament elections next month, but policy differences and the Brexit drama threaten their dream to ""unite the right"".
Many fear the May 26 vote will be a wake-up call for Brussels on the reality that Europe 's anti-immigration and blood-and-soil patriotic forces have moved from the fringes to the mainstream.
Once considered outsiders, they could now end up with one fifth or more of the seats, allowing them to shift the tone of political discourse and make a claim for legitimacy.
Key players are Marine Le Pen's National Rally (NR) in France and the Italian League of Matteo Salvini, who is hosting a meeting of like-minded right-wing groups in Milan on Monday.
In the EU's top economy, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) has become the biggest opposition party by railing against Chancellor Angela Merkel and her 2015 decision to allow a mass influx of asylum seekers.
On Saturday the AfD will gather from 1500 GMT in the city of Offenburg to present its election programme, which calls for ""a Europe of fatherlands"" and opposes the EU's immigration, financial and climate policies.
On Monday in Milan , Italian deputy PM Salvini will follow up and gather allies from across Europe to try to lay the foundations for a future hard-right grouping in the now 751-member European Parliament .
Salvini and Le Pen also agreed to call another meeting in May , after they met in Paris on Friday, a NR source said.

Butembo, DR Congo, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Evelyne was one of the first victims of the Ebola epidemic which broke out in eastern DR Congo last August , the second deadliest in its known history.
Against the odds, the nurse not only survived the haemorrhagic virus, whose outbreak has claimed nearly 700 lives, but has also returned to the fray.
After receiving a vaccination, Evelyne is now tending Ebola-affected children -- part of a campaign that places social skills at the heart of the effort to roll back the dreaded disease.
At an Ebola treatment centre, Evelyne (her name has been changed for the purposes of this story) cradles a seven-month-old baby girl called Sarah.
She provides the infant with desperately-needed human contact -- visitors are kept behind protective screens to prevent them from coming into contact with the body fluids of patients who may have the virus.
""The first test was negative,"" Evelyne calls out. ""We are waiting for the results of the second."" The UN children's agency UNICEF says 30 percent of the 683 deaths registered so far are children or aged under 18 years.
Many children are collateral victims, such as Luc, a five-year-old boy playing football with Consolee Katsiwa, a psychologist in a creche run by UNICEF.
His mother died of Ebola a day earlier, Katsiwa said.
""We are keeping him under observation since he was in direct contact with his mother,"" she said, adding that he would be monitored for 21 days -- the time taken for the virus to incubate.
""If he shows signs of the disease... he could contaminate others in his community."" At a school in Butembo , five pupils carefully take notes during an Ebola awareness programme.
One of the speakers is Huguette, a 24-year-old woman who was cured after being infected following an Ebola death in January .
""I would like to raise awareness among my brothers in Butembo , to tell them that the disease exists, that it is a reality and that it's not stuff that has been invented.
""If you don't head for the Ebola treatment centre you will die. But if you go there at the very early stages, you will survive like me,"" she said."

New York, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :Boeing announced Friday it would cut the production schedule of its 737 aircraft line following the two recent crashes that have seen the 737 MAX grounded worldwide.
The aerospace giant plans to trim production to 42 planes per month, down from 52 per month, starting in mid-April. Boeing shares tumbled after the disclosure, which was released just after the closing bell on Wall Street.
Boeing also announced it was establishing an advisory panel to review its company-wide policies for designing and developing planes.
The Federal Aviation Administration earlier this week said more work was needed before the aerospace giant could even submit a proposed fix that is believed to be a factor in the disasters.
Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg described the production cut as temporary and said it would not affect current employment levels for the 737 and related programs.
""We are coordinating closely with our customers as we work through plans to mitigate the impact of this adjustment,"" Muilenburg said in a statement.
""We will also work directly with our suppliers on their production plans to minimize operational disruption and financial impact of the production rate change."" Boeing has continued to manufacture 737s since the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash killed 157 people, the second deadly crash in five months after an October 2018 Lion Air crash killed 189 people.
However, Boeing has been unable to make deliveries of the planes to customers, a key stoppage that will dent revenues. Boeing is scheduled to report first-quarter results on April 24.
On Thursday, an initial report by the Ethiopia Transport Ministry found that the crew of the doomed plane repeatedly followed procedures recommended by Boeing, confirming concerns about the flight control system on the plane.
Scrutiny has centered on the plane's anti-stall system, Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which is believed to be at least partly at fault.
The Washington Post on Thursday that US regulators had ordered Boeing to fix a second flight-control problem, not related to MCAS, but which officials nevertheless deemed critical to flight safety.
The head of the FAA faced tough questioning from a Senate panel last month. Top Boeing officials are expected at a follow-up hearing that could also be contentious.
Boeing said the new advisory panel will be led by retired US Navy Admiral Edmund Giambastiani, former vice chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff.
""The committee will confirm the effectiveness of our policies and processes for assuring the highest level of safety on the 737 MAX program, as well as our other airplane programs, and recommend improvements to our policies and procedures,"" Muilenburg said.
""Safety is our responsibility and we own it.""Shares of Boeing fell 2.3 percent to $382.92 in after-hours trading."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) Russia 's position on Israeli airstrikes against Syria has not reversed and Moscow still calls for respecting the sovereignty of Damascus , Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview released on Saturday.
The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said that the practice of random airstrikes on the territory of Syria should be put to rest.
""There are no changes in our principled position regarding attacks on the Syrian territory. Our attitude towards this matter has always been clearly expressed. We proceed from the need to strictly respect the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Syria ,"" Lavrov told the Al-Ahram newspaper, when asked whether Moscow 's position on the continuing strikes by Israel against Syria had changed as some reports suggested that Russia had softened its stance.
Israel has been conducting air raids in Syria against Hezbollah targets, as it traditionally views the movement's presence in Lebanon and Syria as a threat to its national security since it is backed by Iran , Israel 's main rival in the region.
At the same time, Russia-Israel relations were put to test following the fatal crash of the Russian Il-20 plane in September 2018 that the Russian Defense Ministry held the Israeli Air Force responsible for. The plane was downed by a missile launched by Syria 's air defense system targeting Israeli F-16 jets that were carrying out airstrikes in Syrian Latakia province. The incident claimed the lives of 15 Russian servicemen.
A high-ranking source in the Israeli government told reporters in February that the crisis in the bilateral relations ended after a meeting had been held between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir Putin . Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) The protracted crisis in Libya is the result of direct intervention by NATO , which led the country into chaos and made it a source of instability, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said.
""The protracted crisis in Libya is a direct consequence of NATO 's illegitimate military intervention. As a result, this country was plunged into chaos, became a source of regional instability, a hotbed of terrorism,"" Lavrov said in an interview with the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram on the eve of his visit to Cairo .
Tensions are on the rise in the North African nation after the Libyan National Army (LNA), led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, moved west and started clashing with rival forces just south of the capital Tripoli . On Friday, the LNA again started advancing on the capital.
Libya has been split up in two since a NATO-led military intervention deposed its longtime ruler, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011. The UN-backed Government of National Accord headed by Fayez Sarraj in the capital of Tripoli is rivaled by a Tobruk-based parliament in the east, which support Haftar."

MOSCOW (UrduPoint News / Sputnik - 06th April, 2019) Moscow opposes transforming Syria into an arena of military confrontation between Syria 's neighboring states, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, referring to the repeated Israeli raids on the crisis-affected nation.
""We stand against turning the country [Syria] into an arena for armed confrontation between various regional players,"" the minister said in an interview with Egyptian Al-Ahram daily newspaper, when asked about Moscow 's position on Israeli raids against Syria .
The foreign minister noted that Russia emphasizes the importance of preventing spikes in tensions and dangerous escalation in Syria . Such bursts may lead to negative consequences not only for neighboring countries, but for the whole middle East, he added.
Tensions between Israel and Syria have been heating up in recent years. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) repeatedly strike Iranian and Syrian targets in Syria , including air defense batteries, and claim to have intercepted Iranian drones crossing from Syria to Israel .
In January this year Israel unleashed a series of massive airstrikes on Syria targeting what it said were Iranian-linked munitions depots, intelligence sites, a training camp and warehouses at Damascus International Airport . Back then the Russian foreign ministry stressed that such a practice should be stopped and Syria should not be allowed to become an arena for settling geopolitical accounts.
In February Israeli attacks on the southwestern Syrian province of Quneitra damaged a local hospital, while in late March Israeli air raids targeted an area near the city of Aleppo , also causing damage.
The recent calls from US President Donald Trump to recognize ""Israel's sovereignty"" over the disputed Golan Heights added fuel to the fire . Damascus insists that the US administration has no right to decide the fate of the Syrian occupied territories."

Back in 2016 , Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed holding a meeting with no preconditions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in Moscow .

The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly slammed the US decision to recognize the Golan, which is the strategic area on the Syrian-Israeli border , as a part of Israel 's territory. The ministry's spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said on Thursday that the move eroded the system of international law.
""Russia's position on the Golan Heights issue has remained unchanged. Of course, it remains a territory of Syria ,"" Lavrov said in an interview with the Egyptian Al-Ahram newspaper ahead of his visit to Cairo .
In March , US President Donald Trump expressed his readiness to recognize Israel 's sovereignty over the Golan and subsequently signed an executive order formally recognizing the area as a part of Israel .
The document, which has been widely regarded as a way of propelling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's re-election bid ahead of the April 9 parliamentary vote , has been condemned by a lot of countries.

Paris, April 6 (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Apr, 2019 ) :The world , it seems, is soon to see the first picture of a black hole.
On Wednesday, astronomers across the globe will hold ""six major press conferences"" simultaneously to announce the first results of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), which was designed precisely for that purpose.
It has been a long wait.
Of all the forces or objects in the Universe that we cannot see -- including dark energy and dark matter -- none has frustrated human curiosity so much as the invisible maws that shred and swallow stars like so many specks of dust.
Astronomers began speculating about these omnivorous ""dark stars"" in the 1700s, and since then indirect evidence has slowly accumulated.
""More than 50 years ago, scientists saw that there was something very bright at the centre of our galaxy,"" Paul McNamara, an astrophysicist at the European Space Agency and an expert on black holes, told AFP.
""It has a gravitational pull strong enough to make stars orbit around it very quickly -- as fast as 20 years."" To put that in perspective, our Solar System takes about 230 million years to circle the centre of the Milky Way.
Eventually, astronomers speculated that these bright spots were in fact ""black holes"" -- a term coined by American physicist John Archibald Wheeler in the mid-1960s -- surrounded by a swirling band of white-hot gas and plasma.
At the inner edge of these luminous accretion disks, things abruptly go dark.
""The event horizon"" -- a.k.a. the point-of-no-return -- ""is not a physical barrier, you couldn't stand on it,"" McNamara explained.
""If you're on the inside of it, you can't escape because you would need infinite energy. And if you are on the other side, you can -- in principle."" - A golf ball on the moon - At its centre, the mass of a black hole is compressed into a single, zero-dimensional point.
The distance between this so-called ""singularity"" and the event horizon is the radius, or half the width, of a black hole.
The EHT that collected the data for the first-ever image is unlike any ever devised.
""Instead of constructing a giant telescope -- which would collapse under its own weight -- we combined several observatories as if they were fragments of a giant mirror,"" Michael Bremer, an astronomer at the Institute for Millimetric Radio Astronomy in Grenoble , told AFP.
In April 2017 , eight such radio telescopes scattered across the globe -- in Hawaii, Arizona, Spain , Mexico , Chile , and the South Pole -- were trained on two black holes in very different corners of the Universe to collect data.
Studies that could be unveiled next week are likely to zoom in on one or the other.
Oddsmakers favour Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the centre of our own elliptical galaxy that first caught the eye of astronomers.
Sag A* has four million times the mass of our sun, which means that the black hole is generates is about 44 million kilometres across.
That may sound like a big target, but for the telescope array on Earth some 26,000 light-years (or 245 trillion kilometres) away, it's like trying to photograph a golf ball on the Moon.
- Testing Einstein - The other candidate is a monster black hole -- 1,500 times more massive even than Sag A* -- in an elliptical galaxy known as M87.
It's also a lot farther from Earth, but distance and size balance out, making it roughly as easy (or difficult) to pinpoint.
One reason this dark horse might be the one revealed next week is light smog within the Milky Way.
""We are sitting in the plain of our galaxy -- you have to look through all the stars and dust to get to the centre,"" said McNamara.
The data collected by the far-flung telescope array still had to be collected and collated.
""The imaging algorithms we developed fill the gaps of data we are missing in order to reconstruct a picture of a black hole,"" the team said on their website.
Astrophysicists not involved in the project, including McNamara, are eagerly -- perhaps anxiously -- waiting to see if the findings challenge Einstein's theory of general relativity, which has never been tested on this scale.
Breakthrough observations in 2015 that earned the scientists involved a Nobel prize used gravitational wave detectors to track two black holes smashing together.
As they merged, ripples in the curvatures of time-space creating a unique, and detectable, signature.
""Einstein's theory of general relativity says that this is exactly what should happen,"" said McNamara.
But those were tiny black holes -- only 60 times more massive than the Sun -- compared to either of the ones under the gaze of the EHT.
""Maybe the ones that are millions of times more massive are different -- we just don't know yet."" Facebook Twitter Google + Related Topics"
