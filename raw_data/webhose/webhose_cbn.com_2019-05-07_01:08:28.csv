"Gay Mayor Joins Democrat Presidential Race, Surging to 3rd After Attacking Pence's Christian Faith",www.cbn.com,Gabe LaMonica,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/gay-mayor-joins-democrat-presidential-race-surging-to-3rd-after-attacking-pences-christian-faith,"A long-shot Democratic candidate for 2020 is steadily climbing in the polls. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg officially announced his run for president Sunday.
""It is time to walk away from the politics of the past and toward something totally different. So that's why I'm here today. I'm here to join you to make a little news. My name is Pete Buttigieg. They call me Mayor Pete. I am a proud son of South Bend Indiana and I am running for president of the United States.""
""I'm here to make the case that a millennial Midwestern mayor might be exactly what we need,"" he said.
The latest Monmouth University poll shows Buttigieg has risen to third place at 9 percent among Iowa caucus-goers. Vice President Joe Biden is in first place with 27 percent of support even though he still has yet to announce whether he's running. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is in second with 16 percent.
A former intelligence officer and veteran of the war in Afghanistan, Buttigieg is a Rhodes Scholar who speaks eight languages and is a concert pianist.
Buttigieg has made waves in recent days, promoting his candidacy by attacking the Christian faith of Vice President Mike Pence.
If elected, the 37-year-old South Bend mayor would beat out Teddy Roosevelt and JFK as the nation's youngest president. He would also become the first homosexual president and the first president with a husband.
""When I was younger I would have done anything to not be gay,"" he said recently.
Now he says he's proud of it, claiming God made him this way, and he's attacking Pence for his biblical beliefs about sexuality. ""Your quarrel sir, is with my Creator,"" Buttigieg said.
He's pitting the freedom of religion against freedom from discrimination. ""That's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand, that if you've gotta problem with who I am, your problem is not with me,"" he said.
After Buttigieg decided to make the vice president his top target, Pence responded saying, ""I think Pete's quarrel is with the First Amendment. All of us in this country have a right to our religious beliefs.""
""I hope that Pete will offer more to the American people than attacks on my Christian faith,"" Pence said in a CNN interview.
As former Indiana governor, Pence worked closely with mayor of South Bend.
""My family and I have a view of marriage that's informed by our faith and we stand by that, but that doesn't mean that we're critical of anyone else who has a different point of view,"" Pence said in a CNBC interview.
Buttigieg's point of view places himself at the intersection of sexuality and religion. ""I'm not critical of his faith, I'm critical of bad policies,"" he claimed.
And it's the mayor's policies that will come under the spotlight in a presidential run. ""Some people I think voted to burn the house down because they'd seen how for years Democrat and Republican presidencies produced economic and social and political results that let them down.""
Buttigieg has defended liberal visions like the green new deal. He also supports a health care public option and even expanding the Supreme Court to up to 15 members - an idea which some liberals have embraced since the current court is slightly conservative."
'Made in the Image of God': How Indiana's Pro-Life Laws Could Change US Abortion Battle,www.cbn.com,Paul Strand,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/made-in-the-image-of-god-how-indianas-pro-life-laws-could-change-us-abortion-battle,"INDIANAPOLIS – The battle over abortion is in high gear in state legislatures across the nation. Lawmakers like those here in Indiana keep churning out measure after measure to limit abortion. And those measures keep getting challenged in court.
But pro-life forces say these court battles are worth it. That's because if a case ends up getting appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court, it could affect the whole country.
One such Indiana case dealing with civil rights for the unborn was struck down last year by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
Mike Fichter, head of Indiana Right to Life, told CBN News, ""Indiana's actually the only state that's passed a law that protects unborn children based upon their civil rights, that prohibits abortion based upon a child's color of his skin, sex, national origin, disability or Down's Syndrome. The Court has never addressed the civil rights of unborn children before.""
So if the Supreme Court decides to take up the case, Fichter said, ""This is historic.""
Case Could Have a Big Impact on Limiting Legalized Abortion
ACLU of Indiana's lead attorney Kenneth Falk complained if the Court decides to rule on the case, that could potentially open the door for states to limit abortions.
He said, ""The state of Indiana is saying 'prior to viability we have the right to tell you whether or not you can get an abortion.' And once you admit that, then there's no limit to how the state can interfere with that right.""
But though that may dismay Falk, it's the goal of these pro-life Indiana legislators: a fundamental change to Roe v Wade, the ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.
Fichter said, ""We believe that if they accept this appeal, it's a clear sign that the Supreme Court is willing to reconsider Roe. And we hope that the end of Roe v Wade comes from Indiana.""
Ultrasound Laws: Do They Change Minds or Not?
The high court may also take up another state measure.
Fichter explained, ""Indiana's ultrasound law requires that any woman considering an abortion in Indiana must have an opportunity to see an ultrasound of her unborn baby at least 18 hours before she can have an abortion.""
Constitutional law attorney Jenna Ellis says research shows an ultrasound often changes a woman's mind as she sees the baby and hears its heartbeat.
Ellis argued, ""When women see the life of their child and the heartbeat that's beating inside of them, there is still a fundamental conscience that God gives us. And most women can't negate that and suppress it to the point that they are willing to kill their child.""
Falk said that's questionable and he's seen other contradictory research.
Statistics show that most women when they review the ultrasound don't change their mind,"" he insisted, adding, ""Many women refuse to review the ultrasound, which they're allowed to under Indiana law.""
He suspects this law insisting an ultrasound happen 18 hours or more before an abortion was just an attempt to make getting that abortion harder.
Balancing Benefits and Burdens
He argued because of that law, ""Women were having to travel great distances, hundreds and hundreds of miles twice to get abortions. And what the evidence showed in this case was this prevented women from obtaining abortions.""
Which is why the ACLU attorney believes a court ruled against the ultrasound measure - based on the suspicion Indiana was just trying to make it more difficult to get an abortion.
As Falk put it, ""The state had no good reason for changing the ultrasound requirement to an 18-hour requirement. And abortion jurisprudence today requires you to balance the burdens on women getting an abortion with the benefits to the state. And the court found there was very little if any benefit and lots of burden.""
Indiana Right to Life's Fichter countered, ""Human life is of interest to any state. So it is of interest to the state of Indiana. In addition to that, Indiana law requires that childbirth is encouraged over abortions. So this is directly of interest to the state of Indiana.""
Injunction 'Literally Costing Lives'
And he bemoaned how a court slapping an injunction on the ultrasound law is having a deadly impact, saying, ""As soon as the injunction went into effect, we've seen a large spike in abortions in the state of Indiana. So we know that it informs women. We know that it helps women choose life. The fact that it has an injunction on it right now is literally costing lives in the state of Indiana. So it's extremely important that this case is heard by the Supreme Court.""
Ellis insists ultrasounds can be crucial game-changers in moving women away from abortion, saying, ""If we're giving women all of the information and we're showing a woman through advanced medical technology 'this isn't just a glob of cells in you, this is a living human being that is a separate human being made in the image of God,' then we're going to see more and more women not even choose to make that choice.""
Ellis continued, ""What the Founders said in the Declaration was that truth is self-evident. And that's what we see in ultrasounds: we see the self-evident fact that this is a human being.""
Granting the Unborn Dignity Even in Death
Also, the Court is considering whether to rule on an Indiana measure Fichter said would treat aborted babies like they were indeed human beings.
He stated, ""It's saying the remains of an unborn child that's been aborted are not just garbage to throw into a landfill – which, unfortunately, that's what happens right now.""
The ACLU's Falk pointed out the measure doesn't really put fetal remains on an equal par with humans who were born and died later, because this measure still allows those fetal remains to be treated differently than any other human's body.
""The state has to have a rational reason for doing what it's doing, and what the state is saying is 'we want to require these remains be honored as if they were a person,'"" Falk explained. ""One of the problems with the law is that it has within it contradictions to the state's own purpose.""
For instance, Falk stated, ""What the law says is if the woman wants to take the fetal remains or tissue remaining after an abortion or miscarriage home with them and throw it away, they can. The law states the remains can be cremated en masse, which you can't do with a human body.""
'It's Not Just a Clump of Cells'
Ellis, though, is hopeful if the Court takes up this fetal remains measure, it could have an important impact.
""The human remains of an aborted child is a human being,"" she insisted. ""And so for fetal remains to have to be treated as a human being individually, I think that that would really show that the Court understands that this is truly a child, it's not just a clump of cells or some other organ that we're removing from the woman's body. It's not part of the woman's body. It has its own distinct DNA and everything.""
Fichter said of fetal remains measure, ""It makes a very strong point about the dignity of an unborn child's life.""
The hope of many pro-life advocates is the more cases that put the humanity of the unborn before the justices, the better the chance those justices will back off from the rulings that legalized the killing of those unborn."
Georgetown University Students Vote to Pay Reparations Fee to Benefit Slave Descendants,www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/georgetown-university-students-vote-to-pay-reparations-fee-to-benefit-slave-descendants,"Georgetown University will likely be the first school in the country to require students to pay a reparation fee benefiting descendents of slavery.
In 1838, the university sold 272 slaves to pay off the school's debt. Now students have voted overwhelmingly to give back to the slave descendents.
The measure, which has to be approved, would cost students $27.20 per semester. The fund will go toward projects in low-income communities where slave descendents now live.
The vote had a turnout of nearly 58 percent. Associated Press reports 2,541 students voted for the ""Reconciliation Contribution"" while 1,304 opposed.
It is unclear if the university will approve the measure, but in a statement after the vote, Todd Olson, vice president for student affairs at Georgetown University, stated, the ""university values the engagement of our students and appreciates that 3,845 students made their voices heard in yesterday's election. Our students are contributing to an important national conversation and we share their commitment to addressing Georgetown's history with slavery.""
In an interview with ABC News , Matt Hill, the university's media relations manager, stated, the university vows to ""carefully review the results of the referendum, and regardless of the outcome, will remain committed to engaging with students, descendants, and the broader Georgetown community and addressing its historical relationship to slavery.""
""So I think the atmosphere on campus is 'what next,'"" stated Nitya Biyani, a junior at Georgetown University's Walsh School of Foreign Service, to CBS News.
Biyani was one of the students who voted against the measure.
""My issue with this is that I felt like the university was sort of tossing the buck on to students,"" she said. ""I don't believe that students are the ones that need to be paying.""
If approved, this would be Georgetown's fourth action to help ease the ongoing tension between the university and slave descendents.
The school originally gave preferential status to descendants if they applied to the university. Secondly, they performed a liturgy service with descendants, where members of the university were part of an initiative to repent for the school's previous transgressions.
In 2017, the university renamed a building after Isaac Hawkins, one of the slaves who was sold in 1838.
The Students for GU272 advocacy group behind the measure is attempting to help other advocacy groups get reparations out of other universities as well."
San Diego Border Tests New Wall in the Midst of Crisis That's Creating 'Huge Vulnerabilities',www.cbn.com,Heather Sells,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/san-diego-border-tests-new-wall-in-the-midst-of-crisis-thats-creating-huge-vulnerabilities,"SAN DIEGO – US Border Patrol has apprehended close to a quarter million unaccompanied children and families already in fiscal year 2019 – and there's no indication that the numbers are slowing .
The historic spike comes as Washington continues to debate the merits of a border wall.
CBN News recently visited with Border Patrol agents in the San Diego sector to better understand the border dynamics that are shaping much of the debate in Washington.
The San Diego sector is unique on several counts: it shares a 60-mile border with Mexico making it the smallest Border Patrol sector on the southwest border. It's also home to the some of the newest border wall technology – a 14-mile stretch of double fencing that's already making a difference.
Fence Makes a Difference
But it shares, along with the other sectors, a deepening burden: how to best protect the border even as agents are daily diverted to care for record numbers of immigrant families and children who need processing, transportation, shelter, and food and often, medical care.
In March, Border Patrol agents apprehended 100,000 immigrants along the southwest border.
San Diego Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott told CBN News that agents feel the stress on several levels – witnessing the pain and suffering of these children and parents and working to process them and care for their needs while keeping the border secure.
Agents Feel the Strain as Border is Overrun
When we talked with him in early April the strain was obvious. ""In the last 24 hours I had 148 agents taken out of patrol duties and they're basically babysitting kids. They're at hospitals with sick aliens. They're processing. They're transporting,"" he said, ""and they're doing things other than patrolling the border. That's created huge vulnerabilities to now where our effectiveness is dropping.""
There's no doubt that violence and poverty in Central America are pushing many of these immigrants to head to the U.S. border. But what Scott wants to talk about is a problem he sees that Congress could fix: a legal loophole forcing Border Patrol to quickly release the families it has processed. ""We have to release families within 20 days and it doesn't take long in today's social media environment for that message to get out,"" he said, ""once that message got out, we got overrun.""
Scott admits that San Diego's numbers don't compare to the numbers in south Texas, but says in fiscal year 2019 his sector has already processed double the immigrants it did in 2018.
Catch and Release
With his facilities at maximum capacity, Scott has been forced to adopt a policy informally known as catch and release. ""We're basically having to process people and then immediately release them into the U.S."" Those immigrants receive an immigration court date, but it's months or even years out and many will never show up.
Amidst the struggle to care for the current wave of immigrants, San Diego border patrol agents are enjoying one of the first sections of a new wall that could serve as a prototype for other sectors. It's actually double fencing with a primary wall closest to the Mexico border along with a secondary wall and a law enforcement zone in between that's large enough for a Border Patrol vehicle to comfortably drive.
The 14-mile section stretches from the Pacific Ocean to the base of the Otay mountains. It's a vast improvement over the previous 6-foot high wall made out of Vietnam War era landing mats. The new walls rise up 30 feet and have a bollard structure hollow steel beams filled with concrete and steel rods. They allow agents to see through the barrier which enhances security.
Agent Fabian Carbajal says the old barrier prevented agents from being able to see illegal crossers getting ready to jump. ""They would stage 20 people at a time, wait for vehicles to go through,"" he said, ""Someone would jump over with a power saw, run to our secondary wall and just breach it – make a hole through it – stage back in Mexico and just wait and see if the Border Patrol would respond. Then the group would go through and make it up north.""
Goal: Make it More Difficult for Illegal Immigrants to Cross
Scott doesn't pretend the new wall can't be beaten. That's not the point. He's happy that it simply makes it more difficult for illegal immigrants to sneak across. By slowing them down, Scott can spread out his agents, creating a human barrier that saves time and money.
""Where we've put that in place we've been able to increase our effectiveness from about 10 percent to over 95 percent,"" he said, ""and more importantly, we are able to pull 180 agents out of that area and then redeploy them to other parts of the border.""
Scott still faces big challenges. The stretch of new wall abruptly ends in a mountainous area with absolutely no border barrier. In total, his sector includes 17 miles of open border. It's a challenge the other sectors face as well. More than half of the U.S.-Mexico border has no fencing or wall.
Agents in the San Diego sector secure these areas on horseback and ATV's. They utilize technology like underground sensors. But they're also up against open spaces with no electricity and no cell coverage. Scott says even locals often don't understand what's at stake.
""They don't realize that less than 14 miles off the coast we have no border fence whatsoever. And anything can cross through here. And if anyone thinks that the criminal organizations and the terrorist organizations and even nation-state countries aren't trying to exploit this crisis – they're fooling themselves."""
8 Deaths and Devastation Unleashed as 20+ Tornadoes Sweep Across the US,www.cbn.com,Amber C. Strong,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/8-deaths-and-devastation-unleashed-as-20-tornadoes-sweep-across-the-us,"A wave of wicked weather has swept through several states killing at least eight people, injuring dozens more, and leaving devastated communities in its wake.
Approximately 21 tornadoes touched down across five states including Alabama, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Ohio.
""The fence around his pool was pretty much blown down. He had three giant pine trees that had blown over in the field,"" Ohio resident Erv Howard told reporters as he cleaned debris from his brother's yard.
In Franklin, Texas residents were caught by surprise when an EF-3 tornado ripped through the town of fewer than 2000 people.
""My house was just lifted, scattered over the backyard,"" one resident described.
""We've lost about half of the south side of Franklin, it's totally destroyed,"" Robertson County Judge Charles Ellison told reporters.
The destruction included 55 homes, a church, and several businesses, but no fatalities.
That wasn't the case for other parts of the country.
The storm's smallest victims, ages 3 and 8, were killed when a tree crashed into their car in Angelina County, Texas.
""I noticed the tree had fallen on their vehicle and I knew it wasn't a good outcome,"" said a witness.
In Louisiana, power outages and flash flooding struck after torrential downpours and heavy winds.
Two people died as a result of the flash flooding, including 13-year-old Sebastian Omar Martinez whose body was found in a drainage canal.
The aftermath from the severe weather is also affecting travel.
At the nation's largest airports there were thousands of flight cancellations and long lines of stranded passengers.
""This is very, very, very difficult and the help is negligible, it's negligible,"" said Liat Rudberg, who was stranded at Charlotte Douglas International Airport.
The first line of weather pushed through parts of Washington, DC, and Virginia overnight and off to the east. However, another line of strong storms winds are expected to hit the southern parts of the US by mid-week."
446 Confirmed Reports of Babies Saved from Abortion in 40 Days for Life,www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/446-confirmed-reports-of-babies-saved-from-abortion-in-40-days-for-life,"Pro-life organization 40 Days for Life has announced 446 confirmed reports of babies saved from abortion through their campaign efforts which coincide with the season of Lent.
40 Days of Life's mission is ""to bring together the body of Christ in a spirit of unity during a focused 40-day campaign of prayer, fasting, and peaceful activism, with the purpose of repentance, to seek God's favor to turn hearts and minds from a culture of death to a culture of life, thus bringing an end to abortion.""
The organization has shared multiple stories of people changing their hearts through prayer and conversations. Below are a few reports from the 40 Day campaign:
Day #6
""On a rainy Memphis day, an abortion-bound couple refused assistance from a trained sidewalk counselor named Tara. But before long, the man exited Planned Parenthood, offering to help shield vigil participants' materials from the rain.
Tara gladly used the opportunity to tell him all about the support available to help the couple choose life. The man said he would try to change the woman's mind, but when a half hour passed, hope began to fade.
Finally, they emerged from Planned Parenthood and announced they had decided against abortion!""
Day #20
""In Smithtown, which is hosting its first-ever 40 Days for Life campaign, a woman admitted she pressured a teenage girl named Jessica into an abortion a few months earlier.
Jessica–heartbroken and trying to make amends for the loss of her child–decided to get pregnant again. And the same woman who pressured her into an abortion had now brought her right back to Planned Parenthood for another one.
""The woman felt crushed, extremely guilty, and did not know what to do about this second pregnancy,"" wrote the Smithtown leadership team.
That's when Jessica burst out of Planned Parenthood, running toward the vigil, crying, and looking for help. Vigil participants were happy to offer it, setting her up with an appointment at a crisis pregnancy center.""
Day #30
""A regular campaign participant in Houston had planned to take a day off from the vigil. But before long, he found himself back out in front of Planned Parenthood.
That last-minute decision proved to be a good one. A driver headed for Planned Parenthood stopped to talk with the volunteer, who offered a coupon for a free ultrasound.
The mother accepted and, before long, she was on a mobile pregnancy center bus where she learned she was carrying TWINS!
The volunteer couldn't wait to share the news with his fellow prayer warriors. ""God be praised!"" he said.
Two lives saved–just like that!""
Day #38
""An expectant mother visited the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania vigil site, asking to speak with one particular sidewalk counselor she had met a few weeks ago.
""She said that she changed her mind about aborting her child after talking to this counselor,"" said Paul, the local leader. ""We were hugging her and thanking God. We all had tears in our eyes. It was a beautiful moment for the mom and all present.""
But there's more! It turns out this mother's teenage daughter is ALSO pregnant and was planning to have an abortion.
After her encounter with the 40 Days for Life team, the woman went home and talked her daughter out of having an abortion too!
One vigil site interaction spared a mother from having an abortion, spared her daughter from having an abortion, and spared both her child and grandchild from being aborted.
This family did not know about pregnancy resource centers, but the Harrisburg team was more than happy to help connect the mother-daughter duo with one.""

"Massive Blaze Engulfs Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, Spire Collapses in Flames",www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/massive-blaze-engulfs-top-of-notre-dame-cathedral-in-paris,"PARIS (AP) - A fire swept across the top of the Notre Dame Cathedral while the soaring Paris landmark was under renovations Monday, collapsing its spire and threatening one of the world's greatest architectural treasures as locals and tourists watched aghast from the streets.
The French president pledged to rebuild a cathedral that he called ""a part of us"" and appealed for help to do so. The 12th-century church is home to relics, stained glass and other incalculable works of art and is a leading tourist attraction, immortalized by Victor Hugo's 1831 novel ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame.""
The Paris prosecutor's office said it was treating the fire as an accident, ruling out arson and possible terror-related motives, at least for now. French media Quote: d the Paris fire brigade as saying the fire was ""potentially linked"" to a 6 million euro ($6.8 million) renovation project on the spire and its 500 tons of wood and 250 tons of lead.
Despite the dramatic image of the flaming cathedral, no one was killed. One firefighter was injured, among some 400 who battled the flames for hours before finally extinguishing them. Firefighters continued working through the night to cool the building and secure the monument, as residual sparks sprinkled down from the gaping hole where the spire used to be.
The blaze started at 6:50 p.m. after the cathedral had closed to the public, and spread to one of its landmark rectangular towers.
Nearby buildings were evacuated as fears mounted that the structure could collapse.
As the spire fell, the sky lit orange, acrid smoke rose in plumes and flames shot out the roof behind the nave. Hundreds of people lined bridges around the island that houses the church, one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world.
Paris fire chief Jean-Claude Gallet said the structure had been saved after firefighters managed to stop the fire spreading to the northern belfry. Gallet said ""two-thirds of the roofing has been ravaged.""
The fire came less than a week before Easter amid Holy Week commemorations. As the cathedral burned, Parisians gathered spontaneously to pray and sing hymns outside the church of Saint-Julien-Les-Pauvres across the river from Notre Dame while the flames lit the sky behind them. Paris Archbishop Michel Aupetit invited priests across France to ring church bells in a call for prayers.
Nearing midnight, signs pointed to the fire nearing an end as lights could be seen through the windows moving around the front of the cathedral, apparently investigators inspecting the scene.
The city's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said a significant collection of art and holy objects inside the church had been recovered. In a tweet later, she thanked firefighters and others who formed a human chain to save artifacts. ""The crown of thorns, the tunic of St. Louis and many other major artifacts are now in a safe place,"" she wrote.
Experts say firefighters were left with devastatingly few options to save a structure that's more than 850 years old, built with heavy timber construction and soaring open spaces, and lacking sophisticated fire-protection systems.
French President Emmanuel Macron treated the fire as a national emergency, rushing to the scene and canceling a previously scheduled televised address meant to address France's yellow vest crisis.
""The worse has been avoided, although the battle is not yet totally won,"" the president said, adding that he would launch a national funding campaign on Tuesday and call on the world's ""greatest talents"" to help rebuild the monument.
""Notre Dame of Paris is our history, our literature, our imagination. The place where we survived epidemics, wars, liberation. It has been the epicenter of our lives,"" Macron said from the scene.
Built in the 12th and 13th centuries, Notre Dame is the most famous of the Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages. Situated on the Ile de la Cite, an island in the Seine river, its architecture is famous for, among other things, its many gargoyles and its iconic flying buttresses. Some 13 million people visit it every year.
Among the most celebrated artworks inside are its three stained-glass rose windows, placed high up on the west, north and south faces of the cathedral. Its priceless treasures also include a Catholic relic, the crown of thorns, which is only occasionally displayed, including on Fridays during Lent.
""It's not one relic, not one piece of glass - it's the totality,"" said Barbara Drake Boehm, senior curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's medieval Cloisters branch in New York, her voice shaking as she tried to put into words what the cathedral meant. ""It's the very soul of Paris, but it's not just for French people. For all humanity, it's one of the great monuments to the best of civilization.""
Global reactions came swiftly including from the Vatican, which released a statement expressing shock and sadness for the ""terrible fire that has devastated the Cathedral of Notre Dame, symbol of Christianity in France and in the world.""
In Washington, Trump tweeted: ""So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris"" and suggested first responders use ""flying water tankers"" to put it out.
Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said outside St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan that New Yorkers were united in sorrow with Parisians over the fire. ""Count on our love, prayers, support and solidarity,"" he said.

600 Cases of Superbug Send Chills Through US Medical Community,www.cbn.com,Lorie Johnson,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/600-cases-of-superbug-send-chills-through-us-medical-community,"A superbug spreading in the United States is sending chills through the medical community. It's a fungal infection that can't be killed by our best medicines.
We found out the hard way how overusing antibiotics can lead to drug-resistant bacterial infections. Now, scientists are questioning whether we’re seeing the same result from the growth of antifungals, like the kind used to treat fruits and vegetables.
The latest culprit of concern is called Candida Auris, a fungus or yeast deemed by the CDC an ""urgent threat"" because antifungal drugs that fight yeast infections have no effect on it.
Most of the roughly 600 cases in the US, are in New York, New Jersey and Chicago, found in nursing homes and hospitals, typically striking patients with weakened immune systems.
Dr. William Li says physicians nationwide are on high alert because little is known about C. Auris. ""We need to figure out what it is, why it's resistant and how to contain it,"" he said.
In his new book, Eat to Beat Disease, Dr. Li explains the best foods that strengthen our body's defenses. He says not having enough good bacteria in our gut can lead to infection. But we can turn that around.
""In general, we do know that when our healthy microbiome, which is the bacteria inside our body, is functioning properly, those bacteria boost our immune system which allows us to fend off attacks from the outside more easily,"" Li said.
Unlike many yeast infections, C. Auris can be transmitted from person to person and can live on hard surfaces. The CDC recommends testing for anyone, such as healthcare workers, who may have come in contact with the fungus."

CEDARVILLE, Ohio – Cedarville University students hope to send a pro-life message with a new fashion trend: combining baby clothes with their own. It produces a startling visual statement of the human cost of abortion.
If you're a pro-life woman, it's a way to make a fashion statement that's also a statement of your beliefs about abortion. As prom and the formal season kicks into high gear, Cedarville women wearing these ""message dresses"" want to see the trend spread.
Senior Susanna Edwards first came up with the idea of the message dress and wore her first one to this year's national March for Life in Washington, D.C.
Surrounded by more than a dozen of her female friends wearing such message dresses, she told CBN News, ""We hope that high school girls, even college women such as ourselves will take at their formal this year or any other opportunity they have to be seen with a onesie or other baby clothes pinned to them to connect the humanity of the child that belongs inside that clothing to their humanity.""
'The Children Who Should be Wearing Them'
Fellow student Anna Edwards said these outfits for tiny babies pinned to beautiful dresses can have an impact both beautiful and haunting.
""When you see baby clothes, you think of sweet things and lovely things and the children who should be wearing them,"" she told CBN News . ""And when you think about them in this context, it just adds a level of intensity and love and beauty to the message.""
Susanna Edwards believes the very term ""message dress"" was God-breathed.
She recalled praying and brainstorming with her roommate, saying, ""We were going through synonyms for clothing and garb and all these things we were coming up with, and then the Lord just like a lightning bolt gave us 'the message dress.'""
Stephanie Schlabach works at the pro-life Miami Valley Women's Center, gave Edwards her first bags of donated baby clothes.
""This is the first that anybody's ever thought of doing something like this,"" she explained. ""The fact that she was able to wear it to the March for Life in D.C .for 2019 is fantastic. And I think that it spoke a lot to people and it was a very respectful way of showing the love for the unborn, and the way that Sue went about it was very creative and gentle and kind.""
Several national news media outlets interviewed Susannah at the March for Life, including CBN News .
One Way to Get the Baby Clothes
Schlabach recommends for women wanting to make their own message dresses to contact their local pro-life pregnancy centers, which often have extra baby clothes they can donate.
The fact that it just takes sewing or pinning baby clothes to a dress makes such an outfit something everyone can create.
""The pro-life movement didn't have such a creative idea in place before that people can come around and take part in and join in with themselves,"" said Tayana Fowler, who produced and posted a video to Facebook about the message dresses.
""Everyone has a different taste. Everyone has a different level of creativity. I want all pro-life advocates who are young women to feel comfortable that they can take part in this initiative,"" Susanna Edwards added.
The Damage Abortion Can Do Women
Schlabach was a psychology major and Anna Edwards is pursuing that field now. Both have studied the mental wounds many women carry from an abortion.
""It causes a lot of post-traumatic stress on their bodies,"" Schlabach told CBN News . ""They have nightmares. They get very depressed.""
Edwards added, ""And for women who are even OK with abortions, they still have to accept that they had something that they then lost, no matter what they believe that something is. Of course, we believe that it's their children and thus you shouldn't kill them. So, it's extremely harmful for women.""
""They have suicidal thoughts and behaviors in some cases, especially if it's a late-term abortion,"" Schlabach noted. ""Because they've started to develop that bond – even without knowing it – with their child. And when they just force that child out of them and it's no longer living, that does cause a lot of psychological damage.""
All Cedarville pro-life students now wearing the message dresses know the horror of abortion is so often unseen. They're hoping to make it a little more visible by displaying the clothes abortion's tiny victims will never get to wear."
PA Wedding Venue Facing Backlash for 'Marriage Is Between a Man and a Woman' Policy,www1.cbn.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/pa-wedding-venue-facing-backlash-for-marriage-is-between-a-man-and-a-woman-policy,"PA Wedding Venue Facing Backlash for 'Marriage Is Between a Man and a Woman' Policy 04-15-2019 Steve Warren
Another Christian business owner is under fire for refusing to go against their religious beliefs in order to serve LGBTQ customers.
The Star Barn, a wedding venue located in central Pennsylvania, is enduring intense backlash on social media for the owner's refusal to back down from their Christian beliefs about marriage.
A retired educator, who's also a homosexual, learned of the Star Barn's policy and posted his objections to the policy on Facebook, calling it discrimination, according to the website PennLive .
Star Barn's owner David Abel explained to the website in an interview that his faith plays a critical role not only in his personal life but his business operations.
He told PennLive he does not tolerate discrimination against anyone, not in his business or in a public setting. He said he does not discriminate in his hiring practices nor his workplace. Abel has been in business for 43 years and owns several business ventures.
""No persons will be discriminated against; however, we ask people to respect that we have core tenants in our faith and our beliefs and we cannot participate in any event that would be in contradiction to those core tenants - one of them being marriage, which has been biblically based for thousands of years as being between a man and a woman,"" he said.
Pennsylvania does not extend anti-discrimination laws to members of the LGBTQ community, according to PennLive .
Under federal law, conservatives argue that the First Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom should include the right to follow one's religious beliefs in any area of life, including the marketplace. But the legal waters are still very muddied.
In the 2018 Colorado bakery case , the US Supreme Court re-affirmed the protections guaranteed under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act in which Jack Phillips pointed out his own religious objection to bake a cake for a gay couple's wedding. The court ruled in his favor and blasted the Colorado Civil Rights Commission for showing hostility towards Phillips' faith.
However, the high court did not address the key issue of whether business owners can claim religious exemptions from anti-discrimination laws used in some states and cities.
Last month, the high court refused to hear an appeal from a Christian bed and breakfast owner in Hawaii who was ordered by a lower court to serve a lesbian couple despite it being a violation of her religious beliefs.
The court rejected the appeal, thus upholding the lower court's ruling in favor of the lesbian couple. Now, litigation will continue to determine what penalty the Christian business owner must face.
Phyllis Young, the owner of Aloha Bed & Breakfast in Honolulu, Hawaii, refused to rent a room in her home to Diane Cervili and Taeko Bufford in 2007 due to her religious beliefs about marriage. Cervili and Bufford sued Young over her actions and accused her of discriminating against them because of their sexuality.
A state court found Young in violation of Hawaii's Civil Rights Commissions' public accommodation law. The law applies to hospitality, entertainment, and transportation services. The law makes it ""illegal to deny a person access to or to treat them unequally in a place of public accommodation"" because of a person's ""religion,"" ""sexual orientation,"" and ""gender identity or expression."""

(Screenshot courtesy: Free Chapel/Facebook)
An overflow crowd of more than 4,000 people attended the ""Life is Beautiful"" meeting at Free Chapel's Gainesville, GA campus on Saturday to celebrate the unborn.
Organized by Pastor Jentezen Franklin, the event was designed to bring attention to the urgency for the church in America to address the issue of abortion. The aim of the meeting of Christian leaders, public servants, and the Christian community was to also show unity in providing a compassionate and grace-filled support network for women across the country.
In Franklin's opening remarks, he highlighted the recent legislation in the state of New York permitting abortion in the third trimester, up until the point of birth, and the recent comments of the governor of Virginia who condoned allowing babies who survive abortions to be left to die.
""If they're not ashamed to take that stand,"" he said, ""then I am not ashamed to take the Word of God and say with all the love in my heart, that life matters to God and it matters to us.""
""We no longer have the luxury of disunity in the body of Christ,"" Franklin added in an appeal to all Christian denominations nationwide.
""The lines have been drawn. Stand up for life,"" he told the audience. ""And stand up for compassion and grace for those that have experienced abortion. We dare not be silent in such a time as this.""
Every speaker at the event emphasized their love and concern for pregnant mothers who feel abandoned and think they have no options. They also prayed for healing and offered forgiveness for women who have been grieving from a past abortion.
Former Planned Parenthood clinic director and now a pro-life advocate, Abby Johnson, whose remarkable story has turned into the box office hit ""Unplanned"", also appeared at the event.
When she took the stage she was transparent about having had two abortions herself but is now celebrating that she is pregnant with her eighth child.
""Most people who work inside these abortion clinics are not there because they love abortion. They're there because of misguided compassion,"" she explained as she told the story of her eight years working for Planned Parenthood.
""I was very ignorant surrounding the topic of abortion. It was my ignorance, it was my naivety that led me inside the doors of the abortion industry,"" the former clinic director added.
Johnson said she reached a turning point in 2009 when she was instructed by her supervisor to double the quota of abortions at her clinic, and when later that year was asked to assist a doctor in an ultrasound-guided abortion procedure on a 13-week-old unborn baby boy.
""I watched this perfectly formed innocent human being become dismembered in his mother's womb,"" she said of the moment that led to her change of heart on the issue. ""I believe that all of these things that happened in 2009 were God's way of chipping through the callous that had formed around my heart. I knew then that what I had seen was a grave injustice.""
From that day forward, Johnson promised herself she would spend every day fighting for justice for the unborn.
""There is no such thing as an unwanted child because every child is created in the image and likeness of God, and very much wanted by our Father,"" she said. ""Let us do everything that we can, not just to make abortion illegal, but to make abortion unthinkable in our society.""

Catastrophic Fire Engulfs Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris,www1.cbn.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/massive-blaze-engulfs-top-of-notre-dame-cathedral-in-paris,"Firefighters Contain Massive Fire That Engulfed Beloved Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris 04-15-2019 Associated Press Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris caught fire on April 15, 2019 (AP Photo)
PARIS (AP) - A fire swept across the top of the Notre Dame Cathedral while the soaring Paris landmark was under renovations Monday, collapsing its spire and threatening one of the world's greatest architectural treasures as locals and tourists watched aghast from the streets. The French president pledged to rebuild a cathedral that he called ""a part of us"" and appealed for help to do so. The 12th-century church is home to relics, stained glass and other incalculable works of art and is a leading tourist attraction, immortalized by Victor Hugo's 1831 novel ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame."" The Paris prosecutor's office said it was treating the fire as an accident, ruling out arson and possible terror-related motives, at least for now. French media quoted the Paris fire brigade as saying the fire was ""potentially linked"" to a 6 million euro ($6.8 million) renovation project on the spire and its 500 tons of wood and 250 tons of lead. Despite the dramatic image of the flaming cathedral, no one was killed. One firefighter was injured, among some 400 who battled the flames for hours before finally extinguishing them. Firefighters continued working through the night to cool the building and secure the monument, as residual sparks sprinkled down from the gaping hole where the spire used to be. The blaze started at 6:50 p.m. after the cathedral had closed to the public, and spread to one of its landmark rectangular towers. Nearby buildings were evacuated as fears mounted that the structure could collapse. As the spire fell, the sky lit orange, acrid smoke rose in plumes and flames shot out the roof behind the nave. Hundreds of people lined bridges around the island that houses the church, one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world. Paris fire chief Jean-Claude Gallet said the structure had been saved after firefighters managed to stop the fire spreading to the northern belfry. Gallet said ""two-thirds of the roofing has been ravaged."" The fire came less than a week before Easter amid Holy Week commemorations. As the cathedral burned, Parisians gathered spontaneously to pray and sing hymns outside the church of Saint-Julien-Les-Pauvres across the river from Notre Dame while the flames lit the sky behind them. Paris Archbishop Michel Aupetit invited priests across France to ring church bells in a call for prayers. Nearing midnight, signs pointed to the fire nearing an end as lights could be seen through the windows moving around the front of the cathedral, apparently investigators inspecting the scene. The city's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, said a significant collection of art and holy objects inside the church had been recovered. In a tweet later, she thanked firefighters and others who formed a human chain to save artifacts. ""The crown of thorns, the tunic of St. Louis and many other major artifacts are now in a safe place,"" she wrote. Experts say firefighters were left with devastatingly few options to save a structure that's more than 850 years old, built with heavy timber construction and soaring open spaces, and lacking sophisticated fire-protection systems. French President Emmanuel Macron treated the fire as a national emergency, rushing to the scene and canceling a previously scheduled televised address meant to address France's yellow vest crisis. ""The worse has been avoided, although the battle is not yet totally won,"" the president said, adding that he would launch a national funding campaign on Tuesday and call on the world's ""greatest talents"" to help rebuild the monument. ""Notre Dame of Paris is our history, our literature, our imagination. The place where we survived epidemics, wars, liberation. It has been the epicenter of our lives,"" Macron said from the scene. Built in the 12th and 13th centuries, Notre Dame is the most famous of the Gothic cathedrals of the Middle Ages. Situated on the Ile de la Cite, an island in the Seine river, its architecture is famous for, among other things, its many gargoyles and its iconic flying buttresses. Some 13 million people visit it every year. Among the most celebrated artworks inside are its three stained-glass rose windows, placed high up on the west, north and south faces of the cathedral. Its priceless treasures also include a Catholic relic, the crown of thorns, which is only occasionally displayed, including on Fridays during Lent. ""It's not one relic, not one piece of glass - it's the totality,"" said Barbara Drake Boehm, senior curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's medieval Cloisters branch in New York, her voice shaking as she tried to put into words what the cathedral meant. ""It's the very soul of Paris, but it's not just for French people. For all humanity, it's one of the great monuments to the best of civilization."" Global reactions came swiftly including from the Vatican, which released a statement expressing shock and sadness for the ""terrible fire that has devastated the Cathedral of Notre Dame, symbol of Christianity in France and in the world."" In Washington, Trump tweeted: ""So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris"" and suggested first responders use ""flying water tankers"" to put it out. Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said outside St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan that New Yorkers were united in sorrow with Parisians over the fire. ""Count on our love, prayers, support and solidarity,"" he said. Associated Press writers Sylvie Corbet and Danica Kirka contributed to this report.

DeMille's 1956 epic ""The Ten Commandments."" (Image credit: Paramount/Wikipedia)
Cecil B. DeMille's biblical epic about an original game of thrones played out between two Egyptian princes will be seen again on broadcast television this weekend.
The Academy Award-winning The Ten Commandments will air on the ABC television network at 7:00 pm Eastern/6:00 pm Central, Saturday, April 20.
Spoiler alert : One prince wins the throne, while the other ends up as a messenger for the Most High.
Except for one gap in 1999, the 1956 classic film, starring Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Brynner as Rameses, has been broadcast by ABC around Easter and Passover since 1973.
The Ten Commandments remains one of the most popular films ever made. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.
It was also a box office hit. The film is the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time, adjusted for inflation, according to Wikipedia . As of 2011, the movie was estimated to have brought in more than $2 billion.
The cast reads like a who's who of old Hollywood. Along with Heston and Brynner, the film also stars Anne Baxter, Edward G. Robinson, Yvonne De Carlo, Debra Paget, John Derek, Vincent Price, and John Carradine.
The working title of the film was originally "" Prince of Egypt ."" It was directed and produced by DeMille, who intended it as a remake of his earlier 1923 Paramount film The Ten Commandments .
According to the Turner Classic Movies website , in the original theatrical version of the film before the opening title credits, DeMille is seen stepping from behind a curtain and onto a stage. He then directly addressed the viewing audience, telling them that the Bible omits approximately 30 years in its description of the life of Moses and that the filmmakers drew upon historical works such as those by Philo and Josephus and the Hebrew Midrash for the picture.
The director also explained that the subject of Moses' life is particularly timely, as it deals with themes such as whether man is to be ruled by God's law or the whims of a dictator like Rameses. The director said the filmmakers' intent was ""not to create a story but to be worthy of the story divinely created 3,000 years ago, the five books of Moses.""
The film also has the significance of having the most expensive special effect ever made for a film -- the parting of the Red Sea.
In April 1955 the New York Times reported the special effects team ""built a 200,000 cubic-foot swimming pool and installed hydraulic equipment that could deluge the area with 360,000 gallons of water in two minutes flat.""
A May 20, 1955, Hollywood Reporter news item asserted that the Red Sea sequence would cost $500,000, both for filming and creating the special effects. The Times review, however, claimed that the scene ""cost more than a million dollars and took 18 months to shoot.""
Last year, Jeff Pfeiffer wrote an article posted to the TV Insider website about The Ten Commandments re-airing on ABC and asked the questions: Why is the film still so popular today when any film, including The Ten Commandments, is readily available via streaming or DVD? And why do people still display a sometimes passionate desire to see ABC air this film every year at around the same time?
""This seems to be a case where it's not only the film itself but the tradition of watching it on television, most likely with family, that combines to make it a special event for many viewers, perhaps made stronger set against the backdrop of various spring holidays,"" he wrote.
""Television times may have changed, but ABC 's annual Easter airing of The Ten Commandments can still give (particularly older) viewers some sense of that comfort and familiarity,"" Pfeiffer continued.
So this Saturday night, plan on spending some time with your family watching the movie... and pass the popcorn."
"Three Religions, One Shared Holy Site: The Cave of The Patriarchs in Hebron",www1.cbn.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/three-religions-one-shared-holy-site-the-cave-of-the-patriarchs-in-hebron,"HEBRON – The city of Hebron was one of the largest cities in biblical times, and today is considered one of the Jewish people's four holy cities. While it's a divided city under Israeli and Palestinian Authority rule, you might be surprised to know Jews and Muslims manage to share a holy site here.
According to the Bible, Hebron is the place where Abraham buried his wife, Sarah. Later, Abraham, his son Isaac, and grandson Jacob, and their wives were all buried here in a place now known as the Cave of the Patriarchs.
Jews lived in the city until they were driven out in the 1929 riots. They returned after Israel regained control in 1967 during the Six-Day War.
About 800 Jews now live in Hebron, surrounded by some 200,000 Arabs.
Holy Site for Jews, Muslims, and Christians
Revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims as a Holy City, Hebron was the first capital of King David. Recently, however, the United Nations deemed it as a Muslim holy site in danger.
Noam Arnon, Spokesman for the Jewish Community in Hebron, told CBN News that in Hebron, everything you find fits all the biblical sources. ""When you read Genesis 23 about Abraham, how he purchased a whole field around, and the trees – the cave is there,"" he said, pointing to a building now covering the cave.
""It's located right beneath the rocks there, which are the end of the field. And the cave itself was dated to the Middle Bronze Age, which is equal to the forefathers' era,"" he said.
Burial Site of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
Arnon took CBN's Scott Ross into the massive structure, and showed him what is called the ""Gate of Heaven."" Beneath the large memorial are caves where three couples are buried: Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, and Jacob and Leah.
Arnon is one of the men who was able to enter the caves beneath, one night decades ago.
""It was in the middle of the night, one of the last nights of the Jewish calendar,"" he explained. ""And there are special prayers and people come here and blow the Shofar and sing many songs. So there was a lot of noise. And we were covered by that noise. We got the tools to open the Gates of Heaven, like hammers and chisels,"" he went on.
No one is allowed in the cave anymore. But when Arnon and his companions crawled through a tunnel, took some stones from the floor, and discovered two caves beneath.
""I found myself crawling amongst human bones,"" Arnon said.
A Unique Arrangement that Helps Keep the Peace
Nearby is the main synagogue where Jews can pray. Today the building is divided between a synagogue and a mosque. The Muslim religious authorities control the religious aspects of the entire place, while Israel maintains the security. It's a unique arrangement that helps keep the peace.
Arnon says the arrangement is not ideal – he'd rather everyone have complete access all the time.
But since it's working well the way it is, the government has no plans to change things at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron.

600 Cases of Superbug Send Chills Through US Medical Community,www1.cbn.com,,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/600-cases-of-superbug-send-chills-through-us-medical-community,"A culture of drug-resistant fungus Candida Auris. 6026401247001 600 Cases of Superbug Send Chills Through US Medical Community
A superbug spreading in the United States is sending chills through the medical community. It's a fungal infection that can't be killed by our best medicines.
We found out the hard way how overusing antibiotics can lead to drug-resistant bacterial infections. Now, scientists are questioning whether we’re seeing the same result from the growth of antifungals, like the kind used to treat fruits and vegetables.
The latest culprit of concern is called Candida Auris, a fungus or yeast deemed by the CDC an ""urgent threat"" because antifungal drugs that fight yeast infections have no effect on it.
Most of the roughly 600 cases in the US, are in New York, New Jersey and Chicago, found in nursing homes and hospitals, typically striking patients with weakened immune systems.
Dr. William Li says physicians nationwide are on high alert because little is known about C. Auris. ""We need to figure out what it is, why it's resistant and how to contain it,"" he said.
In his new book, Eat to Beat Disease, Dr. Li explains the best foods that strengthen our body's defenses. He says not having enough good bacteria in our gut can lead to infection. But we can turn that around.
""In general, we do know that when our healthy microbiome, which is the bacteria inside our body, is functioning properly, those bacteria boost our immune system which allows us to fend off attacks from the outside more easily,"" Li said.
Unlike many yeast infections, C. Auris can be transmitted from person to person and can live on hard surfaces. The CDC recommends testing for anyone, such as healthcare workers, who may have come in contact with the fungus."

COMMENTARY
I am sorry.
There it is…those three little words. And contained within those three words is what a lot of people see as (at least part of) the solution to what ails our world, or what I like to call the second most important three-word phrase known to humanity.
You’ve probably noticed...we are seeing these three words popping up quite a bit lately. Political leaders are acknowledging past failures, hoping for support for future elections. Celebrities and hedge fund CEOs’ mistakes are being debated in the court of public opinion. And in every situation, people are saying, “I am sorry.”
The press and social media are turning up the heat, demanding people take ownership for wrongs they have done. And not only that, people are calling people out for things they think they might have done . Whether it’s sexual abuse, tax fraud, prostitution, election collusion, college admissions fraud or whatever else it might be, people are hyper-aware that well-known people are not, and will never be, perfect. And at the end of the day, people want to hear, “I am sorry.”
But here’s the thing.
I am sorry too.
With each passing year, I become more and more aware of the mistakes I made in my past. Not that I’m perfect now, but things I did in high school, college, my 20s or even in my 30s, cause my 43-year-old self to hang my head in disbelief. I did what? I said what? I believed what?
Even now, as a husband to an amazing bride for fifteen years, I have failed (and continue to fail) in innumerable and spectacular ways! As a parent of three amazing kids, I realize that I, like all parents, have a laundry list of moments I wish I could take back and do over. And let’s not forget my job, where as a pastor and leader, I make a ton of mistakes too.
Even writing all that is a bit disconcerting. And we haven’t even gotten into specifics.
As I think about all of these situations where we are confronted with human failings every day, I step back and look at myself and think, “I have failed too. Not in the exact same ways as others...but in my own unique ways I’ve been just as wrong as they are.” And failure is not only the bad things we choose to do, but also the good things we don’t do. Wow! Way to add insult to injury.
So I am sorry. I have failed too.
But we’ve all got stuff in our past, don’t we? I like to say it this way: none of us have lived the life that we could have, if we would’ve made the right choices every time. And none of us have helped other people as much as we could have if we would’ve done things differently.
In the middle of all of the discussions and rhetoric, I’m afraid it’s just a huge adventure in missing the point.
Why? Because when did saying sorry ever really fix anything? Sure, let’s take ownership of our issues...but if all we ever do is say we’re sorry, then our whole world is still stuck in the same cycle. Apologizing never really gets at a lasting solution, does it?
The answer is right under our noses if we just look up. It’s all so simple, but I don’t see anyone saying it. So I need to say it…
That’s why Easter is so important.
Not what you would expect the answer to be, would you? But contrary to popular opinion, Easter has actually never been about bunnies, marshmallow baby chickens or seasonal chocolate. (Although, let’s be real, I love ALL of those things, and I am grateful when Easter candy shows up in the aisles of the grocery store)!
But in reality, Easter is all about God’s way of dealing with us being our own biggest problem. It’s God addressing all the failures of humanity. However any one of us is letting other people down and making choices we shouldn’t, God knows each one of us better than we know ourselves.
Isn’t that amazing? God knows all your fears, struggles and failures. He sees all of us clearly, and he loves us without limitation.
And here’s the best part…
God isn’t shocked when he learns you’re flawed. God loves broken people! He sees each of us as we truly are: a beloved paradox. It’s not just political leaders and celebrities who have problems. We are simultaneously both extraordinary and treacherous. Humans have an infinite capacity for beauty and for brokenness. In the same day, we are capable of the most amazing acts of selflessness and surprisingly hurtful acts of selfishness.
And Easter is a way better “solution” to our brokenness than “sorry” is because God sent Jesus on a rescue mission to save all of us from...ourselves. That’s what Easter is truly all about! We are the problem, but God has the solution. Easter is about God seeing our failures for what they are -- failures -- and then offering forgiveness and restoration.
Jesus’ work on the cross, and the empty tomb that followed, shouts out the reality that when we take ownership for our mistakes, God’s forgiveness meets us right there. The cross shows that our failures deserve God’s punishment (and his justice dictates that). And the resurrection – what we will celebrate this Easter – shows that our failures are forgivable.
And it doesn’t end there. It’s only the beginning! Remember how I told you “I am sorry” is the second most important three-word phrase in the history of humanity? Do you know what the most important one is?
I love you.
Easter clearly spells out to the world that God loves us, in spite of who we are and anything we’ve done. Just like when we look up and see the unending sky above us, God’s love covers everything in our lives. And his love brings unlimited redemption, forgiveness and hope.
We all need to say, “I am sorry.”
And when we say “I am sorry,” God says, “I love you and forgive you.”
That is why Easter is so absolutely important to all of us.
So let’s do this: as a society, and especially if we follow Jesus, we need to put the reality of Easter back into the center of our lives. The story of our lives can literally be a mouthpiece for the forgiveness and love of God to speak to the world! God’s love not only redeems us...he also wants to redeem others who are just like us: flawed but potentially forgiven.
And we can only imagine what that world would look like.

"Shock, Prayers Around the World for Notre Dame Cathedral",www1.cbn.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/shock-prayers-around-the-world-for-notre-dame-cathedral,"Shock, Prayers Around the World for Notre Dame Cathedral 04-15-2019 Associated Press People pray as Notre Dame cathedral burns in Paris, Monday, April 15, 2019. (AP Photo/Christophe Ena)
The world reacted with shock, horror, and prayers to the massive fire Monday at the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, united in grief and in solidarity with the people of France.
As the flames tore through the 12th-century cathedral, Spain’s prime minister offered France the help of his country in the recovery.
The fire is a “catastrophe for France, for Spain and for Europe,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez tweeted, adding that the flames are destroying “850 years of history, architecture, painting, and sculpture.”
French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters near the scene that he will seek international help, including from the “greatest talents” in the world, to rebuild Notre Dame.
U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking at the start of an appearance in Minnesota, spoke of the “terrible, terrible fire” that devastated “one of the great treasures of the world.”
“It’s a part of our growing up, it’s a part of our culture, it’s a part of our lives,” Trump said of the landmark.
The Notre Dame Cathedral, situated on an island in the Seine River in the heart of Paris, is one of the world’s most visited tourist destinations, drawing some 13 million people each year. The fire’s emotional impact was widely felt. People from all over described in Facebook posts how they cried when they heard about the fire.
Former U.S. President Barack Obama posted an old photo of himself, his wife Michelle and their two daughters lighting candles in the cathedral.
“Notre Dame is one of the world’s great treasures, and we’re thinking of the people of France in your time of grief,” Obama said on Twitter. Michelle Obama, who was in Paris on Monday on a book tour, said: “my heart aches with the people of France.”
“The majesty of Notre Dame - the history, artistry, and spirituality - took our breath away, lifting us to a higher understanding of who we are and who we can be,” she tweeted. She predicted the cathedral would rise again.
The Vatican said Pope Francis “has seen with shock and sadness the news of the terrible fire that has devastated the Cathedral of Notre Dame, symbol of Christianity in France and in the world.”
Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, prayed at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Manhattan for intercession.
“God preserve this splendid house of prayer, and protect those battling the blaze,” Dolan said in a statement.
Jeff Ament, bass player for Pearl Jam, remembered spending hours at the cathedral in his first visit, in 1991, with record executive Michael Goldstone.
“Thinking about Paris,” Ament tweeted, with photos of the cathedral.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted that he’s “horrified,” calling the cathedral “a unique example of world heritage.”
In Russia, the Russian Orthodox Church’s secretary for inter-Christian relations Hieromonk Stefan called the fire “a tragedy for the entire Christian world and for all who appreciate the cultural significance of this temple,” the state news agency RIA-Novosti reported:
On Twitter, Trump suggested using planes to drop water on the flames. France’s Civil Security agency said that wasn’t feasible.
“All means are being used, except for water-bombing aircraft which, if used, could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of the cathedral,” the agency tweeted.

PA Wedding Venue Facing Backlash for 'Marriage Is Between a Man and a Woman' Policy,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/pa-wedding-venue-facing-backlash-for-marriage-is-between-a-man-and-a-woman-policy,"Another Christian business owner is under fire for refusing to go against their religious beliefs in order to serve LGBTQ customers.
The Star Barn, a wedding venue located in central Pennsylvania, is enduring intense backlash on social media for the owner's refusal to back down from their Christian beliefs about marriage.
A retired educator, who's also a homosexual, learned of the Star Barn's policy and posted his objections to the policy on Facebook, calling it discrimination, according to the website PennLive .
Star Barn's owner David Abel explained to the website in an interview that his faith plays a critical role not only in his personal life but his business operations.
He told PennLive he does not tolerate discrimination against anyone, not in his business or in a public setting. He said he does not discriminate in his hiring practices nor his workplace. Abel has been in business for 43 years and owns several business ventures.
""No persons will be discriminated against; however, we ask people to respect that we have core tenants in our faith and our beliefs and we cannot participate in any event that would be in contradiction to those core tenants - one of them being marriage, which has been biblically based for thousands of years as being between a man and a woman,"" he said.
Pennsylvania does not extend anti-discrimination laws to members of the LGBTQ community, according to PennLive .
Under federal law, conservatives argue that the First Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom should include the right to follow one's religious beliefs in any area of life, including the marketplace. But the legal waters are still very muddied.
In the 2018 Colorado bakery case , the US Supreme Court re-affirmed the protections guaranteed under the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act in which Jack Phillips pointed out his own religious objection to bake a cake for a gay couple's wedding. The court ruled in his favor and blasted the Colorado Civil Rights Commission for showing hostility towards Phillips' faith.
However, the high court did not address the key issue of whether business owners can claim religious exemptions from anti-discrimination laws used in some states and cities.
Last month, the high court refused to hear an appeal from a Christian bed and breakfast owner in Hawaii who was ordered by a lower court to serve a lesbian couple despite it being a violation of her religious beliefs.
The court rejected the appeal, thus upholding the lower court's ruling in favor of the lesbian couple. Now, litigation will continue to determine what penalty the Christian business owner must face.
Phyllis Young, the owner of Aloha Bed & Breakfast in Honolulu, Hawaii, refused to rent a room in her home to Diane Cervili and Taeko Bufford in 2007 due to her religious beliefs about marriage. Cervili and Bufford sued Young over her actions and accused her of discriminating against them because of their sexuality.
A state court found Young in violation of Hawaii's Civil Rights Commissions' public accommodation law. The law applies to hospitality, entertainment, and transportation services. The law makes it ""illegal to deny a person access to or to treat them unequally in a place of public accommodation"" because of a person's ""religion,"" ""sexual orientation,"" and ""gender identity or expression."""
"Jentezen Franklin and Abby Johnson from 'Unplanned' Join for 'Life is Beautiful', Calling US Church to Unite Against Abortion",www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/jentezen-franklin-and-abby-johnson-from-unplanned-join-for-life-is-beautiful-calling-us-church-to-unite-against-abortion,"An overflow crowd of more than 4,000 people attended the ""Life is Beautiful"" meeting at Free Chapel's Gainesville, GA campus on Saturday to celebrate the unborn.
Organized by Pastor Jentezen Franklin, the event was designed to bring attention to the urgency for the church in America to address the issue of abortion. The aim of the meeting of Christian leaders, public servants, and the Christian community was to also show unity in providing a compassionate and grace-filled support network for women across the country.
In Franklin's opening remarks, he highlighted the recent legislation in the state of New York permitting abortion in the third trimester, up until the point of birth, and the recent comments of the governor of Virginia who condoned allowing babies who survive abortions to be left to die.
""If they're not ashamed to take that stand,"" he said, ""then I am not ashamed to take the Word of God and say with all the love in my heart, that life matters to God and it matters to us.""
""We no longer have the luxury of disunity in the body of Christ,"" Franklin added in an appeal to all Christian denominations nationwide.
""The lines have been drawn. Stand up for life,"" he told the audience. ""And stand up for compassion and grace for those that have experienced abortion. We dare not be silent in such a time as this.""
Every speaker at the event emphasized their love and concern for pregnant mothers who feel abandoned and think they have no options. They also prayed for healing and offered forgiveness for women who have been grieving from a past abortion.
Former Planned Parenthood clinic director and now a pro-life advocate, Abby Johnson, whose remarkable story has turned into the box office hit ""Unplanned"", also appeared at the event.
When she took the stage she was transparent about having had two abortions herself but is now celebrating that she is pregnant with her eighth child.
""Most people who work inside these abortion clinics are not there because they love abortion. They're there because of misguided compassion,"" she explained as she told the story of her eight years working for Planned Parenthood.
""I was very ignorant surrounding the topic of abortion. It was my ignorance, it was my naivety that led me inside the doors of the abortion industry,"" the former clinic director added.
Johnson said she reached a turning point in 2009 when she was instructed by her supervisor to double the quota of abortions at her clinic, and when later that year was asked to assist a doctor in an ultrasound-guided abortion procedure on a 13-week-old unborn baby boy.
""I watched this perfectly formed innocent human being become dismembered in his mother's womb,"" she said of the moment that led to her change of heart on the issue. ""I believe that all of these things that happened in 2009 were God's way of chipping through the callous that had formed around my heart. I knew then that what I had seen was a grave injustice.""
From that day forward, Johnson promised herself she would spend every day fighting for justice for the unborn.
""There is no such thing as an unwanted child because every child is created in the image and likeness of God, and very much wanted by our Father,"" she said. ""Let us do everything that we can, not just to make abortion illegal, but to make abortion unthinkable in our society.""

'Message Dresses': Beautiful Outfits Also Shout Pro-Life Message,www.cbn.com,Paul Strand,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/message-dresses-beautiful-outfits-also-shout-pro-life-message,"CEDARVILLE, Ohio – Cedarville University students hope to send a pro-life message with a new fashion trend: combining baby clothes with their own. It produces a startling visual statement of the human cost of abortion.
If you're a pro-life woman, it's a way to make a fashion statement that's also a statement of your beliefs about abortion. As prom and the formal season kicks into high gear, Cedarville women wearing these ""message dresses"" want to see the trend spread.
Senior Susanna Edwards first came up with the idea of the message dress and wore her first one to this year's national March for Life in Washington, D.C.
Surrounded by more than a dozen of her female friends wearing such message dresses, she told CBN News, ""We hope that high school girls, even college women such as ourselves will take at their formal this year or any other opportunity they have to be seen with a onesie or other baby clothes pinned to them to connect the humanity of the child that belongs inside that clothing to their humanity.""
'The Children Who Should be Wearing Them'
Fellow student Anna Edwards said these outfits for tiny babies pinned to beautiful dresses can have an impact both beautiful and haunting.
""When you see baby clothes, you think of sweet things and lovely things and the children who should be wearing them,"" she told CBN News . ""And when you think about them in this context, it just adds a level of intensity and love and beauty to the message.""
Susanna Edwards believes the very term ""message dress"" was God-breathed.
She recalled praying and brainstorming with her roommate, saying, ""We were going through synonyms for clothing and garb and all these things we were coming up with, and then the Lord just like a lightning bolt gave us 'the message dress.'""
Stephanie Schlabach works at the pro-life Miami Valley Women's Center, gave Edwards her first bags of donated baby clothes.
""This is the first that anybody's ever thought of doing something like this,"" she explained. ""The fact that she was able to wear it to the March for Life in D.C .for 2019 is fantastic. And I think that it spoke a lot to people and it was a very respectful way of showing the love for the unborn, and the way that Sue went about it was very creative and gentle and kind.""
Several national news media outlets interviewed Susannah at the March for Life, including CBN News .
One Way to Get the Baby Clothes
Schlabach recommends for women wanting to make their own message dresses to contact their local pro-life pregnancy centers, which often have extra baby clothes they can donate.
The fact that it just takes sewing or pinning baby clothes to a dress makes such an outfit something everyone can create.
""The pro-life movement didn't have such a creative idea in place before that people can come around and take part in and join in with themselves,"" said Tayana Fowler, who produced and posted a video to Facebook about the message dresses.
""Everyone has a different taste. Everyone has a different level of creativity. I want all pro-life advocates who are young women to feel comfortable that they can take part in this initiative,"" Susanna Edwards added.
The Damage Abortion Can Do Women
Schlabach was a psychology major and Anna Edwards is pursuing that field now. Both have studied the mental wounds many women carry from an abortion.
""It causes a lot of post-traumatic stress on their bodies,"" Schlabach told CBN News . ""They have nightmares. They get very depressed.""
Edwards added, ""And for women who are even OK with abortions, they still have to accept that they had something that they then lost, no matter what they believe that something is. Of course, we believe that it's their children and thus you shouldn't kill them. So, it's extremely harmful for women.""
""They have suicidal thoughts and behaviors in some cases, especially if it's a late-term abortion,"" Schlabach noted. ""Because they've started to develop that bond – even without knowing it – with their child. And when they just force that child out of them and it's no longer living, that does cause a lot of psychological damage.""
All Cedarville pro-life students now wearing the message dresses know the horror of abortion is so often unseen. They're hoping to make it a little more visible by displaying the clothes abortion's tiny victims will never get to wear."

Three Little Words (I think I need to say I'm sorry too…),www.cbn.com,Daniel Fusco,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/three-little-words-i-think-i-need-to-say-im-sorry-too-hellip,"COMMENTARY
I am sorry.
There it is…those three little words. And contained within those three words is what a lot of people see as (at least part of) the solution to what ails our world, or what I like to call the second most important three-word phrase known to humanity.
You’ve probably noticed...we are seeing these three words popping up quite a bit lately. Political leaders are acknowledging past failures, hoping for support for future elections. Celebrities and hedge fund CEOs’ mistakes are being debated in the court of public opinion. And in every situation, people are saying, “I am sorry.”
The press and social media are turning up the heat, demanding people take ownership for wrongs they have done. And not only that, people are calling people out for things they think they might have done . Whether it’s sexual abuse, tax fraud, prostitution, election collusion, college admissions fraud or whatever else it might be, people are hyper-aware that well-known people are not, and will never be, perfect. And at the end of the day, people want to hear, “I am sorry.”
But here’s the thing.
I am sorry too.
With each passing year, I become more and more aware of the mistakes I made in my past. Not that I’m perfect now, but things I did in high school, college, my 20s or even in my 30s, cause my 43-year-old self to hang my head in disbelief. I did what? I said what? I believed what?
Even now, as a husband to an amazing bride for fifteen years, I have failed (and continue to fail) in innumerable and spectacular ways! As a parent of three amazing kids, I realize that I, like all parents, have a laundry list of moments I wish I could take back and do over.

"Three Religions, One Shared Holy Site: The Cave of The Patriarchs in Hebron",www.cbn.com,Julie Stahl,04-15-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/three-religions-one-shared-holy-site-the-cave-of-the-patriarchs-in-hebron,"HEBRON – The city of Hebron was one of the largest cities in biblical times, and today is considered one of the Jewish people's four holy cities. While it's a divided city under Israeli and Palestinian Authority rule, you might be surprised to know Jews and Muslims manage to share a holy site here.
According to the Bible, Hebron is the place where Abraham buried his wife, Sarah. Later, Abraham, his son Isaac, and grandson Jacob, and their wives were all buried here in a place now known as the Cave of the Patriarchs.
Jews lived in the city until they were driven out in the 1929 riots. They returned after Israel regained control in 1967 during the Six-Day War.
About 800 Jews now live in Hebron, surrounded by some 200,000 Arabs.
Holy Site for Jews, Muslims, and Christians
Revered by Jews, Christians, and Muslims as a Holy City, Hebron was the first capital of King David. Recently, however, the United Nations deemed it as a Muslim holy site in danger.
Noam Arnon, Spokesman for the Jewish Community in Hebron, told CBN News that in Hebron, everything you find fits all the biblical sources. ""When you read Genesis 23 about Abraham, how he purchased a whole field around, and the trees – the cave is there,"" he said, pointing to a building now covering the cave.
""It's located right beneath the rocks there, which are the end of the field. And the cave itself was dated to the Middle Bronze Age, which is equal to the forefathers' era,"" he said.
Burial Site of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
Arnon took CBN's Scott Ross into the massive structure, and showed him what is called the ""Gate of Heaven."" Beneath the large memorial are caves where three couples are buried: Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, and Jacob and Leah.
Arnon is one of the men who was able to enter the caves beneath, one night decades ago.
""It was in the middle of the night, one of the last nights of the Jewish calendar,"" he explained. ""And there are special prayers and people come here and blow the Shofar and sing many songs.

No one is allowed in the cave anymore. But when Arnon and his companions crawled through a tunnel, took some stones from the floor, and discovered two caves beneath.
""I found myself crawling amongst human bones,"" Arnon said.
A Unique Arrangement that Helps Keep the Peace
Nearby is the main synagogue where Jews can pray. Today the building is divided between a synagogue and a mosque. The Muslim religious authorities control the religious aspects of the entire place, while Israel maintains the security. It's a unique arrangement that helps keep the peace.
Arnon says the arrangement is not ideal – he'd rather everyone have complete access all the time.
But since it's working well the way it is, the government has no plans to change things at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron."

Our son is 17, and he is in school. He has a good part-time job, and my wife and I started teaching him basic money management at a young age. He understands the importance of saving, giving, and spending, plus he is setting aside money for technical school after he graduates from high school. Do you think it would be an appropriate real-world exercise if we started charging him a very small amount in rent each month to prepare him for life when he leaves home?
Barry
Dear Barry,
I appreciate the fact that you’re looking for teachable moments, but I really think charging a teenager rent while he’s living at home is going too far. Now, if he was 28 or 29, that’d be a different story. But as parents, it’s still your responsibility to provide a home for your 17-year-old child.
It sounds like you’ve done a fantastic job already of helping your son grow into a responsible young man. He knows how to work, and he has grasped the basic concepts of managing money . I meet people three times his age on a regular basis who still haven’t done that. With this kind of start, I’ve got a feeling your kid will be fine.
I also think, with this kind of start, he has a great chance of becoming wealthy some day!"

As a business owner, how do you find a life balance between work and home? I have my own small business, and sometimes I feel like I’m putting in too much time at the shop and not spending enough time with my husband and kids.
Molly
Dear Molly,
The idea of everything being in balance, on an everyday basis, is a myth. It’s simply not possible to perfectly juggle every aspect of our lives every single day.
The key, I think, is to strive for an overall balance over time. You know first-hand the long hours and how work can interfere with other things if you’re not careful. The answer lies in really being into whatever you’re doing.
When you’re not at your shop or taking care of work-related matters, actively participate in conversations with your spouse and kids—and listen . Spend time with them! Turn off your cell phone when you go on dates with your husband and when you take your kids on outings.
When you’re with your family you should really be with them. Then, when you have to work, chances are they won’t be so upset, and you’ll feel better about things, too!

Freshman Congresswoman and outspoken socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said the US should consider cutting aid to Israel following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent election victory.
When asked on Yahoo News ' ""Skullduggery Podcast"" whether US policy towards Israel should change after Netanyahu vowed to extend Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements in the West Bank (Judea and Samaria), Ocasio-Cortez said, ""I think so.""
""I think these are part of conversations we are having in our caucus, but I think what we are really seeing is an ascent of authoritarianism across the world.

She also said reducing military and economic aid to Israel ""is certainly on the table.""
""I think it's something that can be discussed. I also acknowledge my role in this as well in that I think that I hope to play a facilitating role in this conversation, a supportive role in this conversation, but I also know that people have been leading on this for a long time.""
One of the leaders Ocasio-Cortez referred to is Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN) who proposed a bill in November 2017 that requires ""the Secretary of States to certify that United States funds do not support military detention, interrogation, abuse or ill-treatment of Palestinian children.""
The bill claims the Israel Defense Forces detains ""around 500-700 Palestinian children between the ages of 12 and 17 each year"" and does not provide them due process. Israel denies that it is unjustly imprisoning children.
The Jewish Democratic Council of America criticized Ocasio-Cortez for promoting the idea of cutting aid to Israel and urged her to speak with Jewish leaders in the House of Representatives.
""We are pleased Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recognizes she is NOT a leader on Israel in Congress. We recommend she engage with Dem leaders Eliot Engel, Nita Lowey, & Ted Deutch before contemplating the future of US military aid to Israel,"" the group said. ""US-Israel ties must supersede politics.""

Netanyahu Wins Majority of Knesset Recommendations for Prime Minister,www1.cbn.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/netanyahu-wins-majority-of-knesset-recommendations-for-prime-minister,"Netanyahu Wins Majority of Knesset Recommendations for Prime Minister 04-16-2019 John Waage
JERUSALEM, Israel - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won the support of a majority of Knesset members Tuesday, virtually securing him the task of forming Israel's 35th government.
President Reuven Rivlin consulted with Knesset party members on Monday and Tuesday to determine who will be the country's next prime minister. The Knesset's bloc of right-wing parties overwhelmingly recommended Netanyahu over Blue and White leader Benny Gantz.
The Times of Israel reports that Netanyahu has the backing on 61 Knesset members (MKs), a majority of the 120-seat Knesset. Gantz has just 41 seats backing him so far.
Rivlin will meet with all of the parties before selecting Netanyahu to form the new government.
For the first time in Israel's history, the recommendations were broadcast live. Rivlin's office said the decision to broadcast live was ""in the name of transparency.""
Rivlin's final decision on who will form the next government will happen Wednesday evening. Rivlin will invite the chosen prime minister to the President's Residence.
If Netanyahu is commissioned, as expected, his task to form a government will be complicated by infighting among the right of center parties, especially between the religious parties and the secular Israel Beiteinu party headed by Avigdor Lieberman.
Lieberman, whose party won five seats in last week's elections, is demanding that he be named defense minister in the new government. Even more unacceptable to the religious parties is his demand that Israel moves to enact a law forcing religious youths to enlist in Israel's armed forces. The law would make draft dodgers subject to criminal penalties.
The religious parties, Shas, United Torah Judaism (UTJ) and the URWP (Union of Right-Wing Parties) hold at least 20 seats between them. They have agreed to unite to counter Lieberman. UTJ member Moshe Gafni told the Ashkenazi Haredi daily, ""If our positions are not accepted, there will not be a coalition. It is inconceivable that Lieberman, with his five seats, would establish terms (contrary to the beliefs of) three larger parties.""
Meanwhile, President Rivlin is urging a national unity government between Netanyahu's Likud party and the Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz. Those two parties finished far ahead of all the others and would create a government with at least a 70-seat majority. But Gabi Ashkenazi, a former IDF chief of staff and spokesman for Blue and White, said Monday that his party currently would not join such a coalition.
Whomever Rivlin chooses to be Prime Minister will have 28 days to build a coalition, with a possible two-week extension at the end of that time if no government has emerged."
'Simply Mind-Blowing': Researchers Believe They've Discovered the Route Moses Took Out of Egypt,www.cbn.com,CBN News,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/simpy-mind-blowing-researchers-believe-theyve-discovered-the-route-moses-took-out-of-egypt,"Bible scholars from the Doubting Thomas Research Foundation (DTRF) believe they may have discovered the route Moses took when he led the Children of Israel out of slavery from Egypt and to the Promised Land.
The group told the Daily Star Online that they traveled to Saudi Arabia three times during their research and found evidence that the Israelites traveled through the modern-day kingdom to get to Israel.
DTRF researcher Ryan Mauro is still working on this theory but said the most ""plausible"" route is one where the Israelites left Egypt through Cairo and crossed into the Sinai Peninsula. He believes they crossed into ancient Midian and stopped at Mount Sinai, which he claims is the peak of Jabal al-Lawz in eastern Saudi Arabia.
""After three trips to Saudi Arabia, and I'm fully convinced that the Israelites went into the ancient land of Midian when they fled slavery in Egypt,"" he told the Daily Star Online .
Last year, the organization released a documentary detailing their quest to find Mount Sinai in Saudi Arabia.
Mauro said he and his team discovered several pieces of evidence that Jabal al-Lawz is where Mount Sinai was located.
""The golden calf, the split rock, Moses' altar, the Red Sea crossing site; all of these pieces need to fit, and they fit at this site in a way that no other site does,"" he said.
Mount Sinai is traditionally associated with Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. The St. Catherine Monastery was built over what is believed to be the site where God spoke to Moses in the burning bush.
""Perhaps these (skeptics) have doubted the historical account of the Exodus story because of a lack of evidence at the traditional site at St. Catherine's, but what we have found appears to fit the ancient accounts,"" Mauro said of the Jabal al-Lawz peak.
Jabal al-Lawz has been previously been identified as the possible site of Mount Sinai, but scholars doubt this theory.
""There is no credible historical, geographical, archaeological or Biblical evidence for the thesis that Mt. Sinai is at Jabal al-Lawz in Saudi Arabia,"" said creationist researcher Gordon Franz.
Mauro also told the Daily Star Online there is evidence that Moses split the sea at the Gulf of Aqaba on the modern-day beach of Nuweiba. There, the crossing would be just eight miles wide and a depth of only 33 meters (108 feet).
""It's going to take some time to bring this alternative theory into mainstream historiography, but I believe that our work is going to seriously shift the landscape on this subject,"" Mauro said.
Mainstream scholars seriously doubt the historicity of the events recorded in Exodus due to a lack of archaeological evidence.
Mauro encourages them to have an open mind.
""I would basically say to someone who's (skeptical) about the Exodus to keep an open mind about the subject,"" he said. ""These events really did happen. It doesn't require belief in one of these faiths to accept the evidence.""
Mauro said his team is currently trying to piece together an exact timeline and map structure for Exodus based on their findings.
""What I found there was simply mind-blowing. I couldn't believe that there was all this evidence for the Exodus and hardly anyone outside this region was aware of it."

(Philippe Wojazer/Pool via AP)
The blaze that engulfed and destroyed a large part of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris has now been fully extinguished.
The world watched in horror Monday as the cathedral went up in flames. Distraught Parisians gathered all around as the iconic structure glowed bright red and smoke filled the skies. Some bowed to pray in the streets as firefighters battled the blaze.
""It was just heartbreaking to watch. The ladders were not tall enough. The hoses were not strong enough,"" said eye witness John Dickas.
The heat from the flames was felt even on the opposite side of the river Seine. At the height of the fire, the cathedral spire that marked the Paris skyline, toppled from the intense flames.
One witness posted this cell-phone video of a group of strangers gathered nearby the burning cathedral singing a prayer in French.
The flames burning out of control could be seen across Paris Monday evening, and there were moments when it seemed the entire structure would burn to the ground. But this morning the bell towers, the facade and the most precious artifacts from inside remain.
For centuries, Notre Dame has stood as the heart of French identity and a symbol of global Christianity – surviving the French revolution, two world wars and Nazi occupation. The Christian landmark has stood for nearly 900 years.
After a 12-hour battle, firefighters say the entire fire is out. The bell towers and facade remain, but two-thirds of the roof is gone.
Officials are investigating the cause, but don't believe it was arson. They say it was more than likely related to the $6 million restoration project.
In an emotional address to France and the world, President Emmanuel Macron pledged to rebuild. ""We'll rebuild Notre-Dame together. I am solemnly telling you tonight: this cathedral will be rebuilt by all of us together. We will rebuild Notre Dame because that is what the French expect, because that is what our history deserves, because it is our destiny,"" Macron said during a news conference Monday night.
Despite the loss, there's relief at what's been saved.
The cathedral's famous organ was damaged but is reportedly intact and this poignant photo from inside shows the cross and altar are still standing.
Precious relics housed inside the cathedral are also safe, most notably, a crown of thorns said to be from the crucifixion of Jesus. The fate of the famous stained-glass windows is still uncertain.
""For the French, my God, for the world, Notre Dame Cathedral represents what's most notable, what's most uplifting, what's most inspirational about the human project and to see that reduced to ashes? My oh my. I remember our song: 'from the ashes we rise up.' We had Ash Wednesday, we went to rise up with Jesus at Easter and I believe that there'll be some rising from this dying,"" said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York.
During a news conference Tuesday morning, officials said the artifacts saved from Notre Dame will be moved the the Louvre.
President Macron says an international campaign will be launched to help fund rebuilding and restoration efforts. Already a French billionaire has pledged more than $200 million to the project."

In February 2019, four ninth-grade students from the Haemeq Hamaaravi High School in Kibbutz Yifat in the Jezreel Valley found a gold coin minted by the Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II.
The four pupils, Ido Kadosh, Ofir Sigal, Dotan Miller, and Harel Grin, stumbled upon the coin while exploring the fields alongside the Zippori stream in the Galilee, adjacent to the Sanhedrin Trail. They immediately recognized that this was no ordinary coin and alerted their geography and history teacher Zohar Porshyn, who contacted the Israel Antiquities Authority.
The 1,600-year-old coin is extremely rare.
""The gold coin is a solidus minted by the emperor Theodosius II in Constantinople (now Istanbul) around 420–423 CE (AD). Similar coins are known from the Eastern Byzantine empire, but this is the first of its type discovered in Israel. One side depicts the image of the emperor and the other shows the image of the [goddess] Victory holding the Staff of the Cross,"" explained IAA numismatic expert Dr. Gabriela Bijovsky.
Theodosius II was one of the most influential emperors of the Byzantine Empire, compiling an Imperial Code of Laws, designated the 'Codex Theodosius'.
The Christian emperor also turned Jews into second-class citizens.
Jews were banned from military and civil service and were not allowed to build new synagogues. ""The emperor Theodosius II abolished the post of the 'Nasi,' the Head of the Sanhedrin Council, and decreed that the Jews' financial contributions to the Sanhedrin be transferred to the Imperial Treasury,"" said Yair Amitzur, IAA chief archaeologist of the Sanhedrin Trail.
""The Sanhedrin Trail initiated by the IAA tells the story of the Jewish leadership in the Galilee at the time of the Mishnah and the Talmud in the Roman and Byzantine periods. It is symbolic that the gold coin discovered adjacent to the Sanhedrin trail reflects the period of dramatic events when the Sanhedrin ceased to function in the Galilee, and the center of Jewish life transferred from the Galilee to Babylon,"" said Amitzur."

Across Europe, there has been a growing rise in attacks on churches. Countries like France and Germany have seen a spike in violent vandalism, desecrating cherished churches and Christian symbols in recent months and years.
According to the German news site PI-News, every day in France, two churches are desecrated. They report 1,063 attacks on Christian churches or symbols like crucifixes, icons, and statues in France in 2018, marking a 17 percent increase from the year before.
The Middle East Forum reports that attacks on Catholic churches in France since the start of the year have included smashed statues, broken crosses, and demolished tabernacles.
Recently, the historic Church of St. Sulpice in Paris was set on fire after a midday service on Sunday. March, an illegal Muslim immigrant tried to burn down the organ of the Saint-Denis basilica (another jewel) and destroyed stained glass ( https://t.co/vYpFpZtO8K

It was the second attack in a month after the St. Nicholas Catholic Church in Houilles found their statue of the Virgin Mary destroyed and the altar cross on the ground.

In February, at Saint-Alain Cathedral in Lavaur, congregants found their altar cloth burned and the church's crosses and statues of saints broken. And in the city of Nimes, individuals vandalized the church of Notre-Dame des Enfants (Our Lady of the Children) and smeared a cross with human excrement according to Newsweek.

In a statement to a local paper, The Tablet, Bishop Robert Wattebled of Nimes said, ""This greatly affects our diocesan community. The sign of the cross and the Blessed Sacrament have been the subject of serious injurious actions.""
""This act of profanation hurts us all in our deepest convictions,"" he continued.

According to The Tablet, a record 47 documented attacks on churches and religious sites were reported in February alone.
""I think there is a rising hostility in France against the church and its symbols,"" stated Ellen Fantini, executive director of Observatory of Intolerance and Discrimination Against Christians in Europe. ""It seems to be more against Christianity and the symbols of Christianity.""
""These attacks are on symbols that are really sacred to parishioners, to Catholics."" she added. ""Desecration of consecrated hosts is a very personal attack on Catholicism and Christianity, more than spray-painting a slogan on the outside wall of a church.""
The German media reports the growing anti-Christian sentiment is believed to be a result of increased Muslim migration. In 2016, after the arrival of close to a million Muslims in Germany, a local newspaper reported ""not a day goes by"" that attacks on religious statues did not happen in the town of Dülmen.
And in France studies show the attacks on churches have increased as the number of Muslim migrants has increased. A January 2017 study stated , ""Islamist extremist attacks on Christians"" in France rose by 38 percent, going from 273 attacks in 2015 to 376 in 2016; the majority occurred during Christmas season and ""many of the attacks took place in churches and other places of worship.""
In 2016, CBN News reported on three ""radicalized"" women who were plotting to bomb Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Police found a car loaded with at least six gas canisters near the church. One of the females was found guilty of encouraging other potential jihadists to perform attacks in Syria and France as well. "
Ohio Democrat Drafted Measure to Exclude Black Babies from Being Saved Under Pro-Life Law,www1.cbn.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/ohio-democrat-drafted-measure-to-exclude-black-babies-from-being-saved-under-pro-life-law,"Last week, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law a bill that bans abortions as soon as the baby's heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks.
But before it passed, a Democrat state representative from Ohio tried to make sure African-American babies were excluded from the pro-life bill and could be aborted for any reason up to 20-weeks.
Rep. Janine Boyd proposed Amendment 0291 which would have provided an exception for black mothers to abort their babies.
Boyd suggested protecting black children from abortion is akin to slavery.
""Black slaves were once treated like cattle and put out to stud in order to create generations of more slaves,"" she said during her remarks, which were broadcast on The Ohio Channel . ""Our country is not far enough beyond our history to legislate as if it is.""
State Rep. Derek Merrin, a Republican and chair of the committee, challenged Boyd's claims and said the law should be applied to all unborn children, regardless of their skin color.
Ultimately, the amendment did not pass and virtually every baby with a beating heart in Ohio will be protected from abortion. The only exception is in cases when the mother's life is threatened.
Still, pro-life activists were outraged by Boyd's amendment.
""To reference owning humans as a defense of dismembering them is moral myopia. If it is wrong to own humans, it is also wrong to intentionally kill them,"" said pro-life group Created Equal president Mark Harrington, according to LifeNews .
Former Planned Parenthood executive turned pro-life advocate Abby Johnson also criticized Boyd's amendment, saying, ""apparently a 38% national abortion rate in the African-American community isn't enough.""
Meanwhile, pro-abortion groups continue to threaten legal action against the newly-signed pro-life bill.
""Similar versions of this unconstitutional abortion ban stand 0-4 in federal court. Soon to be 0-5,"" the American Civil Liberties Union Ohio chapter tweeted.

Venezuela Losing Its Only Remaining Hope of Salvaging Its Socialist Economy,www1.cbn.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/april/venezuela-losing-its-only-remaining-hope-of-salvaging-its-socialist-economy,"Venezuela Losing Its Only Remaining Hope of Salvaging Its Socialist Economy
Venezuela is losing its only remaining hope of salvaging its economy. Just when it seemed the socialist meltdown in Venezuela couldn't get any worse, the nation's vital oil industry could be nearing total collapse.
With its huge oil reserves, Venezuela once was Latin America's most prosperous country. Today, the nation's petroleum output is about the same as Romania's, and it could drop even more for two big reasons.
First, the already bankrupt petroleum operation just lost its biggest customer - the United States. Second, nationwide blackouts continue to bring the entire economy to a standstill. And experts say the power outages may have damaged the oil production equipment to such an extent, it may not be able to pump any product.
In the Maracaibo industrial zone, the machinery sits quiet, while oil workers fish the polluted waters for something to eat.
Last month, a report from the International Energy Agency warned Venezuela's output of crude oil could soon collapse to just a tiny fraction of what it was even a few years ago. That would put the country, said to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, in the ironic position of having to import fuel to meet its domestic needs.
Nobody can really begin to count the number of people who have escaped Venezuela and come across the border into Colombia. They say about 40,000 people a day are crossing the border, but in reality, there could be millions. So obviously this cannot continue. Conditions continue to deteriorate and that means something is going to have to happen sooner or later -- whether that comes from within Venezuela or without remains to be seen.
To make the problem worse, cash-strapped Venezuelans fleeing the country are taking the gasoline with them. They smuggle it across the border and sell it on the side of the road in Cucuta.
Back in Maracaibo, broken oil pipes and crumbling infrastructure are making an environmental crisis almost as big as the economic one.
""Because of all the broken pipes you can constantly see oil floating on the water,"" Alirio Lujano, a fisherman, told CBN News .
Jose Gregorio, another fisherman who works in the Venezuelan oil field, said: ""We are used to this because we work in these conditions every day. We have to wash with gasoline to get it off, and that causes a rash on our skin.""
But with their oilfield jobs paying the equivalent of only $3.00 a month, the men have little choice but to eat what they can catch to supplement their already meager diet.
Over the past five years, the United States has seen it's domestic petroleum production skyrocket as high-tech extraction in places like west Texas becomes more profitable. Last year, America passed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's largest producer of crude oil. This means even if Venezuela's industry can recover, the US may not buy as much petroleum as it did before.
And with periodic nationwide blackouts still a problem, this once-thriving industry is paralyzed for the time being. Which means for the foreseeable future, Venezuela's biggest export will be refugees.
""It never used to be like this. It makes me very sad,"" Wilmer Medina, a fisherman, told CBN News ."

Palestinian Group at Cornell Tells Israeli Student 'Quit Complaining' About Rockets that Blew Up Her Home,www1.cbn.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/palestinian-group-at-cornell-tells-israeli-student-quit-complaining-about-rockets-that-blew-up-her-home,"Palestinian Group at Cornell Tells Israeli Student 'Quit Complaining' About Rockets that Blew Up Her Home 04-16-2019 Steve Warren
A pro-Palestinian group at Cornell University told an Israeli student through a Facebook post to ""quit complaining"" about a rocket attack that blew up her home in Israel on the Gaza border.
According to The College Fix , Shir Kidron recounted a 2009 Gaza missile attack in the April 7 Cornell Daily Sun op-ed writing: ""A mere two seconds after I entered the shelter, I heard a loud boom, and felt my home collapse.""
In her article, Kidron pointed out that 40 percent of the children in the Israeli border town of Sderot suffer from PTSD due to the constant threat of rockets.
The op-ed was posted to Facebook by the group Reject Radicals at Cornell.
Cornell Collective for Justice in Palestine (CCJP) responded to Kidron's comments writing: ""If you want the rockets to stop, end the occupation. Otherwise, quit complaining about how it ruined your brunch plans in Ashdod.""
Back in February, the CCJP had also signed onto the Cornell Students for Justice in Palestine's letter to Cornell President Martha Pollack which called on the school to divest from companies that conduct business with Israel, accusing Israel of engaging in ""apartheid"" and ""ethnic cleansing.""
Rena Nasar, StandWithUs' Tri-State campus director and managing director of campus affairs, said in a statement to the Jewish Journal , ""It is inhumane to minimize the rockets Hamas shoots into Israeli civilian homes and nursery schools. There is no justification for such barbaric terrorism and Israel has a right to defend its citizens.""
""It is shameful that CCJP would skirt the issue of the need for negotiations, and blame only Israel for the lack of peace,"" Nasar said. ""This is yet another example of how boycott campaigns on campus descend into outright hate speech. We urge university leaders to take a clear moral stand by condemning this rhetoric.""
The Journal also reported the university did not respond to their request for comment."
"This Would Be One of the Toughest US Abortion Laws, Creating a Collision Course with Roe v Wade",www1.cbn.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/this-would-be-one-of-the-toughest-us-abortion-laws-creating-a-collision-course-with-roe-v-wade,"(AP File Photo) 6027300368001 This Would Be One of the Toughest US Abortion Laws, Creating a Collision Course with Roe v Wade
Sav-A-Life Alabama's Lisa Hogan appeared on Wednesday's CBN Newswatch program to discuss the proposed measure.
Alabama lawmakers are set to a hold a public hearing Wednesday on a bill that could make almost all abortions a felony. The measure is slated to be discussed in the House Health Committee and it's expected to draw large crowds on both sides of the issue.
One of the biggest anti-abortion proposals introduced this year, the measure would make an abortion punishable with 10 to 99 years in prison, though a woman would not be charged for having the procedure under the proposal.
Labeled ""HB314"", it would ban any abortion from the start a woman is ""known to be pregnant."" There is only one exception for a women's health, avoiding exemptions for rape and incest.
The bill would be used to directly challenge Roe v. Wade — the landmark 1973 US Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. If passed and signed into law, it would most likely be struck down by lower courts. However, the goal is for the case to make it to the Supreme Court for a new judicial showdown.
""The goal of this bill is to address Roe v Wade,"" said Republican Rep. Terri Collins, the House bill's sponsor. ""I believe the Roe v Wade decision was based on a lack of information that the baby in a womb is a person.""
Randall Marshall, executive director of the liberal American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, called the measure ""one of the most extreme anti-abortion bills in the country, to effectively outlaw abortions in flagrant violation of federal law.""
""They are trying to tee this up as an opportunity for the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v Wade and its progeny. There are already cases in the pipeline that will get to the Supreme Court long before this does,"" Marshall added.
The measure comes after Alabama voters wrote anti-abortion language into the state constitution, declaring the state recognizes the ""rights of unborn children."" Around 59 percent of voters approved the constitutional amendment in November.
With a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, the bill joins a list of several others across the US intended to challenge Roe v Wade. Recently, states such as Ohio and Mississippi passed laws prohibiting abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, and states like Georgia and South Carolina are soon to follow suit. Other states like Missouri and Iowa have pushed laws limiting abortions after a certain time or requiring an ultrasound before an abortion.
Organizations like the ACLU have already filed lawsuits to stop the measures."
'Who Has Bewitched You?' Franklin Graham Blasts Christian College Students & Alumni for Fighting Mike Pence at Graduation,www1.cbn.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/who-has-bewitched-you-franklin-graham-blasts-christian-college-students-and-alumni-for-fighting-mike-pence-at-graduation,"CBNNews.com 'Who Has Bewitched You?' Franklin Graham Blasts Christian College Students, Alumni for Fighting Mike Pence at Graduation 04-16-2019 Steve Warren Vice President Mike Pence. (Image credit: CBN News)
Vice President Mike Pence is receiving backlash from Taylor University students and alumni after the school announced Pence, a former Indiana governor, would be this year's commencement speaker.
Fox News reports more than 3,300 people have signed a change.org petition to have Pence's invitation rescinded by the school, alleging the ""Trump-Pence Administration's policies"" are ""not consistent with the Christian ethic of love we hold dear.""
Located in Upland, Indiana, the administrators of the small evangelical Christian college are standing by their decision to have the vice president deliver the address at the school's graduation ceremonies scheduled for next month.
Kevin Holtsberry, a Taylor alumnus, told Fox News the outraged alumni and students are mistaking disagreement on political issues with personal attacks, while also thanking the school for ""standing firm"" and not pulling Pence's invitation.
""The vice president has very orthodox Christian beliefs - very traditional beliefs - that a vast majority of Christians believe. His political views are shared by a large section of America, so it's not a radical choice, and I think people should be able to engage and disagree with his views and do it in a mature fashion,"" he said.
Franklin Graham also took the opportunity to call out the students and alumni who have objected to Pence's appearance at the school.
In a post to his Facebook page on Tuesday, the evangelist wrote: ""For the life of me I don't understand this. Some students and alumni at Taylor University in Indiana, a Christian college, are objecting to Vice President Mike Pence speaking at their upcoming graduation commencement. They should be absolutely thrilled.""
""But instead, this group started a petition to rescind the invitation because they say the Administration is 'not consistent with the Christian ethic of love we hold dear.' What are these people smoking? This reminds me of Paul's words, 'You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you?' (Galatians 3:1). Vice President Mike Pence recently told CNN that he is 'a Bible-believing Christian.' Is that what they are objecting to?"" Graham asked.
""I appreciate the fact that Taylor's president, Paul Lowell Haines, has stood firm on the decision to invite the vice president and publicly praised him as a 'good friend to the University over many years,' and 'a Christian brother whose life and values have exemplified what we strive to instill in our graduates.' There couldn't be a better, more qualified, more inspirational speaker for graduates to hear from or a better example for them to follow in life. Thank you, Mr. Vice President,"" he concluded.
The university's administration also released a statement saying they look forward to Pence's visit.
""Since making the announcement of Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming commencement speech, we have received feedback from people on either side of the issue. Taylor University is an intentional Christian community that strives to encourage positive, respectful and meaningful dialogue. We look forward to hosting the Vice President next month,"" Taylor University spokesman, James Garringer, said in a statement to Fox News ."

Freshman Congresswoman and outspoken socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said the US should consider cutting aid to Israel following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent election victory.
When asked on Yahoo News ' ""Skullduggery Podcast"" whether US policy towards Israel should change after Netanyahu vowed to extend Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements in the West Bank (Judea and Samaria), Ocasio-Cortez said, ""I think so.""
""I think these are part of conversations we are having in our caucus, but I think what we are really seeing is an ascent of authoritarianism across the world. I think that Netanyahu is a Trump-like figure,"" she added. Rep. @AOC thinks ""Netanyahu is a Trump-like figure"" and says the reelection of the Israeli prime minister is part of ""the ascent of authoritarianism across the world"" https://t.co/YerdSu30jF via @isikoff , @dklaidman , @skullduggerypod pic.twitter.com/TrpjYRQHUX

She also said reducing military and economic aid to Israel ""is certainly on the table.""
""I think it's something that can be discussed. I also acknowledge my role in this as well in that I think that I hope to play a facilitating role in this conversation, a supportive role in this conversation, but I also know that people have been leading on this for a long time.""
One of the leaders Ocasio-Cortez referred to is Rep. Betty McCollum (D-MN) who proposed a bill in November 2017 that requires ""the Secretary of States to certify that United States funds do not support military detention, interrogation, abuse or ill-treatment of Palestinian children.""
The bill claims the Israel Defense Forces detains ""around 500-700 Palestinian children between the ages of 12 and 17 each year"" and does not provide them due process. Israel denies that it is unjustly imprisoning children.
The Jewish Democratic Council of America criticized Ocasio-Cortez for promoting the idea of cutting aid to Israel and urged her to speak with Jewish leaders in the House of Representatives.
""We are pleased Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recognizes she is NOT a leader on Israel in Congress. We recommend she engage with Dem leaders Eliot Engel, Nita Lowey, & Ted Deutch before contemplating the future of US military aid to Israel,"" the group said. ""US-Israel ties must supersede politics.""
Ocasio-Cortez is a harsh critic of Israeli policy and advocates for a two-state solution.
""I believe absolutely in Israel's right to exist,"" she has said. ""I am a proponent of a two-state solution."" "

ANALYSIS
More than a decade ago, a man by the name of Barack Obama burst onto the political scene with charisma and communication skills that propelled him to the presidency. Part of the package that he was intent on selling voters was a, 'love your neighbor' strategy, having compassion for your fellow man.
Fast-forward to the 2020 race for president and you now have another presidential candidate, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, echoing many of those similar Christian themes.
""Buttigieg is talking about compassion,"" said CBN Chief Political Analyst David Brody. ""A lot of the criticism of Donald Trump is that his policies have not been compassionate. I think that might be the way he interjects faith and talks about the compassion parts of the Bible but maybe get away from some of the thornier issues that he'll have to confront from a biblical perspective as well."" Other Democrats running for president in 2020 are discussing faith but Buttigieg is different in one key way: he's aggressively pushed the topic into the national conversation and he's doing it as a gay man running for president. That, in itself, is distinctive.
""He's going into uncharted territory,"" Brody noted. ""What I mean by that is that he has been the one to aggressively interject his faith into the national dialogue and conversation from a Democrat perspective. We haven't seen that in a while so we don't know how that's going to play out."" In 2008, Barack Obama won 24 percent of the white evangelical vote. He did it by discussing his faith openly and effectively. He spoke with CBN News four times during that campaign, unafraid or unashamed to share his biblical views on controversial matters.
""Remember, back in the day with President Obama, it was, 'love your neighbor' it was all about compassion,"" Brody recalled. ""Well, here comes Pete Buttigieg doing the same thing, talking about compassion quite often. Hillary Clinton did not talk about her faith in 2016 and it hurt her a lot for sure because you win elections on the margins. Pete Buttigieg is trying something different.""
Brody said there's a political opening for, ""Mayor Pete"" if he decides to take it. ""If he just tries to play to the progressive Christian left, it's a small pie. He needs to come into the conservative evangelical sandbox and really start playing there and making the case for his compassionate side of his faith in that box because that's where the voters are, that's where the momentum is, that's where the energy is."" But overall, why exactly is Buttigieg rising in the polls and increasing his campaign coffers? Brody has a theory.
""He's authentic, he communicates well, he's a war veteran, he's from the Midwest and he has an ability to put the whole package together. I think he's going to be around for a while,"" he said.
How long he can last will depend on how he handles the incoming fire, both from Democrats and Republicans.
""He's passed the entrance exam to get into college, "" Brody added. ""He did well on the SAT. Now, we find out how the midterm exam goes and the final exam comes later on in the process. The questions get harder, the scrutiny gets tighter, the microscope gets larger and I think when you put all of that together, that's when we'll have a sense of whether or not he has the toughness for the fight."""

Mike DeWine signed into law a bill that bans abortions as soon as the baby's heartbeat is detected, which can be as early as six weeks.
But before it passed, a Democrat state representative from Ohio tried to make sure African-American babies were excluded from the pro-life bill and could be aborted for any reason up to 20-weeks.
Rep. Janine Boyd proposed Amendment 0291 which would have provided an exception for black mothers to abort their babies.
Boyd suggested protecting black children from abortion is akin to slavery.
""Black slaves were once treated like cattle and put out to stud in order to create generations of more slaves,"" she said during her remarks, which were broadcast on The Ohio Channel . ""Our country is not far enough beyond our history to legislate as if it is.""
State Rep. Derek Merrin, a Republican and chair of the committee, challenged Boyd's claims and said the law should be applied to all unborn children, regardless of their skin color.
Ultimately, the amendment did not pass and virtually every baby with a beating heart in Ohio will be protected from abortion. The only exception is in cases when the mother's life is threatened.
Still, pro-life activists were outraged by Boyd's amendment.
""To reference owning humans as a defense of dismembering them is moral myopia. If it is wrong to own humans, it is also wrong to intentionally kill them,"" said pro-life group Created Equal president Mark Harrington, according to LifeNews .
Former Planned Parenthood executive turned pro-life advocate Abby Johnson also criticized Boyd's amendment, saying, ""apparently a 38% national abortion rate in the African-American community isn't enough.""
Meanwhile, pro-abortion groups continue to threaten legal action against the newly-signed pro-life bill.
""Similar versions of this unconstitutional abortion ban stand 0-4 in federal court. Soon to be 0-5,"" the American Civil Liberties Union Ohio chapter tweeted."
"This Would Be One of the Toughest US Abortion Laws, Creating a Collision Course with Roe v Wade",www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/this-would-be-one-of-the-toughest-us-abortion-laws-creating-a-collision-course-with-roe-v-wade,"Sav-A-Life Alabama's Lisa Hogan appeared on Wednesday's CBN Newswatch program to discuss the proposed measure.
Alabama lawmakers are set to a hold a public hearing Wednesday on a bill that could make almost all abortions a felony. The measure is slated to be discussed in the House Health Committee and it's expected to draw large crowds on both sides of the issue.
One of the biggest anti-abortion proposals introduced this year, the measure would make an abortion punishable with 10 to 99 years in prison, though a woman would not be charged for having the procedure under the proposal.
Labeled ""HB314"", it would ban any abortion from the start a woman is ""known to be pregnant."" There is only one exception for a women's health, avoiding exemptions for rape and incest.
The bill would be used to directly challenge Roe v. Wade — the landmark 1973 US Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. If passed and signed into law, it would most likely be struck down by lower courts. However, the goal is for the case to make it to the Supreme Court for a new judicial showdown.
""The goal of this bill is to address Roe v Wade,"" said Republican Rep. Terri Collins, the House bill's sponsor. ""I believe the Roe v Wade decision was based on a lack of information that the baby in a womb is a person.""
Randall Marshall, executive director of the liberal American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, called the measure ""one of the most extreme anti-abortion bills in the country, to effectively outlaw abortions in flagrant violation of federal law.""
""They are trying to tee this up as an opportunity for the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v Wade and its progeny. There are already cases in the pipeline that will get to the Supreme Court long before this does,"" Marshall added.
The measure comes after Alabama voters wrote anti-abortion language into the state constitution, declaring the state recognizes the ""rights of unborn children."" Around 59 percent of voters approved the constitutional amendment in November.
With a conservative majority on the Supreme Court, the bill joins a list of several others across the US intended to challenge Roe v Wade. Recently, states such as Ohio and Mississippi passed laws prohibiting abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, and states like Georgia and South Carolina are soon to follow suit. Other states like Missouri and Iowa have pushed laws limiting abortions after a certain time or requiring an ultrasound before an abortion.
Organizations like the ACLU have already filed lawsuits to stop the measures."
Churches Desecrated in Ongoing Attacks Across Europe,www.cbn.com,Christian Ellis,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/churches-desecrated-in-ongoing-attacks-across-europe,"Across Europe, there has been a growing rise in attacks on churches. Countries like France and Germany have seen a spike in violent vandalism, desecrating cherished churches and Christian symbols in recent months and years.
According to the German news site PI-News, every day in France, two churches are desecrated. They report 1,063 attacks on Christian churches or symbols like crucifixes, icons, and statues in France in 2018, marking a 17 percent increase from the year before.
The Middle East Forum reports that attacks on Catholic churches in France since the start of the year have included smashed statues, broken crosses, and demolished tabernacles.
Recently, the historic Church of St. Sulpice in Paris was set on fire after a midday service on Sunday.
March, an illegal Muslim immigrant tried to burn down the organ of the Saint-Denis basilica (another jewel) and destroyed stained glass ( https://t.co/vYpFpZtO8K

It was the second attack in a month after the St. Nicholas Catholic Church in Houilles found their statue of the Virgin Mary destroyed and the altar cross on the ground.

In February, at Saint-Alain Cathedral in Lavaur, congregants found their altar cloth burned and the church's crosses and statues of saints broken. And in the city of Nimes, individuals vandalized the church of Notre-Dame des Enfants (Our Lady of the Children) and smeared a cross with human excrement according to Newsweek.

In a statement to a local paper, The Tablet, Bishop Robert Wattebled of Nimes said, ""This greatly affects our diocesan community. The sign of the cross and the Blessed Sacrament have been the subject of serious injurious actions.""
""This act of profanation hurts us all in our deepest convictions,"" he continued.

According to The Tablet, a record 47 documented attacks on churches and religious sites were reported in February alone.
""I think there is a rising hostility in France against the church and its symbols,"" stated Ellen Fantini, executive director of Observatory of Intolerance and Discrimination Against Christians in Europe. ""It seems to be more against Christianity and the symbols of Christianity.""
""These attacks are on symbols that are really sacred to parishioners, to Catholics."" she added. ""Desecration of consecrated hosts is a very personal attack on Catholicism and Christianity, more than spray-painting a slogan on the outside wall of a church.""
The German media reports the growing anti-Christian sentiment is believed to be a result of increased Muslim migration. In 2016, after the arrival of close to a million Muslims in Germany, a local newspaper reported ""not a day goes by"" that attacks on religious statues did not happen in the town of Dülmen.
And in France studies show the attacks on churches have increased as the number of Muslim migrants has increased. A January 2017 study stated , ""Islamist extremist attacks on Christians"" in France rose by 38 percent, going from 273 attacks in 2015 to 376 in 2016; the majority occurred during Christmas season and ""many of the attacks took place in churches and other places of worship.""
In 2016, CBN News reported on three ""radicalized"" women who were plotting to bomb Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Police found a car loaded with at least six gas canisters near the church. One of the females was found guilty of encouraging other potential jihadists to perform attacks in Syria and France as well."
'Who Has Bewitched You?' Franklin Graham Blasts Christian College Students & Alumni for Fighting Mike Pence at Graduation,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/who-has-bewitched-you-franklin-graham-blasts-christian-college-students-and-alumni-for-fighting-mike-pence-at-graduation,"Vice President Mike Pence is receiving backlash from Taylor University students and alumni after the school announced Pence, a former Indiana governor, would be this year's commencement speaker.
Fox News reports more than 3,300 people have signed a change.org petition to have Pence's invitation rescinded by the school, alleging the ""Trump-Pence Administration's policies"" are ""not consistent with the Christian ethic of love we hold dear.""
Located in Upland, Indiana, the administrators of the small evangelical Christian college are standing by their decision to have the vice president deliver the address at the school's graduation ceremonies scheduled for next month.
Kevin Holtsberry, a Taylor alumnus, told Fox News the outraged alumni and students are mistaking disagreement on political issues with personal attacks, while also thanking the school for ""standing firm"" and not pulling Pence's invitation.
""The vice president has very orthodox Christian beliefs - very traditional beliefs - that a vast majority of Christians believe. His political views are shared by a large section of America, so it's not a radical choice, and I think people should be able to engage and disagree with his views and do it in a mature fashion,"" he said.
Franklin Graham also took the opportunity to call out the students and alumni who have objected to Pence's appearance at the school.
In a post to his Facebook page on Tuesday, the Quote: : ""For the life of me I don't understand this. Some students and alumni at Taylor University in Indiana, a Christian college, are objecting to Vice President Mike Pence speaking at their upcoming graduation commencement. They should be absolutely thrilled.""
""But instead, this group started a petition to rescind the invitation because they say the Administration is 'not consistent with the Christian ethic of love we hold dear.' What are these people smoking? This reminds me of Paul's words, 'You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you?' (Galatians 3:1). Vice President Mike Pence recently told CNN that he is 'a Bible-believing Christian.' Is that what they are objecting to?"" Graham asked.
""I appreciate the fact that Taylor's president, Paul Lowell Haines, has stood firm on the decision to invite the vice president and publicly praised him as a 'good friend to the University over many years,' and 'a Christian brother whose life and values have exemplified what we strive to instill in our graduates.' There couldn't be a better, more qualified, more inspirational speaker for graduates to hear from or a better example for them to follow in life. Thank you, Mr. Vice President,"" he concluded.
The university's administration also released a statement saying they look forward to Pence's visit.
""Since making the announcement of Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming commencement speech, we have received feedback from people on either side of the issue. Taylor University is an intentional Christian community that strives to encourage positive, respectful and meaningful dialogue. We look forward to hosting the Vice President next month,"" Taylor University spokesman, James Garringer, said in a statement to Fox News ."
Palestinian Group at Cornell Tells Israeli Student 'Quit Complaining' About Rockets that Blew Up Her Home,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/palestinian-group-at-cornell-tells-israeli-student-quit-complaining-about-rockets-that-blew-up-her-home,"A pro-Palestinian group at Cornell University told an Israeli student through a Facebook post to ""quit complaining"" about a rocket attack that blew up her home in Israel on the Gaza border.
According to The College Fix , Shir Kidron recounted a 2009 Gaza missile attack in the April 7 Cornell Daily Sun op-ed writing: ""A mere two seconds after I entered the shelter, I heard a loud boom, and felt my home collapse.""
In her article, Kidron pointed out that 40 percent of the children in the Israeli border town of Sderot suffer from PTSD due to the constant threat of rockets.
The op-ed was posted to Facebook by the group Reject Radicals at Cornell.
Cornell Collective for Justice in Palestine (CCJP) responded to Kidron's comments writing: ""If you want the rockets to stop, end the occupation. Otherwise, quit complaining about how it ruined your brunch plans in Ashdod.""
Back in February, the CCJP had also signed onto the Cornell Students for Justice in Palestine's letter to Cornell President Martha Pollack which called on the school to divest from companies that conduct business with Israel, accusing Israel of engaging in ""apartheid"" and ""ethnic cleansing.""
Rena Nasar, StandWithUs' Tri-State campus director and managing director of campus affairs, said in a statement to the Jewish Journal , ""It is inhumane to minimize the rockets Hamas shoots into Israeli civilian homes and nursery schools. There is no justification for such barbaric terrorism and Israel has a right to defend its citizens.""
""It is shameful that CCJP would skirt the issue of the need for negotiations, and blame only Israel for the lack of peace,"" Nasar said. ""This is yet another example of how boycott campaigns on campus descend into outright hate speech. We urge university leaders to take a clear moral stand by condemning this rhetoric.""
The Journal also reported the university did not respond to their request for comment."
"MUST SEE: Notre Dame Cathedral Devastated, but Despite the Inferno, Prayers Rise and the Cross Remains",www.cbn.com,Caitlin Burke,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/must-see-notre-dame-cathedral-devastated-but-despite-the-inferno-prayers-rise-and-the-cross-remains,"The blaze that engulfed and destroyed a large part of Notre Dame cathedral in Paris has now been fully extinguished.
The world watched in horror Monday as the cathedral went up in flames. Distraught Parisians gathered all around as the iconic structure glowed bright red and smoke filled the skies. Some bowed to pray in the streets as firefighters battled the blaze.
""It was just heartbreaking to watch. The ladders were not tall enough. The hoses were not strong enough,"" said eye witness John Dickas.
The heat from the flames was felt even on the opposite side of the river Seine. At the height of the fire, the cathedral spire that marked the Paris skyline, toppled from the intense flames.
One witness posted this cell-phone video of a group of strangers gathered nearby the burning cathedral singing a prayer in French.
The flames burning out of control could be seen across Paris Monday evening, and there were moments when it seemed the entire structure would burn to the ground. But this morning the bell towers, the facade and the most precious artifacts from inside remain.
For centuries, Notre Dame has stood as the heart of French identity and a symbol of global Christianity – surviving the French revolution, two world wars and Nazi occupation. The Christian landmark has stood for nearly 900 years.
After a 12-hour battle, firefighters say the entire fire is out. The bell towers and facade remain, but two-thirds of the roof is gone.
Officials are investigating the cause, but don't believe it was arson. They say it was more than likely related to the $6 million restoration project.
In an emotional address to France and the world, President Emmanuel Macron pledged to rebuild. ""We'll rebuild Notre-Dame together. I am solemnly telling you tonight: this cathedral will be rebuilt by all of us together. We will rebuild Notre Dame because that is what the French expect, because that is what our history deserves, because it is our destiny,"" Macron said during a news conference Monday night.
Despite the loss, there's relief at what's been saved.
The cathedral's famous organ was damaged but is reportedly intact and this poignant photo from inside shows the cross and altar are still standing.
Precious relics housed inside the cathedral are also safe, most notably, a crown of thorns said to be from the crucifixion of Jesus. The fate of the famous stained-glass windows is still uncertain.
""For the French, my God, for the world, Notre Dame Cathedral represents what's most notable, what's most uplifting, what's most inspirational about the human project and to see that reduced to ashes? My oh my. I remember our song: 'from the ashes we rise up.' We had Ash Wednesday, we went to rise up with Jesus at Easter and I believe that there'll be some rising from this dying,"" said Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York.
During a news conference Tuesday morning, officials said the artifacts saved from Notre Dame will be moved the the Louvre.
President Macron says an international campaign will be launched to help fund rebuilding and restoration efforts. Already a French billionaire has pledged more than $200 million to the project."
Venezuela Losing Its Only Remaining Hope of Salvaging Its Socialist Economy,www.cbn.com,Chuck Holton,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/april/venezuela-losing-its-only-remaining-hope-of-salvaging-its-socialist-economy,"Venezuela is losing its only remaining hope of salvaging its economy. Just when it seemed the socialist meltdown in Venezuela couldn't get any worse, the nation's vital oil industry could be nearing total collapse.
With its huge oil reserves, Venezuela once was Latin America's most prosperous country. Today, the nation's petroleum output is about the same as Romania's, and it could drop even more for two big reasons.
First, the already bankrupt petroleum operation just lost its biggest customer - the United States. Second, nationwide blackouts continue to bring the entire economy to a standstill. And experts say the power outages may have damaged the oil production equipment to such an extent, it may not be able to pump any product.
In the Maracaibo industrial zone, the machinery sits quiet, while oil workers fish the polluted waters for something to eat.
Last month, a report from the International Energy Agency warned Venezuela's output of crude oil could soon collapse to just a tiny fraction of what it was even a few years ago. That would put the country, said to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, in the ironic position of having to import fuel to meet its domestic needs.
Nobody can really begin to count the number of people who have escaped Venezuela and come across the border into Colombia. They say about 40,000 people a day are crossing the border, but in reality, there could be millions. So obviously this cannot continue. Conditions continue to deteriorate and that means something is going to have to happen sooner or later -- whether that comes from within Venezuela or without remains to be seen.
To make the problem worse, cash-strapped Venezuelans fleeing the country are taking the gasoline with them. They smuggle it across the border and sell it on the side of the road in Cucuta.
Back in Maracaibo, broken oil pipes and crumbling infrastructure are making an environmental crisis almost as big as the economic one.
""Because of all the broken pipes you can constantly see oil floating on the water,"" Alirio Lujano, a fisherman, told CBN News .
Jose Gregorio, another fisherman who works in the Venezuelan oil field, said: ""We are used to this because we work in these conditions every day. We have to wash with gasoline to get it off, and that causes a rash on our skin.""
But with their oilfield jobs paying the equivalent of only $3.00 a month, the men have little choice but to eat what they can catch to supplement their already meager diet.
Over the past five years, the United States has seen it's domestic petroleum production skyrocket as high-tech extraction in places like west Texas becomes more profitable. Last year, America passed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's largest producer of crude oil. This means even if Venezuela's industry can recover, the US may not buy as much petroleum as it did before.
And with periodic nationwide blackouts still a problem, this once-thriving industry is paralyzed for the time being. Which means for the foreseeable future, Venezuela's biggest export will be refugees.
""It never used to be like this. It makes me very sad,"" Wilmer Medina, a fisherman, told CBN News ."
Pakistani Prime Minister Says Asia Bibi Will Finally Be Released,www.cbn.com,"Will Maule, Faithwire",04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/pakistani-prime-minister-says-asia-bibi-will-finally-be-released,"Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has told reporters that embattled Christian mother Asia Bibi will finally be allowed to leave Pakistan.
UK Government Advisor ‘Publicly Supported’ Cleric Who Called For Asia Bibi Execution
Bibi, who was convicted of blasphemy and spent a decade on death row, was acquitted by Pakistan’s Supreme Court last October but has since been held at an undisclosed location in the port city of Karachi.
Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Prime Minister Khan said that “she will leave Pakistan in a couple of weeks,” according to the Jerusalem Post .
Bibi’s husband, Ashiq Masih, has been holed up with Bibi since her acquittal. Her children, however, are currently residing in Canada, where the entire family has been granted asylum.
“The case of Asia Bibi is a priority for our government, and we are focused on ensuring the safety of her and her family,” a spokesperson for Canada’s Global Affairs Department, told Faithwire .

The multi-disciplinary government department, which incorporates the Department of Foreign Affairs, said it was “working with like-minded friends and allies on this issue.”
“Canada is prepared to do everything we can to ensure the safety of Asia Bibi. We urge the Government of Pakistan to take all necessary steps to keep her safe,” the spokesperson added.
“Freedom of religion is a fundamental human right, and must be fully respected.”
Why Has The Release Been So Delayed?
Reports indicate that Bibi was initially held at an undisclosed location for her own safety, as radical Islamists sought to take justice into their own hands and hand down the execution that Pakistan’s Supreme Court ruled against.
However, it soon became apparent that the Pakistani government was seeking assurances from Bibi that she would not speak ill of her country in the media upon being released.
Now, having likely secured these assurances, Bibi will be allowed to reunite with her family in Canada.
“There is a little bit of a complication. And I can’t speak on the media about [it],” Khan said, according to the BBC . “But I can assure you she is safe and she will be leaving in weeks.”
What Is The Background?
Bibi was initially arrested back in 2009 after supposedly entering into an argument with a group of women about a source of drinking water. The Islamist women accused Bibi of drinking from the same tap as them, to which Bibi allegedly responded, “Jesus Christ died for my sins. What did the prophet Muhammad do for you?” a remark which they believed offended their revered religious figure.
However, in the Supreme Court’s final judgment, it declared that the two sisters who accused Bibi “had no regard for the truth,” before adding that “the said semi-literate young sisters had a reason to level allegations against the appellant which could be untrue.
The landmark judgment also noted that the prosecution’s presented evidence “was nothing short of concoction incarnate.” According to the highest court in Pakistan, the entire case against Bibi was built on lies."
Israeli Schoolboys Uncover Coin From Christian Emperor Who Persecuted Jews,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/israeli-schoolboys-uncover-coin-from-christian-emperor-who-persecuted-jews,"In February 2019, four ninth-grade students from the Haemeq Hamaaravi High School in Kibbutz Yifat in the Jezreel Valley found a gold coin minted by the Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II.
The four pupils, Ido Kadosh, Ofir Sigal, Dotan Miller, and Harel Grin, stumbled upon the coin while exploring the fields alongside the Zippori stream in the Galilee, adjacent to the Sanhedrin Trail. They immediately recognized that this was no ordinary coin and alerted their geography and history teacher Zohar Porshyn, who contacted the Israel Antiquities Authority.
The 1,600-year-old coin is extremely rare.
""The gold coin is a solidus minted by the emperor Theodosius II in Constantinople (now Istanbul) around 420–423 CE (AD). Similar coins are known from the Eastern Byzantine empire, but this is the first of its type discovered in Israel. One side depicts the image of the emperor and the other shows the image of the [goddess] Victory holding the Staff of the Cross,"" explained IAA numismatic expert Dr. Gabriela Bijovsky.
Theodosius II was one of the most influential emperors of the Byzantine Empire, compiling an Imperial Code of Laws, designated the 'Codex Theodosius'.
The Christian emperor also turned Jews into second-class citizens.
Jews were banned from military and civil service and were not allowed to build new synagogues.
""The emperor Theodosius II abolished the post of the 'Nasi,' the Head of the Sanhedrin Council, and decreed that the Jews' financial contributions to the Sanhedrin be transferred to the Imperial Treasury,"" said Yair Amitzur, IAA chief archaeologist of the Sanhedrin Trail.
""The Sanhedrin Trail initiated by the IAA tells the story of the Jewish leadership in the Galilee at the time of the Mishnah and the Talmud in the Roman and Byzantine periods. It is symbolic that the gold coin discovered adjacent to the Sanhedrin trail reflects the period of dramatic events when the Sanhedrin ceased to function in the Galilee, and the center of Jewish life transferred from the Galilee to Babylon,"" said Amitzur."

Bible scholars from the Doubting Thomas Research Foundation (DTRF) believe they may have discovered the route Moses took when he led the Children of Israel out of slavery from Egypt and to the Promised Land.
The group told the Daily Star Online that they traveled to Saudi Arabia three times during their research and found evidence that the Israelites traveled through the modern-day kingdom to get to Israel.
DTRF researcher Ryan Mauro is still working on this theory but said the most ""plausible"" route is one where the Israelites left Egypt through Cairo and crossed into the Sinai Peninsula. He believes they crossed into ancient Midian and stopped at Mount Sinai, which he claims is the peak of Jabal al-Lawz in eastern Saudi Arabia.
""After three trips to Saudi Arabia, and I'm fully convinced that the Israelites went into the ancient land of Midian when they fled slavery in Egypt,"" he told the Daily Star Online .
Last year, the organization released a documentary detailing their quest to find Mount Sinai in Saudi Arabia.
Mauro said he and his team discovered several pieces of evidence that Jabal al-Lawz is where Mount Sinai was located.
""The golden calf, the split rock, Moses' altar, the Red Sea crossing site; all of these pieces need to fit, and they fit at this site in a way that no other site does,"" he said.
Mount Sinai is traditionally associated with Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. The St. Catherine Monastery was built over what is believed to be the site where God spoke to Moses in the burning bush.
""Perhaps these (skeptics) have doubted the historical account of the Exodus story because of a lack of evidence at the traditional site at St. Catherine's, but what we have found appears to fit the ancient accounts,"" Mauro said of the Jabal al-Lawz peak.
Jabal al-Lawz has been previously been identified as the possible site of Mount Sinai, but scholars doubt this theory.
""There is no credible historical, geographical, archaeological or Biblical evidence for the thesis that Mt. Sinai is at Jabal al-Lawz in Saudi Arabia,"" said creationist researcher Gordon Franz.
Mauro also told the Daily Star Online there is evidence that Moses split the sea at the Gulf of Aqaba on the modern-day beach of Nuweiba. There, the crossing would be just eight miles wide and a depth of only 33 meters (108 feet).
""It's going to take some time to bring this alternative theory into mainstream historiography, but I believe that our work is going to seriously shift the landscape on this subject,"" Mauro said.
Mainstream scholars seriously doubt the historicity of the events recorded in Exodus due to a lack of archaeological evidence.
Mauro encourages them to have an open mind.
""I would basically say to someone who's (skeptical) about the Exodus to keep an open mind about the subject,"" he said. ""These events really did happen. It doesn't require belief in one of these faiths to accept the evidence.""
Mauro said his team is currently trying to piece together an exact timeline and map structure for Exodus based on their findings.
""What I found there was simply mind-blowing. I couldn't believe that there was all this evidence for the Exodus and hardly anyone outside this region was aware of it. "

Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) (Image credit: CBN News) 6026925804001
In an exclusive interview with CBN News Tuesday, US Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) defended his reaction to Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar after she called 9/11 an event in which ""some people did something.""
Crenshaw and others had condemned Omar's statement delivered during a speech at a CAIR meeting in March.
""I saw it shared on social media and my first reaction was: What really, again?"" the first-term Texas congressman said. ""This is a pattern, right. This is not a case of someone misspeaking at a certain point. I think it's obvious that she feels a certain way about terrorism, about 9/11 in particular. And I don't want to attribute motivations, but it was dismissive. The way she referred to it was dismissive.""
But Crenshaw was careful not to endorse the implication that some have made that Omar supports terrorism.
""I don't think she supports any kind of terrorism or anything like that, "" he told CBN News . ""But she did speak about it in a dismissive and disrespectful way. I clearly pointed that out. I said 'Hey, that's unbelievable. Why would you talk about it this way? If you are going to talk about it and you feel like you misspoke, then say you misspoke. But she doesn't. She doubles down. Maybe because she's perfectly fine with the way that came off.""
The congressman also pointed to Omar's history of her repeated anti-Semitic and anti-Israel comments.
""If you're criticizing Israel, but you're doing it in a way that implies that the Jewish people in America have a dual loyalty, that's anti-Semitism. It's more than just criticizing Israeli policy. It's OK to criticize Israeli policy. It's OK to say whatever you want. It's a free country. And it's also OK for the rest of us to say 'We don't like what you're saying.' That's actually our job as members of Congress.”
Crenshaw said these types of comments should be called out.
""Nothing was taken out of context. That is a narrative being perpetuated, which is truly dishonest. And notice nobody can ever explain how it was taken out of context,"" he noted. ""They'll say, 'Well she's explaining how CAIR was founded.' Well, first of all, she got that wrong. She said CAIR was founded after 9/11 and that's just not true. It was founded in 1994. So that's not even true from the beginning.""
The freshman congressman says the left generally uses a sequence of events to try to cover up comments such as Omar's and to distract from the narrative.
""First, they accused me of being against 9/11 victims. They made up some nonsense about refusing to support a bill, by the way, that's not even out of committee. It has nothing to do with the other thing. Of all of the people you're going to choose in Congress to say you didn't support America after 9/11 -- you're going to choose me?"" Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL, asked. ""I went and fought against the people that perpetuated that crime and made sure they never did it again. It's kind of a strange accusation to make.""
“And then the next accusation they tried to make was 'well, you're only attacking her because she's a Muslim woman.' And that's nonsense,"" he added. ""You're a member of Congress and a member of Congress who, by the way, is constantly elevating your status, saying 'I should have a better voice because of these things.' OK, but you can't go in the opposite direction and say 'you're not allowed to talk to me or criticize me because of my identity.' That's a really weak argument and that indicates you don't have a strong set of ideas in the first place that you can defend.”
""Then they got even worse after that. They said we were 'inciting violence.' So criticizing you is inciting violence -- this is the argument that's being used,"" Crenshaw explained. ""That's a real dangerous path to go and is also something we see quite often. You see it on college campuses all the time that any conservative speaker is inciting violence. It's fundamentally not true. Telling people to go do violent things that's inciting violence, right? That's illegal by the way.”
""But criticizing for something they said is never inciting violence,"" the congressman told CBN News. ""To say otherwise is wholly dishonest. I think most Americans know that. But what's been impressive about this is that every Democrat has jumped on that particular narrative like telling the president to stop inciting violence. The president just tweeted out her own words and said 'Never Forget.' In no way, shape or form is that inciting violence. You could make all sorts of criticisms about it. You could maybe say it was over the top.""
""But to say it was inciting violence is an attempt to take an intellectual shortcut. It's an attempt to silence your critics by claiming that they're being violent against you when in fact, they're not. It's a shame to see so many sophisticated people jump on that bandwagon. Again to come around full circle on this and believe it and use that narrative. It's really sad to see. It's not a good place for American discourse,"" Crenshaw continued."
'Made in the Image of God'- How Indiana's Pro-Life Laws Could Change US Abortion Battle,www1.cbn.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/made-in-the-image-of-god-how-indianas-pro-life-laws-could-change-us-abortion-battle,"'Made in the Image of God': How Indiana's Pro-Life Laws Could Change US Abortion Battle
INDIANAPOLIS – The battle over abortion is in high gear in state legislatures across the nation. Lawmakers like those here in Indiana keep churning out measure after measure to limit abortion. And those measures keep getting challenged in court.
But pro-life forces say these court battles are worth it. That's because if a case ends up getting appealed all the way to the US Supreme Court, it could affect the whole country.
One such Indiana case dealing with civil rights for the unborn was struck down last year by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.
Mike Fichter, head of Indiana Right to Life, told CBN News, ""Indiana's actually the only state that's passed a law that protects unborn children based upon their civil rights, that prohibits abortion based upon a child's color of his skin, sex, national origin, disability or Down's Syndrome. The Court has never addressed the civil rights of unborn children before.""
So if the Supreme Court decides to take up the case, Fichter said, ""This is historic.""
Case Could Have a Big Impact on Limiting Legalized Abortion
ACLU of Indiana's lead attorney Kenneth Falk complained if the Court decides to rule on the case, that could potentially open the door for states to limit abortions.
He said, ""The state of Indiana is saying 'prior to viability we have the right to tell you whether or not you can get an abortion.' And once you admit that, then there's no limit to how the state can interfere with that right.""
But though that may dismay Falk, it's the goal of these pro-life Indiana legislators: a fundamental change to Roe v Wade, the ruling that legalized abortion nationwide.
Fichter said, ""We believe that if they accept this appeal, it's a clear sign that the Supreme Court is willing to reconsider Roe. And we hope that the end of Roe v Wade comes from Indiana.""
Ultrasound Laws: Do They Change Minds or Not?
The high court may also take up another state measure.
Fichter explained, ""Indiana's ultrasound law requires that any woman considering an abortion in Indiana must have an opportunity to see an ultrasound of her unborn baby at least 18 hours before she can have an abortion.""
Constitutional law attorney Jenna Ellis says research shows an ultrasound often changes a woman's mind as she sees the baby and hears its heartbeat.
Ellis argued, ""When women see the life of their child and the heartbeat that's beating inside of them, there is still a fundamental conscience that God gives us. And most women can't negate that and suppress it to the point that they are willing to kill their child.""
Falk said that's questionable and he's seen other contradictory research.
Statistics show that most women when they review the ultrasound don't change their mind,"" he insisted, adding, ""Many women refuse to review the ultrasound, which they're allowed to under Indiana law.""
He suspects this law insisting an ultrasound happen 18 hours or more before an abortion was just an attempt to make getting that abortion harder.
Balancing Benefits and Burdens
He argued because of that law, ""Women were having to travel great distances, hundreds and hundreds of miles twice to get abortions. And what the evidence showed in this case was this prevented women from obtaining abortions.""
Which is why the ACLU attorney believes a court ruled against the ultrasound measure - based on the suspicion Indiana was just trying to make it more difficult to get an abortion.
As Falk put it, ""The state had no good reason for changing the ultrasound requirement to an 18-hour requirement. And abortion jurisprudence today requires you to balance the burdens on women getting an abortion with the benefits to the state. And the court found there was very little if any benefit and lots of burden.""
Indiana Right to Life's Fichter countered, ""Human life is of interest to any state. So it is of interest to the state of Indiana. In addition to that, Indiana law requires that childbirth is encouraged over abortions. So this is directly of interest to the state of Indiana.""
Injunction 'Literally Costing Lives'
And he bemoaned how a court slapping an injunction on the ultrasound law is having a deadly impact, saying, ""As soon as the injunction went into effect, we've seen a large spike in abortions in the state of Indiana. So we know that it informs women. We know that it helps women choose life. The fact that it has an injunction on it right now is literally costing lives in the state of Indiana. So it's extremely important that this case is heard by the Supreme Court.""
Ellis insists ultrasounds can be crucial game-changers in moving women away from abortion, saying, ""If we're giving women all of the information and we're showing a woman through advanced medical technology 'this isn't just a glob of cells in you, this is a living human being that is a separate human being made in the image of God,' then we're going to see more and more women not even choose to make that choice.""
Ellis continued, ""What the Founders said in the Declaration was that truth is self-evident. And that's what we see in ultrasounds: we see the self-evident fact that this is a human being.""
Granting the Unborn Dignity Even in Death
Also, the Court is considering whether to rule on an Indiana measure Fichter said would treat aborted babies like they were indeed human beings.
He stated, ""It's saying the remains of an unborn child that's been aborted are not just garbage to throw into a landfill – which, unfortunately, that's what happens right now.""
The ACLU's Falk pointed out the measure doesn't really put fetal remains on an equal par with humans who were born and died later, because this measure still allows those fetal remains to be treated differently than any other human's body.
""The state has to have a rational reason for doing what it's doing, and what the state is saying is 'we want to require these remains be honored as if they were a person,'"" Falk explained. ""One of the problems with the law is that it has within it contradictions to the state's own purpose.""
For instance, Falk stated, ""What the law says is if the woman wants to take the fetal remains or tissue remaining after an abortion or miscarriage home with them and throw it away, they can. The law states the remains can be cremated en masse, which you can't do with a human body.""
'It's Not Just a Clump of Cells'
Ellis, though, is hopeful if the Court takes up this fetal remains measure, it could have an important impact.
""The human remains of an aborted child is a human being,"" she insisted. ""And so for fetal remains to have to be treated as a human being individually, I think that that would really show that the Court understands that this is truly a child, it's not just a clump of cells or some other organ that we're removing from the woman's body. It's not part of the woman's body. It has its own distinct DNA and everything.""
Fichter said of fetal remains measure, ""It makes a very strong point about the dignity of an unborn child's life.""
The hope of many pro-life advocates is the more cases that put the humanity of the unborn before the justices, the better the chance those justices will back off from the rulings that legalized the killing of those unborn."
Good Friday — From Our Lord’s Perspective,feeds.cbn.com,Lisa.Webber,04-16-2019,2019,4,http://feeds.cbn.com/devotions/Good-Friday-from-our-lords-perspective,"Michael Gabriele
I wished I had fainted or blacked out, but anxiety-induced adrenaline kept me alert as they dragged me to the waiting cross. They flopped me upon the main log with all the care and attention of tossing a sack of feed into a trough. I did not resist their arms sliding me into position, the wood splintering my wounds. Surrounded by my executioners, I hardly heard the scattered voices of other soldiers keeping bystanders back.
A grieving woman crying my name drifted through the commotion. My mother? Mary Magdala?
The swarming, boisterous soldiers and the lingering wails from the already crucified victims drowned everything else. I again tensed in terror at the sudden vibration of hammer against nail as they secured a wooden pedestal to the beam for my feet. The Romans treated crucifixion as any engineering job—performed precisely with a process. Based on my height, they had carefully measured where to place my feet so that even when pierced with a nail, I’d be able to painfully support my weight, ensuring a slow death.
They then stretched my arms wide, dislocating my left shoulder, and quickly determined where my hands should go. Marked with quick notches to the wood, they bore starter holes, readying the timber to easily but tightly receive the nails that would drive through my wrists.
With preparations fully complete, they could now crucify me. A soldier pulled my hand to the waiting hole and clutched it firmly in place by my wrist. Two others held me down by my opposite arm. Another retrieved a mallet and a long iron spike. My chest heaved in dreadful anticipation of his obvious task. And although I held perfectly still, it was neither exhaustion nor the weight of the soldiers that kept me in place.
Love.
Love steadied me. My greatest expression of love for the world. Why would I resist? This was not surrender. God’s commitment to humanity culminated now in this ultimate act of self-giving.
I felt the stinging stab of the nail gouging my sacred flesh as the soldier pressed it into the very base of my palm, centered where hand met wrist. His mallet raised. It seemed to hang in the air forever before rushing downward and connecting with the large nail head. This single hammer smash propelled the spike through my hand—driving through nerves, cartilage, carpal bones and into the wood of the crossbeam. The iron sliced my wrist’s median nerve, roaring pain up my entire arm, exploding into my brain. I choked on the air that gasped and groaned from my lips. Three more pounds of the mallet shot waves of torment through my whole body.
They wasted no time wrenching my other hand over the wood, tugging my already pinioned wrist against the anchored spike. I clenched my jaw. Blood seethed through my teeth with every breath.
Again the hammer came down, and another nail fired into the bed of my palm and out the back of my wrist. Intolerable pain leapt through my arm, arching my back and thrusting the thorns further into my head. I hardly felt them over the screaming, searing nerves of my extremities.
In this insufferable state of mind-drilling torture, I could have easily howled for their immediate destruction. As it were, I did call loudly for my Father’s powerful actions upon them. I made an urgent demand regarding those who nailed me to this beam, as well as on those who condemned me to this fate and handed me over to such extreme evil.
“Father, forgive them,” I cried as they positioned my feet, one over the other against the pedestal. “They know not what they do!” (Luke 23:34 ESV)
The cold sound of mallet against nail carried the crunch of iron into bone and the agonizing pain of tender feet impaled onto wood.
Dear Jesus, when I contemplate the pain you must have endured as you were nailed to your sacred cross, I struggle to equate your unimaginable suffering with the words “Good Friday.” But then I remember why you submitted yourself to such agony … for me. You took my sins upon your shoulders, and by your wounds, I am healed. (Isaiah 53:5 ESV)

Israeli and Evangelical Leaders to Trump: Do Not Give Up Jewish Land for Peace with Palestinians,www1.cbn.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/israeli-and-evangelical-leaders-to-trump-do-not-give-up-jewish-land-for-peace-with-palestinians,"Israeli and Evangelical Leaders to Trump: Do Not Give Up Jewish Land for Peace with Palestinians 04-17-2019 CBN News
An American Evangelical leader and Israeli settler leader are urging President Donald Trump not to give up Jewish land for peace in his upcoming peace plan for Israelis and Palestinians.
Family Research Council President Tony Perkins and Samaria Regional Council Mayor Yossi Dagan voiced their concerns Tuesday in a joint piece published in T he Washington Times .
""The Trump administration should stay the course, continuing to avoid the 'land for peace' proposals, and the policies that have prevented Israelis from building in Judea and Samaria, which have repeatedly failed to work,"" Dagan and Perkins said in the editorial.
The two leaders are concerned Trump's pending peace agreement will call for Israelis to withdraw from settlement communities in the West Bank (Judea and Samaria).
For Dagan, the idea of giving up Jewish settlements for peace is personal. He fled the Sa-Nur settlement in Samaria when Israel withdrew and then destroyed it in the 2005 Disengagement Plan in an effort to create lasting peace with Palestinian leaders. It was one of four settlements that were demolished in the West Bank. Israel also withdrew from Gaza as part of the plan. Today, Gaza is controlled by the Hamas terror group, which presents a major security threat to Israel.
""One thing is clear, we won't sit on the sidelines while world leaders play with our future,"" said Dagan. ""We will use all the tools and connections we have to ensure that any [peace] plan... will not harm the State of Israel or Judea and Samaria.""
Their warnings come after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to extend Israeli sovereignty over Jewish communities in the West Bank, causing some to question the likelihood of a future Palestinian state in the West Bank with eastern Jerusalem as its capital.
""From my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and we have the responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians,"" Netanyahu told Israeli media days before the country's national elections.
Trump has yet to publicly respond to Netanyahu's comments about the West Bank.
Dagan and Perkins ended their editorial by saying that while they want peace, Trump must take into account the consequences of well-intentioned but potentially bad decisions.
""One of us is a Christian, the other an Orthodox Jew,"" they wrote. ""We both pray for and desire peace, stability and freedom in the Middle East. But just because we desire something to be does not make it so. We cannot control whether the necessary parties come to the negotiating table, and we should not fail to speak the truth and recognize reality because of the fear of others' reactions."" "
'Major Medical Breakthrough': Israeli Scientists Print World's First 3D Heart with Human Tissue,www1.cbn.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/major-medical-breakthrough-israeli-scientists-print-worlds-first-3d-heart-with-human-tissue,"'Major Medical Breakthrough': Israeli Scientists Print World's First 3D Heart with Human Tissue 04-17-2019 Emily Jones
Israeli scientists made history Monday by unveiling the world's first 3D-printed human heart made with real human tissue.
Printing a 3D heart is the process by which scientists use a computer to join together biochemical material layer by layer in order to develop a heart that eventually can be transplanted into a human being.
The miniature heart was created by researchers at Tel Aviv University and they believe it is a ""major medical breakthrough"" for future heart transplant patients.
Tal Dvir, who led the project, told AFP it marked ""the first time anyone anywhere has successfully engineered and printed an entire heart replete with cells, blood vessels, ventricles and chambers."" Israeli scientists revealed the world's first 3D-printed heart, which was created using a patient’s own cells!

— Israel ישראל (@Israel) April 15, 2019
""People have managed to 3D-print the structure of a heart in the past, but not with cells or with blood vessels,"" he continued.
Transplant patients often wait years before finding a suitable donor and there are no guarantees their body will accept the donated heart. Many patients' bodies reject the transplant, leaving them with life-threatening consequences.
The Israeli scientists seek to overcome this problem by taking a biopsy of fatty tissue from the patient to develop the ""ink"" for the printed heart.
According to a statement from Tel Aviv University, the scientists believe using the patient's own body tissue to create their new heart will eliminate the risk of their body rejecting the transplant.
""The biocompatibility of engineered materials is crucial to eliminating the risk of implant rejection, which jeopardizes the success of such treatments,"" said Dvir.
The Israeli scientists announced their findings in the peer-reviewed journal called Advanced Science .
The heart is about the size of a cherry. The human cells used to create the heart are able to contract but cannot pump blood yet.
The research team's next step is to teach the cells to pump like a healthy heart. Dvir said they hope to begin transplanting 3D printed hearts into animal models in a year.
The scientists will have to also overcome the challenge of learning how to expand the cells to create a full-sized human heart. Another challenge is figuring out how to print the tiny capillaries found in the heart."

Omar Barghouti, the founder of the worldwide Boycotts, Sanctions, and Divestments movement against Israel, is outraged that he was barred from entering the United States last Wednesday.
Barghouti wrote in an editorial piece for The Guardian that he was traveling to the US to promote the BDS movement and attend his daughter's wedding but Israeli officials stopped him from boarding his flight.
""I was abruptly stopped and prevented from boarding my flight at Ben Gurion airport. The US consulate informed the airline staff that US immigration has banned me from entering the country, despite having a valid visa, without providing a reason,"" he wrote.
Barghouti speculates that he was banned because Israel is ""outsourcing its anti-Democratic tactics to the US.""
""Given my regular, unhindered travel to the US for years, this ban seems to be an ideologically and politically motivated measure that fits in with Israel's escalating repression against human rights defenders,"" he claimed.
A State Department official refused to discuss the details of Barghouti's visa.
""Visa records are confidential under U.S. law; therefore, we cannot discuss the details of individual visa cases,"" the official told NPR.
Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs said it was not connected to the matter and had no knowledge of the US' decision to bar Barghouti.
Barghouti then blasted US President Donald Trump for recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and moving the US embassy to Jerusalem. He also criticized Congress for passing laws that allow states to boycott businesses that embrace the BDS movement against Israel.
""All of this has emboldened Israel's hardline rightwing government to accelerate its racist, oppressive policies towards the Palestinian people,"" he argued.
This is not the first time the BDS leader has had trouble leaving Israel.
According to The Times of Israel , Israel has prohibited Barghouti from leaving the Jewish States multiple times in recent years by refusing to renew his travel documents.
In February, Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs and Public Diplomacy released a report alleging that members of the BDS movement are linked to terrorists.
The report entitled, ""Terrorists in Suits: The Ties Between NGOs Promoting BDS and Terrorist Organizations"" names 13 NGO's that support the BDS movement.
Out of the 13 NGOs examined, the report identifies more than 100 connections between BDS organizations and terrorists. Those connections include joint campaigns, funding, and even manpower.
Barghouti openly supports Palestinians' ""armed resistance"" against Israelis."
Columbine Threat by Woman with Gun Shuts Denver-Area Schools,www1.cbn.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/columbine-threat-by-woman-with-gun-shuts-denver-area-schools,"Columbine Threat by Woman with Gun Shuts Denver-Area Schools 04-17-2019 Associated Press School police officers locked down Columbine High School and Denver-area schools after a threat late Tuesday, April 16, 2019 (AP Photo)
LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) - Denver-area public schools will be closed Wednesday as authorities search for a young Florida woman who flew to the city and bought a gun after becoming ""infatuated"" with the mass shooting at Columbine High School.
The FBI said Sol Pais, 18, is ""considered to be extremely dangerous"" and ""made threats to commit an act of violence in the Denver metropolitan area"" just days before the 20th anniversary of the attack that killed 13 people.
All schools in the Denver area were urged to tighten security because the threat was deemed ""credible and general,"" said Patricia Billinger, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Safety. Columbine and more than 20 other schools outside Denver lock their doors for nearly three hours Tuesday afternoon before Wednesday's complete closures were announced.
The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office and the FBI say Pais traveled to Colorado from Miami on Monday night and bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition.
Denver Public Schools said that all facilities and programs will be closed Wednesday, and there will be no afternoon activities or athletic competitions. The district said the decision to close campuses was in collaboration with other Denver metro-area school districts due to the ongoing safety concern.
On Tuesday, some schools released their students after additional security was called in and canceled evening activities or moved them inside.
""We always have heightened awareness close to high-profile anniversaries like this,"" Billinger said.
Authorities said Pais was last seen near Columbine -- in the Jefferson County foothills outside Denver -- wearing a black T-shirt, camouflage pants and black boots. They appealed for anyone seeing her to call an FBI tip line at 303 630-6227, and said she is too dangerous to be approached by civilians. The alert also said police who come into contact with her should detain her and evaluate her mental health.
""This has become a massive manhunt ... and every law enforcement agency is participating and helping in this effort,"" Dean Phillips, special agent in charge of the FBI in Denver, said late Tuesday night.
The FBI's Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force issued a notice Tuesday describing Pais as ""infatuated with (the) Columbine school shooting.""
Sheriff's spokesman Mike Taplin said the threats she made were general and not specific to any school.
The Denver Post reported that a call to a phone number listed for Pais' parents in Surfside, Florida, was interrupted by a man who identified himself as an FBI agent and said he was interviewing them.
Surfside Police Sgt. Marian Cruz confirmed that her parents last saw her on Sunday and reported her missing on Monday. The Miami Herald and WTVJ are reporting that neighbors say the teen is a senior at Miami Beach High School.
The Associated Press left messages at two numbers listed for Pais' relatives in Florida, while another number was disconnected.
Two teenage gunmen attacked Columbine on April 20, 1999, killing 12 classmates and a teacher.

"For the First Crucial 23 Minutes, No One Detected a Fire in Notre Dame",www1.cbn.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/for-the-first-crucial-23-minutes-no-one-detected-a-fire-in-notre-dame,"For the First Crucial 23 Minutes, No One Detected a Fire in Notre Dame
In the critical early moments of the fire at Paris' renowned Notre Dame cathedral, no one suspected that a devastating inferno was growing.
The first alarm went off at 6:20 p.m. during evening mass as a priest was reading from the Bible. Organist Johann Vexo said that people didn't immediately react. He and some others started to leave the building but then came back.
Those who initially searched for a fire found nothing.
Vexo chatted with colleagues for another twenty minutes and said because he didn't see fire or smoke he thought the alarm was a mistake.
But when a second alert went off at 6:43 p.m. officials discovered the fire on the cathedral's roof. From there, it went on to consume most of Notre Dame's wooden structure including its spire. The two bell towers and the facade survived.
Engineers spent Tuesday looking for structural weaknesses as dozens of investigators began the search for a cause. So far, they've ruled out arson and believe the restoration work underway may be to blame.
French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to rebuild an even more beautiful building and says a five-year plan is possible--although not everyone agrees.
Private donations from top French businesses are pouring in. Already, close to one billion dollars has been raised and French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe says the government will give ordinary citizens special tax cuts to encourage more donations.
The Spiritual Loss
On a spiritual level, the loss is immeasurable.
Ed Condon, the DC bureau chief for the Catholic News Agency, told CBN News it's impossible to overstate the cathedral's spiritual significance to Western civilization. And he acknowledged that the timing, during the beginning of Easter week, is stunning.
""I think big, dramatic moments ... like this fire at Notre Dame, are a great time to give us pause as individuals, for the French as a nation, but also for us as a wider culture to really say, 'Are we really taking seriously what we're preparing for?'""
Dr. Corne Bekker, the dean of Regent University's seminary said the moment could provide France with an opportunity to re-focus on its Christian heritage.
""We sometimes think of France as an ex-Christian country but I do not think we should make that mistake. They have deep Christian roots there and the story is not finished yet,"" he said."

A teacher in the United Kingdom has been fired for her stand against pro-LGBT teaching at her son's primary school run by the Church of England.
Kristy Higgs of Fairford, Gloucestershire posted on her personal Facebook page, according to the London Daily Mail , that the school was requiring ""relationship education"" be mandatory. In one example, she says the school had started using books about a boy who wears dresses.
She wrote, ""Which means, for example, that children will be taught that all relationships are equally valid and 'normal,' so that same-sex marriage is exactly the same as traditional marriage, and that gender is a matter of choice, not biology, so that it's up to them what sex they are.""
Higgs went on to say that teaching fundamental Christian beliefs will become forbidden and freedom of belief will be destroyed.
The mother-of-two, who had worked at her son's Christian primary school for six years, invited her Facebook followers to sign a petition against the new sex education measure in October 2018. One anonymous complaint about the post was sent to the school, accusing her of ""posting homophobic and prejudiced views.""
Higgs was then sent to a disciplinary panel that found her guilty of ""gross misconduct"" because she could have ""potentially"" hurt the school's reputation. But on a contradictory note, the panel also stated ""there was no actual evidence"" of damage to the school.
Higgs argues her termination was because of her Christian views on sex education which are ""shared by hundreds of thousands"" of parents.
""As soon as the investigation began I was repeatedly told, 'This is nothing to do with your religion',"" stated Higgs. ""That was clearly a legal tactic and of course it has everything to do with my religion.""The Christian Legal Centre, Higgs' legal team, is taking the case to the employment tribunal. The CLC shared in a statement, ""This is all about the freedom of a Christian to hold biblical views.""
Higgs' complaint is a result of growing liberalism within the UK's education system. Recently, the UK Department of Education established a new requirement for students as young as five to learn about LGBT relationships and gender reassignment. They have even allowed head teachers to ""overrule"" parents who don't want their children to participate in the controversial sex education classes.
""Pupils growing up in families with LGBT members, or who are beginning to understand that they are or may be LGBT themselves, should feel that relationships education and RSE (relationships and sex education) is relevant to them,"" the new guidelines stated.
Colin Hart, chairman of the Coalition for Marriage, criticized the lessons as ""completely unacceptable"" and warned they will ""downgrade marriage.""
""The Department for Education is sidelining traditional marriage, the most stable form of relationship for raising children and forcing them to learn about every other form of relationship under the sun, even when it is not age-appropriate. The law should encourage traditional marriage, not undermine it,"" he said."
Breakthrough: Movie Review,feeds.cbn.com,Chris.Carpenter,04-11-2019,2019,4,http://feeds.cbn.com/movies/breakthrough-movie-review,"More on this movie at IMDb.com Disclaimer CBN is not endorsing the films or TV shows CBN.com reviews. Our goal is to provide information about the latest in entertainment, both the good and the bad, so you may make an informed decision as to what is appropriate for you and your families. Chris Carpenter - Director of Internet Programming
With a commitment to uplifting people through entertainment, film producer DeVon Franklin certainly has developed a reputation for crafting faith-based cinema with a nod to the miraculous.
From the dramatic rescue that restored a family in Miracles from Heaven to the rambunctious re-telling of the greatest story ever told in The Star , Franklin knows a thing or two about miraculous storytelling.
Now comes his latest release, Breakthrough , based on the amazing true story of a mother refusing to give up on her son despite seemingly insurmountable medical odds.
Starring Chrissy Metz ( This is Us) , Topher Grace ( Spiderman 3) , Josh Lucas ( Sweet Home Alabama ), and Dennis Haysbert ( Far from Heaven ), the movie is directed by television veteran Roxann Dawson ( Star Trek: Voyager ), who is making her feature film debut.
THE MOVIE IN A MINUTE
Adopted as an infant by loving but sometimes overbearing parents Joyce and Brian Smith, 14-year-old John Smith is having a difficult time processing who he really is. While he seemingly has a great life fueled by his love for basketball, good music, and close friends, something is missing. His longing for identity has created more then a few tension filled moments with his parents. It takes a tragedy to ultimately help them find the common ground they so desperately need.
When John falls through the ice into a bitterly cold Missouri lake, he remains beneath the surface for more than 15 minutes. Without a pulse and his body temperature dropping quickly, life has all but slipped away from John. But as he lies lifeless, Joyce refuses to give up. Leaning heavily on her all-encompassing belief in a loving God, she inspires others around her to pray for her son’s recovery. Joyce’s unrequited love for God and family serve as a helpful reminder that faith and unbridled hope can create a miracle.
THE GOOD AND BAD OF BREAKTHROUGH
With good performances throughout from a veteran cast, Metz shines as Joyce Smith, a woman who believes that all things are possible through faith in God. Dawson certainly knows how to get the best from the actress best known for her role in the television series This is Us . Metz is a force of nature in the film as she delivers in scene after scene.
For his part, Haysbert is superb in his role as the world-renowned physician leading John’s recovery team. Respectful of science and the medical odds of survival, the Hollywood veteran does a commendable job of balancing the family’s faith-infused hope and the sobering expectation of John’s chances.
Lucas and Grace provide a nice counter balance to each other in the movie. Lucas as the highly concerned, understated father juxtaposed against Grace’s brash, hipster family pastor who initially irritates Joyce mightily but eventually gains her favor. And while the dynamics between Grace’s character and the Smith family seem a bit over the top and contrived at times, they ultimately prove worthy in the end.
Best known for her television directing work on Crossing Jordan and Star Trek: Enterprise, Dawson utilizes effective dialogue and an honest treatment of prayer’s power to capture the true essence of this modern day miracle.
Especially pleasing is that Breakthrough doesn’t fall into the trap of being a faith-based movie that has a cookie-cutter happy ending. While being delivered from certain death is certainly a joyous occasion by all accounts, the film is unafraid to show the sometimes-difficult backlash John Smith faced from teachers and students in the months following his return to normal life.
The only place where the movie really falters is the strained, overdramatic scene of a choir of people standing outside John’s hospital room window to perform a stylized version of a praise and worship song accompanied by a full band. However, there is only one problem. There is no band to be found. Also, a scene featuring Metz making peace with God on the hospital’s rooftop seems just too perfect as the snowflakes fall gently around her.
IN THE END
Even though it is predictable at times, Breakthrough will appeal to both faith-based and general audiences. The blend of a tremendously inspiring true story, great casting, and performances that draw skillfully on emotion and heart make this a highly compelling movie. Breakthrough provides an exhilarating reminder that faith and undeniable hope can move mountains and in this case defy science.

During his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution, Konzelman said 94 clinic workers have approached former Planned Parenthood executive Abby Johnson’s nonprofit, And Then There Were None, according to Pure Flix Insider .
‘Unplanned’ Movie Director Says Film Was Made ‘For Such a Time as This’
“One percent of the abortion workers in the United States, after getting one look at them being portrayed on film,” he said, “have decided to change their lives … and what they do for a living.”

The Pure Flix filmmaker was on Capitol Hill to speak on a panel regarding Twitter’s alleged censorship of “Unplanned.” On its opening weekend in late March, the social media platform temporarily suspended the film’s promotional account.
“Unplanned” chronicles Johnson’s eight-year career at Planned Parenthood and her conversion to the pro-life movement after she watched a doctor perform an abortion via ultrasound.
Ashley Bratcher, the actor who portrays Johnson in the faith-based movie, tweeted Thursday she receives messages “every single day” from people whose lives — and minds — were changed after seeing “Unplanned.”

The movie beat box-office expectations for its opening weekend, bringing in $6.1 million — more than doubling forecasted earnings.
Pro-Life Movie ‘Unplanned’ Makes Stunning Debut at Box Office
In an interview earlier this year with Faithwire, Konzelman said “Unplanned” was made “for such a time as this,” noting the series of pro-abortion bills that have passed state houses across the U.S. in recent months.
“We couldn’t have foreseen the rapid developments that are suddenly coming to a head,” he said, “but we serve a God who could, and did.”"

'Major Medical Breakthrough': Israeli Scientists Print World's First 3D Heart with Human Tissue,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/major-medical-breakthrough-israeli-scientists-print-worlds-first-3d-heart-with-human-tissue,"Israeli scientists made history Monday by unveiling the world's first 3D-printed human heart made with real human tissue.
Printing a 3D heart is the process by which scientists use a computer to join together biochemical material layer by layer in order to develop a heart that eventually can be transplanted into a human being.
The miniature heart was created by researchers at Tel Aviv University and they believe it is a ""major medical breakthrough"" for future heart transplant patients.
Tal Dvir, who led the project, told AFP it marked ""the first time anyone anywhere has successfully engineered and printed an entire heart replete with cells, blood vessels, ventricles and chambers.""
Israeli scientists revealed the world's first 3D-printed heart, which was created using a patient’s own cells!
This medical breakthrough provides great hope and opens future possibilities for patients around the world who suffer from heart-disease pic.twitter.com/NTERs82yUy
— Israel ישראל (@Israel) April 15, 2019
""People have managed to 3D-print the structure of a heart in the past, but not with cells or with blood vessels,"" he continued.
Transplant patients often wait years before finding a suitable donor and there are no guarantees their body will accept the donated heart. Many patients' bodies reject the transplant, leaving them with life-threatening consequences.
The Israeli scientists seek to overcome this problem by taking a biopsy of fatty tissue from the patient to develop the ""ink"" for the printed heart.
According to a statement from Tel Aviv University, the scientists believe using the patient's own body tissue to create their new heart will eliminate the risk of their body rejecting the transplant.
""The biocompatibility of engineered materials is crucial to eliminating the risk of implant rejection, which jeopardizes the success of such treatments,"" said Dvir.
The Israeli scientists announced their findings in the peer-reviewed journal called Advanced Science .
The heart is about the size of a cherry. The human cells used to create the heart are able to contract but cannot pump blood yet.
The research team's next step is to teach the cells to pump like a healthy heart. Dvir said they hope to begin transplanting 3D printed hearts into animal models in a year.
The scientists will have to also overcome the challenge of learning how to expand the cells to create a full-sized human heart. Another challenge is figuring out how to print the tiny capillaries found in the heart."
'Jesus Holds the Victory Flag': Archaeologists Uncover What Could Be Jesus' Last Supper Room in a Way You've Never Seen Before,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-12-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/jesus-holds-the-victory-flag-israeli-archaeologists-uncover-jesus-last-supper-room-in-a-way-youve-never-seen-before,"JERUSALEM, Israel - Thousands are visiting Jerusalem this week to celebrate Easter and the events leading up to Resurrection Day. The most popular attractions will be the historic locations that played significant roles during Holy Week.
The Bible says Jesus had a final Passover meal with his disciples before going to the cross. The Cenaculum on Mount Zion is the traditional site of the Upper Room.
The Cenaculum’s ancient walls, worn-down surfaces, and poor illumination have made it hard for researchers to study its history.
Now, Israeli archaeologists know more about this site than ever before thanks to state-of-the-art technology used to uncover the upper room’s secrets.
“Using ground-penetrating radar, laser measurement, laser scanning, and an advanced photography technique, we managed to reach every corner of the Last Supper room. We managed to create an accurate 3-D model of the place. We even managed to penetrate inside the ancient stones,” archaeologist Amit Re'em told CBN News.
For years, many wondered when was the room built and if it is the real place of the Last Supper. Re’em told CBN News the structure dates back to the Crusader period.
The technology helped uncover old artwork on the walls and decipher religious symbols. Re'em said they found symbols of the ""Lion of Judah"" and ""Angus Dei"", a lamb that represents Jesus.
“Now, I’m pointing toward the keystone of the Gothic arches and on the keystone, where nobody saw before, you could see the holy lamb, the Agnus Dei – this is the tail and the legs and the head – and the holy lamb is holding a flag – the victorious flag. Jesus holds the victory flag,” Re’em explained while pointing the images out to CBN News.
On another keystone, there’s a lion.
“You can see the tail of the lion right here, you can see the leg and the head is a little bit broken. The Lion actually is the symbol of King David. Now we know according to the Bible that Jesus is the descendant of the Davidic dynasty,” he said.
Underneath the 12th century Crusader church, there’s evidence of a magnificent 4th-century Byzantine church where early Christians worshipped.
The building was renovated to its current form in 1335 by Franciscan monks.
“This church possessed many, many relics,” Re’em said. “According to the traditions in the story the crown of thorns was here and maybe the Byzantines built their church on much earlier and ancient sacred site.”
For many, visiting the Last Supper room is a moving experience.
“When you told me about the new technology it moved this place in my estimation from a possible to a probable,” Caleb Company founder Don Finto told CBN News .
In Christian tradition, it is more than the site of the Last Supper. It was also the room where early believers encountered the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.
Pilgrim Marie Christina Kaul says she can feel the presence of God here.
“It’s fantastic. It’s like this place has the power of the Presence and what He’s been teaching me all over Israel and this is just another example it’s like this place is like a different note on the scale of the song of God,"" Kaul said.
Re’em says it’s too early to know if this is the place Jesus had his Last Supper with his disciples but he said he’s learned one thing as an archaeologist about traditions.
“The tradition regarding the Last Supper room is very, very old. It goes back for centuries…Hear this ancient tradition, explore there because inside them is embedded, is hidden some truth,” he said."
Israeli and Evangelical Leaders to Trump: Do Not Give Up Jewish Land for Peace with Palestinians,www.cbn.com,CBN News,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/israeli-and-evangelical-leaders-to-trump-do-not-give-up-jewish-land-for-peace-with-palestinians,"An American Evangelical leader and Israeli settler leader are urging President Donald Trump not to give up Jewish land for peace in his upcoming peace plan for Israelis and Palestinians.
Family Research Council President Tony Perkins and Samaria Regional Council Mayor Yossi Dagan voiced their concerns Tuesday in a joint piece published in T he Washington Times .
""The Trump administration should stay the course, continuing to avoid the 'land for peace' proposals, and the policies that have prevented Israelis from building in Judea and Samaria, which have repeatedly failed to work,"" Dagan and Perkins said in the editorial.
The two leaders are concerned Trump's pending peace agreement will call for Israelis to withdraw from settlement communities in the West Bank (Judea and Samaria).
For Dagan, the idea of giving up Jewish settlements for peace is personal. He fled the Sa-Nur settlement in Samaria when Israel withdrew and then destroyed it in the 2005 Disengagement Plan in an effort to create lasting peace with Palestinian leaders. It was one of four settlements that were demolished in the West Bank. Israel also withdrew from Gaza as part of the plan. Today, Gaza is controlled by the Hamas terror group, which presents a major security threat to Israel.
""One thing is clear, we won't sit on the sidelines while world leaders play with our future,"" said Dagan. ""We will use all the tools and connections we have to ensure that any [peace] plan... will not harm the State of Israel or Judea and Samaria.""
Their warnings come after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to extend Israeli sovereignty over Jewish communities in the West Bank, causing some to question the likelihood of a future Palestinian state in the West Bank with eastern Jerusalem as its capital.
""From my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and we have the responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians,"" Netanyahu told Israeli media days before the country's national elections.
Trump has yet to publicly respond to Netanyahu's comments about the West Bank.
Dagan and Perkins ended their editorial by saying that while they want peace, Trump must take into account the consequences of well-intentioned but potentially bad decisions.
""One of us is a Christian, the other an Orthodox Jew,"" they wrote. ""We both pray for and desire peace, stability and freedom in the Middle East. But just because we desire something to be does not make it so. We cannot control whether the necessary parties come to the negotiating table, and we should not fail to speak the truth and recognize reality because of the fear of others' reactions."""
Anti-Israel BDS Founder Blames Israel for Being Denied Entry into the US,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/anti-israel-bds-founder-blames-israel-for-being-denied-entry-into-the-us,"Omar Barghouti, the founder of the worldwide Boycotts, Sanctions, and Divestments movement against Israel, is outraged that he was barred from entering the United States last Wednesday.
Barghouti wrote in an editorial piece for The Guardian that he was traveling to the US to promote the BDS movement and attend his daughter's wedding but Israeli officials stopped him from boarding his flight.
""I was abruptly stopped and prevented from boarding my flight at Ben Gurion airport. The US consulate informed the airline staff that US immigration has banned me from entering the country, despite having a valid visa, without providing a reason,"" he wrote.
Barghouti speculates that he was banned because Israel is ""outsourcing its anti-Democratic tactics to the US.""
""Given my regular, unhindered travel to the US for years, this ban seems to be an ideologically and politically motivated measure that fits in with Israel's escalating repression against human rights defenders,"" he claimed.
A State Department official refused to discuss the details of Barghouti's visa.
""Visa records are confidential under U.S. law; therefore, we cannot discuss the details of individual visa cases,"" the official told NPR.
Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs said it was not connected to the matter and had no knowledge of the US' decision to bar Barghouti.
Barghouti then blasted US President Donald Trump for recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and moving the US embassy to Jerusalem. He also criticized Congress for passing laws that allow states to boycott businesses that embrace the BDS movement against Israel.
""All of this has emboldened Israel's hardline rightwing government to accelerate its racist, oppressive policies towards the Palestinian people,"" he argued.
This is not the first time the BDS leader has had trouble leaving Israel.
According to The Times of Israel , Israel has prohibited Barghouti from leaving the Jewish States multiple times in recent years by refusing to renew his travel documents.
In February, Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs and Public Diplomacy released a report alleging that members of the BDS movement are linked to terrorists.
The report entitled, ""Terrorists in Suits: The Ties Between NGOs Promoting BDS and Terrorist Organizations"" names 13 NGO's that support the BDS movement.
Out of the 13 NGOs examined, the report identifies more than 100 connections between BDS organizations and terrorists. Those connections include joint campaigns, funding, and even manpower.
Barghouti openly supports Palestinians' ""armed resistance"" against Israelis."
"When You Understand it Medically, You'll Appreciate Christ's Sacrifice, Suffering, and Death All the More",www1.cbn.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/when-you-understand-it-medically-youll-appreciate-christs-sacrifice-suffering-and-death-all-the-more,"When You Understand it Medically, You'll Appreciate Christ's Sacrifice, Suffering, and Death All the More
Christians all know Christ died for them on the cross. But a doctor here in Indianapolis who studied crucifixion for a decade says until you understand what Jesus went through medically, it's hard to fully appreciate just how much He suffered to pay for the sins of mankind.
""It was the worst form of death that was imaginable,"" Dr. Joseph Bergeron, the author of The Crucifixion of Jesus , said. ""And the Romans had been using it for three centuries by the time Jesus came along, so it was well perfected.""
Doctor Rules Out Suffocation
Bergeron told CBN News, ""Most often on Easter we hear talks about how Jesus suffocated while He was on the cross.""
However, the doctor says suffocation doesn't gel with the gospel accounts of Jesus talking on the cross.
""He talked to the Apostle John, for example. He spoke to the thieves who were crucified with Him. When you're suffocating and struggling for your last breath, you have no interest in carrying on a conversation,"" he argued.
And though that would be a bad way to die, the Romans made sure such a relatively quick death wouldn't happen so that those they crucified suffered much longer.
""There are literary references to people being on the cross for a week. When you're suffocating, you're just not going to last that long,"" the doctor shared, adding, ""With crucifixion, it was a slow and torturous death.""
Big Clue in Christ's Own Words: 'This is My Blood That's Poured Out…'
The real cause of death shows up in Christ's own prophetic words at the Last Supper.
""Jesus told us how He was going to die. He said 'this is my blood that's poured out for the remission of sins.' That's not suffocation. That's bleeding to death. That's shock. That's the complications of shock.""
The precise medical term Bergeron uses is ""traumatic hemorrhagic shock.""
Christ knowing such a grim death was racing towards Him would be one explanation for the odd occurrence of Him sweating blood in the garden of Gethsemane.
Jesus in Traumatic Anguish Before the Physical Suffering Began
""And to be honest with you, I never really understood that or even thought it happened,"" Bergeron admitted. ""But in studying the crucifixion extensively over the last 10 years, I've come to understand that sweating blood does actually occur. There've been very few cases – just a handful. They're always before severe injury, the threat of injury, and usually before execution. That Jesus sweat drops of blood meant that He fully understood what was about to happen to Him.""
And then it began as Jesus was taken captive and led off to two groups of tormentors. The Jews and Romans both bludgeoned and tore His flesh in two vicious beatings.
Bergeron said of those Jews, ""Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin convicted Him of blasphemy, which was punishable by death.""
But under Roman rule the Jews had no authority to execute, so they physically and brutally punished Him. Then a whole company of Roman soldiers beat Him to within an inch of His life.
What Riled the Romans
The author explained, ""Now you have to understand that Romans didn't like the Jews to begin with. They were anti-Semitic. And for this person who's charge was basically political insurrection: naming Himself King of the Jews, that would have heightened their anger and worsened the beating that He had experienced from Roman soldiers.""
Bergeron said of Jesus, ""And so His beating exceeded what was typical for crucifixion victims. And He had extensive blood loss and tissue injury from that.""
So the shock began to set in before Christ reached Calvary.
Why He Couldn't Carry the Cross
""It looked like He was beginning to experience shock just walking there. Because He couldn't carry part of the cross to the crucifixion site. He would have been expected to do that. Everybody else did, but He could not,"" Bergeron said.
That led the doctor to diagnose, ""So He was getting weak and going into shock at that time more likely than not.""
Then came just about the most painful and humiliating execution the Romans could administer.
Crucifixion 'Considered Obscene'
""It was considered obscene,"" Bergeron shared. ""A Roman citizen wouldn't ever be crucified. It was meant for political insurgents, rank criminals and escaped slaves.""
It all punished Jesus' body with a shock so traumatic as to kill him hours sooner than most people crucified.
The doctor explained shock would stop Christ's blood from clotting.
""This is a very ominous complication, difficult to control even in modern trauma centers,"" he shared from his years of medical experience. ""In Jesus' time, there would be no treatment and it would lead to rapid death. And that explains why Jesus died so rapidly: six hours, rather than days, which could be the case very often.""
Dying Rapidly, but Horribly
The Son of God died rapidly, but horribly. Which leaves Bergeron in awe of the sacrifice.
He told CBN News in a quiet, reverent tone, ""That He would become a human being and come here and do that to rectify our relationship as humans with God, to redefine it and restore us to fellowship with God, it's an amazing thing.""
And on that cross, Jesus Christ showed how simple it is to find salvation in Him.
Then this doctor and man of faith shared, ""The prayer to know God is so simple. It's like the thief on the cross. He didn't know what to say, so just: 'please remember me.' And a sincere prayer from anyone is never turned away. Jesus told him that he would be in paradise that day.""
Bergeron realizes it's tough to face all the gory details of Christ's death. But he believes it can help us love and respect all the more a God willing to come down to earth and face such pain and agony so humans could be cleansed from their sins and spend eternity with Him."

First Liberty Institute's Keisha Russell appeared on CBN's Newswatch program Wednesday to discuss the organization's investigation into the San Antonio City Council's decision to ban Chick-fil-A from the local airport.
CBN News has learned the San Antonio City Council may revisit its vote to ban Chick-fil-A from the San Antonio International Airport.
As CBN News reported , the city council voted last month to remove the popular restaurant from its concession contract at the airport. A Chick-fil-A concession stand was one of 10 proposed concepts made to the council by a company seeking to open a restaurant section located in Terminal A of the San Antonio airport, according to the San Antonio Current .
""With this decision, the City Council reaffirmed the work our city has done to become a champion of equality and inclusion,"" Councilman Roberto C. Treviño had said in a statement to the paper. ""We don't have room in our public facilities for a business with a legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior.""
But City Councilman and mayoral candidate Greg Blockhouse told CBN News on Wednesday that the council will reconsider the move at Thursday night's council meeting.
In the meantime, First Liberty Institute , a Dallas-based religious liberty law firm is investigating the city council's decision.
""The City's decision to ban Chick-fil-A was blatant, illegal religious discrimination,"" Hiram Sasser, general counsel to First Liberty Institute, said in a press release. ""We want to know just how deep the religious animosity runs within San Antonio's city government. A tolerant and inclusive city should have nothing to hide.""
Attorneys with First Liberty are requesting all public records, including staff reports, comments and assessments concerning the proposed agreement with the City of San Antonio and the company which had included Chick-fil-A in its proposal for the remodeling of the airport.
The request also seeks communications, notes, or other documents, including but not limited to emails, text messages, notes, statements, letters, reports, and comments, produced by members of the San Antonio City Council, or any employee or staff member of the City Council relating to the contract or to Chick-fil-A."

(AP Photo/Eric Gay
PHOENIX (AP) - Detained asylum seekers who have shown they have a credible fear of returning to their country will no longer be able to ask a judge to grant them bond.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr decided Tuesday that asylum seekers who clear a ""credible fear"" interview and are facing removal don't have the right to be released on bond by an immigration court judge while their cases are pending. The attorney general has the authority to overturn prior rulings made by immigration courts, which fall under the Justice Department.
It's Barr's first immigration-related decision since taking office. The American Civil Liberties Union said late Tuesday that the plan was unconstitutional and that it planned on suing.
Typically, an asylum seeker who crosses between ports of entry would have the right to ask a judge to grant them bond for release. Under the new ruling, they will have to wait in detention until their case is adjudicated.
""There will be many, many people who are not gonna even have the opportunity to apply for release now,"" said Gregory Chen, director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Chen said that about 90 percent of asylum seekers pass their credible fear interview, the first step in seeking asylum.
The decision doesn't affect asylum-seeking families because they generally can't be held for longer than 20 days. It also doesn't apply to unaccompanied minors.
Barr's ruling takes effect in 90 days and comes amid a frustrating time for the administration as the number of border crossers has skyrocketed. Most of them are families from Central America who are fleeing violence and poverty. Many seek asylum.
There were a total of 161,000 asylum applications filed in the last fiscal year and 46,000 in the first quarter of 2019, according to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts.
Sarah Pierce, policy analyst for the Migration Policy Institute, said the number of decisions by immigration judges that the administration of President Donald Trump has referred to itself for review is unprecedented. The administration - under both Barr and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions - has reviewed a total of 10 immigration rulings. That's compared to four under all of President Barack Obama's tenure and nine during George W. Bush's.
""This has been a really unprecedented use of power to influence the immigration system,"" Pierce said.

US Flag 'Intimidating to Immigrants'?

The Stunning Police Car Debate in Laguna Beach 04-17-2019 (Image credit: Laguna Beach Police Department/Facebook)
The City of Laguna Beach will keep the American flag design on its police cars.
After a spirited public comment session attended by more than 200 people, the city council voted Tuesday night to keep the current design featuring the American flag in the background on all police vehicles.
The Los Angeles Times reports the council first agreed to redesign the city's Ford Explorer police vehicles in February, choosing a black-and-white look and the image of Old Glory running through the word ""police"" on the doors.
The council decided to revisit its decision this month ""out of an abundance of caution"" after hearing complaints from residents and acknowledging that the bold-colored design currently on the cars doesn't match the option the council initially chose, Mayor Pro Tem Steve Dicterow said in an interview Monday.
The graphic the council chose had a cloud-like look to the flag inside the lettering.
Patrick Cannon, a longtime Laguna Beach resident, told the council when he sees the new logo on police cars, he sees ""Immigration and Customs Enforcement"" because the red and white of the flag runs through the capital letters ""ice"" in ""police,"" the Times reported.
Franklin Graham took the opportunity to congratulate the citizens and the city council of Laguna Beach for keeping the US flag in a Facebook post Tuesday.
""Can you believe that someone complained about the design incorporating elements of Old Glory—saying it might seem aggressive or intimidating to immigrants. Wow. Does this complainer not realize that what that flag stands for is the reason so many people want to come to this country?"" the evangelist wrote.
""At a standing room only city council meeting last night, nearly every person in the room raised their hand that they supported the new design. The city council voted to keep it. Good job Laguna Beach!"" Graham continued."
'He Is a Male': Iowa High School Girls Stage Walk-Out Over Transgender Student Using Girls' Restroom,www1.cbn.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/he-is-a-male-iowa-high-school-girls-stage-walk-out-over-transgender-student-using-girls-restroom,"'He Is a Male': Iowa High School Girls Stage Walk-Out Over Transgender Student Using Girls' Restroom 04-17-2019 Steve Warren
Girls at an Iowa high school are asking for privacy in their bathrooms after a male who says he's a female began using the female facility.
Twenty girls at Council Bluffs High School staged a walkout last week chanting ""We want privacy"" and ""He is a male.""
The walkout was triggered by a female student who believes her privacy is being invaded by a student who recently began to identify as a girl. The transgender student is a biological male, according to television station WOWT .
Another 40 students did the same in favor of transgender students using whichever restroom they want.
Under Iowa state law, the school is required to allow transgender students to use the restroom of the gender with which they identify.
""According to the US Department of Education, which Iowa has adopted that same language and is now a part of our state law, our students who are transitioning into a new gender have the right to use the restroom that they identify. So it is our obligation to allow that to occur,"" Dr. Vickie Murillo, superintendent of the Council Bluffs Community School District, told the television station .
""We felt very uncomfortable with a male, who's not doing anything to be transgender, going into the female restrooms,"" student Elana Owens said.
Brandi Scherlund, another student, said: ""I believe if you have the male parts you go to the males' bathroom and if you have the female parts you go to a ladies room and that's just the way I was raised.""
WOWT reported the school was prepared for the walkout and no students were punished for participating in the protests."
Justice Department Set to Release Redacted Mueller Report,www1.cbn.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/barr-to-news-conference-thursday-morning-on-muellers-russia-report,"Justice Dept. Releases Redacted Mueller Report, Dems and Media Furious 04-17-2019
LATEST Mueller Report in a Nutshell: Russia Interference Was 'Sweeping', but Trump Camp Wasn't Part of It
WASHINGTON - Democrats and the media are in an uproar, accusing US Attorney General William Barr of being a ""shill"" for the president, all because of a press conference.
Even up to the moment of the report's release, controversy escalated around Barr's handling of the Mueller report.
Democrats have been criticizing his decision to hold a press conference before making it available to them. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said, ""The attorney general appears to be waging a media campaign on behalf of President Trump.""
Democrats are demanding Barr let the report speak for itself.
Nadler continued, ""The fact that the attorney general is not releasing even the redacted report to Congress until after his press conference will again result in the report being presented through his own words, rather than through the words of Special Counsel Robert Mueller."" This come as the New York Times reports Justice Department officials have been in contact with White House attorneys about Mueller's conclusions. But Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said, ""I've not seen it. The president has not seen it.""
Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) tweeted, ""The process is poisoned.""
And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said, ""AG Barr has thrown out his credibility.""
Members of the media are piling on too.
NBC News political analyst Nicolle Wallace said, ""It's no longer the Mueller report. It's now the two guys, Barr and Rosenstein... who put their finger on the scale and made the decision about obstruction that Mueller didn't make, spinning the decision they made when they put the finger on the scale about obstruction, which Mueller wouldn't do, the Mueller report. It's no longer the release of the Mueller report, guys.""
Los Angeles Times White House reporter Eli Stokol said, ""I think you know if you want the public to take this report seriously and to believe the Justice Department is credible, you would probably think twice about putting the head of the Justice Department out on TV to do spin for you.""
It was President Trump who broke the news about Barr's news conference during a radio interview Wednesday. ""You'll see a lot of very strong things come out.""
Barr quoted directly from Mueller's report in declaring the investigation found no evidence Trump and his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia.
On allegations of obstruction of justice, Mueller gave no final call, but Barr concluded there was not enough evidence to prove any obstruction. The Washington Post reports today that Mueller couldn't reach a conclusion because he couldn't determine the president's intent.
And members of Congress are demanding the full, unredacted report, saying they need all the underlying evidence to draw their own conclusions.
Meanwhile, Trump and his legal team are coming out with a robust legal defense of their own, preparing a cut-down version of the report. The president says the report fully exonerates him.
We're told we will not hear from Robert Mueller today, but he could still be called before Congress to testify in the days to come."
Pakistani Prime Minister Says Asia Bibi Will Finally Be Released | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/pakistani-prime-minister-says-asia-bibi-will-finally-be-released,"Pakistani Prime Minister Says Asia Bibi Will Finally Be Released 04-16-2019
UK Government Advisor ‘Publicly Supported’ Cleric Who Called For Asia Bibi Execution
Bibi, who was convicted of blasphemy and spent a decade on death row, was acquitted by Pakistan’s Supreme Court last October but has since been held at an undisclosed location in the port city of Karachi.
Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Prime Minister Khan said that “she will leave Pakistan in a couple of weeks,” according to the Jerusalem Post .
Bibi’s husband, Ashiq Masih, has been holed up with Bibi since her acquittal. Her children, however, are currently residing in Canada, where the entire family has been granted asylum.
“The case of Asia Bibi is a priority for our government, and we are focused on ensuring the safety of her and her family,” a spokesperson for Canada’s Global Affairs Department, told Faithwire .

The multi-disciplinary government department, which incorporates the Department of Foreign Affairs, said it was “working with like-minded friends and allies on this issue.”
“Canada is prepared to do everything we can to ensure the safety of Asia Bibi. We urge the Government of Pakistan to take all necessary steps to keep her safe,” the spokesperson added.
“Freedom of religion is a fundamental human right, and must be fully respected.”
Why Has The Release Been So Delayed?
Reports indicate that Bibi was initially held at an undisclosed location for her own safety, as radical Islamists sought to take justice into their own hands and hand down the execution that Pakistan’s Supreme Court ruled against.
However, it soon became apparent that the Pakistani government was seeking assurances from Bibi that she would not speak ill of her country in the media upon being released.
Now, having likely secured these assurances, Bibi will be allowed to reunite with her family in Canada.
“There is a little bit of a complication. And I can’t speak on the media about [it],” Khan said, according to the BBC . “But I can assure you she is safe and she will be leaving in weeks.”
What Is The Background?
Bibi was initially arrested back in 2009 after supposedly entering into an argument with a group of women about a source of drinking water. The Islamist women accused Bibi of drinking from the same tap as them, to which Bibi allegedly responded, “Jesus Christ died for my sins. What did the prophet Muhammad do for you?” a remark which they believed offended their revered religious figure.
However, in the Supreme Court’s final judgment, it declared that the two sisters who accused Bibi “had no regard for the truth,” before adding that “the said semi-literate young sisters had a reason to level allegations against the appellant which could be untrue.
The landmark judgment also noted that the prosecution’s presented evidence “was nothing short of concoction incarnate.” According to the highest court in Pakistan, the entire case against Bibi was built on lies. "

Expand Your Horizons
You've been searching for a long time for your new home, without success. Maybe you're looking in the wrong place.
According to the Census Bureau's 2017 American Housing Survey (AHS), 35% of people who had recently moved did so because they wanted a larger or higher-quality home – and that dream home may require moving to a different area. The AHS found that another 18% relocated to reduce their housing costs. Apparently, an affordable home that met their needs (or wants) wasn't available in their immediate area.
Relocation can mean anything from moving across town to moving across the country. How far are you willing to move away from your current home to find a different one? You may not be able to make a long-distance move. Jobs, family responsibilities, or schools may keep you nearby – or maybe you really like your current area and don't want to move far away.
A recent NerdWallet study shows varied home migration habits across America, with people preferring to stay in their existing area but a sizable number making a larger leap to a new area.
America's Migration Patterns
Data from NerdWallet's Migration and Housing Affordability Analysis shows that from 2012 to 2016, an average 47 million residents moved each year – but the majority of those moves were within the same metropolitan area.
For example, the Boston metro area averaged 442,318 movers within the area annually from 2012 to 2016. During the same period, Boston averaged 189,432 newcomers annually and 144,215 residents moving out annually.
New York City and Chicago both lost more residents to migration than they gained, but all the other metro areas studied had a net increase in new residents just from migration – potentially disrupting local housing markets.
Unless home availability keeps up with the influx of new homebuyers in any individual market, prices will rise – and price gains are forcing potential homebuyers to rent in some of these markets.
NerdWallet's analysis found that most people moving to a new metro area are renters – averaging 68% across all markets. San Diego had the lowest percentage of newcomer homebuyers at 23%, while Phoenix and Tampa tied for the highest percentage (41%).
Affordability depends on how much income you can devote to housing. The survey found that in every metro area analyzed, the median homeowner income was more than double that of the median renter income. In most areas, homeowners spent between 18% and 22% of their income on housing, but renters spent between 30% and 33%– making it even more difficult for renters to save and join the housing market in the future.
Plenty of homeowners are living on the edge as well. In fifteen of the surveyed metro areas, homeowners paid at least $500 more a month on average housing costs than renters.
Assess Needs and Get Finances Ready
A successful relocation requires planning and preparation – and not just with finances. You may know what you're looking for in a home, but do you know what you will accept?
Consider today's deal-breakers, but also think about the future. If you have children (or more children), is the space adequate ? If you're getting older, will the house accommodate limited mobility as you age? Will your favorite features now still be your favorites in twenty years?
Objectively assess what you're looking for in a home and rank the attributes in order. You're more likely to resist an impulse buy or stretching beyond your means to get a particular home.

Justice Department Set to Release Redacted Mueller Report,www.cbn.com,Associated Press,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/barr-to-news-conference-thursday-morning-on-muellers-russia-report,"LATEST Mueller Report in a Nutshell: Russia Interference Was 'Sweeping', but Trump Camp Wasn't Part of It
WASHINGTON - Democrats and the media are in an uproar, accusing US Attorney General William Barr of being a ""shill"" for the president, all because of a press conference.
Even up to the moment of the report's release, controversy escalated around Barr's handling of the Mueller report.
MORE Attorney General Barr's Full Remarks on the Release of the Mueller Report

Democrats have been criticizing his decision to hold a press conference before making it available to them. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) said, ""The attorney general appears to be waging a media campaign on behalf of President Trump.""
Democrats are demanding Barr let the report speak for itself.
Nadler continued, ""The fact that the attorney general is not releasing even the redacted report to Congress until after his press conference will again result in the report being presented through his own words, rather than through the words of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.""
This come as the New York Times reports Justice Department officials have been in contact with White House attorneys about Mueller's conclusions. But Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, said, ""I've not seen it. The president has not seen it.""
Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) tweeted, ""The process is poisoned.""
And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said, ""AG Barr has thrown out his credibility.""
Members of the media are piling on too.
NBC News political analyst Nicolle Wallace said, ""It's no longer the Mueller report. It's now the two guys, Barr and Rosenstein... who put their finger on the scale and made the decision about obstruction that Mueller didn't make, spinning the decision they made when they put the finger on the scale about obstruction, which Mueller wouldn't do, the Mueller report. It's no longer the release of the Mueller report, guys.""
Los Angeles Times White House reporter Eli Stokol said, ""I think you know if you want the public to take this report seriously and to believe the Justice Department is credible, you would probably think twice about putting the head of the Justice Department out on TV to do spin for you.""
It was President Trump who broke the news about Barr's news conference during a radio interview Wednesday. ""You'll see a lot of very strong things come out.""
Barr Quote: d directly from Mueller's report in declaring the investigation found no evidence Trump and his 2016 campaign colluded with Russia.
On allegations of obstruction of justice, Mueller gave no final call, but Barr concluded there was not enough evidence to prove any obstruction. The Washington Post reports today that Mueller couldn't reach a conclusion because he couldn't determine the president's intent.
And members of Congress are demanding the full, unredacted report, saying they need all the underlying evidence to draw their own conclusions.
Meanwhile, Trump and his legal team are coming out with a robust legal defense of their own, preparing a cut-down version of the report. The president says the report fully exonerates him.
We're told we will not hear from Robert Mueller today, but he could still be called before Congress to testify in the days to come."
"San Antonio City Council to Revisit Chick-fil-A Ban, 'First Liberty' Investigates 'Religious Discrimination'",www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/san-antonio-city-council-to-revisit-chick-fil-a-ban-first-liberty-investigates-religious-discrimination,"First Liberty Institute's Keisha Russell appeared on CBN's Newswatch program Wednesday to discuss the organization's investigation into the San Antonio City Council's decision to ban Chick-fil-A from the local airport.
CBN News has learned the San Antonio City Council may revisit its vote to ban Chick-fil-A from the San Antonio International Airport.
As CBN News reported , the city council voted last month to remove the popular restaurant from its concession contract at the airport. A Chick-fil-A concession stand was one of 10 proposed concepts made to the council by a company seeking to open a restaurant section located in Terminal A of the San Antonio airport, according to the San Antonio Current .
""With this decision, the City Council reaffirmed the work our city has done to become a champion of equality and inclusion,"" Councilman Roberto C. Treviño had said in a statement to the paper. ""We don't have room in our public facilities for a business with a legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior.""
But City Councilman and mayoral candidate Greg Blockhouse told CBN News on Wednesday that the council will reconsider the move at Thursday night's council meeting.
In the meantime, First Liberty Institute , a Dallas-based religious liberty law firm is investigating the city council's decision.
""The City's decision to ban Chick-fil-A was blatant, illegal religious discrimination,"" Hiram Sasser, general counsel to First Liberty Institute, said in a press release. ""We want to know just how deep the religious animosity runs within San Antonio's city government. A tolerant and inclusive city should have nothing to hide.""
Attorneys with First Liberty are requesting all public records, including staff reports, comments and assessments concerning the proposed agreement with the City of San Antonio and the company which had included Chick-fil-A in its proposal for the remodeling of the airport.
The request also seeks communications, notes, or other documents, including but not limited to emails, text messages, notes, statements, letters, reports, and comments, produced by members of the San Antonio City Council, or any employee or staff member of the City Council relating to the contract or to Chick-fil-A."
'He Is a Male': Iowa High School Girls Stage Walk-Out Over Transgender Student Using Girls' Restroom,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/he-is-a-male-iowa-high-school-girls-stage-walk-out-over-transgender-student-using-girls-restroom,"Girls at an Iowa high school are asking for privacy in their bathrooms after a male who says he's a female began using the female facility.
Twenty girls at Council Bluffs High School staged a walkout last week chanting ""We want privacy"" and ""He is a male.""
The walkout was triggered by a female student who believes her privacy is being invaded by a student who recently began to identify as a girl. The transgender student is a biological male, according to television station WOWT .
Another 40 students did the same in favor of transgender students using whichever restroom they want.
Under Iowa state law, the school is required to allow transgender students to use the restroom of the gender with which they identify.
""According to the US Department of Education, which Iowa has adopted that same language and is now a part of our state law, our students who are transitioning into a new gender have the right to use the restroom that they identify. So it is our obligation to allow that to occur,"" Dr. Vickie Murillo, superintendent of the Council Bluffs Community School District, told the television station .
""We felt very uncomfortable with a male, who's not doing anything to be transgender, going into the female restrooms,"" student Elana Owens said.
Brandi Scherlund, another student, said: ""I believe if you have the male parts you go to the males' bathroom and if you have the female parts you go to a ladies room and that's just the way I was raised.""
WOWT reported the school was prepared for the walkout and no students were punished for participating in the protests."
US Flag 'Intimidating to Immigrants'? The Stunning Police Car Debate in Laguna Beach,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/2019/april/us-flag-intimidating-to-immigrants-the-stunning-police-car-debate-in-laguna-beach,"The City of Laguna Beach will keep the American flag design on its police cars.
After a spirited public comment session attended by more than 200 people, the city council voted Tuesday night to keep the current design featuring the American flag in the background on all police vehicles.
The Los Angeles Times reports the council first agreed to redesign the city's Ford Explorer police vehicles in February, choosing a black-and-white look and the image of Old Glory running through the word ""police"" on the doors.
The council decided to revisit its decision this month ""out of an abundance of caution"" after hearing complaints from residents and acknowledging that the bold-colored design currently on the cars doesn't match the option the council initially chose, Mayor Pro Tem Steve Dicterow said in an interview Monday.
The graphic the council chose had a cloud-like look to the flag inside the lettering.
Patrick Cannon, a longtime Laguna Beach resident, told the council when he sees the new logo on police cars, he sees ""Immigration and Customs Enforcement"" because the red and white of the flag runs through the capital letters ""ice"" in ""police,"" the Times reported.
Franklin Graham took the opportunity to congratulate the citizens and the city council of Laguna Beach for keeping the US flag in a Facebook post Tuesday.
""Can you believe that someone complained about the design incorporating elements of Old Glory—saying it might seem aggressive or intimidating to immigrants. Wow. Does this complainer not realize that what that flag stands for is the reason so many people want to come to this country?"" the evangelist wrote.
""At a standing room only city council meeting last night, nearly every person in the room raised their hand that they supported the new design. The city council voted to keep it. Good job Laguna Beach!"" Graham continued."
"When You Understand it Medically, You'll Appreciate Christ's Sacrifice, Suffering, and Death All the More",www.cbn.com,Paul Strand,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/when-you-understand-it-medically-youll-appreciate-christs-sacrifice-suffering-and-death-all-the-more,"Christians all know Christ died for them on the cross. But a doctor here in Indianapolis who studied crucifixion for a decade says until you understand what Jesus went through medically, it's hard to fully appreciate just how much He suffered to pay for the sins of mankind.
""It was the worst form of death that was imaginable,"" Dr. Joseph Bergeron, the author of The Crucifixion of Jesus , said. ""And the Romans had been using it for three centuries by the time Jesus came along, so it was well perfected.""
Doctor Rules Out Suffocation
Bergeron told CBN News, ""Most often on Easter we hear talks about how Jesus suffocated while He was on the cross.""
However, the doctor says suffocation doesn't gel with the gospel accounts of Jesus talking on the cross.
""He talked to the Apostle John, for example. He spoke to the thieves who were crucified with Him. When you're suffocating and struggling for your last breath, you have no interest in carrying on a conversation,"" he argued.
And though that would be a bad way to die, the Romans made sure such a relatively quick death wouldn't happen so that those they crucified suffered much longer.
""There are literary references to people being on the cross for a week. When you're suffocating, you're just not going to last that long,"" the doctor shared, adding, ""With crucifixion, it was a slow and torturous death.""
Big Clue in Christ's Own Words: 'This is My Blood That's Poured Out…'
The real cause of death shows up in Christ's own prophetic words at the Last Supper.
""Jesus told us how He was going to die. He said 'this is my blood that's poured out for the remission of sins.' That's not suffocation. That's bleeding to death. That's shock. That's the complications of shock.""
The precise medical term Bergeron uses is ""traumatic hemorrhagic shock.""
Christ knowing such a grim death was racing towards Him would be one explanation for the odd occurrence of Him sweating blood in the garden of Gethsemane.
Jesus in Traumatic Anguish Before the Physical Suffering Began
""And to be honest with you, I never really understood that or even thought it happened,"" Bergeron admitted. ""But in studying the crucifixion extensively over the last 10 years, I've come to understand that sweating blood does actually occur. There've been very few cases – just a handful. They're always before severe injury, the threat of injury, and usually before execution. That Jesus sweat drops of blood meant that He fully understood what was about to happen to Him.""
And then it began as Jesus was taken captive and led off to two groups of tormentors. The Jews and Romans both bludgeoned and tore His flesh in two vicious beatings.
Bergeron said of those Jews, ""Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin convicted Him of blasphemy, which was punishable by death.""
But under Roman rule the Jews had no authority to execute, so they physically and brutally punished Him. Then a whole company of Roman soldiers beat Him to within an inch of His life.
What Riled the Romans
The author explained, ""Now you have to understand that Romans didn't like the Jews to begin with. They were anti-Semitic. And for this person who's charge was basically political insurrection: naming Himself King of the Jews, that would have heightened their anger and worsened the beating that He had experienced from Roman soldiers.""
Bergeron said of Jesus, ""And so His beating exceeded what was typical for crucifixion victims. And He had extensive blood loss and tissue injury from that.""
So the shock began to set in before Christ reached Calvary.
Why He Couldn't Carry the Cross
""It looked like He was beginning to experience shock just walking there. Because He couldn't carry part of the cross to the crucifixion site. He would have been expected to do that. Everybody else did, but He could not,"" Bergeron said.
That led the doctor to diagnose, ""So He was getting weak and going into shock at that time more likely than not.""
Then came just about the most painful and humiliating execution the Romans could administer.
Crucifixion 'Considered Obscene'
""It was considered obscene,"" Bergeron shared. ""A Roman citizen wouldn't ever be crucified. It was meant for political insurgents, rank criminals and escaped slaves.""
It all punished Jesus' body with a shock so traumatic as to kill him hours sooner than most people crucified.
The doctor explained shock would stop Christ's blood from clotting.
""This is a very ominous complication, difficult to control even in modern trauma centers,"" he shared from his years of medical experience. ""In Jesus' time, there would be no treatment and it would lead to rapid death. And that explains why Jesus died so rapidly: six hours, rather than days, which could be the case very often.""
Dying Rapidly, but Horribly
The Son of God died rapidly, but horribly. Which leaves Bergeron in awe of the sacrifice.
He told CBN News in a quiet, reverent tone, ""That He would become a human being and come here and do that to rectify our relationship as humans with God, to redefine it and restore us to fellowship with God, it's an amazing thing.""
And on that cross, Jesus Christ showed how simple it is to find salvation in Him.
Then this doctor and man of faith shared, ""The prayer to know God is so simple. It's like the thief on the cross. He didn't know what to say, so just: 'please remember me.' And a sincere prayer from anyone is never turned away. Jesus told him that he would be in paradise that day.""
Bergeron realizes it's tough to face all the gory details of Christ's death. But he believes it can help us love and respect all the more a God willing to come down to earth and face such pain and agony so humans could be cleansed from their sins and spend eternity with Him."
From Practicing Witchcraft to Worshipping Jesus Christ in Cuba,www.cbn.com,Emily Towns,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/from-practicing-witchcraft-to-worshipping-jesus-christ-in-cuba,"Santeria — a form of modern witchcraft that fuses Catholic practices and African folk beliefs — is prevalent in Cuba. In fact, according to the U.S. State Department, some sources estimate that as many as 80 percent of Cubans practice Santeria.
But because of generous donors supporting Cuban church planters, a strong body of Christ-followers is growing in this once closed-off country.
Aleja, whose name we’ve changed for security, is a church planter who has seen the incredible impact your gifts have made.
Recently, Aleja helped plant a church in a neighborhood that was particularly opposed to the Gospel. The neighbors all followed Santeria, and every home was marked with pagan signs.
But eventually, the church members’ acts of love and service began to open doors.
“In our church, we not only meet to worship the Lord and build ourselves with His presence and His Word, but we go out to help the needy of the neighborhood,” Aleja said. “We share the blessings we receive, and in this way, we establish bridges of friendship and love.”
Like the early church in the book of Acts , this congregation’s compassion began to reach even the most resistant people in the neighborhood. However, one man held so strongly to his pagan beliefs that he threatened the church. He was considered to be the head of the cult, and his family was very influential in the community.
The believers began to consistently pray for this family – over the course of several years. Eventually, the man’s grandson attended a Sunday service. He was so moved by the Gospel that he joined the church and invited his grandmother — the wife of the man who had been threatening the Christ-followers.
The boy’s grandmother had been sick and unable to work for some time. Doctors had warned that because of her infection, they would possibly need to amputate her leg and operate on her kidneys. But the church gathered around the woman and began to pray for a miracle.
When she returned to the doctors, they were amazed. She no longer needed an operation! The woman praised God, made a decision to follow Christ, and was baptized. Now, she is sharing her testimony with her friends, family, and everyone in the neighborhood — including her husband.
“He is still very much against God and against the Christians, but we know the Lord fights for His people and defends them, and we continue to pray for him to meet Jesus,” says Aleja.
When you help support church planters , you show people that with God, nothing is impossible. You demonstrate how great His love is by being His hands and feet and meeting a community’s needs.
You can support the spread of the Gospel without ever getting on an airplane!
Thank you for helping to transform the hearts and lives of people in Cuba and bringing light into the darkest neighborhoods around the world.

Americans Are On The Move: Economic News You Can Use,www.cbn.com,MoneyTips,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/april/americans-are-on-the-move-economic-news-you-can-use,"Expand Your Horizons
You've been searching for a long time for your new home, without success. Maybe you're looking in the wrong place.
According to the Census Bureau's 2017 American Housing Survey (AHS), 35% of people who had recently moved did so because they wanted a larger or higher-quality home – and that dream home may require moving to a different area. The AHS found that another 18% relocated to reduce their housing costs. Apparently, an affordable home that met their needs (or wants) wasn't available in their immediate area.
Relocation can mean anything from moving across town to moving across the country. How far are you willing to move away from your current home to find a different one? You may not be able to make a long-distance move. Jobs, family responsibilities, or schools may keep you nearby – or maybe you really like your current area and don't want to move far away.
A recent NerdWallet study shows varied home migration habits across America, with people preferring to stay in their existing area but a sizable number making a larger leap to a new area.
America's Migration Patterns
Data from NerdWallet's Migration and Housing Affordability Analysis shows that from 2012 to 2016, an average 47 million residents moved each year – but the majority of those moves were within the same metropolitan area.
For example, the Boston metro area averaged 442,318 movers within the area annually from 2012 to 2016. During the same period, Boston averaged 189,432 newcomers annually and 144,215 residents moving out annually.
New York City and Chicago both lost more residents to migration than they gained, but all the other metro areas studied had a net increase in new residents just from migration – potentially disrupting local housing markets.
Unless home availability keeps up with the influx of new homebuyers in any individual market, prices will rise – and price gains are forcing potential homebuyers to rent in some of these markets.
NerdWallet's analysis found that most people moving to a new metro area are renters – averaging 68% across all markets. San Diego had the lowest percentage of newcomer homebuyers at 23%, while Phoenix and Tampa tied for the highest percentage (41%).
Affordability depends on how much income you can devote to housing. The survey found that in every metro area analyzed, the median homeowner income was more than double that of the median renter income. In most areas, homeowners spent between 18% and 22% of their income on housing, but renters spent between 30% and 33%– making it even more difficult for renters to save and join the housing market in the future.
Plenty of homeowners are living on the edge as well. In fifteen of the surveyed metro areas, homeowners paid at least $500 more a month on average housing costs than renters.
Assess Needs and Get Finances Ready
A successful relocation requires planning and preparation – and not just with finances. You may know what you're looking for in a home, but do you know what you will accept?
Consider today's deal-breakers, but also think about the future. If you have children (or more children), is the space adequate ? If you're getting older, will the house accommodate limited mobility as you age? Will your favorite features now still be your favorites in twenty years?
Objectively assess what you're looking for in a home and rank the attributes in order. You're more likely to resist an impulse buy or stretching beyond your means to get a particular home.
Meanwhile, lay the financial groundwork for your move. Adjust your current budget to allow down payment savings and settle on a future budget that includes your mortgage payment and other housing costs such as taxes and maintenance. Be realistic on how much you can afford to pay for your new home.

'The Lure of Porn Is Never Quenched': How Porn Is Affecting Single Men,www.cbn.com,Luke Gibbons,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/the-lure-of-porn-is-never-quenched-how-porn-is-affecting-single-men,"COMMENTARY
A man's pornography addiction has devastating impacts on himself, his wife, and his family. Countless marriages and broken families have been a direct result of men's porn usage.
Unfortunately, porn is equally damaging to a single man. It can keep him single longer or prevent him from having a lasting relationship.
A 2018 Gallup Poll revealed that the percentage of unmarried Americans (both male and female) who find porn morally acceptable increased 15 percentage points since 2017. That's the largest increase among subgroups.
Sam Perry, an assistant professor of sociology and religious studies at the University of Oklahoma, noted, ""Perhaps it's not being unmarried that makes people more inclined to think porn is okay, but that the more people think pornography is just fine, the less likely they are to get married.""
Perry cites two reasons viewing porn may lead single people to delay marriage.
""Pornography could either make marriage seem like an outdated, boring institution. Or pornography (and specifically masturbating to pornography) could remove the 'need' to get married as the source where one can find sexual fulfillment.""
Porn Lessens Your Desire for Real Relationships
Of course, there are many reasons why a man may be single. But pornography usage creates unique challenges.
According to Michael Johnson of Covenant Eyes, ""When we get our sexual desires 'satisfied' by porn, our sex drive doesn't drive us to marriage. It drives us to more porn. You may want to be married, but porn is just so much easier. The result: you satiate your sexual appetite in a cheap, artificial sort of way, instead of letting your desire drive you to prepare and seek God's calling in marriage.""
Mark Regnerus, a University of Austin professor and the author of Cheap Sex, said, ""At best, porn will augment—or compete with—sex, and stall marriage. At worst, sexual technology threatens to undermine coupled sex altogether.""
Mark Ballenger, a writer at Apply God's Word, noted a significant problem for Christian men.
""Their use of porn lessens their desire for real women. It also causes them shame and makes them feel they are not prepared for a Christian marriage; therefore they do not pursue a woman like they would if they did not have the shame from their porn use. They feel they are not prepared to be a Christian husband because of their porn addiction, and so they remain single for much longer.""
Will My Desire for Porn Will Go Away When I Get Married?
Many single men mistakenly believe that their porn usage will stop when they get married. But too often, their porn addiction will follow them into their marriage.
Paul Leininger, the Executive Director at Petra Church in New Holland, Pennsylvania, said, ""I struggled with it for 28 years of my life, even into my marriage. I thought marriage would solve my problem. But, no, it didn't.""
Craig Gross, a pastor and speaker, noted that porn addiction does not simply stop when you get married. ""Porn is so easy. It's so accessible. It's teaching you so much so to be selfish…People are saying, 'Hey, I'm not having sex, but I just look at porn.'""
""I think in the Christian world the mindset is 'Ahh, but I'm still a virgin'…This is cheating made pure…but in reality it's like you're not helping anybody. You are probably hurting yourself more by bringing that addiction into your future relationship.""
Gross added, ""You are setting yourself to want something by watching something that you're not going to be able to get in marriage. Ultimately, it's teaching you to treasure just all about what you want, what you desire. But in reality you can't approach sex or marriage that way and have a successful marriage.""
""The lure of porn is never quenched by marital sex,"" said Dannah Gresh, the author of What Are You Waiting For? ""Because porn has almost nothing to do with real love and real sex. It's as counterfeit as a counterfeit can be.""
Using Porn as a Sexual Release
Some single men justify their porn addiction by saying they need the sexual release they get by using porn and masturbating.
Noah Filipiak, a pastor and the author of Beyond The Battle, said, ""In fact, porn can almost feel like an act of righteousness for some singles—their way of making sure they aren't having premarital sex. A Christian single man recently told me he has to look at porn because it's his way of making sure he doesn't have premarital sex.""
God has created the majority of us with an energy designed to drive us closer to Him. That same energy drives us as single men to seek a Christ-focused wife. In pornography our affections and energy are turned back on ourselves. Serving only our selfish desires.
Andy Farmer, a singles' pastor at Covenant Fellowship in Philadelphia, said, ""Self-gratification through using pornography is the opposite of what God intended, not a premature enjoyment of what God intended.""
Christian author and apologist C.S. Lewis recalled. ""For me the real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite which, in lawful use, leads the individual out of himself to complete (and correct) his own personality in that of another (and finally in children and even grandchildren) and turns it back; sends the man back into the prison of himself, there to keep a harem of imaginary brides.""
God created sex for the benefit and enjoyment of a couple within the bounds of marriage. Sex in any other form – whether alone or with someone else – is rebellion against God's plans.
Take Advantage of the Opportunity
If you are single and plan to get married, now is a great opportunity for you to begin overcoming your porn addiction. Join a small group that has Christian men who have broken free from pornography and can help support and encourage you.
Also, the development of the brain's pre-frontal cortex continues until the age of 25. The pre-frontal cortex involves such functions as personality development, proper social behavior, and decision making.
According to Mental Health Daily, ""If you are under the age of 25 and your brain is not yet fully developed, you may want to take advantage of this critical period. This means that you can effectively be a co-creator in how your brain decides to mold itself. Engaging in healthy behaviors and giving your brain optimal stimulation will help ensure healthy prefrontal cortex development.""
Dealing with your porn usage after you are 25 will be harder. So dealing with it now is a great opportunity.

'The Lure of Porn Is Never Quenched': How Porn Is Affecting Single Men,www1.cbn.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/the-lure-of-porn-is-never-quenched-how-porn-is-affecting-single-men,"'The Lure of Porn Is Never Quenched': How Porn Is Affecting Single Men 04-17-2019 (Adobe stock image)
COMMENTARY
A man's pornography addiction has devastating impacts on himself, his wife, and his family. Countless marriages and broken families have been a direct result of men's porn usage.
Unfortunately, porn is equally damaging to a single man. It can keep him single longer or prevent him from having a lasting relationship.
A 2018 Gallup Poll revealed that the percentage of unmarried Americans (both male and female) who find porn morally acceptable increased 15 percentage points since 2017. That's the largest increase among subgroups.
Sam Perry, an assistant professor of sociology and religious studies at the University of Oklahoma, noted, ""Perhaps it's not being unmarried that makes people more inclined to think porn is okay, but that the more people think pornography is just fine, the less likely they are to get married.""
Perry cites two reasons viewing porn may lead single people to delay marriage.
""Pornography could either make marriage seem like an outdated, boring institution. Or pornography (and specifically masturbating to pornography) could remove the 'need' to get married as the source where one can find sexual fulfillment.""
Porn Lessens Your Desire for Real Relationships
Of course, there are many reasons why a man may be single. But pornography usage creates unique challenges.
According to Michael Johnson of Covenant Eyes, ""When we get our sexual desires 'satisfied' by porn, our sex drive doesn't drive us to marriage. It drives us to more porn. You may want to be married, but porn is just so much easier. The result: you satiate your sexual appetite in a cheap, artificial sort of way, instead of letting your desire drive you to prepare and seek God's calling in marriage.""
Mark Regnerus, a University of Austin professor and the author of Cheap Sex, said, ""At best, porn will augment—or compete with—sex, and stall marriage. At worst, sexual technology threatens to undermine coupled sex altogether.""
Mark Ballenger, a writer at Apply God's Word, noted a significant problem for Christian men.
""Their use of porn lessens their desire for real women. It also causes them shame and makes them feel they are not prepared for a Christian marriage; therefore they do not pursue a woman like they would if they did not have the shame from their porn use. They feel they are not prepared to be a Christian husband because of their porn addiction, and so they remain single for much longer.""
Will My Desire for Porn Will Go Away When I Get Married?
Many single men mistakenly believe that their porn usage will stop when they get married. But too often, their porn addiction will follow them into their marriage.
Paul Leininger, the Executive Director at Petra Church in New Holland, Pennsylvania, said, ""I struggled with it for 28 years of my life, even into my marriage. I thought marriage would solve my problem. But, no, it didn't.""
Craig Gross, a pastor and speaker, noted that porn addiction does not simply stop when you get married. ""Porn is so easy. It's so accessible. It's teaching you so much so to be selfish…People are saying, 'Hey, I'm not having sex, but I just look at porn.'""
""I think in the Christian world the mindset is 'Ahh, but I'm still a virgin'…This is cheating made pure…but in reality it's like you're not helping anybody. You are probably hurting yourself more by bringing that addiction into your future relationship.""
Gross added, ""You are setting yourself to want something by watching something that you're not going to be able to get in marriage. Ultimately, it's teaching you to treasure just all about what you want, what you desire. But in reality you can't approach sex or marriage that way and have a successful marriage.""
""The lure of porn is never quenched by marital sex,"" said Dannah Gresh, the author of What Are You Waiting For? ""Because porn has almost nothing to do with real love and real sex. It's as counterfeit as a counterfeit can be.""
Using Porn as a Sexual Release
Some single men justify their porn addiction by saying they need the sexual release they get by using porn and masturbating.
Noah Filipiak, a pastor and the author of Beyond The Battle, said, ""In fact, porn can almost feel like an act of righteousness for some singles—their way of making sure they aren't having premarital sex. A Christian single man recently told me he has to look at porn because it's his way of making sure he doesn't have premarital sex.""
God has created the majority of us with an energy designed to drive us closer to Him. That same energy drives us as single men to seek a Christ-focused wife. In pornography our affections and energy are turned back on ourselves. Serving only our selfish desires.
Andy Farmer, a singles' pastor at Covenant Fellowship in Philadelphia, said, ""Self-gratification through using pornography is the opposite of what God intended, not a premature enjoyment of what God intended.""
Christian author and apologist C.S. Lewis recalled. ""For me the real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite which, in lawful use, leads the individual out of himself to complete (and correct) his own personality in that of another (and finally in children and even grandchildren) and turns it back; sends the man back into the prison of himself, there to keep a harem of imaginary brides.""
God created sex for the benefit and enjoyment of a couple within the bounds of marriage. Sex in any other form – whether alone or with someone else – is rebellion against God's plans.
Take Advantage of the Opportunity
If you are single and plan to get married, now is a great opportunity for you to begin overcoming your porn addiction. Join a small group that has Christian men who have broken free from pornography and can help support and encourage you.
Also, the development of the brain's pre-frontal cortex continues until the age of 25. The pre-frontal cortex involves such functions as personality development, proper social behavior, and decision making.
According to Mental Health Daily, ""If you are under the age of 25 and your brain is not yet fully developed, you may want to take advantage of this critical period. This means that you can effectively be a co-creator in how your brain decides to mold itself. Engaging in healthy behaviors and giving your brain optimal stimulation will help ensure healthy prefrontal cortex development.""
Dealing with your porn usage after you are 25 will be harder. So dealing with it now is a great opportunity.
Remember that once you are married, it will start to affect your wife and family members. Choose to be a man that stands with integrity now. What a great testimony that will be for your wife!
Also, find opportunities to use your energy in ways that will improve your mind, talents, and ambitions. Start preparing now to become the man that your future wife desires. Train to be a man who will make your wife feel secure and cherished in your love.
And spend time drawing closer to God. Lean into Him as you need His grace and strength today as you battle porn. Develop intimacy with God now, so in time you can make Him the centerpiece of your marriage.

From Practicing Witchcraft to Worshipping Jesus Christ in Cuba | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,04-17-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/april/from-practicing-witchcraft-to-worshipping-jesus-christ-in-cuba,"From Practicing Witchcraft to Worshipping Jesus Christ in Cuba 04-20-2019 Emily Towns
Santeria — a form of modern witchcraft that fuses Catholic practices and African folk beliefs — is prevalent in Cuba. In fact, according to the U.S. State Department, some sources estimate that as many as 80 percent of Cubans practice Santeria.
But because of generous donors supporting Cuban church planters, a strong body of Christ-followers is growing in this once closed-off country.
Aleja, whose name we’ve changed for security, is a church planter who has seen the incredible impact your gifts have made.
Recently, Aleja helped plant a church in a neighborhood that was particularly opposed to the Gospel. The neighbors all followed Santeria, and every home was marked with pagan signs.
But eventually, the church members’ acts of love and service began to open doors.
“In our church, we not only meet to worship the Lord and build ourselves with His presence and His Word, but we go out to help the needy of the neighborhood,” Aleja said. “We share the blessings we receive, and in this way, we establish bridges of friendship and love.”
Like the early church in the book of Acts , this congregation’s compassion began to reach even the most resistant people in the neighborhood. However, one man held so strongly to his pagan beliefs that he threatened the church. He was considered to be the head of the cult, and his family was very influential in the community.
The believers began to consistently pray for this family – over the course of several years. Eventually, the man’s grandson attended a Sunday service. He was so moved by the Gospel that he joined the church and invited his grandmother — the wife of the man who had been threatening the Christ-followers.
The boy’s grandmother had been sick and unable to work for some time. Doctors had warned that because of her infection, they would possibly need to amputate her leg and operate on her kidneys. But the church gathered around the woman and began to pray for a miracle.
When she returned to the doctors, they were amazed. She no longer needed an operation! The woman praised God, made a decision to follow Christ, and was baptized. Now, she is sharing her testimony with her friends, family, and everyone in the neighborhood — including her husband.
“He is still very much against God and against the Christians, but we know the Lord fights for His people and defends them, and we continue to pray for him to meet Jesus,” says Aleja.
When you help support church planters , you show people that with God, nothing is impossible. You demonstrate how great His love is by being His hands and feet and meeting a community’s needs.
You can support the spread of the Gospel without ever getting on an airplane!
Thank you for helping to transform the hearts and lives of people in Cuba and bringing light into the darkest neighborhoods around the world.

A man was arrested Wednesday evening after carrying gasoline, lighter fluid, and butane lighters into the New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral.
""Around 7:55 pm, a man walked into St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan with gas cans and lighter fluid, and was subsequently apprehended by @NYPDCT without incident,"" the New York Police Department tweeted.

The 37-year-old man's identity will be released once he is formally charged, authorities said. Senior law enforcement officials said he may be emotionally disturbed.
According to ABC News , the man allegedly parked his car in front of Saks Fifth Avenue and carried two canisters of gas, two bottles of lighter fluid, and two butane lighters into the cathedral.
Church ushers stopped the man before nearby officers with the NYPD Critical Response Command took him into custody.
NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller told reporters at a news conference that he gave ""inconsistent and evasive"" answers to police officers after being stopped.
""At that point, some gasoline apparently had spilled out onto the floor,"" Miller said. ""His basic story was that he was cutting through the cathedral to get to Madison Avenue, that his car had run out of gas...We took a look at the vehicle. It was not out of gas.""
NBC News reports that police are still working to determine a motive.
""It's hard to say exactly what his intentions were,"" Miller said,
""But we do know that carrying two cans of gasoline and the equipment to light that, to a public area and a place like St. Patrick's Cathedral is something that presents a danger to the public, and that's why he's in custody,"" he continued.
The incident comes just days after a fire engulfed and destroyed France's iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris.
Police say the man in custody made no mention of the Notre Dame fire."
Muslim Syrians Converting To Christianity After Defeating ISIS,www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/muslim-syrians-converting-to-christianity-after-defeating-isis,"Years after the Islamic State laid siege to the Syrian town of Kobani, some of its Muslim residents are leaving behind Islam and turning to Christianity.
In 2015, Kobani was the epicenter in the battle against ISIS. It was also here that US-led forces beat back ISIS terrorists and liberated the city before finally ending the group's hold over Iraq and Syria last month.
Many of the new converts to Christ say the violence ISIS brought to their region left them disillusioned with Islam.
While many Muslims became agnostic or atheist, others turned to Jesus and opened up Kobani's first church in decades called ""Church of the Brethren."" It is the only evangelical church in Kobani.
""After the war with Islamic State people were looking for the right path, and distancing themselves from Islam,"" church founder Omar Firas told Reuters . ""People were scared and felt lost.""
Firas said approximately 80 to 100 people in Kobani now worship at the evangelical church.
""We meet on Tuesdays and hold a service on Fridays. It is open to anyone who wants to join,"" he said.
CBN News met with Firas in February. He founded the church while a new representative form of government in northeast Syria called the ""Self Administration of Syria"" (SANES) was emerging.
The SANES controls a third of Syria between the Tigris and Euphrates River and guarantees freedom of religion to all of the 4 million people within its borders.
Firas told CBN News his church would never have been allowed under ISIS.
""We can express our rituals with complete freedom,"" he said.
Church of the Brethren's existence is a sign of true religious freedom under SANES.
""Because this project is democratic and for the first time it has recognized we as a Syriac Christians and recognized our language, culture and even our religion,"" SANES Executive Council VP Elizabeth Kourie told CBN News .
The leaders say their hope is to spread this new democracy throughout Syria rather than form another country.

‘I Feel Like I’m Birthed Again’ : Thousands Flock to Jordan River to Remember Christ During Holy Week,www1.cbn.com,,04-18-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/april/lsquo-i-feel-like-i-rsquo-m-birthed-again-rsquo-thousands-flock-to-jordan-river-to-remember-christ-during-holy-week,"DF_CMI810_Qasr_Al_Yahud_Baptismal_Place_HD1080_0_143.104 6027572485001
QASR EL JEHUD - Christians from all over the world come to Israel during holy week. One of the main sites they visit is an area where many believe John the Baptist baptized Jesus Christ.
For Christians being baptized in the Jordan River is a profound spiritual experience.
“This is my dream and Jesus was baptized here and I think and I believe that this river is blessed,” Eyerusalem Ayakew told CBN News .
“I’m feeling like rivers. I feel like I’m birthed again because Jesus was baptized here,” Andinet Ayakew added.
The site is called Qasr el Yahud, ***on the border with Jordan near the north end of the Dead Sea.***. Israel developed this site for Christian pilgrims and now about three-quarters of a million people visit here each year. While there’s no proof this is the exact location of the baptism of Jesus, it remains a special place.
“I read the Bible. I preach the Bible and for us to be here and actually experience it first hand, it sort of underscores and affirms what they hear week after week as we present God’s Word to the people,” said Pastor Steve McCraken from Grace Pointe Community Chapel.
This area is also believed to be the place where Elijah the prophet ascended into heaven in a fiery chariot and where the children of Israel crossed over into the Promised Land.
Tour guide Ben David Katriel gave two reasons why this might be the area Joshua brought the Israelites on their way to Jericho.
“There are passages in the Jordan, places that are easier to pass. That never changes, that’s topography. But except that we have Jericho there is no argument about the location of Jericho,” he explained.
Ret. Gen. Uzi Dayan says the Jewish people returned here from Egypt more than three thousand years ago. Three millennia later, Jews are still returning to the land of Israel, where you can see biblical prophecies come to life.
“Actually, this is the first Aliya that took place,” he said. This is a combination where the Bible or the stories of the Bible meet.”
Pastor McCraken encourages other Christians to visit the Jordan river.
“Come. Make this part of your plans because this will enrich your faith and deepen your devotion to Jesus, which is what it’s all about.”
For many, it’s especially meaningful just before the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus Christ."
