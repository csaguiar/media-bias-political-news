Nationalism is by definition a form of collectivism. No transition necessary. It intends to put the national identity above that of the individual.
It's interesting that in modern times (the Trump era is a good example) the nationalists tend to favor the individual within a larger group. For example, low taxes are a very individualist concept. Also, they tend to protect freedom of speech, rights to self defense, property rights, etc, for citizens. However, we see that they tend to not favor individual behaviors which they see as ""diluting"" the national identity. For example in the US, that identity being defined as Judeo-Christian, we tend to see the nationalists argue against traditional individual concepts like gay marriage, prostitution, and recreational drug use.
In my mind, the key difference between this neo-nationalism vs classical liberalism is the idea that rights are a function of one's citizenship for nationalism vs being a function of one's humanity for classical liberalism."

Unfortunately, that has been relegated to the stuff of conspiracy theorists because many at Reason do not like the current target of the Deep State- Trump.

Every blizzard in New York or DC is hyped by the media as a national emergency and every imperfection in our lives is described as a gaping flaw- an existential threat to our survival. No wars are killing off entire generations of young men. No cattle cars packed with undesirables are carrying people to death camps. No diseases are killing people by the millions.
Further, America's problems are not Europe's problems, and the sum total of those problems is not some indictment of globalism or capitalism or any other ism. We have four major powers in the world, between China, America, Europe and Russia. Those powers have such different cultural foundations that attempting to draw parallel's with them are major mistakes.
Indeed, the problems in New York and California are very different from the problems of rural Colorado or Pennsylvania.

I never said the outcome wasn't real. However, altruism is a motivation: It's when you do something for others without an expectation of personal gain. That manifestly isn't what is at work in the invisible hand. Again, Smith was trying to figure out how to harvest human desire for gain to create mutually beneficial outcomes without resorting to altruism as a motivator, which he believed wouldn't work.
So, yes, the outcomes of the invisible hand are mutually beneficial, but that doesn't make them altruistic in nature. Smith's insight was that selfishness, rather than altruism, was the emotion you needed to appeal to.
Altruism isn't an outcome. It's a motivation. You're systematically confusing outcome with cause in your description, and the quote you put forth to support your contention – ""without intending it, without knowing it"" – explicitly makes it clear that he isn't talking about altruism, but about an outcome that results in something like altruism without it as a motivator."

That's probably the source of our disagreement.
I'm talking about altruistic behavior emerging in these systems--regardless of and even in spite of motives. Isn't that what Smith is talking about above?
When scientists are studying altruism, they're not concentrating on motives either. If bonobos can pass the mirror test, then maybe they are capable of such introspection. In the multitude of other examples of altruistic behavior in the natural world, we're generally not talking about motives. The bees and ants that are the subject of the Nature article I linked above are probably not capable of altruistic motives . However, their economic circumstances and the forces of evolution have converged to make them behave altruistically--regardless of motive.
Altruistic behavior emerges from economic systems, even when people are pursuing their own selfish interests, and finding that the same kind of altruistic behavior emerges during the process of evolution shouldn't surprise anybody who understands Adam Smith."

Poor bastard."
DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen Is Leaving Wednesday. Will Her Replacement Be Worse?: Reason Roundup - Hit & Run : Reason.com,reason.com,Elizabeth Nolan Brown,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/blog/2019/04/08/dhs-secretary-kirstjen-nielsen-leaving,"EARNIE GRAFTON/REUTERS/Newscom An impossible job? Kirstjen Nielsen announced Sunday that on April 10, she'll be stepping down as head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Customs and Border Protection chief Kevin McAleenan will then become acting secretary of DHS.
Nielsen's resignation comes less than a year and a half after she replaced John Kelly. Kelly went on to become President Donald Trump's chief of staff, but he left that position in January. ""With McAleenan's appointment, Trump now has an acting homeland security secretary, defense secretary, interior secretary and chief of staff,"" notes Axios .
Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 7, 2019 Nielsen ""has arguably been the most aggressive secretary in the department's short history in cracking down on immigration—with her legacy likely to be defined among progressives by the 'zero tolerance' prosecution policy of late spring and early summer 2018 that resulted in the separation of thousands of families at the US-Mexico border,"" writes immigration reporter Dara Lind. Alas:
None of it appears to have been enough for Trump.
Nielsen's resignation was preceded on Thursday night by the abrupt withdrawal of the nomination of acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Ron Vitiello to formally lead the agency, with Trump telling reporters Friday morning that he wanted to go in a ""tougher direction."" While it's not yet clear whether Trump requested Nielsen's resignation or not, it certainly appears as if that ""tougher direction"" is extending to a new DHS secretary....
[W]ith nearly 100,000 migrants apprehended by Border Patrol agents along the US-Mexico border in March, Trump is yet again ruminating angrily and obsessively over immigration, riffing in speeches about telling migrants ""we're full"" and ""go back.""
Nielsen couldn't make that happen, because no one could, because it's impossible. The US can't—even with a wall—physically prevent the entry of unauthorized immigrants onto US soil. And once on US soil, they have certain rights—including the right to request asylum.
The one silver lining here seems to be that there's not much more McAleenan, or any Nielsen replacement, can legally do.
Even during Kelly's tenure as DHS head, ""the low-hanging fruit of deterrent immigration policies had been picked a long time ago,"" writes Lind. She continues:
US immigration law is a balance between the desire to minimize unauthorized entry into the United States and the desire to protect vulnerable people who may be fleeing harm and persecution. Both US and international law prohibit the US from refusing entry to people who are in danger of prosecution in their home countries; both US statute and court settlements offer extra due-process protections to asylum seekers, children, and families.
The policies Trump wants, and the outcomes he has promised, aren't within the power of the White House or the Department of Homeland Security.
As for Acting Secretary McAleenan's prospects: He's shown no particular signs of being better or worse than the average border hawk. He has presided over some of the worst immigration actions and abuses of the Trump administration, while refusing to endorse the very worse of Trump's rhetoric. He's ""not an ideologue or fire breather,"" an anonymous DHS officially tells CNN.
Kevin McAleenan is a career border officer. He ""looks the part"" better than Nielsen. But he's not the dude who blames Ds for everything or talks of ""invasion."" & he—like any other human on earth—can't physically stop migrants from setting foot on US soil. https://t.co/YMKG55w4Pi
— Dara Lind (@DLind) April 7, 2019 FREE MARKETS ""The safest place in the world to be online."" A new internet regulation proposal backed by U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May would give regulatory bodies there ""unprecedented powers to issue fines and other punishments if social-media sites don't swiftly remove"" offending content. British authorities are touting it as a way to ensure the U.K. is ""the safest place in the world to be online."" Right now, the proposal ""comes in the form of a white paper that eventually will yield new legislation,"" reports The Washington Post :
Early details shared Sunday proposed that lawmakers set up a new, independent regulator tasked to ensure companies ""take responsibility for the safety of their users."" That oversight—either through a new agency or part of an existing one—would be funded by tech companies, potentially through a new tax.
The agency's mandate would be vast, from policing large social-media platforms such as Facebook to smaller web sites' forums or comment sections. Much of its work would focus on content that could be harmful to children or pose a risk to national security. But regulators ultimately could play a role in scrutinizing a broader array of online harms, the U.K. said, including content ""that may not be illegal but are nonetheless highly damaging to individuals or threaten our way of life in the U.K."" The document offers a litany of potential areas of concern, including hate speech, coercive behavior and underage exposure to illegal content such as dating apps that are meant for people over age 18.
