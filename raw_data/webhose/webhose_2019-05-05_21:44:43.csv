The right thing to do, would have been to send the full (unredacted Mueller report) on to congress, letting them make the decision on whether or not Trump had obstructed justice.

And I don't think history is going to be kind to,Trump, Barr, or even Rosentein. As far as how it will remember Robert Mueller, I think we'll have to wait and see what's in the report. The way this report was handled by Barr, (using one of Trump's favorite lines) was truly disgraceful)!

There are 4 legal Requirements of the AG in an Independent Investigation. #4 “Notify the Judiciary Committees of any action taken by the Independent Investigator at the conclusion of the Investigation.” Nothing more ! ( No ‘Barr Summaries’ or Opinions or Biases or Theories. ) Because conflicted un-Recused Barr demonstrated written bias last year, Barr had the fewest votes of confidence in the Senate Confirmation ever. Eric Holder ( longest running Atty Gen ): “Barr was blatantly departing from the 2 Precedents ( Nixon & Clinton . . Nixon’s AG went to prison ) & inconsistent with the ‘best practice.’” ( hello . . Because his boss is engaged in an Election Campaign he could put his finger on the scale & influence 100 million voters ? ) ( Even AG Reno never made a ‘Determination’ about Mrs. Bill Clinton )There was too much evidence for Mueller to ‘Decline’ Prosecution thereby having the usual expectation that it would be passed onto Congress as was done in all the previous Precedents. The Atty Gen is not a Grand Jury or a Judge & Jury of any sort & has a lot of explaining to do.” Mueller had a ‘Summary’ in his report & Barr in his cover-up suspiciously refused to share it or quote all of it. Barr lied about “Transparency” because Transparency would mean immediately going directly to court to get approval to submit the whole report to the Intelligence Committee. Unlike Barr, Mueller purposely avoided giving bias to congress. By Barr stalling, he is postponing the shocking findings until just before election day. Republican suicide."

In a unsolicited memo to the DOJ, he argued that if Congress made it a crime for the president “corruptly” to obstruct, impede, or influence an investigation into the president’s own crimes, it would intrude on the president’s constitutional authority. That is a significant step towards putting a sitting President above the law. Whatever the esoteric legal arguments that can be brought to bear, the position is an affront to common sense.

Mueller is a war hero that (more than anyone) knows the importance of American national security. Barr should simply release Mueller's very safe report. The longer he holds onto it or changes it or hides large portions of what should be a safe report for folks to see, the more guilty Trump appears to just about everyone. No matter how you shake it, the full report should (AT THE VERY LEAST) be sent to congress in it's entirety. Congress routinely handles national security matters and information that is a billion times more serious than this report. They deal with national security secrets every single day! There simply is absolutely no excuse for what Barr is doing. His job description did not call for him to even give a silly four page summary of his beliefs. His job is literally to get out of the way and send the entire 400 page report to congress. AMERICA NEEDS THE FULL REPORT; not Barr's personal interpretation of it."
