SUBSCRIBE April 10, 2019, 12:43 AM GMT By Reuters Boeing's legal troubles grew Tuesday as a new lawsuit accused the company of defrauding shareholders by concealing safety deficiencies in its 737 MAX planes before two fatal crashes led to their worldwide grounding. The proposed class action filed in Chicago federal court seeks damages for alleged securities fraud violations, after Boeing's market value tumbled by $34 billion within two weeks of the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg and Chief Financial Officer Gregory Smith were also named as defendants. Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers had no immediate comment. According to the complaint, Boeing ""effectively put profitability and growth ahead of airplane safety and honesty"" by rushing the 737 MAX to market to compete with Airbus SE, while leaving out ""extra"" or ""optional"" features designed to prevent the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes. It also said Boeing's statements about its growth prospects and the 737 MAX were undermined by its alleged conflict of interest from retaining broad authority from federal regulators to assess the plane's safety. Richard Seeks, the lead plaintiff, said Boeing's compromises began to emerge after the Ethiopian Airlines crash killed all 157 onboard, five months after the Lion Air crash killed 189. Seeks said he bought 300 Boeing shares in early March, and sold them at a loss within the last two weeks. The lawsuit seeks damages for Boeing stock investors from Jan. 8 to March 21. Shareholders often file lawsuits accusing companies of securities fraud for concealing material negative information that causes the stock price to decline upon becoming public. Chicago-based Boeing faces many other lawsuits over the crashes, including by victims' families and by participants in its employee retirement plans. Boeing said on Tuesday that aircraft orders in the first quarter fell to 95 from 180 a year earlier, with no orders for the 737 MAX following the worldwide grounding. On April 5, it said it planned to cut monthly 737 production to 42 planes from 52, and was making progress on a 737 MAX software update to prevent further accidents. The case is Seeks v Boeing Co et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 19-02394."
Netflix pulls Felicity Huffman movie from April schedule after guilty plea,www.nbcnews.com,Variety,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/netflix-pulls-felicity-huffman-movie-april-schedule-after-guilty-plea-n992786,"LOS ANGELES - Netflix has removed the Felicity Huffman comedy ""Otherhood"" from its schedule after the actress agreed to plead guilty for her role in the college admissions bribery scandal. Netflix told the Associated Press that it was delaying the release of the film but did specify a new premiere date. Reps for Netflix have not commented further.
""Otherhood,"" which had been set for release on April 26, was no longer searchable Tuesday on the streaming platform's press site. Huffman co-stars with Patricia Arquette and Angela Bassett in a trio of suburban mothers who show up unannounced at the New York City homes of their sons. ""Otherhood"" is directed by Cindy Chupack from a screenplay she wrote with Mark Andrus, based on the novel ""Whatever Makes You Happy"" by William Sutcliffe.
The U.S. Attorney's Office announced on Monday that Huffman and a dozen other parents will plead guilty in the college admissions scandal. Huffman was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud. According to the criminal complaint, she paid $15,000 to admissions consultant William Singer in order to boost her older daughter's SAT score. The Emmy winner and Oscar nominee was arrested March 12.
""I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,"" Huffman said in a statement Monday.
""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.""
Huffman plays a prosecutor in another Netflix project, Ava DuVernay's Central Park Five miniseries ""When They See Us."" According to Netflix's press site, that project will premiere May 31."

Leigh Stein, daughter of victim Dan Stein, wipes away tears as Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto signs three gun-control bills into law on April 9, 2019. Steph Chambers / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via AP Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 9, 2019, 11:54 PM GMT / Updated April 10, 2019, 12:22 AM GMT By Associated Press PITTSBURGH — Gun rights groups sued Tuesday to block Pittsburgh from enforcing firearms legislation passed after a mass shooting at a synagogue, accusing city officials of blatantly defying the state's prohibition on municipal gun regulation. Democratic Mayor Bill Peduto signed the bills into law in a ceremony at the City-County Building, declaring the community had come together ""to say enough is enough."" City officials said they had to act because the Republican-controlled Pennsylvania Legislature — which is planning to hold a memorial service for the victims this week — will not. ""We are going to take some action, we are going to do something positive and, yes, it is going to be everlasting,"" said Peduto, surrounded by gun-control advocates and members of three congregations that were targeted in the shooting rampage at Tree of Life Synagogue. ""Change only happens when you challenge the status quo."" Minutes later, a coalition of gun rights groups sued to get the newly minted laws overturned, calling them ""patently unenforceable, unconstitutional, illegal."" Shortly after that, a second lawsuit, this one backed by the National Rifle Association , declared that ""Pittsburgh has violated the rights of its citizens."" ""Worse yet, Pittsburgh has committed this violation without any realistic prospect of diminishing the ... incidence of horrific mass shootings,"" said the suit, filed by four city residents. ""All it will do is leave law-abiding citizens more vulnerable to attack from better-armed and more ruthless assailants."" The new legislation restricts military-style assault weapons like the AR-15 rifle authorities say was used in the Oct. 27 massacre that killed 11 and wounded seven. It also bans most uses of armor-piercing ammunition and high-capacity magazines and allows the temporary seizure of guns from people who are determined to be a danger to themselves or others. The first two laws are due to take effect in 60 days, the imminent-danger law in 180 days. Breaking: Pgh Mayor signs gun control legislation #wpxi pic.twitter.com/hczIP1jrlZ — Rick Earle (@WPXIRickEarle) April 9, 2019 Whether the city will be able to enforce them is an open question. State law has long prohibited municipalities from regulating the ownership or possession of guns or ammunition, and courts have thrown out other local firearms measures, including a 1990s-era assault weapons ban in Pittsburgh. But city leaders said they were eager to take on the fight, given the Legislature's traditional reluctance to pass gun legislation. ""This fantasy that somehow the state is going to step up and help us is simply not going to happen,"" said Council President Bruce Kraus. The bill signing took place as state lawmakers prepared to come together for a memorial service for the Tree of Life victims. The unusual joint session at the Capitol in Harrisburg on Wednesday will bring together the House and Senate for prayers and speeches about the attack. Peduto's spokesman said the timing was coincidental. The Pittsburgh bills — proposed not long after the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history — were weakened ahead of City Council passage in an effort to make them more likely to survive a court challenge. While one of the bills originally included an outright ban on assault weapons, the revised measure bars the ""use"" of assault weapons in public places. A menorah at a memorial outside the Tree of Life Synagogue on the first night of Hanukkah in Pittsburgh on Dec. 2, 2018. Gene J. Puskar / AP A full ban on possession would take effect only if state lawmakers or the state Supreme Court give municipalities the right to regulate guns, which is seen as unlikely in a state where a majority of legislators are fiercely protective of gun rights. The city will be represented in court by lawyers with Everytown for Gun Safety, a group backed by billionaire Michael Bloomberg. In another legal filing Tuesday, the Allegheny County Sportsmen's League asked a judge to hold the city, Peduto and six council members who voted for the gun-control legislation in contempt of court, contending they violated a 1995 legal settlement in which city officials dropped the earlier effort to ban assault weapons and agreed to ""abide by and adhere to Pennsylvania law."" ""It is unfortunate that ... taxpayers will be burdened by the city's elected officials believing it is acceptable — and even gloating — that they are violating the Pennsylvania Constitution and Crimes Code,"" Joshua Prince, a lawyer seeking to overturn the laws, wrote in a statement."
Oregon woman lived to 99 with most organs on wrong side of body,www.nbcnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oregon-woman-lived-99-most-organs-wrong-side-body-n992801,"SALEM, Ore. — Rose Marie Bentley was an avid swimmer, raised five kids, helped her husband run a feed store, and lived to the ripe age of 99. It was only a year after she died, in 2017, that students and their teacher at a medical school discovered that all her internal organs except for her heart were in the wrong place. The discovery of the rare condition, which this week was presented to a conference of anatomists, was astounding, especially because Walker had lived so long. People with the condition known as situs inversus with levocardia often have life-threatening cardiac ailments and other abnormalities, according to Oregon Health & Science University.
Cameron Walker's class at the university in Portland was examining the heart of a cadaver last year when they noticed the blood vessels were different. When they opened the abdominal cavity, they saw that all the other organs were on the wrong side.
In a telephone interview Tuesday, Walker described his reaction to the find.
""Definitely a mix of curiosity, fascination and a sense of wanting to explore a little bit of a medical mystery — a medical marvel really — that was in front of us,"" Walker told The Associated Press. ""And I would say the students felt something very similar.""
Bentley's family had not known about the condition that OHSU says occurs only once in every 22,000 births. Apparently Bentley didn't either.
Bentley, who lived in Molalla, 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Portland, had led a normal life. Her only recurrent physical complaint was arthritis, her daughter Louise Allee remembered.
But there were signs.
When Bentley was in her 50s, she underwent a hysterectomy, and the doctor also wanted to remove the appendix. But he couldn't find it, Allee said in a phone interview.
When Bentley had her gallbladder removed at least a decade later, it was on the opposite side of where it should have been, she said.
""No one said a thing,"" Allee said. ""I was surprised. This was before they did it with a scope, and she had a good-sized incision. You'd think they would have said something, but they didn't.""
Walker had agreed to donate her body to OHSU, Oregon's only academic health center. The first sign for the students there that Walker's anatomy was unusual was when they were examining the area around her heart.
""They were noticing that the blood vessels were different there and called us over, and instead of telling them that they were blind I decided we would take look and try to figure out what the anomaly was,"" said Walker, an assistant professor of anatomy.
""And It wasn't completely clear until we went into the abdominal cavity ... that her organs were transposed left to right,"" Walker said.
The unusual blood vessels near the heart had helped compensate for the condition.
Walker on Monday gave a poster presentation about the discovery at an annual meeting of the American Association of Anatomists, in Orlando, Florida, on experimental biology.
""This is an important case that really gave us an opportunity to talk about the importance of future clinicians paying attention to subtle anatomic variations, not just large anatomic variations, in terms of addressing their future patients as individuals,"" Walker said. ""Don't judge a book by its cover, and always check and see what you've got before you talk about care.""
He has researched how old people with the condition have lived, and he found no one documented cases in which a person lived beyond age 73. Bentley surpassed that by 26 years.
Allee said her mother would have been delighted that the donation of her body led to a learning experience.
""She would have been tickled to know she could educate with something unusual,"" Allee said. ""Dad would have loved to know about it so he could tease her.""
Her husband, James, died about 15 years ago."
5 ways to Marie Kondo your financial life,www.nbcnews.com,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/know-your-value/feature/5-ways-marie-kondo-your-financial-life-ncna992201,"Out of Office 5 ways to Marie Kondo your financial life The tidying expert and bestselling author spoke to Know Your Value about how you can apply her principles to money management. Organizational expert Marie Kondo. KonMari Media, Inc. Share this — April 8, 2019, 8:58 PM ET By Renee Morad Marie Kondo’s principles of tidying aren’t just for your closets, dressers and cabinets. According to the Japanese decluttering expert, the same method can be applied to your finances as well. “Fewer items does not make everyone happier; it’s about finding the balance of items that makes you feel the most comfortable — and the same thing applies to your wealth,” the bestselling author and star of Netflix’s hit show “Tidying Up with Marie Kondo,” told NBC’s Know Your Value in an email. “What is important is to foster an awareness of what you need — and to make a plan to get there.” For the implausibly unfamiliar, the KonMari method revolves around discarding personal items that no longer spark joy. With finances, there is also some discarding and careful categorizing, but of dreams, rather than objects. Here are Kondo’s top five tips: 1. Create a financial plan “The same general principle of committing time to creating a plan definitely applies!” Kondo said. “If you procrastinate, you’ll never get around to it.” Having a financial plan might seem obvious. But only one in four Americans have written one, according to the Schwab Modern Wealth Index . Those who take the time to map it out are more likely to practice other positive financial behaviors, like saving money regularly and managing debt, according to the index. “When creating a financial plan, you want to think about how you want to live your life, whether you want to, say, buy a house in the next five years or save up for retirement,” Cynthia Loh, vice president of digital advice and innovation for Charles Schwab, told Know Your Value. View this graphic on nbcnews.com 2. Imagine what you want your life to look like “Imagining your ideal life serves as your motivation and clarifies your goals before you tidy,” said Kondo. “Similarly, imagining your ideal financial life allows you to see the gap between what you have now and what you’d like to obtain in the future.” Kondo added, “this practice will clarify your next, actionable steps.” You’ll want to evaluate how you want to live your life and ensure your partner or family is on the same page. Consider milestones such as whether you want to retire at, say, age 55 or 65, where you’d like to live and the costs associated with that lifestyle, Loh said. 3. Prioritize what you want to save and invest — and in what order Kondo stressed the importance of saving and investing. “Think of your top priority and where other financial priorities rank in your list of short and long-term goals,” Loh suggested. Don’t know how to start investing? You’re not alone. Over half of Americans say they want to spend more time investing but don’t know where to begin, according to a Schwab Consumer Digital Demands Report . Schwab recommends eight savings fundamentals . Your first priority should be matching your employer’s 401(k) contribution, followed by accelerating credit card payments. Next, focus on building an emergency fund and maximizing savings to tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Saving for your child’s education and a down payment on a home could follow. Then, you might want to prioritize paying off other debt and investing. 4. Discard spending habits that don’t spark joy “My method of tidying is focused on what to keep in life – and letting the rest go with gratitude,” said Kondo. “After tidying the home, many of my clients say that the ability to identify what sparks joy for them can be applied to other areas of their lives as well.” Her popular method encourages tidying by category (not by location) beginning with clothes, then moving on to books, papers, miscellaneous items and, finally, sentimental items. “Keep only those things that speak to the heart, and discard items that no longer spark joy,” Kondo wrote. “This practice allows you to identify what brings you joy, which is especially important when considering how you spend your money–what you’re saving for, how much money is needed and so on.” “After tidying, my clients are more mindful about what they purchase, and they avoid buying in excess,” Kondo added. “I do believe it is important to use this self-awareness to guide your spending habits and let go of any tendencies or habits that are hindering you from meeting your financial goals (and your ideal lifestyle, overall).” Small steps can go a long way. Take a closer look at your spending habits and discard certain habits (like buying lunch out on a regular basis) that might not serve your long-term goals, Loh recommended. 5. Categorize your dreams Also, consider categorizing your dreams by setting short- and long-term goals. This means weighing important decisions like saving for an annual family vacation or spreading your vacations out every few years so you can save up for something else, like a Florida home when you retire. “Some people find it helpful to categorize their goals while others don’t; it all depends on the person,” Kondo wrote. “Give it a try and see if it fits you.” MORE FROM "

Logan, who was most recently a correspondent for “60 Minutes,” will start a three-month assignment on May 1, with Sinclair’s local stations set to air her reporting. Logan, who won numerous national journalism awards for her coverage from international war zones, told NBC News she would be covering some of the untold stories involving immigrants and people living on both sides of the border, as well as the impact of the drug cartels operating in the area. “Everybody who is down there, all they talk about is the cartels,” Logan said. “Why is that not a much bigger part of the conversation?” Logan’s hiring adds to recent moves by Sinclair that hint at the company’s national news ambitions outside of the journalism produced by its local TV stations. Sinclair recently launched a weekly national news program, “ America This Week ,” led by former Fox News host Eric Bolling, and hired investigative journalist James Rosen, who had previously worked for Fox News. Boris Epshteyn and Sebastian Gorka, both former advisers to President Donald Trump, also appear on air for Sinclair. The company also added former Obama campaign staffer Ameshia Cross as a left-leaning commentator. Sinclair’s sizable reach into American homes through local TV news has caused alarm among liberal media watchdogs that have pointed to the company’s practice of pushing its affiliates to air “ must run ” segments with a conservative slant.

Logan has emerged in recent months as a vocal critic of the national media over its coverage of the Trump administration, appearing several times on Fox News in the past few weeks to discuss media bias and pointing to a lack of coverage of immigrant detainment under the Obama administration as evidence of a double standard. Logan, who is also is in the midst of writing a book about her life and career, told NBC News that she agrees with the perception that the media has a liberal bias . “I dismissed people in conservative media as being crazy alt-right Nazis and that’s part of the propaganda,” Logan said. “Any outside view threatens the one dominant narrative that’s allowed.

Alabama passes budget with funding to address state's prison violence problem,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/alabama-passes-budget-funding-address-state-s-prison-violence-problem-n992806,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. — Alabama representatives on Tuesday approved a budget that provides money for 500 additional corrections officers as the state seeks to stave off a lawsuit from the Department of Justice over prison violence. The House of Representatives voted 103-0 for a general fund budget that includes funding for more officers as well as money to boost officer pay. The spending plan now moves to the Alabama Senate.
""This is a first step. It's part of the plan. It certainly won't be all of the plan to try to address these issues,"" said Republican Rep. Steve Clouse, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee.
Clouse said much of a $40 million funding increase for the Department of Corrections is for the 500 additional officers and to boost pay by 20 percent to entice more people to work in state prisons.
The Department of Justice last week said Alabama is v iolating the Constitution by failing to protect inmates from violence and sexual abuse and by housing them in understaffed and overcrowded facilities. The department gave the state 49 days to respond or risk a federal lawsuit.
The state prison system, already facing a federal court directive to increase staff, had requested the money in January, but Clouse said the Justice Department report added increased urgency to the request. The department has indicated it plans to make the same request in subsequent years.
Gov. Kay Ivey last week said that the Justice Department identified many of the same concerns the state already has been working to address.
""This is just reinforcing the need we've been seeing all along. This is an Alabama problem. It's got to have an Alabama solution and we'll be addressing that in fast order,"" Ivey said.
Prisoners stand in a crowded lunch line during a prison tour at Elmore Correctional Facility in Elmore, Ala on June 18, 2015. Brynn Anderson / AP file While the House passed the budget without a dissenting vote, some Democrats used the debate time to question Ivey's proposal to build, or lease, three new large mega-prisons, housing about 3,000 inmates each. Most existing prisons would close.
While nothing has been finalized, the Alabama Department of Corrections is currently seeking ""expressions of interest"" from companies to build the three prisons and lease them back to the state for a maximum of $78 million annually. The deadline to respond is Thursday.
""Studies across the country have shown that mega-prisons are not the way to go,"" said Rep. Chris England, a Democrat from Tuscaloosa.
Some lawmakers noted that leasing the prisons would obligate the state to make lease payments without requiring legislative approval as a bond issue for construction would.
A prison system spokesman said the prison plan will be a collaborative effort with lawmakers and the request for industry proposals will help the state make an informed decision on the ""appropriate path forward.""
Clouse told reporters he wants to continue to gather information about the proposal.
""We've got to see what the costs are,"" he said.
A group representing inmates in an ongoing lawsuit over mental health care said the state needs to be more aggressive in responding to the Justice Department's concerns.
Ebony Howard, a senior supervising attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center, said 500 officers is a ""wholly inadequate"" number. She cited a federal judge's order in an ongoing lawsuit over prison mental health care saying the state should hire 2,200 correctional officers by 2022.
""Governor Ivey has long said that the prison crisis is an Alabama problem that should have an Alabama solution. Well, the Department of Justice has made it very clear that time has passed,"" Howard said.
In a letter to the governor, the organization suggests that Alabama more than double the funding request to add 1,100 officers this year and again next year; implement sentencing reform; and replace the two worst state prisons, including Holman prison in Atmore.
Lawmakers applauded after approving the general fund budget, but Rep. John Rogers, a Democrat from Birmingham, said the money is inadequate to resolve the problems at state prisons.
""We should have been crying,"" Rogers said.

Attorney for ex-Minneapolis officer who killed Justine Damond says he feared ambush,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/attorney-ex-minneapolis-officer-who-killed-justine-damond-says-he-n992791,"MINNEAPOLIS — A Minneapolis police officer who shot and killed an unarmed woman as she approached his squad car after calling 911 to report a possible crime was reacting to a loud noise and feared an ambush, his attorney said Tuesday, calling it ""a perfect storm with tragic consequences."" Mohamed Noor, charged with murder and manslaughter in the 2017 death of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, and his partner were rolling down a dark alley in response to Damond's 911 calls about a possible sexual assault when a bicyclist appeared in front of them and they heard ""a bang,"" defense attorney Peter Wold said in his opening statement at Noor's trial.
""It is the next split second that this case is all about,"" Wold said.
Noor fired a single shot, killing Damond, a 40-year-old dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia whose death rocked both countries and led to changes in the Minneapolis Police Department. The shooting came just two weeks after an officer in New York was ambushed and killed in a parked vehicle.
Attorneys for Noor, who was fired after being charged in the case and has never talked to investigators about what happened, argue that he used reasonable force to defend himself and his partner from a perceived threat. But prosecutors say there is no evidence he faced a threat that justified deadly force
Prosecutor Patrick Lofton, in his opening statement, questioned a statement from Noor's partner, Matthew Harrity, that he heard a thump right before the shooting. Lofton said Harrity never said anything at the scene about such a noise, instead mentioning it for the first time some days later in an interview with investigators.
Lofton also said investigators found no forensic evidence to show that Damond had touched the squad car before she was shot, an assertion that seemed aimed at the possibility that she had slapped or hit it upon approaching the officers.
Lofton also wondered why other officers responding to the scene didn't consistently have their cameras switched on. The officers did not turn on their body cameras until after the shooting, and there was no squad car video. Lofton noted that a sergeant taking statements had her camera on when she talked to Harrity, but off when she talked to Noor.
""We'll never hear what Noor said,"" he said.
Justine Damond Stephen Govel Photography Damond was a life coach who had been engaged to be married in just a month's time. Noor, 33, is a Somali American whose arrival on the force just a couple of years earlier had been trumpeted by city leaders working to diversify the police force.
Damond called 911 twice, then called her fiance and hung up when police arrived, Lofton said. One minute and 19 seconds later, Damond was cradling a gunshot wound to her abdomen and saying, ""I'm dying,"" Lofton added.
Minnesota law allows police officers to use deadly force to protect themselves or their partners from death or great bodily harm. Prosecutors charged Noor with second-degree intentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
Damond's fiance, Don Damond, was the first witness for prosecutors. Damond sobbed as he described calls from investigators the night of Justine's death, saying he wasn't told an officer had shot her until a second phone call.
Damond said calling her family members in Australia was ""painful, and traumatic, and the worst phone call I've ever had to make in my life."" Members of Justine's from Australia, including her father, stepmother, brother and sister-in-law, were in the courtroom Tuesday and could be heard crying as Damond testified.
Justine Damond had taken her fiance's name professionally before their marriage.
Former Minneapolis Police officer Mohamed Noor arrives with his lawyers for the beginning of his trial on April 1, 2019 in Minneapolis. Stephen Maturen / Getty Images file Earlier Tuesday, Hennepin County District Judge Kathryn Quaintance relented on restrictions that would have prevented the public and media from viewing video evidence introduced in the case. That's expected to include body-camera video that shows efforts to save Damond. Quaintance had cited a desire to protect Damond's privacy, but a coalition of media groups including The Associated Press had challenged the ban.
""The court, like the jury, must follow the law — even if I disagree with it,"" said Quaintance.
Noor's attorneys haven't said whether he will testify. If he does, prosecutors may be able to introduce some evidence that the defense wanted to keep out of the state's case, including that he has refused to talk to investigators. They also could bring up a 2015 psychological test that showed Noor disliked being around people and had difficulty confronting others. Despite that test, a psychiatrist found him fit to be a cadet officer.
The shooting raised questions about Noor's training. The police chief defended Noor's training, but the chief was forced to resign days later. The shooting also led to changes in the department's policy on use of body cameras.

80-year-old New York man arrested on charges he killed 2 young women in Virginia Beach in 1973,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/80-year-old-new-york-man-arrested-charges-he-killed-n992811,"NORFOLK, Va.— An 80-year-old New York man has been arrested on charges that he killed two young women in a beach cottage nearly half a century ago in Virginia, police said Tuesday. Ernest Broadnax was arrested in New York City on Monday and faces two counts of second-degree murder and one count of rape in Virginia Beach. The slayings occurred in the summer of 1973.
Virginia Beach police did not say how they linked Broadnax to the killings. They said their cold-case unit began to pursue a “strong lead” last year and sought out “advanced forensic technology.”
Broadnax, who lives in New York City’s Queens borough, is waiting to go through extradition in New York, police said. It’s unclear if he has an attorney.
For decades, the case haunted the coastal city in Virginia and the officers who launched the investigation.
Friends Janice Pietropola and Lynn Seethaler were from the Pittsburgh area and had rented a cottage about a block from the Atlantic Ocean.
Concerned when the two 19-year-olds missed their checkout time, an employee opened the door of their rented cottage, peered inside and discovered their bodies.
Pietropola was shot three times in the right side of the head with a .22-caliber gun. She also was raped and strangled.
Seethaler was shot twice in the right side of the head and face. Her neck was slashed with a wine bottle, and she also was strangled.
Every available detective was put on the case. There were hundreds of interviews and thousands of communiques with police elsewhere.
“We did everything we could,” then-police Capt. William Haden told The Associated Press in 1998. “We flew in the helicopter, we searched rooftops, we climbed into manholes.”
During their week in Virginia, Seethaler and Pietropola met several men on the beach and had gone on dates. On two occasions, they invited some of their new acquaintances back to the cottage for beers.
The contents of the women’s purses had been dumped on the cottage floor, but robbery never was considered a motive.
Police didn’t know if the killer knew the women, or if the victims were picked at random.
For Haden, the case became personal. The crime happened on his 31st birthday, and he said he felt as if the young women’s parents had entrusted their daughters to his care.
More than a decade after the killings, Haden flew to Los Angeles to investigate two suspects arrested on an unrelated crime whose names had surfaced in the Virginia Beach investigation. But he couldn’t connect them to the slayings.
“I have always referred to them as ’my girls,’” he said in 1998. “I still don’t know why this case was so personal. There is no way I can describe that to you.”
Virginia Beach police said in their statement Tuesday that they never gave up. The cold case unit began “aggressively researching” a strong lead that came in last fall.
They enlisted help from various law enforcement agencies, ranging from the FBI and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to units within the New York Police Department.
“Their dedication and tenacity paid off,” Virginia Beach police said."
Young father Tyler Davis missing from Ohio shopping complex since February - NBC News,www.nbcnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/missing-in-america/young-father-tyler-davis-missing-ohio-shopping-complex-february-n992246,"Apr 8 2019, 3:50 pm ET Young father Tyler Davis missing from Ohio shopping complex since February by Bianca Hillier Comment Print
Parents with young children know how rare it is to have time to themselves. For Brittany and Tyler Davis –- parents of a 20-month-old son –- these occasions only happen three times a year: Brittany’s birthday, Tyler’s birthday, and their anniversary.
This year for Brittany’s birthday on February 24, she and her husband Tyler, 29, planned a night at a hotel near Easton Town Center, an indoor and outdoor shopping complex in Columbus, Ohio. They live about 90 minutes southwest in Wilmington, Ohio, and the trip was Brittany’s first time hanging out in the state’s capital.
“On February 23rd, me and my husband and our son drove to my in-laws and dropped our son with them,” Brittany told Dateline. “Then we continued on to the Hilton hotel, which is right in front of the shopping center, and checked in probably around 5:00 p.m.” Tyler Davis, 29.
Brittany said a close friend, who lives in Columbus, came by the hotel to hang out with them. A few hours later, around 8:30 p.m., the three of them left the hotel to walk around the shopping center.
“We got some dinner and went out for the evening,” Brittany said. “We walked around the town center to get the lay of the land, because we were going to go shopping the next day and had a couple’s massage planned.” advertisement
Brittany told Dateline nothing was out of ordinary that evening. But by the time they had walked around the sprawling shopping complex –- which includes no fewer than 235 retail stores, 40 restaurants and 750 residential units, according to its website –- it was around 3:00 a.m. and everyone was exhausted. They took an Uber back to the hotel. Brittany said that’s when the night began to change.
“When we were getting out of the Uber, Tyler seemed so confused and frustrated,” Brittany told Dateline. “He said he was going to go for a walk.”
Brittany said she offered to go with him, but her phone was dying so their friend went with Tyler, instead, while Brittany went to the hotel room to charge her phone. She went back outside a couple of minutes later, she said, but couldn’t find her husband or their friend.
“I was kind of confused, like, ‘What’s going on?’” she said. “Then Tyler called me around 3:30 a.m. and said he would be right back [to the hotel].”
A few minutes later, the couple’s friend returned to the hotel. Tyler was not with him.
“He said Tyler would be right back, too. But I kept trying to call Tyler and he wouldn’t answer,” Brittany said. Brittany added that their friend had seen Tyler on the walk, but she was unclear why, or at what point, they had separated.
Around 4:10 a.m., about one hour after Tyler had left for the walk, Brittany’s phone rang. It was Tyler. advertisement
“He called and said, ‘I see the hotel. I’m walking through the woods. I’ll be right there.’” Brittany said. “He sounded so confused. And he is not an outdoorsy person at all. There could be two trees right beside each other and he would call that ‘woods.’”
Seconds later, Brittany’s phone rang again. It was Tyler.
“I answered it and there was an open line for about four seconds. Then the phone hung up,” Brittany said. “I called him back and his phone was off. And it’s been off ever since.”
Brittany told Dateline it was nearing 4:30 a.m. at this point. Their friend, who Brittany says lives just 10 minutes from the hotel, decided to go home. Brittany told Dateline she “didn’t have a good feeling” about her husband’s safety and began calling friends to ask for advice on what to do. According to Brittany, her friends reassured her that nothing was wrong and Tyler was probably going to walk through the door at any moment. But as the sun began to rise, Brittany grew more concerned.
“I called an old roommate who lives in Columbus. At 8:00 a.m., he came and we drove around Easton. Maybe Tyler fell asleep on a bench? We didn’t know what had happened,” Brittany said.
Brittany said she then called her in-laws, Tyler’s parents, to tell them what was going on. Around 10:30 a.m., she called the Columbus Police Department to report her husband missing.
“After I spoke to the police, my father-in-law arrived,” Brittany said. “He searched every single area on foot, by himself. He stayed there until it was dark.”
Brittany drove to her in-laws’ house to take care of her and Tyler’s son. She says she returned to Easton Town Center that evening to continue searching for her husband. Authorities searched, too, she said. But nobody found any trace of the missing father.
The Columbus Police Department did not reply to Dateline’s request for comment by Monday evening, but Brittany said authorities have conducted multiple searches and are currently reviewing security footage.
“They have a lot of missing people in that area, but I only have one husband,” Brittany said. “There are so many different things that could have happened, but there is no lead directing us anywhere. He would not just leave.” advertisement
Tyler Davis is described as being 5’10” tall and weighing 170 lbs. with brown hair and brown eyes. He was last seen wearing a blue and green flannel shirt with blue jeans and black and white Nike shoes. Tyler has a birthmark on his right arm. If you have any information on the circumstances surrounding Tyler’s disappearance, please call the Columbus Police Department at 614-645-4545. Bianca Hillier"

This undated photo provided by the Yavapai County Jail shows Tara Aven, 46. Yavapai County Jail via AP Tara Aven, 46, and her daughter, Briar Aven, 24, were arrested Tuesday and face multiple charges, police in Prescott said in a statement.
Police discovered the body of a 77-year-old woman after a concerned resident reported that he had not seen Sandra Aven, 77, in some time.
Tara and Briar Aven live next door to Sandra Aven, and when police asked them about Sandra's whereabouts, they discovered inconsistencies in the women's accounts, police said. Briar Aven is said to have initially told officers that her grandmother was out of town.
After interviewing the women, police entered a home and found a body they believe is that of Sandra Aven, Prescott police said.
Police said the woman has yet to be identified and they did not say how she died.
""Subsequent interviews with Briar Aven and Tara Aven resulted in confessions to the murder of Sandra Aven in late 2017,"" police said in the statement, adding that in the time after their relative’s death they began cashing monthly payments intended for Sandra Aven.
This undated photo provided by the Yavapai County Jail shows Briar Aven, 24. Yavapai County Jail via AP Yavapai County Jail records show the women were booked Tuesday afternoon.
Penny Cramer, administrative assistant to the Yavapai County Attorney, said Wednesday that both were booked in on initial charges that include first-degree premeditated murder, tampering with evidence and fraudulent schemes. Initial charges can sometimes change.
Briar Aven was being held on no bond, and bail was set at a $1 million cash-only bond for Tara Aven, Cramer said. Both were in jail Wednesday, the sheriff’s department said.
Prescott Lead Officer David Fuller said Wednesday that police believe the pair cashed checks including Social Security payments and payments from a rental property owned by Sandra Aven. He said the case is still under investigation.

He beat the two main parties that had led the country for a quarter century. Nayib Bukele speaks after winning the presidential election with more than 53 percent of the vote in El Salvador on Feb. 3, 2019. Rodrigo Sura / EPA Feb. 4, 2019, 3:51 PM GMT By The Associated Press A youthful former mayor of the capital easily won El Salvador's presidency, getting more votes than his three rivals combined to usher out the two parties that dominated politics for a quarter century in the crime-plagued Central America nation. The Supreme Electoral Court declared Nayib Bukele the winner late Sunday, saying he had nearly 54 percent of the votes, with about 90 percent of ballots counted. Carlos Callejas of the Nationalist Republican Alliance ended in a distant second at less than 32 percent, while even farther back were former Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez of the currently governing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front and a minor party candidate. By surpassing the 50 percent threshold, Bukele won outright and avoided the need for a March runoff against the No. 2 finisher. Bukele claimed victory even before the formal announcement of his win, inviting a jubilant crowd in the capital of San Salvador to celebrate in the streets. ""This is a victory for the Salvadoran public, really,"" Bukele said to cheers. Supporters celebrate after Great National Alliance candidate Nayib Bukele won the presidential election in San Salvador, El Salvador, on Feb. 3, 2019. Marvin Recinos / AFP - Getty Images All four candidates promised to end corruption, stamp out gang violence and create more jobs, with crushing crime at the top of the agenda, but Bukele's campaign resonated more with his countrymen and polls had pointed to him as the strong front-runner going into the election. Roughly 67,000 Salvadorans belong to gangs that terrorize their communities with extortion, murder and other forms of violence. Related Housing is key to Puerto Rico's recovery. Will 2019 see promised funding, solutions? The candidates proposed creating economic opportunities and restoring social values to dissuade Salvadorans from engaging in criminal behavior. El Salvador is small both in size and population, with just 6.5 million people. Close to a third of its households live in poverty, while the World Bank says per capita income is $3,560. Salvadorans searching for a better life have joined recent caravans of migrants trekking across Mexico hoping to reach the U.S. Bukele, 37, made his political debut in 2012 as a small-town mayor with the FMLN and won election in the capital three years later, automatically making him a potential presidential contender. But his frequent criticism of the leftist party's leadership got him expelled, and he ran for the presidency as the unlikely standard-bearer for the small, conservative Grand Alliance for National Unity, whose initials — GANA — mean ""win"" in Spanish. The FMLN and the conservative Nationalist Republican Alliance, known as ARENA, had dominated El Salvador's politics since a 1992 peace deal ended a vicious civil war. But both parties have been stained by corruption scandals and neither has been able to stem gang violence. ""I came to vote because I want the country to change, because we are tired of so much corruption,"" said one voter, Estela Henriquez, at a polling place in the capital. More than 4,500 election observers, including representatives of the Organization of American States and the European Union, were on hand. There were no reports of major problems in voting."
Why does the Supreme Court have nine justices? And why can't Democrats add more?,www.nbcnews.com,Steve Vladeck,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/why-does-supreme-court-have-nine-justices-why-can-t-ncna992851,"Even most lawyers have probably never heard of the Judiciary Act of 1869 , which became law 150 years ago today. But this obscure statute, among other things, adjusted the number of seats on the Supreme Court to its now familiar total of nine — a total that Congress hasn’t touched since. On this, the 1869 act’s sesquicentennial, it’s worth reflecting on how we ended up with nine justices — and why recent proposals that Democrats should expand the size of the court when that party is next in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House are dangerously myopic.
Recent proposals that Democrats should expand the size of the court are dangerously myopic.
The Constitution, perhaps surprisingly, says nothing about how many justices should serve on the Supreme Court.
The text contemplates at least one — a chief justice — to preside over a president’s impeachment trial. But otherwise, the Founders left the size of the court to Congress , which tweaked the number of seats seven times over its first 80 years. In 1801, for example, lame-duck Federalists tried to deny incoming President Thomas Jefferson the chance to fill a seat that was expected to soon be vacant by reducing the court’s size from six justices (the original complement under the Judiciary Act of 1789) to five. But once Jefferson was sworn in, his partisans in the new Congress quickly restored the seat — and Jefferson filled it.
As the nation expanded westward, Congress kept pace, adding seats to the Supreme Court each time it created new circuit courts of appeals — for the Seventh Circuit in 1807, the Eighth and Ninth Circuits in 1837 and the Tenth Circuit in 1863. Although the timing of the expansions was often dictated by politics, having one seat per circuit provided both an apolitical justification for the court’s size and a principle of geographic diversity among the justices, since the idea was that each seat would be filled by someone from a different circuit.
But as part of its broader conflict with President Andrew Johnson, Congress reduced the number of seats on the court in 1866 from 10 seats to seven — decoupling the number of seats from the number of circuit courts of appeals. Although the 1869 act, enacted one month after the inauguration of President Ulysses S. Grant — Johnson’s successor — restored to nine both the number of circuits and Supreme Court seats, the episode set off alarm bells. Should Congress have the power to interfere with both the president — by changing the size of the court — and the court itself?
Thus, when Congress next added a new circuit court in 1929, it left the size of the court unchanged. And when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, relying on dubious claims about the justices’ health and pace of work, infamously proposed to increase the size of the court to 15 Justices in 1937, it was the pushback from his own party in Congress that largely killed the proposal.
Should Congress have the power to interfere with both the president — by changing the size of the court — and the court itself?
The concern that animated Democratic opposition to FDR’s “court-packing” plan is just as valid today: If Congress increases the size of the Supreme Court for transparently partisan political reasons, it would cement the idea the justices are little more than politicians in robes, and that the court is little more than an additional — and very powerful — arm through which partisan political power can be exercised. And although many Americans already hold this view of the court, court-packing for transparently partisan reasons would only make things worse, especially if it set a precedent for future Congresses to do the same.
Indeed, if one of the most important justifications for an independent, un-elected judiciary is the ability to protect the rights of minorities against the tyranny of the majority, a court that is beholden to whichever party is currently in power would likely lack both the inclination and the legitimacy to stand up to the political branches. Indeed, that Congress has not revisited the size of the court in 150 years is a powerful testament to just how ingrained the norm of nine has become — and how concerned different political constituencies have been at different times about preserving the court’s power.
Related Opinion Opinion Has the Supreme Court lost its legitimacy? To be sure, there are some who see the addition of two new seats to the court as a proportional response to hardball tactics by Republicans — first by holding open the seat vacated by Justice Antonin Scalia for nearly a year so that it could not be filled by President Barack Obama, and then by confirming Justice Brett Kavanaugh notwithstanding broader concerns about both the nominee and the president who nominated him.
Not only do two wrongs not make a right, though, but once Congress gets back into the business of messing with the size of the court, it’s impossible to imagine it stopping. Thus, Democrats might expand the court to 11 seats in 2021, but nothing would stop Republicans from expanding the court to 15 when next they control both chambers of Congress and the White House — and so on. It would only be a matter of time before the court had 37 justices — and no legitimacy.
To some, of course, destroying the legitimacy of the Supreme Court (especially the current court) is a feature, not a bug. So be it. But even those who don’t see their views represented among a majority of the current justices should have an interest in preserving the court’s long-term authority to check the political branches — authority that court-packing would necessarily, and irrevocably, erode.

Dark web monitoring: Useful way to fight identity theft or marketing hype?,www.nbcnews.com,Herb Weisbaum,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/dark-web-monitoring-useful-way-fight-identity-theft-or-marketing-ncna992351,"We’ve all heard of the dark web, although few of us really know much about it. News reports tell us it’s where criminals buy and sell stolen personal information , such as credit card numbers, bank account passwords, even Social Security numbers. No wonder credit monitoring companies have added “dark web monitoring” to their list of services. This fear of the unknown just might motivate people to pay $10 - $30 a month for identity theft protection .
But what can dark web monitoring really do for you?
Many people are making false assumptions about that, according to a new survey by the Consumer Federation of America (CFA). The survey found that:
36 percent of those who’d seen ads for dark web monitoring incorrectly believed identity theft services can remove their personal information from the dark web. (They can’t.) 37 percent mistakenly believe these services can prevent stolen information sold on the dark web from being used. (They can’t.) The reality is: No one can erase the data that winds up in this underground cyber-marketplace or prevent it from being sold, exchanged or used.
“People are making assumptions that are natural, but incorrect,” said Susan Grant, CFA’s director of Consumer Protection and Privacy. “Dark web monitoring may be able to alert consumers that their stolen personal information is being offered for sale on the internet, but it can’t put the genie back in the bottle.”
The Consumer Federation of American wants companies that offer these services to do a better job explaining how they work and what they can — and cannot — do.
Here's how to get a loan if you have bad credit Aug. 14, 2018 02:15 THE 411 ON DARK WEB MONITORING The technology to scan the dark web was developed in 2006. The process, called “scraping,” allows a company to monitor hundreds of chat rooms, websites and peer-to-peer networks that deal with stolen personal identity information and download that data for analysis.
But here’s the part credit monitoring companies don’t tell you: Most of the stolen information being sold on the dark web is shielded from scraping software because it’s behind a paywall.
“There's no way a darknet scraper can find that data whatsoever. These services are completely useless, as far as what they do that for consumers,” said cybersecurity consultant Brett Johnson, a former cybercriminal who helped build the first criminal online marketplace.
Wonder if your information is on the dark web?
“It is,” Johnson said. “There's no need for an individual to pay for dark web monitoring to learn that.”
Dark web monitoring may be able to alert consumers that their stolen personal information is being offered for sale on the internet, but it can’t put the genie back in the bottle.
Susan Grant, Consumer Federation of America
IS THERE ANY VALUE TO DARK WEB MONITORING? Neal O’Farrell, executive director of the Identify Theft Council , is a long-time critic of credit monitoring services. He calls dark web scanning “a smoke and mirrors deal” that was created by credit monitoring services to justify their monthly fee.
“They keep adding on these extra services that are truly valueless and don't go to the cause of the problem, which is vigilance, awareness, taking care of your own personal information, freezing your credit,” O’Farrell charged.
NBC News BETTER contacted two of the big players in this industry, Experian and Norton LifeLock . Executives from both companies insist their dark web monitoring is a valuable service because it tells people the specific types of personal information that’s circulating in the criminal marketplace — and how to respond to that.
“The fact that we give you step by step instructions about what you should do certainly does motivate the consumer to be more secure,” said Paige Hanson, Norton LifeLock’s Chief of Identity Education.
Dark web alerts can fight data breach fatigue, where people assume they can’t do anything to protect themselves, so they don’t, said Michael Bruemmer, Experian’s vice president of data breach resolution. “It’s that complacency that we’re trying to avoid.”
3 THINGS YOU CAN DO ON YOUR OWN More than 14.7 billion records have been reported lost or stolen since 2013, according to the Breach Level Index , with 6.4 million more added to the list every day.
Related Scam Alert Scam Alert You've been breached: Hackers stole nearly half a billion personal records in 2018 “With so much of your personal information already compromised, you need to be vigilant —always watching for warning signs of identity theft and doing things that make it more difficult for criminals to use the data they’ve stolen,” said Adam Levin, founder of CyberScout , which offers identity and data breach defense services. “You can’t simply rely on a monitoring service to do all the work for you.”
Here’s what you should be doing on your own:
Monitor your accounts Check your credit card, bank and other financial accounts once a week or so to look for anything suspicious.
Supercharge your passwords If they’re weak, create new ones — especially for your most sensitive accounts. And don’t use a password on more than one account. A free password generator and password manager can help make and store long, strong passwords.
Related Do It BETTER Do It BETTER How to create strong passwords you can remember Get a copy of your credit reports You can get a free one from each of the big three credit reporting agencies — Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — every 12 months by going to AnnualCreditReport.com . (Note: You must provide your Social Security Number because that’s the way they locate your credit file.)
When you get the report, look for signs of possible fraud , such as: credit cards or bank accounts you never opened, a change of employer or home address that’s not right, or negative information, such as late payment notices, that are wrong.
Freeze your credit By locking your credit file , you prevent criminals from using that information to open new accounts in your name.
“Financial identity theft is one of the most common forms of identity theft and a security freeze the single most meaningful thing you can do to protect your financial accounts,” said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center .

Man accused of abandoning pet fish has animal cruelty charges dropped,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-accused-abandoning-pet-fish-has-animal-cruelty-charges-dropped-n992896,"WILMINGTON, N.C. — Charges have been dropped against a North Carolina man accused of leaving his pet fish behind without food when he was evicted. Michael Hinson faces charges after he abandoned his pet fish. New Hanover County Sheriff's Office New Hanover County District Attorney Ben David told news outlets Tuesday that 53-year-old Michael Hinson is no longer charged with animal cruelty and abandonment. He says fish aren't protected under related statues that define ""animal"" as amphibians, reptiles, bird and mammals, excluding humans.
Officials say Hinson was evicted from his Wilmington home last month and left behind an unhealthy Oscar fish in a dirty tank. He was arrested last week after officials found the 6-inch fish, which is being nursed back to health at an aquarium store.
Sheriff's Lt. Jerry Brewer said this was the county's first animal cruelty case involving a fish."

Texas Tech medical school to stop using race in admissions,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-tech-medical-school-stop-using-race-admissions-n992901,"LUBBOCK, Texas — Race will no longer be factored into admissions at Texas Tech University's medical school following an agreement with the Trump administration, potentially previewing how other complaints over affirmative action are handled under Education Secretary Betsy Devos. The resolution resolves a complaint filed in 2004 against Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. But notably, the resolution is the first of its kind under the Trump administration, which last year rescinded Obama-era guidelines meant to promote diversity among students.
The civil rights office of the Education Department also has ongoing investigations into policies at Yale and Harvard.
Under the agreement with Texas Tech's medical school, the admissions department will ""discontinue all consideration of an applicant's race and/or national origin."" The resolution was signed in February but first reported Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal.
The original complaint was filed by Roger Clegg, president and general counsel of the Center for Equal Opportunity, which opposes affirmative action.
On Tuesday, the group posted to its website a March letter to Clegg from the Education Department, which said that school officials acknowledged in interviews that internal reviews ""does not specifically consider the necessity for continued use of race-conscious admissions policies or whether race-neutral alternatives would be effective in achieving a similar level of diversity.""
Related News What is legal affirmative action? Harvard's race-conscious admissions go to court. It went on to say the department ""has concern"" that the medical school's admissions process may not be narrowly tailored.
The Trump administration's Justice Department has signaled concern about the use of race in admissions decisions. The department, for instance, sided last year with Asian-American plaintiffs who contend in a lawsuit against Harvard that the school unlawfully limits how many Asian students are admitted.
In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted affirmative action policies a victory by permitting race to be among the factors considered in the college admission process."

A car that had apparently veered off the road was found in the Caribbean Sea, and two bodies have been found, police said Tuesday.
Dominican Republic National Police told NBC News on Wednesday that authorities identified a woman who died in a hospital as Portia Ravenelle. Police said she was found seriously injured by the side of a road by a fisherman March 27 and was hospitalized, but died April 4.
The woman did not have any documents on her when she was found, police said.
Her body was identified using fingerprints supplied by the U.S. embassy, police said Wednesday. The man's body that was found is so far unidentified.
Ravenelle and her boyfriend, Orlando Moore, were due to return from their Caribbean vacation March 27, Moore's family said Monday.
But the Mount Vernon couple never made their flight home, and their car was still sitting at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, where they had left it on March 23.
Orlando Moore and Portia Ravenelle. Courtesy of the Moore Family A man's body in an ""advanced state of decomposition"" but with ""the characteristics of Orlando Moore"" was recovered from the water on March 31, police said in a statement translated from Spanish.
The couple is believed to have rented a car, and evidence indicates they were headed to the airport but had a car accident, police said.
Their rented car was seen at a toll booth near the point where a vehicle was found in the sea, police have said.
It was not immediately clear what may have caused the car to drop off the highway and into the sea, but fishermen told investigators that on March 27, they heard a ""rumble"" coming from the coast-hugging Las Americas Highway in Santo Domingo East, police said in Tuesday’s statement.
Police said Tuesday that divers have not been able to identify the submerged vehicle's characteristics because of poor conditions, and the point is known for strong currents.
The U.S. Department of State said Tuesday that it was working on the investigation with authorities in the Dominican Republic, according to NBC New York.
Moore's sister, Lashay Turner, alerted officials about the missing couple, NBC New York reported , and she told the station that that her brother was a father and not the type to ""just run off on a hiatus.""
A neighbor of the couple, John Hollis, told NBC New York that ""Orlando was a very vibrant outgoing person, that would do anything for you."" He considered them friends.
""Portia is a vibrant energy,"" Hollis said. ""I'm going to miss her.""

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 10, 2019, 12:50 PM GMT By Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann WASHINGTON — For all the talk about the different lanes in the 2020 Democratic presidential race, there’s one emerging reality when it comes to the issue divide. It’s essentially Bernie Sanders versus everyone else. Think about it: Sanders is the only self-avowed democratic socialist, while the other Dems have declined to explicitly embrace that label, with many saying they’re a capitalist — in some form or fashion. On health care, as he reintroduces his Medicare for All Act, Sanders has ruled out a role for private insurance other than for cosmetic surgery . And outside of Kamala Harris, the other top-tier Dems (Beto O’Rourke, Pete Buttigieg, even Elizabeth Warren) still envision some kind of role for private insurers — even as they all talk about “Medicare for All” or embrace it as a goal. And on free college tuition versus debt-free college, Sanders is the one promising free college tuition. The others are more focused on refinancing debt and subsidizing tuition for community colleges. (As Buttigieg recently asked , is it progressive to subsidize four-year college students, who will go on to make more money than non-college grads?) This issue-divide reality is good news/bad news for Sanders. (And note: We’re talking about divisions, not policy proposals.) The bad news: He’s increasingly on an island on these issues. The good news: Like in 2016, he gets to cast himself as the pure candidate when it comes to capitalism versus socialism, on single-payer, and on free college tuition — even as the party is closer to him on the issues than it was four years ago. But the question for Democratic primary voters: Is it better to be pure on these issues? Or is it better to have flexibility – given the poll numbers on these stances? 2020 Vision: Bernie the millionaire Speaking of Sanders… He has railed against the “millionaires and billionaires.” And now he’s one of them. As he’s set to release 10 years of tax returns on April 15 – after issuing just one tax summary (of 2014) in his last presidential campaign – Sanders admitted to the New York Times that he’s now a millionaire due to book royalties. “I wrote a best-selling book,” he said. “If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.” The Times notes that Sanders’ 2017 Senate financial disclosure forms “show he earned roughly $1.06 million that year, more than $885,000 from book royalties. His most recent book, ‘Where We Go From Here,’ was published last year.” On the campaign trail today Speaking today before the North America Building Trade Unions legislative conference in DC are John Hickenlooper (at 9:10 am ET), Elizabeth Warren (9:25 am ET), Kamala Harris (9:40 am ET), Tim Ryan (9:55 am ET), Eric Swalwell (at 10:45 am ET), Cory Booker (at 11:00 am ET), and Amy Klobuchar (at 11:30 am ET)… Harris also holds a town hall in Iowa… Julian Castro has a “People First” rally in San Antonio… And Jay Inslee has a town hall with CNN in DC. Netanyahu appears headed to victory in Israel “With 96 percent of the votes counted, [Prime Minister Netanyahu’s] Likud and Benny Gantz's Blue and White party both had won 35 seats each,” per NBC News . “But Netanyahu was in a stronger position to form a coalition government with the anticipated support of right-wing and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties, Likud's natural allies. Such a coalition could have as many as 65 votes in the 120-member parliament.” More from F. Brinley Bruton and Paul Goldman: “The results affirmed Israel's continued tilt to the right and further dimmed hopes of a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” We’re going to find out how much of the recent Trump-Netanyahu alliance on the Golan Heights and the West Bank was campaign saber-rattling – or whether it was real. Oh, and one other reminder: Winning an election in a parliamentary system is the first step; forming the actual government is the next. And that can be a messy process.

Here's more on that and what else we're watching today.
Netanyahu claims 'colossal victory' in tight election ""King Bibi"" may have done it again.
With 96 percent of the votes counted Wednesday morning, Netanyahu appeared to be better placed than his main competitor in a tight race that was seen as a referendum on his leadership.
Netanyahu's Likud party and former military chief of staff Benny Gantz's rival Blue and White party had each won 35 seats.
But Netanyahu is in a stronger position to form a coalition government with the anticipated support of right-wing and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties.
If his party succeeds in forming a parliamentary majority and Netanyahu again serves as prime minister, it would be his fourth consecutive and fifth overall term, making him the longest-serving leader in the country's history.

Now, after the February fatal shooting of a young black rapper by six officers, some are calling for an outside agency or civil rights group to review the Vallejo Police Department.
""Can we not use the O.K. Corral tactics?"" one resident asked. ""We've become the wild, Wild West. That has to change. We're losing too many lives.""
GOP worried over Trump purge of Homeland Security President Donald Trump is getting blowback from his own party for his shake-up of the leadership at the Department of Homeland Security.
Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has urged Trump not to fire the head of Citizen and Immigration Services and criticized the influence of White House adviser and immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller. Senate Homeland Security Committee Chair Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., said he's concerned about the ""void"" at DHS.
Meantime, the White House is already working on plans to make it harder for immigrants at the border to receive asylum by putting border agents in charge of the interview process , according to multiple senior administration officials.
Miller has argued that Customs and Border Protection agents would be tougher on asylum-seekers and would pass fewer of them on the initial screening, known as a credible fear interview, the sources said.
A high-stakes meeting will decide Brexit's fate — but the U.K. won't be at the table For a country that voted to ""take back control"" in June 2016, the United Kingdom's future is now in the hands of the very European leaders it wanted to divorce.
Tonight 27 prime ministers and presidents from across the European Union will gather to choose between two broad options that will determine the U.K.'s fate . Both could have dramatic consequences for Britain and beyond.
The European leaders may offer the U.K. a long extension, postponing the date by up to one year when Brexit is set to finally happen.
But if just one European leader disagrees with such an approach, Britain will crash out of Europe without a deal on Friday.

Stephen Miller is lone survivor at center of White House Homeland Security chaos And then there was one.
Amid the chaotic power struggle that led to Kirstjen Nielsen's ouster as Homeland Security secretary, one White House adviser is the obvious winner: Stephen Miller.
The iconoclastic hard-line young policy aide to President Donald Trump, hated by the left and celebrated by the extreme right, has survived all his rivals.
Now Trump's immigration policy, which will be the president's central 2020 campaign issue, belongs to him, NBC News' Jonathan Allen writes.
The director of the U.S. Secret Service, Randolph Alles, also announced he is leaving his position, in a further sign of the Department of Homeland Security shakeup.
But as the Trump administration hardens its stance on immigration, it will still have to contend with challenges from other parts of the government.
A federal judge in California issued an order Monday blocking the Trump administration's policy of returning some asylum-seekers to Mexico while they wait for a court appearance.
Any appeal of the decision would be heard by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which Trump has repeatedly blasted as a ""disgrace"" for ruling against his policies.

First-ever black hole photo gives humanity a long-anticipated glimpse of bizarre celestial object,www.nbcnews.com,David Freeman,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/first-ever-black-hole-photo-gives-humanity-long-anticipated-glimpse-ncna992111,"Scientists on Wednesday unveiled the first-ever photograph of a black hole , giving humanity a glimpse of a bizarre celestial object that has captivated our imagination for more than a century. The long-anticipated photo — in which a black hole's silhouette is visible as a dark patch surrounded by a bright ring — was shown in a series of press briefings held simultaneously in Washington and five other cities around the world.
The photo is the product of observations made in April 2017 by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), an international consortium that linked eight radio observatories around the world to create a single, Earth-size telescope with enough magnifying might to see what until now has been unseeable.
""Here it is,"" Sheperd Doeleman, a Harvard astronomer and project director of the EHT, said as he revealed the image at the Washington briefing. ""This is the strongest evidence that we have to date for the existence of black holes.""
""For 25 years this was always a dream, a fiction, an expectation,"" Heino Falcke, an astronomer at Radboud University in the Netherlands and one of the EHT scientists, told NBC News MACH in an email. ""I have seen many beautiful, detailed images of black holes — but all were just simulations,"" he added. ""This one is so precious, so beautiful, because it is real.""
The photo shows the supermassive black hole at the center of a neighboring galaxy known as Messier 87. The black hole lies about 55 million light-years from Earth and is billions of times more massive than the sun.
Scientists reveal first image of a black hole: 'We are delighted' April 10, 2019 02:03 Falcke said he was surprised by how large the black hole appears in the photo, adding that it hadn't been clear that the black hole was big enough to produce a shadow that would be visible to us. ""Well, we saw the shadow at the first attempt,"" he said. ""It really is that large — that blew me away.""
Black holes are super-dense remnants of collapsed stars whose gravitational forces are so strong that no matter or even light can escape once it gets too close. Scientists envisioned ""invisible stars"" at least as far back as the 18th Century, and Einstein's theory of general relativity predicted the existence of such objects in 1915 — though the term black hole wasn't coined until 1967 .
Related Space Space Black holes explained Countless black holes are now thought to exist in the universe, including an estimated 100 million in our galaxy alone. Lucky for us, astronomers say none is near enough to Earth to pose a threat.
As the name suggests, black holes themselves are completely black and invisible. But scientists had long believed that radio waves given off by the gas and dust swirling around a distant black hole's so-called event horizon — the theoretical boundary marking the point beyond which all light and matter pass inexorably into the black hole — would be visible through a sufficiently powerful telescope.
Dramatic as it is, the photo unveiled Wednesday may be just a prelude to what's to come from the EHT.
""As with all great discoveries, this is just the beginning,"" Doeleman said.
Falcke said the group wanted to make sharper images as well as movies of gas orbiting black holes, adding, ""This is just the first step and we are only scratching the surface.""

SUBSCRIBE April 10, 2019, 12:43 AM GMT By Reuters Boeing's legal troubles grew Tuesday as a new lawsuit accused the company of defrauding shareholders by concealing safety deficiencies in its 737 MAX planes before two fatal crashes led to their worldwide grounding. The proposed class action filed in Chicago federal court seeks damages for alleged securities fraud violations, after Boeing's market value tumbled by $34 billion within two weeks of the March 10 crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX. Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg and Chief Financial Officer Gregory Smith were also named as defendants. Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers had no immediate comment. According to the complaint, Boeing ""effectively put profitability and growth ahead of airplane safety and honesty"" by rushing the 737 MAX to market to compete with Airbus SE, while leaving out ""extra"" or ""optional"" features designed to prevent the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes. It also said Boeing's statements about its growth prospects and the 737 MAX were undermined by its alleged conflict of interest from retaining broad authority from federal regulators to assess the plane's safety. Richard Seeks, the lead plaintiff, said Boeing's compromises began to emerge after the Ethiopian Airlines crash killed all 157 onboard, five months after the Lion Air crash killed 189. Seeks said he bought 300 Boeing shares in early March, and sold them at a loss within the last two weeks. The lawsuit seeks damages for Boeing stock investors from Jan. 8 to March 21. Shareholders often file lawsuits accusing companies of securities fraud for concealing material negative information that causes the stock price to decline upon becoming public. Chicago-based Boeing faces many other lawsuits over the crashes, including by victims' families and by participants in its employee retirement plans. Boeing said on Tuesday that aircraft orders in the first quarter fell to 95 from 180 a year earlier, with no orders for the 737 MAX following the worldwide grounding. On April 5, it said it planned to cut monthly 737 production to 42 planes from 52, and was making progress on a 737 MAX software update to prevent further accidents. The case is Seeks v Boeing Co et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois, No. 19-02394."
Wrongful death lawsuit against Michelle Carter who encouraged boyfriend's suicide is dismissed - NBC News,www.nbcnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wrongful-death-lawsuit-against-michelle-carter-who-encouraged-boyfriend-s-n992951,"Wrongful death lawsuit against Michelle Carter dismissed NBC News 9 hrs ago Minyvonne Burke © Faith Ninivaggi Image: Michelle Carter A wrongful death lawsuit against Michelle Carter who, via text messages, encouraged her boyfriend to kill himself has been dismissed, court records reveal.
Eric S. Goldman, a lawyer for Conrad H. Roy III's mother, told the Boston Herald that the suit has been ""resolved"" but declined to comment further.
Court records show that it was dismissed ""with prejudice and without costs,"" meaning that it can't be brought back to court.
Lynn Roy filed the $4.2 million wrongful death lawsuit against Carter in August 2017 for her role in Conrad Roy's 2014 suicide. The 18-year-old died by inhaling carbon monoxide inside his pickup truck in Fairhaven, Massachusetts.
Lawyers for Carter and Lynn Roy were not immediately available for comment.
Carter, then 17, was on the phone with Conrad Roy at the time of his suicide and convinced him to get back in the truck after he got out and told her he was having second thoughts, prosecutors said.
Bristol County Juvenile Court Judge Lawrence Moniz convicted Carter of involuntary manslaughter in 2017 for Conrad Roy's death and sentenced her to a mandatory 15 months in prison and five years of probation.
An attorney for Carter, now 22, had asked Moniz to keep her free as they attempted to have the case heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. The state's high court, however, upheld the conviction during a February ruling and ordered her to start her sentence immediately .

European leaders set to decide on whether to extend Brexit,www.nbcnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/european-leaders-set-decide-whether-extend-brexit-n992906,"BRUSSELS — European leaders are meeting in the continent's political capital Wednesday to decide whether to give the United Kingdom an extension on Brexit . The emergency summit marked the most pivotal moment in a near three-year process that has engulfed Britain in division and emotional turmoil, and caused deep rancor for its neighbors.
Europe has become exasperated by the inability of Britain's politicians to agree a way forward.
The British public voted in a referendum to leave the European Union in June 2016 but Wednesday's conclave will be the second time British Prime Minister Theresa May has pleaded with European leaders to give the country more time.
Brexit road trip: A 1,200-mile journey to the four corners of the U.K. Feb. 7, 2019 09:58 If they cannot agree, the U.K. faces the prospect of crashing out of the E.U. without a deal on Friday.
Although a ""no-deal Brexit"" scenario does have supporters , most experts warn it could tank the economy , bring food shortages , and risk conflict in Northern Ireland .
On Wednesday, May made her case to the 27 prime ministers and presidents in Brussels' futuristic Europa Building. She was then shut out of a high-stakes decision room — where her country's fate will be decided by the leaders of the very countries Britain sought to divorce.
""I know many people will be frustrated that the summit is taking place at all because the U.K. should have left the E.U. by now,"" she told reporters as she arrived.
Most E.U. countries are willing to give Britain a long extension, either to the end of this year or the end of next, according to two E.U. diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly to journalists.
Related World news A high-stakes meeting will decide Brexit's fate — but the U.K. won't be at the table This would be a ""flextension,"" a delay that the U.K. can terminate early if and when lawmakers in the British Parliament finally pass a plan. So far, they have been spectacularly unable to agree how to unpick the four decades of laws and regulations that bind them to Europe, three times rejecting May's deal and dismissing every alternative as well.
A longer extension is the outcome favored by European Council President Donald Tusk, the host of Wednesday's meeting, who wrote to E.U. leaders Tuesday urging them to offer ""a longer extension"" of ""no longer than one year.""
He also asked Europe's leaders not to make May and her team feel foolish during the talks.
""Neither side should be allowed to feel humiliated at any stage in this difficult process,"" Tusk wrote.

At a late-night meeting of E.U. ambassadors Wednesday, the French representative was ""not positive"" about allowing Britain to stay that long, another diplomat added.
All members at the summit are deeply concerned that Britain staying on as a temporary member might seek to disrupt the E.U. This is in response to British hard-line Brexit supporters who see any delay as a betrayal.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, a lawmaker with May's ruling Conservatives, tweeted last week that the U.K. ""should be as difficult as possible"" if it's forced to stay, including vetoing the E.U. budget and opposing any attempts at further integration within the political and economic bloc.
If a long extension leaves us stuck in the EU we should be as difficult as possible. We could veto any increase in the budget, obstruct the putative EU army and block Mr Macron’s integrationist schemes.
— Jacob Rees-Mogg (@Jacob_Rees_Mogg) April 5, 2019 In response, a draft document prepared ahead of the summit says that ""the extension cannot be allowed to undermine the regular functioning"" of the E.U.
The document, sent to NBC News by two E.U. diplomats, calls on the U.K. ""to act in a constructive and responsible manner throughout this unique period"" and asks for its ""sincere cooperation.""
France has reportedly asked for more concrete assurances, so whether this language will satisfy them is unclear.
Related World news What does it mean to be European in the Brexit era? We asked millennials It's not just the U.K. that would be impacted by a ""no-deal"" Brexit.
Netherlands, Belgium, and France would likely see immediate effects such as loss of trade and delays at their ports. And no member state will want to be seen as responsible for risking conflict on the Irish border.
That has led some to question whether France will actually hold out and veto a long extension.
""It's the usual game — good cop, bad cop,"" one of the E.U. diplomats said.

Barr says he thinks the government spied on the Trump campaign,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/barr-says-he-thinks-government-spied-trump-campaign-n992986,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr, defending his decision to order a review of the Trump-Russia probe's origins, told a Senate panel Wednesday that he thinks “spying did occur” by the U.S. government on ’s 2016 campaign. “For the same reason we’re worried about foreign influence in elections ... I think spying on a political campaign — it’s a big deal, it’s a big deal,” Barr said in response to a question from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the ranking member on the Senate Appropriations subcommittee, who had asked why he is looking into the origins of the investigation.
Attorney General Barr: FBI 'spying did occur' on 2016 Trump campaign April 10, 2019 00:49 Barr said that he grew up during the Vietnam War when there was spying on anti-war advocates by the U.S. government and that there were rules put in place to ensure there’s an adequate basis for such action.
“I’m not suggesting that those rules were violated, but I think it’s important to look at that. I’m not talking about the FBI necessarily, but intelligence agencies more broadly,” he said.
Shaheen then asked, “You’re not suggesting that spying occurred?”
Barr paused for several seconds and replied, “I think spying did occur,” though he didn’t elaborate.
He said that he’s not launching an investigation of the FBI and is not suggesting there is a problem that’s “endemic” to the agency, but “I think there was a failure among a group of leaders at the upper echelons.”
“I feel I have an obligation to make sure that government power isn’t abused,"" he added.
Later in the hearing, Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said that Barr's ""spying"" comment was ""unnecessarily inflammatory"" and offered the attorney general the chance to rephrase his remarks — because Schatz said ""the word spying could cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out.""
'I expected better': Lawmakers react to Barr claiming spying on Trump campaign April 11, 2019 02:42 ""I'm not sure of all the connotations of that word,"" Barr replied, adding that he could also describe it as ""unauthorized surveillance."" ""I want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance.""
Barr declined to elaborate when Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., chairman of the panel, asked what the basis was for his remarks.
""There is a basis for my concern, but I'm not going to discuss the basis,"" Barr said.
“I’m not saying if improper surveillance occurred,” he added later when asked to clarify — saying only that he was “concerned about it” and looking into the situation.
At a hearing Tuesday before a House Appropriations subcommittee, Barr revealed that he is ""reviewing the conduct"" of the FBI's Russia probe during the summer of 2016 , and that the Department of Justice inspector general will release a report on the agency's use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act process and other matters in the Russia case in May or June.
Trump on Wednesday praised Barr's revelation of the probe into the investigation of his campaign.
""What I'm most interested in is getting started, hopefully the attorney general, he mentioned it yesterday, he is doing a great job. Getting started on going back to the origins of exactly where this all started,"" he told reporters at the White House. ""Because this was an illegal witch hunt and everybody knew it.""
Trump: Russia probe was 'an attempted coup' April 10, 2019 01:36 The Senate hearing intended to focus on the 2020 budget request comes a day after House Democrats pressed the attorney general on the forthcoming release of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
Barr said Tuesday that his original timeline still stands, and that he planned to release the redacted document by mid-April, specifying that he expects it would come out “within a week” and that it will be released to the public.
On Wednesday, however, Barr implied it may not be released until next week.
""I'm landing the plane right now and I've been willing to discuss my letters and the process going forward, and the report is going to be out next week and I'm not going to go into the details until the plane is on the ground,"" he said when asked by Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., whether the White House or the president have already viewed the report or were briefed on the report.
He would not respond to questions from Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., about whether he had shared any additional information from the report with the White House, or whether administration officials had seen the full document.
Barr later clarified during the hearing that before his summary was sent out, “we did advise the White House counsel’s office that the letters were being sent” and while they weren’t given the document in advance, “it may have been read to them.”
Barr reiterated Wednesday before the Senate that after the redacted version of the Mueller report is released to the public, he's ""willing to work with the committees.""
""I intend to take up with the House and Senate Judiciary committees what other areas they feel they have a need to have access to the information and see if I can work to accommodate that,"" said Barr, who added that the most ""inflexible"" area under the law would be the grand jury material, suggesting he would not seek to disclose those parts to lawmakers.
Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., asked during the hearing whether ""there is material risk that the grand jury material would leak"" if such information is provided to Congress.
""I think so,"" Barr said, adding that that could also be the case with other redacted material.
Asked by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., whether he had a conversation with Mueller about why he didn't make a recommendation on the issue of obstruction of justice, Barr said, ""Yes, I did,"" and added that there would be a fuller explanation of that conversation in the report.
Barr added, while being questioned by Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., that he didn't know ""whether Bob Mueller supported my conclusion"" on obstruction.
The attorney general also declined to say whether he views the Mueller investigation as a ""witch hunt,"" or illegal, as Trump has characterized it.
""It really depends on where you're sitting,"" Barr said, adding that if someone is falsely accused of something, it could be viewed as a witch hunt. ""It is what it is.""
Asked Tuesday whether Mueller or anyone on his team reviewed his summary of the report in advance, Barr told the House panel that Mueller's team ""did not play a role"" in drafting that document and that he did give Mueller an opportunity to review it, but he ""declined.""
House Democrats had given Barr until April 2 to submit the full report to Congress, a deadline that was not met. In response, the House Judiciary Committee last week passed a resolution that authorizes Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., to issue a subpoena for the full, unredacted report. It has not yet been issued.

"Red Cross regains access to Venezuela jails, military prisons",www.nbcnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/red-cross-regains-access-venezuela-jails-military-prisons-n992981,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The International Committee of the Red Cross has regained access to prisons in Venezuela, including highly guarded military facilities where dozens of inmates considered political prisoners are being held, as President Nicolas Maduro seeks to counter mounting criticism of his government’s human rights record. The fact that the visits include military prisons, which hadn’t been previously reported, was confirmed to The Associated Press by a human rights lawyer and family members of those detained.
International Red Cross President Peter Maurer on Wednesday wraps up a five-day visit to Venezuela, where the Geneva-based group is among international organizations trying to carve out a space to deliver badly needed humanitarian aid and technical assistance free of the winner-take-all politics contributing to the country’s turmoil.
Red Cross representatives visit prisons every year in more than 100 countries, following an established protocol allowing it to verify conditions of confinement and hold private conversations with inmates in which they can voice complaints and send messages to loved ones.
But the group had been denied access in Venezuela at least since 2012.
Related News Venezuelan-Americans welcome Trump's tough talk. Republicans hope that will mean votes. The renewed visits in Venezuela began March 11 when a Red Cross delegation visited a model prison in Caracas, the Simon Bolivar Center for the Formation of New Men. Eighty-seven foreigners are being held.
But more significant was the visit two weeks later to the military-run Ramo Verde prison outside Caracas, which holds 69 people the opposition considers political prisoners.
Sandra Hernandez, whose husband, Sgt. Luis Figueroa, has been jailed at Ramo Verde since January for leading a military uprising against Maduro, was present last week when a white-colored vehicle emblazoned with the international Red Cross’ logo pulled up to the prison entrance.
She was there for her once-a-week visit, delivering basic staples — pasta, rice and cheese — that have become harder to afford since she was fired from her $7-a-month job as a teacher in what she said was retaliation for her husband’s opposition to the government.
She said that if not for remittances sent by a relative in Spain, her husband could starve on the scant rations provided by prison authorities.
While her husband told her he wasn’t among the small group of prisoners allowed to speak with the Red Cross representatives, she was hopeful the visit would help improve dire conditions for all inmates, many of whom she said are suffering from lack of medical attention and claim to have been tortured. The AP was unable to independently verify those claims.
“It’s very important they talk to prisoners and see firsthand what’s happening inside,” she said.
Red Cross officials declined to comment and the group has made little mention of the prison visits, saying only in a Tweet that it had begun visiting jails under the auspices of civilian penitentiary authorities. It made no mention of the visits to the military-run facilities. The organization commonly avoids describing such visits except in a “confidential dialogue” with officials
Prisons Minister Iris Varela has said the visit to the civilian facility, and others to come, were part of an effort to share with the world Venezuela’s positive experience rehabilitating inmates.
Left unsaid by both sides was that the Red Cross had also secured access to military detention facilities.
The majority of people held at the Ramo Verde are military personnel accused of plotting to overthrow Maduro. Many more, including five oil executives with U.S. passports, are being held in the basement jail of the military counterintelligence headquarters in the capital.
“This is an important first step, but make no mistake, it’s also an attempt by Maduro to gain legitimacy with the international community,” said Alfredo Romero, a human rights lawyer who was told of the Red Cross visit by prison workers when trying to visit clients at Ramo Verde. “It’s not in itself going to change the government’s willingness to improve conditions.”
Related News Venezuela's hospitals see rising death toll from blackouts A senior government official played down the significance of the Red Cross visits, describing them as part of a broader push to work more closely with several international agencies, including the World Food Program and the Pan American Health Organization. The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to lack of authorization to discuss those talks publicly.
The international Red Cross’ sister organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, recently said it had received a waiver from Maduro to deliver aid to some 650,000 people in Venezuela beginning this month. Maduro has long denied a humanitarian crisis, considering aid offers a “Trojan horse” to pave the way for a foreign military intervention.
Similarly, opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who is recognized by 50 nations as Venezuela’s rightful leader, has tried to control the distribution of U.S.-supplied aid in a bid to weaken Maduro’s grip on power.
In another attempt to counter growing criticism, Maduro last month welcomed a delegation sent by the United Nations’ High Commissioner for Human Rights. He previously had called such visits a politically biased threat to Venezuela’s sovereignty.

“fbi surveillance” – Google News: Attorney General Barr seems to embrace Republican talking points on Mueller Russia probe – NBCNews.com,www.nbcnews.com,mikenova,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/attorney-general-barr-seems-embrace-republican-talking-points-mueller-russia-n993021,"WASHINGTON — Attorney General William Barr on Wednesday appeared to embrace longtime GOP talking points about the Russia investigation when he raised questions about whether the FBI followed its own rules. At a Senate budget hearing, Barr — who expressed skepticism about special investigation before President Trump made him attorney general — endorsed a widespread GOP view that the investigation may have involved inappropriate surveillance of the Trump campaign. He said he would conduct a review of the matter.
"" I think spying did occur "" on Trump's campaign, Barr told a subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee. ""The question was whether it was adequately predicated.""
Barr said he hasn't concluded there was wrongdoing, but ""I need to explore that. I think it's my obligation. Congress is usually very concerned about intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies staying in their proper lane. I want to make sure that happened.""
He added, ""I have no specific evidence that I would cite right now, I do have some questions about it. I have concerns about various aspects of it.""
Barr added that he wasn't launching an investigation of the FBI, but said, ""I think there was probably a failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon."" He did not elaborate on who he believes failed and how.
Attorney General Barr to face more questions on Mueller report April 10, 2019 01:46 President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have long argued that the Russia investigation had its origins in a group of biased FBI leaders who bore animosity toward Trump, including then-Director James Comey and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Both men have denied that they acted out of any bias, saying there was a trail of evidence of Trump campaign contacts with Russians they would have been negligent not to follow.
Two FBI employees who played an early role in the investigation, Peter Strzrok and Lisa Page, did denounce Trump in text messages that later became public. Mueller removed them from the team when he learned of the texts.
In the end, Mueller's investigation found no criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, according to Barr's summary of its principal conclusions.
Barr's embrace of longtime GOP talking points casting doubt on the origins of the Russia investigation came shortly after Trump denounced the probe as ""an illegal investigation,"" ""crooked,"" ""an attempted coup,"" and ""treason.""
What does AG Barr mean by 'unauthorized surveillance?' April 10, 2019 01:18 Given a chance to distance himself from those comments by Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., Barr declined. ""I'll use my own adjectives,"" the attorney general said.
Barr's comments followed House testimony Tuesday in which he revealed that an inquiry by the Justice Department's Inspector General into aspects of the Russia inquiry was almost finished.
The inspector general, Michael Horowitz, has been looking into how the FBI obtained a warrant in October 2016 to monitor the communications of Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign who had traveled to Russia and had previously been the target of recruitment by Russian intelligence officers.
Horowitz's team has also asked witnesses about some of the informants the FBI used in the early stages of the investigation, including a Cambridge professor, Stefan Halper, The New York Times reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the inquiry.
Attorney General Barr plans to release Mueller report 'within a week' April 9, 2019 01:36 Republicans have raised questions about the Page warrant because they say it relied on information from a dossier by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer who was conducting opposition research paid for by Democrats. They also question the role of Halper, who had contracts with the Pentagon and longstanding relationships with British and American intelligence agencies.
Barr took pains to say he wasn't questioning the actions of the FBI as a whole.
""I don't like to hear attacks about the FBI because I think the FBI is an outstanding organization and I think Chris Wray is a great partner for me,"" he said, referring to the current FBI director. ""I feel I have an obligation to make sure that government power is not abused. I think that's one of the principal roles of the attorney general.""
Barr said he hasn't set up a review team yet, ""but I have in mind having some colleagues help me pull all this information together and letting me know whether there are some areas that should be looked at.""

“I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand, that if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me,” Buttigieg said in the speech. “Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.”
Buttigieg's speech, which was delivered at an event hosted by the LGBTQ Victory Fund, garnered national attention due, in part, to his frank openness about his struggle with his sexual orientation.
On Monday, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, reprised his critique of Pence.
“Just because you are LGBTQ doesn't mean it's OK to discriminate against you,” he told reporters in Las Vegas. “I think most people get that, I think most Christians get that, and it's time for us to move on toward a more inclusive and more humane vision of faith than what this vice president represent.""

“People will often be polite to you in person, while advancing policies that harm you and your family. You will be polite to them in turn, but you need not stand for such harms,” Buttigieg tweeted Tuesday. “Instead, you push back, honestly and emphatically. So it goes, in the public square.”

Sanders unveiled a new 'Medicare For All' bill. Allies wonder how he'll get it passed. Progressive activists are calling on candidates to explain how they will keep their promises. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, introduces the Medicare for All Act of 2019 on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. Manuel Balce Ceneta / AP Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 10, 2019, 5:10 PM GMT / Updated April 10, 2019, 11:47 PM GMT By Benjy Sarlin WASHINGTON — Sen. Bernie Sanders unveiled the latest version of his ""Medicare For All"" bill on Wednesday — but a split in the field of Democratic presidential contenders over how to pass it is giving rivals a rare chance to outflank him on the left. Sanders' legislation is broadly similar to prior versions: It would effectively replace all insurance with a more generous version of Medicare that covers every American with no copayments or deductibles. The updated bill adds new benefits for long-term care to help seniors remain in their homes and communities. ""We are going to end the international embarrassment of the United States of America, our great country, being the only major nation on earth not to guarantee health care to all as a right,"" Sanders said at a press conference. The Sanders bill is the definitive leftmost position on health care for 2020. Several presidential rivals, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris are among 14 senators co-sponsoring it, but their campaigns have largely pivoted toward discussing more incremental plans that preserve private insurance. Medicare-for-All: What it could mean for U.S. health care system Feb. 18, 2019 07:31 Gillibrand joined Sanders at the podium on Wednesday, but used her remarks to talk up her proposal to let customers buy into Medicare and then ""dare any insurance company to just try to compete."" In the Sanders bill, these insurers would be banned from offering similar coverage within four years. As candidates promise ambitious new policy ideas, though, progressive activists are also grilling them over whether they have a plan to get their proposals past GOP opposition in Congress and conservative justices on the Supreme Court. Warren has seized on the issue by calling for an end to the filibuster, the Senate rule requiring 60 votes to pass a bill if a member objects. Republicans currently control the Senate and election analysts give Democrats, at best, a shot at winning a slim majority in 2020. ""We're fighting for big, structural change — but we won't get anything done unless we face this head on,"" Warren tweeted. That was a contrast to Sanders, who to that point had taken a bold approach to policy, but a more measured one when it came to legislative procedure. Sanders has suggested he favors ""filibuster reform"" but sounded skeptical in an interview with Huffpost over the weekend about proposals to abolish it. He noted that President Donald Trump favored eliminating the filibuster, which should make Democrats ""a little bit nervous,"" and that ""you have to protect minority rights” in the Senate. ""I don’t think you can just simply shove everything through,"" Sanders said. ""There's an argument for that, by the way, but that's not where I am right now."" Those comments drew criticism from progressive circles where his policy ideas are often best received. ""It's befuddling that Bernie doesn't have a stronger position on filibuster reform considering how much he criticized the GOP's use of the filibuster for blocking Democratic legislation in 2013,"" Waleed Shahid, communications director for Justice Democrats, told NBC News. ""Maybe he just thinks this is an arcane issue that the vast majority of voters don't understand or care about,"" Shahid added, ""but I think he can use his platform to explain to people why a political revolution also requires major structural reforms of our democracy."" Looking to address these concerns, Sanders released a statement on Wednesday afternoon detailing a path to passage that involved first rallying supporters to pressure Democrats into supporting his plan and then using potential hardball procedural tactics to pass it with a bare majority. Sanders suggested making it harder for Senators to filibuster, while not quite calling for its abolition. But he also indicated that ending the filibuster would be unnecessary, as he could pass his agenda through budget ""reconciliation,"" a procedure that requires a simple majority. But reconciliation comes with constraints. Budget experts interviewed by NBC News were split on how much of Sanders' agenda might pass given these obstacles. While expanding health care and raising taxes seem achievable to some degree, the bigger and more complex the proposal, the greater the risk that a crucial component might be stripped that undermines the whole package. In his statement, though, Sanders suggested a way to ensure that a Medicare For All bill made it past the Senate parliamentarian, who advises members on whether legislation violates the rules. He would instruct his vice president, who would preside over the senate, to overrule the parliamentarian's advice if it conflicted with his plan. ""I can tell you that a vice president in a Bernie Sanders administration will determine that Medicare for All can pass through the Senate under reconciliation and is not in violation of the rules,"" he said. It's an idea that's been floated before: Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, suggested Vice President Mike Pence use the same method to repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act. The idea was rejected, however, and it could have far-reaching implications for how the Senate functions if ever implemented. Other candidates have set aside procedural concerns to argue voters should grill candidates more on what policies they'll pursue if they lack the votes for Medicare for All. ""I think the best way to do it would be design a Medicare for All system,"" Booker, who also opposes ending the filibuster, said in an interview with WCBS 880 on Wednesday, ""but anybody who says those words, 'Medicare For All,' who’s running for president, the next thing out of their mouth should be talking to people about well, if we have 50 (votes), If we’re a split Congress, what are you gonna actually do in your first year to make health care more accessible and affordable?"" On the right and center-left, critics challenged the new Sanders bill over its cost — $32 trillion over 10 years, according to one estimate by the conservative Mercatus Center — and its elimination of existing private plans. Republicans have made single-payer health care an early focus of attacks heading into the 2020 election. ""Self-proclaimed socialist Senator Bernie Sanders is proposing a total government takeover of healthcare that would actually hurt seniors, eliminate private health insurance for 180 million Americans, and cripple our economy and future generations with unprecedented debt,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. Americans spend far more per person on health care than other developed countries, and Sanders has argued his plan will save money by reducing overhead and provider payments and negotiating lower drug prices. He has not specified how he would pay for his plan, but offered a menu of possible options on Wednesday, including a 4 percent payroll tax on workers and 7.5 percent tax on employers, higher estate and income taxes on the rich, and new fees on large banks. Health care industry groups, who have launched a campaign to defeat Medicare for All, argue that cutting reimbursements could affect quality of care, potentially making it harder to recruit doctors and specialists and to keep hospitals open.

But being the focus of Fox and other conservative outlets has elevated her agenda. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., prepares to speak at the National Action Network's annual convention in New York on April 5, 2019. Spencer Platt / Getty Images Get the Think newsletter. April 10, 2019, 3:28 PM GMT By Matt Laslo Want in on a little secret? Newly minted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez isn’t that powerful: The New York Democrat’s just one out of a freshmen class of 101 members in a chamber of 435. She doesn't chair a committee, she can’t single-handedly pass legislation, let alone drive her party’s entire agenda, and her word is far from law. But that might be breaking news to anyone who regularly consumes information from the conservative politicians and talking heads who parade misinformation about in the world of conservative media — where she is all anyone can talk about. And their relentless focus on a minor member, combined with the constant raising of the specter of “socialism,” has completely backfired and turned Ocasio-Cortez into one of the most recognizable members of Congress and a super hero of the progressive left with powers that far outpace her actual rank on Capitol Hill. (She also continues to poll extremely positive among voters in her home of New York City , despite headlines about her supposed unpopularity in nationwide polls.) Related Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is right about corruption in Congress Backbench lawmakers — on both the right and the left — regularly use social media and the press (when they can get any) to drive either their policy or personal agendas outside of the confines of the nation’s entrenched two-party structure. But Capitol Hill itself still moves at a glacial pace and largely remains entrenched in tradition, and freshmen lawmakers are the lowest in seniority so they’re naturally mostly powerless by design. Still, in many ways, the juggernauts of conservative media have turned the 29-year old Ocasio-Cortez into a power broker well ahead of her years and despite her lack of seniority. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who prided himself on refusing to hold votes on President Obama's agenda and nominations, recently held a vote on the congressional newbie’s climate agenda. Not because the leader, who hails from coal country, supports the Green New Deal, but because he wanted to try to embarrass the many Senate Democrats vying for the White House — a group of powerful and accomplished lawmakers whom the progressive wing of the party is pressuring to embrace Ocasio-Cortez’s sweeping measure. Related AOC is a perfect role model for millennials — but not for what she does behind the keyboard And her impact has gone beyond the Senate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi — who’s still just starting her second historic act as House Speaker — has been forced to respond to numerous questions about Ocasio-Cortez’s actions (like when she encouraged protestors holding a sit-in in Pelosi’s office ) and her green agenda . And Ocasio-Cortez has been praised by many for producing what was largely seen as the most newsworthy moment in the bitterly partisan marathon testimony of former Trump lawyer and ""fixer"" Michael Cohen. She calmly and methodically pressed Cohen for specifics as to how Congress could prove his allegations that Trump lied about the values of his properties in order to skimp on his annual tax obligation — which got Cohen to say that lawmakers could prove or disprove his claims by looking at Trump’s yet-to-be-released tax returns. Related AOC and Cohen remind Trump that Mueller isn't the only investigator he needs to worry about In less than five minutes with the witness, Ocasio-Cortez helped bolster her entire party’s case to review Trump’s tax returns; that work is ongoing. Still,because of her lack of seniority she had to wait until nearly the end of the first round of questions to press the witness for answers to the questions millions had been longing to hear. Still, conservatives persist in portraying her as powerful beyond belief, capable of wreaking havoc on everything they hold dear. Take February's Conservative Political Action Conference, which used to be focused on reigning in the debt and deficit . This year conservative thought leaders focused much of their attention on and aimed their ire at Ocasio-Cortez — or at least at the papier-mâché likeness of her they’ve erected — instead of the hammering the much more powerful Pelosi or any of a variety of presidential contenders. For instance, the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. taunted AOC’s Green New Deal by repeating apopular, yet incorrect, impression of the Green New Deal: That she's trying to take away people's hamburgers. “I’ve got 100 cows — you just let Alexandria Cortez [sic] show up at my cows and try to take my cows away,” Falwell Jr. told the crowd. “I love cows, Jerry,” Trump Jr. replied. “They’re delicious.” Here’s what the proposal actually states about meat: “Working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible."" That's a far cry from banning cattle, yet lawmakers are doing photo-ops stuffing their faces with burgers . Related Democratic socialism derangement syndrome? Why hysteria about the rise of the progressive left misses the mark Other caricatures the right (and alt-right) keep painting of Ocasio-Cortez don’t seem to mesh with reality either, while their visceral dismissal of Ocasio-Cortez has brought accusations of sexism . Ocasio-Cortez may be young (she’s not even old enough to run for president in 2020), she may make mistakes (who doesn’t) and she may still be learning the ropes of Capitol Hill (I’ve worked here for 12 years and I still get lost in the sprawling complex), but she’s now the talk of the town. One could even call her a titan, because lawmakers twice her age and at least one who has now served 44 years longer than her (Republican Don Young of Alaska) are now forced to react to her ideas rather than ignore them as generations of lawmakers have ignored freshmen before her. In this slow-moving, even stale capital city, that’s a revolution in and of its own.

The blast caused a building to partially collapse and sparked a fire, which officials said had been contained. Dominion Energy said in a statement that a contractor, who was not its employee and was not working on behalf of the utility, was doing excavation work and dug into a natural gas pipeline before the explosion. Glenn said the contractor was boring under the sidewalk and hit a 2-inch gas line.

Officials said everyone who was inside the building where the explosion occurred has been accounted for, but that crews are still working to maneuver through debris, NBC affiliate WRAL of Raleigh reported . Phill Grosshans told WRAL that he was walking in the downtown, moments before the explosion, when he heard a ""gigantic blast"" and was almost knocked to the ground.

April 10, 2019, 2:29 PM GMT By Erik Ortiz The early involvement of federal authorities to help investigate a string of ""suspicious"" blazes that swallowed three black churches in Louisiana is vital during a time when hate crimes in the country are on the rise, historians and academics say. And after a major fire burned down a social justice center in Tennessee less than two weeks ago — and led investigators to anti-Semitic graffiti — civil rights groups say it's even more urgent for officials to react swiftly. ""What is happening in Tennessee and Louisiana is domestic terrorism and we must not turn a blind eye to any incident where people are targeted because of the color of their skin or their faith,"" Derrick Johnson, the president and CEO of the NAACP, said in a statement. Related Graffiti found after fire at justice center is anti-Semitic symbol About 200 people, including from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, are examining the latest cases in Louisiana to help determine whether the fires were intentionally set and may have been motivated by racism or extremism. Following the third fire last week, State Fire Marshal Butch Browning told reporters that investigators have identified ""suspicious elements"" in each case and ""we do believe that crimes have occurred."" All three churches were in St. Landry Parish, north of Lafayette, and were historically black. The first fire was reported on March 26 at St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre; the second on April 2 at the Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas; and the third last Thursday at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, also in Opelousas and founded in the 19th century. ""There is clearly something happening in this community,"" Browning said in a statement. The charred foundation of St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre, Louisiana, following an early-morning fire on March 26, 2019. Natalie Obregon / NBC News The churches were empty at the time of the fires, officials said, and each suffered considerable damage, forcing worshippers to hold Sunday services at other locations. (A fourth fire last weekend at a church with a predominantly white congregation in another parish 200 miles away doesn't appear to be connected, authorities have said.) St. Landry Parish, with a population of more than 83,000, is about 56 percent white and 42 percent black, census data shows . Police in the parish have told pastors at other black churches that they will step up safety patrols. Christopher Strain, who studied the wave of black church burnings of the 1990s in his book, ""Burning Faith: Church Arson in the American South,"" said that church arsons linked to hate crimes tend to spike alongside the general rise in hate crimes. In Louisiana, ""investigators have deemed these fires 'suspicious' and they certainly are: it's hard to see three such incidents in a limited geographic area in a short amount of time as coincidental,"" Strain, a professor of American studies at Florida Atlantic University, said in an email. ""Whether the targets are churches, synagogues, mosques, or other sacred spaces, arson is a well-worn tool in the white supremacist's toolbox,"" he added, ""and it would not be surprising if investigators determined that these fires were hate-based or racially motivated."" Related 'Blackness isn't safe, anywhere': How the church burnings in Louisiana send a dangerous message Jack Levin, a professor emeritus at Northeastern University in Boston and co-director of the Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict, said that given the legacy of racial strife in the South and how black houses of worship were targeted during the civil rights movement, authorities can't ignore a hate crime motivation. ""We've seen hate crimes on the rise and the number of organized hate groups growing in this country over the last several years,"" Levin said. ""It's much more likely now that three black churches victimized by unknown perpetrators would be hate crimes and possibly the work of members of organized groups."" The FBI last fall reported a more than 17 percent rise in hate crimes across the country in 2017 from 2016 — the third consecutive year the numbers have increased. In February, the Southern Poverty Law Center found hate groups increased by 30 percent in the past four years, reaching an all-time high. The ATF, which tracks how houses of worship in the U.S. are targeted, found the majority of the more than 240 incidents in 2017 involved a Christian denomination and were categorized as ""incendiary,"" involving some type of accelerant or device. Of those incendiary fires, only one was motivated by ""extremism,"" according to a U.S. Bomb Data Center report. Investigators cited ""revenge"" or ""vandalism"" in other cases. In the majority of the fires, however, the motivation was either not reported or not known. In June 2015, a spate of fires damaged or destroyed several predominantly black churches in the South — coming on the heels of a white supremacist's massacre of nine people at a historically black church in Charleston, South Carolina. But investigations of those fires later determined they were either unintentionally set, caused by lightning, or if there was evidence of arson, there was no indication it was motivated by racial bias. Still, these latest fires in Louisiana can be unnerving for churchgoers because they conjure up images of past bombings and attacks. In 1964 alone, the Ku Klux Klan burned 31 mostly-black churches in Mississippi, Strain said. ""Church burnings, whether accidental or deliberate, are enormous traumas for congregations,"" he added. ""These are houses of worship, where people pray and give thanks and become baptized and get married, places full of memories that are important to individuals, to families, and to communities."" Kenneth Robinson, pastor of The Creek Church in Charlotte, North Carolina — one of the black churches damaged in June 2015 — can't shake the helplessness he felt when he saw his already struggling church consumed in flames. Fire destroys the predominantly black Briar Creek Road Baptist Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, on June 24, 2015. Charlotte Fire The congregation was forced to rebuild and the church rebranded itself following $250,000 worth of damages. (Before the fire, it was known as Briar Creek Baptist Church.) Authorities have treated the case as arson, although they have not located a suspect or determined it was linked to a hate crime. It remains an open investigation. Robinson, a third-generation minister, said Tuesday that even though no suspect has been caught, he learned a powerful lesson — one that has solidified his faith. ""We forgive the people that did it,"" he said. ""You can't harbor hate. Even though this was afflicted on us and has affected us tremendously, financially and emotionally, we have to forgive.""

Federico A. de Jesús: Trump's lies about Puerto Rico aren't just cruel — they're preventing disaster relief,www.nbcnews.com,Federico A. de Jesús,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-lies-about-puerto-rico-aren-t-just-cruel-ncna992576," has spent the last few weeks lying about Puerto Rico . This is to say nothing of the president’s behavior towards the island while in office. His infamous insults to the people of Puerto Rico over the past two years are well recorded — throwing paper towels at survivors, saying that the hurricane that devastated the Commonwealth was throwing the federal budget “a little out of whack,” complaining that Puerto Ricans “want everything done for them,” among other precious gems . Unfortunately, the president's bold face lies and recalcitrance against the island’s unmet needs are now holding up a bill that would fund critical disaster relief for several states and Puerto Rico. The president's bold face lies and recalcitrance against the island’s unmet needs are now holding up a bill that would fund critical disaster relief for several states and Puerto Rico.
Here are the facts. Trump continues to falsely insist that Puerto Rico has received $91 billion in hurricane assistance funding. Even though FEMA and all independent experts agree that nowhere near that has even been appropriated by Congress ( $41 billion has been approved , with only a fraction having been sent to the island), administration officials claim that the $91 billion is the amount that the federal government “expects” Puerto Rico will need over the next 50 years. That is like an insurance company telling the victim of a car crash it has paid the largest insurance claim in history — but instead of referring to the amount of money that has actually been approved for the specific claim, it announces an estimate the company expects will be needed in further car repairs for the next 50 years. It makes absolutely no sense.
Beyond Trump’s lies, the big question for Senate Republicans now is how long will they continue to enable the president as he attempts to throw a particular set of disaster victims under the bus. Make no mistake, neither the president nor Congress can be allowed to pick winners and losers after natural disasters. Today it’s Puerto Rico, but tomorrow it might be California — or anywhere. We need a fully funded emergency spending bill to help everyone in all U.S. jurisdictions affected by natural disasters. That is supposed to be the American way and nothing short of this is acceptable.
Trump lashes out at Puerto Rico again April 2, 2019 06:04 The president continues to insist — and Senate Republicans so far seem to agree — that he does not want “one more dollar” to go to the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico. That cruelty and punishment is immoral. It’s divorced from the scale of devastation Hurricane Maria caused and the economic hamstrings long imposed on the island.
And it makes no sense when we all know that it has taken years to recover from disasters like Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy . In fact, in 2007 , two years after Katrina, Congress passed Public Law 110-28 , which included an extension of the cost share waivers to Gulf Coast states impacted by Hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, Dennis and Rita. Puerto Rico, which faced two back-to-back category 5 hurricanes in 2017 , deserves no less.
Related Opinion Hurricane Maria, one year later: Why I had to leave Puerto Rico, and why I still struggle with that decision I wish the president could look into Myrna Izquierdo ’s eyes and tell her that no more funding is needed. Izquierdo runs a clinic for HIV-positive elderly patients in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico and she recently had to order nurses to reuse soiled adult diapers because the clinic depends on funding that expired earlier in March. This in turn has left 1.3 million Puerto Ricans struggling to pay for food and other basic staples.
Or take the case of Amadita Jiménez Gutiérrez , who started to lose her emergency nutritional assistance in March, losing $200 a month, who now tells the Washington Post that she will “eat less” because of the funding cuts. Can you imagine the president of the United States telling Amadita that she doesn’t need these funds? Since when is putting food on the table — especially after the hurricane that caused the longest electricity blackout in modern U.S. history — “excessive and unnecessary,” as the Trump administration recently stated ? A more relevant and time-sensitive question is, why are Senate Republicans tolerating this punishment?
Since when is putting food on the table — especially after the hurricane that caused the longest electricity blackout in modern U.S. history — “excessive and unnecessary?""
The slow and inefficient federal response to the twin hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico in 2017 showed that boricuas can pull themselves up by their own bootstraps . When the local government and FEMA were absent, neighbors helped neighbors to subsist, rebuild and survive. However, to truly recover and rebuild Puerto Rico, the federal government needs to fulfill its duty and help U.S. citizens in need. We need to create a Marshall Plan and provide Puerto Ricans with badly needed economic tools and policies to make the island more resilient and self-reliant. We are not begging for aid; we are demanding that the federal government meets its responsibility. After all, it is important to remember that Hurricane Maria exacerbated an already simmering financial and economic crisis that was due in large part to misguided federal policies towards the island that in turn helped to cause the human-made part of this perfect storm.
If the insults, delays in the funding of life-saving programs, and other games continue to be played with the people of Puerto Rico, the five-million strong Puerto Rican diaspora in the U.S. will remember at the ballot box."
Nipsey Hussle's mother shares heartfelt message in wake of his death,www.nbcnews.com,Janelle Griffith,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/nipsey-hussle-s-mother-shares-heartfelt-message-wake-his-death-n993031,"Rapper Nipsey Hussle's mother shared words of encouragement with those mourning the death of her son. In an almost nine-minute video posted on Facebook on Tuesday, Angelique Smith said death is not something to be feared and described how Hussle, whose real name was Ermias Asghedom, looked after he was fatally shot outside his clothing store Marathon Clothing , in Los Angeles on March 31.
""I have strength, and I want to lift you up,"" Smith said. ""Please do not stay down, do not stay stuck, do not mourn. Because Nipsey is great. And now he's even greater because he has no bounds and no limits. His energy is everywhere. He's there with you now and he's here with me now. And please be encouraged.""
Smith said her son, who was a community advocate for his native South Los Angeles and renowned for his kindness , appeared beautiful and peaceful after his death.
“When you walk this earth and you do good deeds for people and you are loving and kind, those are the things that will show on your face — you will look more beautiful,"" Smith said. ""Ermias looked healthy, he looked clean, he had a glow.""
She continued: ""He did not look scary. He did not look like he was shot. None of the trauma … the way that he left this earth, none of that showed on his face. He looked like a radiant, clean, beautiful light being. Nothing negative.""
Eric Ronald Holder, Jr., was charged last week and pleaded not guilty in the shooting death of Hussle, 33, that left two others wounded. Hussle died from gunshot wounds to his head and torso, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner said.
A memorial will be held for the Grammy-nominated rapper on Thursday at the Staples Center in Los Angeles .

SUBSCRIBE April 10, 2019, 3:51 PM GMT By Minyvonne Burke and Associated Press The trial of a Florida man accused of killing his wife almost three decades ago began this week with the man's now-adult son describing how he found his mother's bones buried in the backyard of their family home. ""I picked up the coconut object and it ended up being the top part of her skull … we looked back in the hole and saw teeth,"" Aaron Fraser told the court during opening statements Tuesday, according to First Coast News . Fraser's mother, Bonnie Haim, disappeared from their Jacksonville home in January 1993. Her remains weren't discovered until 2014 when Fraser was doing renovations on his childhood house. His father, Michael Haim, was arrested in 2015 and is on trial for the murder. Fraser is a key witness in the case. As a 3-year-old at the time of his mother's disappearance, he told a child welfare worker, ""Daddy hurt mommy,"" or something similar, according to detectives. Michael Haim, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. ""Aaron also stated that 'Daddy shot Mommy,' 'Daddy placed Mommy in timeout,' and 'My daddy could not wake her up,'"" a 2015 arrest affidavit said. Brenda Medders was the child welfare worker who spoke to Fraser at the time of his mother's disappearance. She testified Tuesday during a cross-examination that she did not ask the child if he had been coached or knew right from wrong because of his young age, News 4 Jax reports. ""What I was trying to do is gather as many facts as I could, which he gave me many,"" she said. While Michael Haim remained a suspect, detectives had trouble building a case without a body. There wasn't a break in the investigation until 21 years after Bonnie Haim's disappearance when Fraser discovered his mother's skeletal remains while making repairs to the family home, according to detectives with the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office. He had won the house as part of a wrongful death lawsuit against his father. A water leak required Fraser to remove a concrete slab underneath which he found the remains. DNA tests confirmed the remains were those of Bonnie Haim and a medical examiner concluded she died from a homicide ""by unspecified means,"" according to the affidavit. A spent shell casing found where she was buried was the same type of caliber as a rifle that Michael Haim owned, the affidavit said. According to the affidavit, Michael Haim was abusive to his wife and she had made plans to move into an apartment with their son while he was away on a trip. She had secretly opened a bank account and when her husband found out about it and made her close it, she started giving money to a trusted friend to hold for her. Michael Haim, 52, who had moved to North Carolina by the time of his arrest in 2015, claimed his wife left their home without their son late one night in January 1993 after they had an argument about their marital problems. He also said he went searching for his wife, although he didn't notify law enforcement about her disappearance. The disappearance wasn't reported to law enforcement until a maintenance worker found her purse in a hotel dumpster and called police. ""Michael Haim was the last known individual to have contact with victim,"" the arrest affidavit said. ""The suspect admits that he and the victim were fighting over marital issues and that she was planning to leave and take their child."" The trial continued Wednesday in a Florida court.

New human species discovered in Philippines cave,www.nbcnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/new-human-species-discovered-philippine-cave-ncna993061,"Fossil bones and teeth found in the Philippines have revealed a long-lost cousin of modern people, which evidently lived around the time our own species was spreading from Africa to occupy the rest of the world. It’s yet another reminder that, although Homo sapiens are now the only surviving members of our branch of the evolutionary tree, we’ve had company for most of our existence.
And it makes our understanding of human evolution in Asia “messier, more complicated and whole lot more interesting,” says one expert, Matthew Tocheri of Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ontario.
In a study released Wednesday by the journal Nature, scientists describe the cache of seven teeth and six bones from the feet, hands and thigh of at least three members of the species. They were recovered from Callao Cave on the island of Luzon in the northern Philippines in 2007, 2011 and 2015. Tests on two samples show minimum ages of 50,000 years and 67,000 years.
Right upper teeth of an individual of the newly identified species Homo luzonensis, found in Callao Cave in the Philippines. Callao Cave Archaeology Project / Reuters The main exodus of our own species from Africa that all of today’s non-African people are descended from took place around 60,000 years ago.
An analysis of the bones from Luzon led the study authors to conclude they belonged to a previously unknown member of our “Homo” branch of the family tree. One of the toe bones and the overall pattern of tooth shapes and sizes differ from what’s been seen before in the Homo family, the researchers said.
They dubbed the creature Homo luzonensis.
 Climate change could affect human evolution. Here's how. It apparently used stone tools and its small teeth suggest it might have been rather small-bodied, said one of the study authors, Florent Detroit of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris.
H. luzonensis lived in eastern Asia at around the same time as not only our species but also other members of the Homo branch, including Neanderthals, their little-understood Siberian cousins the Denisovans, and the diminutive “hobbits” of the island of Flores in Indonesia.
There’s no sign that H. luzonensis encountered any other member of the Homo group, Detroit said in an email. Our species isn’t known to have reached the Philippines until thousands of years after the age of the bones, he said.
But some human relative was on Luzon more than 700,000 years ago, as indicated by the presence of stone tools and a butchered rhinoceros dating to that time, he said. It might have been the newfound species or an ancestor of it, he said in an email.
Detroit said it’s not clear how H. luzonensis is related to other Homo species. He speculated that it might have descended from an earlier human relative, Homo erectus, that somehow crossed the sea to Luzon.
H. erectus is generally considered the first Homo species to have expanded beyond Africa, and it plays a prominent role in the conventional wisdom about evolution outside that continent. Some scientists have suggested that the hobbits on the Indonesian island descended from H. erectus.
The first chamber of Callao Cave where fossils of newly identified hominin species Homo luzonensis were discovered on Luzon Island, in the Philippines, on April 10, 2019. Callao Cave Archaeology Project / Reuters Tocheri, who did not participate in the new report, agreed that both H. luzonensis and the hobbits may have descended from H. erectus. But he said the Philippines discovery gives new credence to an alternate view: Maybe some unknown creature other than H. erectus also slipped out of Africa and into Europe and Asia, and later gave rise to both island species.
After all, he said in an interview, remains of the hobbits and H. luzonensis show a mix of primitive and more modern traits that differ from what’s seen in H. erectus. They look more like what one what might find in Africa 1.5 million to 2.5 million years ago, and which might have been carried out of that continent by the mystery species, he said.
The discovery of the new human relative on Luzon might be “smoke from a much, much bigger fire,” he said.
Michael Petraglia of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, said the Luzon find “shows we still know very little about human evolution, particularly in Asia.”
More such discoveries will probably emerge with further work in the region, which is understudied, he said in an email.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Mnuchin are negotiating with Chinese representatives to work up a long-term trade deal with China. The world’s two largest economies have imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods, and President Donald Trump has threatened to extend the duties if the trade dispute can’t be resolved.

Facebook's battle against disinformation adds a new weapon — the 'click gap',www.nbcnews.com,David Ingram,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-s-battle-against-disinformation-adds-new-weapon-click-gap-n993126,"MENLO PARK, Calif. — Facebook on Wednesday announced a series of initiatives to limit the spread of “problematic” content such as disinformation and extremism, but said the onus would remain on algorithms and users to discover that content. Most notable among the initiatives is the use of what the company calls a “click-gap” signal, which will down-rank links to purported news articles that are receiving large amounts of traffic from Facebook but aren’t linked to other parts of the web.
Facebook says it hopes that the new signal will decrease the prevalence of “low-quality content,” like disinformation and clickbait.
Tessa Lyons, head of news feed integrity at Facebook, said the company's research has shown that where web traffic comes from is a sign of how authoritative a site is. Search engines use similar signs to determine the quality of websites.
""We think that it will help us to fight low-quality content that people don’t want to see,"" she said of the change.
Facebook convened about two dozen journalists at its headquarters to explain the changes and issued a press release outlining the larger initiatives.
Facebook’s initiative to tailor the service around smaller communities, like its ""Groups"" and messaging features, announced in March , has been the subject of scrutiny due to the spread of disinformation around various topics including vaccines and conspiracy theories. Groups that spread disinformation were found to have expanded their reach out of sight of public scrutiny.
The company said its changes would also help in “reducing the reach of Groups that repeatedly share misinformation.”
Facebook did not announce a fundamental change in how to find violations of its policies. The social network's strategy has two parts: violations reported by users, and violations found by the company's artificial intelligence-driven software.
There are some exceptions where Facebook employees proactively look for violations, Andrea Saul, a company spokeswoman, said. Those exceptions include when security staff is investigating a terrorist network and wants to see how wide its reach is, and when Facebook wants to measure how much harmful content they're missing.
Karen Courington, a member of Facebook's product support operations team, said it would be impractical to have people proactively hunt for content violations considering the network's worldwide reach. The company said it now employs 30,000 people on its content moderation team.
""The challenge is the scale at which we’re operating,"" she said.
Courington said it's also hard for company employees to moderate content from countries they are unfamiliar with.
""There are areas where we need the cultural context,"" she said.
Still, Facebook said the large number of small changes it has made to its algorithms add up to a big difference in the content that shows up in its feeds.
""The last few years at Facebook have been a philosophical shift in how we think about responsibility,"" Guy Rosen, Facebook’s VP of site integrity, said.
The company also said it had made headway in reducing the overall amount of misinformation on its platform.
""Since the United States presidential elections in 2016, there’s been a marked decrease in the amount of misinformation on the Facebook platform,"" Henry Silverman, a Facebook operations specialist who works on reducing the spread of false news stories, said.
The company also announced that it will deploy a “clear history” feature, which will allow users to wipe their accounts clean of both content posted on the service and the ad preferences the company has accumulated on that user over the lifetime of the account.
The feature was first announced in May 2018 , but has been delayed. Rosen said launching the feature has taken so long because the company has been re-engineering how data is processed.
""We’re working toward launching this in the fall,” he said. “We want to be sure we’re launching this right.”
Facebook said it is getting better at using software to automatically detect hate speech, finding 52 percent of it proactively in the third quarter of 2018, up from 24 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Amazon employees push for company to 'be a climate leader' to combat global warming,www.nbcnews.com,Jason Abbruzzese,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/amazon-employees-push-company-be-climate-leader-combat-global-warming-n993076,"More than 3,500 Amazon employees have signed a letter urging the e-commerce giant to take action on climate change, adding to growing activism by technology workers directed at their companies. The letter , published Wednesday on the blogging platform Medium, calls for Amazon to publicly detail how it plans to handle disruption brought on by climate change and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.
The letter, first reported by The New York Times , is attributed to a group called Amazon Employees for Climate Justice.
""Amazon has the resources and scale to spark the world’s imagination and redefine what is possible and necessary to address the climate crisis. We believe this is a historic opportunity for Amazon to stand with employees and signal to the world that we’re ready to be a climate leader,"" the group wrote.
A smaller group of Amazon employees and shareholders made a similar call in December .
An Amazon spokesperson pointed to the company's climate initiatives including a plan called ""shipment zero"" that aims for all of the company's shipments to have a net-zero carbon footprint. The company projects that it will have achieved that goal with 50 percent of its shipments by 2030.
""Amazon’s sustainability team is using a science-based approach to develop data and strategies to ensure a rigorous approach to our sustainability work,"" the company said in a statement. ""We have launched several major and impactful programs and are working hard to integrate this approach fully across Amazon.""
We stand in solidarity with the thousands of Amazon workers demanding bold action on climate change. We are grateful for their bravery. In signing this letter, they are taking a risk to ensure a livable future for all of us. https://t.co/8ZP0eVefnu
— Google Walkout For Real Change (@GoogleWalkout) April 10, 2019 The employees' letter takes a hard look at Amazon's current climate impact, noting that the company lacks a plan to reach zero carbon emissions, works with oil and gas companies, and donates to politicians who deny climate change.
""In our mission to become 'Earth’s most customer-centric company,' we believe our climate impact must be a top consideration in everything we do,"" the group wrote.
In recent months, many employees in the tech field have publicly called for changes in their industry and their particular companies. At Google, an employee walkout pushed the company to change how it handles sexual harassment complaints. Google and other tech companies have since stopped forcing employees to have such complaints handled only behind closed doors.
Government contracts have also become the source of employee protests at Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce.

Brain scan on living NFL players detects abnormal proteins found in CTE,www.nbcnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/brain-scan-living-nfl-players-detects-abnormal-proteins-found-cte-n993086,"An experimental brain scan can now detect abnormal proteins in the brains of living former NFL players affected by chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The study, conducted by a team of researchers in Boston and Arizona, used positron emission tomography scans in a small group of former NFL players with persistent cognitive, mood and behavioral symptoms such as depression, rage and memory loss characteristic of CTE.
College football star who died by suicide had CTE June 26, 2018 01:35 They found that tau — the abnormal protein that forms after the destruction of normal brain matter — was present at significantly higher levels on the PET scans of the 26 players, compared to those who had not participated in contact sports or experienced symptoms. The tau deposits were also seen in the same specific areas, in the same general pattern, of previously studied brains diagnosed with CTE on autopsy. Notably, the scientists found no relationship between the amount of tau seen on the PET scans and the severity of behavior and mood symptoms or performance on cognitive tests. The results of the study were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine .
This isn’t the first time tau has been found in a living human being. In 2017, doctors found a unique pattern of CTE in the brain of former Minnesota Vikings linebacker Fred McNeill . But doctors were unsure if this was a finding specific to McNeil or if this was a trend among players who exhibited CTE symptoms — so they performed more tests.
Related Nightly News Some parents saying 'no' to tackle football over CTE fears “The results of this study provide initial support for the flortaucipir PET scan to detect abnormal tau from CTE during life,” said lead author Robert Stern, professor of neurology, neurosurgery, and anatomy and neurobiology at the Boston University School of Medicine.
“This is an exciting development because it's the first step in helping us answer many of the questions we have regarding the disease, such as why do some people get it and some others do not? What are some of the risk factors? The protective factors? And most importantly, how do we prevent it,” Stern said.
Co-author Dr. Eric Reiman, executive director of the Banner Alzheimer’s Institute in Phoenix, added that the results of the study provide further evidence that CTE differs from Alzheimer’s disease and that more research needs to be done to discern the impact of contact sports on the development of CTE.
“Our findings suggest that mild cognitive, emotional and behavioral symptoms observed in athletes with a history of repetitive impacts are not attributable to AD, and they provide a foundation for additional research studies to advance the scientific understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CTE in living persons,” Reiman said in a statement.
CTE is a neurodegenerative disease found most commonly in athletes with a history of repetitive brain injuries, including symptomatic concussions as well as asymptomatic subconcussive hits to the head that do not cause symptoms. Traumatic brain injuries, including concussions and repeated blows to the head, can lead to a buildup of abnormal proteins that kill brain cells, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The blows don't necessarily have to be high impact and the symptoms usually don't appear until years after they occur. Currently, there is no way to predict if or when someone will develop CTE and a diagnosis can only be made after someone has died.
Like Alzheimer’s, CTE has been suggested to be associated with a progressive loss of brain cells, but in contrast to Alzheimer’s, the diagnosis of CTE is based in part on a pattern of tau deposits and a relative lack of amyloid plaques, commonly found in Alzheimer’s patients.
Many scientists believe that repeated blows to the head increases the risk for developing CTE. Combat veterans and athletes in rough contact sports such as football and boxing are among those thought to be the most at risk. In fact, a 2017 study found that the brains of 110 out of 111 former NFL players had CTE .
Stern says that CTE's existence has been known since the 1920s but it was initially called punch drunk syndrome, because it classically affected boxers. In 2002, Mike Webster, a deceased ex-Pittsburgh Steeler, was the first player to be diagnosed with CTE. Since then, Stern and his team have worked on ways to diagnose the condition while players are living. Stern notes that great progress has been made in CTE research, but cautions that using PET scans to diagnose CTE is still not in the imminent future as more research needs to be done to replicate and expand the study's findings.
“We're not there yet,” Stern told NBC News. “These results do not mean that we can now diagnose CTE during life or that this experimental test is ready for use in the clinic. Maybe I’m being cautious, but we are a ways away from using this technology in a clinically meaningful way.”
Related News Despite evidence, skeptics try to cast doubt on CTE-football link Stern, who has researched CTE for the past 11 years, hopes that looking at the brains of high school, college and professional athletes who suffer from classic CTE symptoms such as irritability, depression, rage and erratic behavior may help discover the extent of the incurable disease, help assess and limit the potential damage done, and provide an opportunity to test potential treatments.
“Me and 50 co-researchers around the world are conducting further research, the DIAGNOSE CTE project, and our primary goal is to develop and refine methods of diagnosing CTE during life,” Stern said. “We plan to examine the course of the disease over a three-year period and to assess risk factors including genetics and exposures to repetitive head injuries. And when we’re done, we plan to share our vast data to different researchers around the world.”
The results of the National Institutes of Health-funded DIAGNOSE CTE follow-up study are expected to be released in 2020.

The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement is leaving,www.nbcnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/acting-director-immigration-customs-enforcement-leaving-n993181,"WASHINGTON — The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement is leaving his post Friday, according to an agency spokesperson, the latest departure in a reshuffling of the Department of Homeland Security. President Donald Trump had nominated the acting director, Ron Vitiello, to become the permanent head of ICE, but pulled his nomination last week.
A DHS official said the agency received an email Wednesday with the news that Vitiello would be leaving ICE.
Trump announced his decision to rescind Vitiello's nomination last Friday, saying he preferred a nominee who would take the critical immigration agency ""in a tougher direction.""
""We're going in a little different direction. Ron is a good man, but we're going in a tougher direction,"" Trump told reporters before a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border , when asked about reports that Vitiello's nomination to lead ICE had been withdrawn.
What is being done to protect children at the border June 14, 2018 08:14 Before Trump's comments, NBC News had reported that Trump had withdrawn the nomination, citing a document sent to members of Congress on Thursday. A DHS official confirmed the document's veracity.
DHS has not said who will replace Vitiello as acting director, but Deputy Director Matthew Albence is next in line.
Vitiello's departure comes after DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was pressured to resign on Sunday and Secret Service Director Tex Alles resigned on Monday.
NBC News reported that Nielsen left because of differences with Trump over restarting a family separation policy for migrants at the border.
Alles announced his departure after a Chinese national was apprehended inside Trump's Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, after getting past initial screening by Mar-a-Lago security.
White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump had selected James M. Murray, a career member of the Secret Service, to take over as director beginning in May.

"'Unfounded, irresponsible': Dems rip Barr remark about 'spying' on Trump campaign",www.nbcnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/unfounded-irresponsible-dems-rip-barr-remark-about-spying-trump-campaign-n993176,"WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and congressional Democrats on Wednesday blasted Attorney General William Barr for testifying that the government spied on Donald Trump's presidential campaign. ""I'm flabbergasted by 's comments. I don't get it,"" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters at the Capitol.
""When you start linking spying with law enforcement or the intelligence community, that sets off red flags everywhere,"" Warner added. ""And that's why I think he does a disservice to the men and women who work in the Department of Justice and the FBI, who if they had not started a counterintelligence investigation into Russia's intervention in the 2016 election, they would be skewered and rightfully so.""
The Democrats lashed out after Barr told a Senate subcommittee that he believes ""spying did occur"" by the U.S. government on Trump's campaign. Barr said he had a basis for his belief although he declined to disclose it to lawmakers, but no hard evidence that anything improper had occurred; he added that it was a matter he needed to review.
Schiff: Barr's use of spying term was 'designed to please' Trump April 10, 2019 01:02 Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chairman of the Intelligence panel, told NBC News he was ""deeply disturbed"" by Barr's comments and that he had never heard any Department of Justice or FBI official allege that the intelligence community had spied on the Trump campaign. He said that invoking such strong language not only undermines the work of the intelligence community, but also helps strengthen ""deep state"" conspiracy theories.
""Spying is a loaded term. The attorney general is smart enough to know that it's a loaded term,"" he said.
Later in his testimony, under further questioning, Barr used the phrase ""unauthorized surveillance.""
Pelosi, D-Calif., also weighed in, telling reporters, ""It is very dismaying and disappointing that the chief law enforcement officer in our country is going off the rails yesterday and today. He is of the United States of America, not of Donald Trump.""
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., called on Barr to ""retract his unfounded, irresponsible claim"" that U.S. law enforcement spied on Trump's campaign, and demanded he apologize.
""The only spies interfering in the 2016 campaign were Russian ones,"" Blumenthal said. ""As Attorney General Barr himself admitted, there is absolutely no evidence that our nation's own law enforcement officers did anything unlawful during their investigation into Russian meddling in our democracy. To recklessly suggest otherwise is deeply offensive — and worse, it is dangerous.""
In a tweet, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who also attended the hearing, called Barr's comments “inaccurate, irresponsible, & without evidence.""
During Barr's testimony, he declined to elaborate when Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, chairman of the panel, asked what the basis was for his remarks about spying.
""There is a basis for my concern, but I'm not going to discuss the basis,"" Barr said.
""I'm not saying if improper surveillance occurred,"" he added later when asked to clarify — saying only that he was ""concerned about it"" and looking into the situation.

Arizona moves to repeal law banning promotion of 'homosexual life-style' in school,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/arizona-moves-repeal-law-banning-promotion-homosexual-life-style-school-n993206,"PHOENIX — Arizona lawmakers were poised Wednesday to begin the process of repealing a 1991 sex education law that forbids instruction that ""promotes a homosexual life-style."" The planned action in the state House comes a day after Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich declined to join in defending a lawsuit filed last month by LGBTQ groups against the state's Board of Education and state's top schools official, Democratic Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman.
Related NBC OUT Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg, Pences trade barbs The 1991 law also prohibits HIV and AIDS instruction that ""portrays homosexuality as a positive alternative lifestyle"" or ""suggests that some methods of sex are safe methods of homosexual sex.""
The lawsuit says the law stigmatizes lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students and is discriminatory.
Republican state Rep. T.J. Shope plans to carry the repeal and calls the 1991 law ""antiquated."" He said Republicans who hold majorities in both chambers of the Legislature were split, with some critical of Brnovich's decision and others believing as he did that the law was outdated.
Shope will use an existing bill as a vehicle for the repeal, erasing the current language and replacing it with a full repeal of the 1991 law.
Related NBC OUT Trump's HIV plan met with both cautious optimism, flat-out skepticism Hoffman had called for the repeal of the law in February, before the lawsuit was filed. She had indicated she had no plans to mount a defense, and Brnovich's decision left it up to the Legislature or the Board of Education to defend it.
""For nearly three decades the effects of these policies have harmed Arizona's students and families,"" she said in a statement Wednesday. ""As I have previously stated, I believe this law is indefensible and its repeal is long overdue. I urge the legislature to take immediate action and remove this law from statute.""
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Equality Arizona, alleges the 1991 law constitutes unconstitutional discrimination and restricts educational opportunity for LGBTQ students. It says it enshrines in state law that LGBTQ students can only be discussed in a negative light and communicates to students and teachers ""that there is something so undesirable, shameful, or controversial about 'homosexuality' that any positive portrayals of LGBTQ people or same-sex relationships must be explicitly barred.""
Related NBC OUT 'No promo homo' laws affect millions of students across U.S. Arizona is one of seven states with laws prohibiting the promotion of homosexuality. Critics say such laws stigmatize lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students and create a state-sanctioned climate of discrimination.
Lambda Legal filed the lawsuit along with the National Center for Lesbian Rights in U.S. District Court in Tucson. Shannon Minter, legal director for the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said repealing the law would end the lawsuit.
""We just realized and recognized that the law was blatantly unconstitutional,"" Minter said. ""And when a similar law was challenged in Utah, the Utah Legislature also took action to repeal it.""

New bill aims to stamp out bias in algorithms used by companies,www.nbcnews.com,Cyrus Farivar,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/new-bill-aims-stamp-out-bias-algorithms-used-companies-n993186,"New bill aims to stamp out bias in algorithms used by companies Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation to bring federal oversight to the use of “automated decision systems."" Cory Booker speaks at the North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU) 2019 legislative conference in Washington on April 10, 2019. Yuri Gripas / Reuters Breaking News Emails April 10, 2019, 8:39 PM UTC By Cyrus Farivar Three Democratic lawmakers Wednesday introduced a bill in the Senate to bring government oversight to the algorithms companies use for a wide variety of purposes. The bill, called the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2019, would empower the Federal Trade Commission to scrutinize the use of consumer-facing “automated decision systems” in an effort to identify bias, privacy and security risks. The bill comes after some technology firms faced questioning over their use of algorithm-based systems that decide which users see content such as housing and job advertisements. Facebook has faced particular scrutiny in recent months. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development sued the social media giant over claims that the company allowed ads to be targeted to certain ages, races and genders. A recent study also found that Facebook’s system targeted particular groups with certain housing and jobs ads without being asked to by advertisers. Last year, Reuters reported on an automated system for hiring at Amazon that had an obvious flaw: it preferred male applicants over female ones. The bill, introduced by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Yvette D. Clarke, D-N.Y., adds to growing political attention directed at algorithmic bias. In May 2018, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio trumpeted the city’s first algorithm watchdog group, assembling a panel of experts to examine how computer programs are used in municipal decision making, particularly law enforcement . The Automated Decision Systems Task Force is believed to be the first such group in the nation. Andrew Ferguson , a law professor at the University of the District of Columbia and the author of The Rise of Big Data Policing , told NBC News that a federal bill like this is “overdue.” “This type of federal effort will be critical for maintaining control over companies using personal data for commercial gain,” Ferguson said. “Equally importantly, I hope the bill sparks a national conversation about how to best set up local, state and additional federal laws to police algorithmic decision-making. Underneath the data is democracy, and our democratic leaders need to act."" The new federal legislation empowers the FTC to establish its own rules mandating “impact assessments,” which the law defines as a study that scrutinizes the “design and training data,” taking into account fairness, bias, discrimination and other considerations. In a statement , Booker said that his parents were subjected to “real estate steering” when they attempted to buy a house in his home state 50 years ago. “However, the discrimination that my family faced in 1969 can be significantly harder to detect in 2019: houses that you never know are for sale, job opportunities that never present themselves, and financing that you never become aware of — all due to biased algorithms,” he said. “This bill requires companies to regularly evaluate their tools for accuracy, fairness, bias and discrimination. It’s a key step toward ensuring more accountability from the entities using software to make decisions that can change lives.” If it is enacted into law, not all companies would be equally affected — it would only cover companies already under the FTC’s purview, and those that make more than $50 million annually. The bill has support from the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law , among other advocacy groups. “Algorithms control various aspects of a digital economy,” Francella Ochillo, the general counsel for the National Hispanic Media Coalition, said. “They determine which candidates will be interviewed and how much they will be paid; who will be targeted for or excluded from advertisements; and how much consumers will pay for goods and shipping online.” The bill is expected to first be heard by the Senate Commerce Committee in the coming months.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., introduced legislation Tuesday aimed at strengthening support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer youth who are at risk of or who have suffered child abuse. “We need to do more to better understand and address the abuse of LGBTQ youth,” Baldwin, one of only two openly LGBTQ people in the Senate, said in a statement. “This reform will help child welfare professionals better protect LGBTQ youth from child abuse and neglect, and help victims of abuse recover from the trauma that it brings.”
Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., leaves a luncheon at the Capitol on Sept. 7, 2016. Bill Clark / CQ Roll Call via AP file The Protecting LGBTQ Youth Act would amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act , a 1974 bill that sets standards for defining and reporting child abuse and provides states with federal funding for the investigation, prosecution and treatment of abuse. Though the legislation has been amended several times — it was updated as recently as January following the passing of the Victims of Child Abuse Act Reauthorization Act of 2018 — the amendment proposed by Kaine and Baldwin would be the first time the legislation explicitly accounts for LGBTQ youth.
“Abuse has devastating impacts on children’s lives, and more resources are needed to both prevent maltreatment and help those recovering from trauma,” Kaine said in a statement.
Related NBC OUT Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg, Pences trade barbs LGBTQ youth are almost four times more likely to experience childhood sexual abuse and 20 percent more likely to experience physical abuse from a parent or guardian than their heterosexual peers, according to a 2011 analysis of 37 school-based studies published in the American Journal of Public Health. And the Interagency Working Group on Youth Programs , a U.S. government initiative, has reported that LGBTQ youth are “overrepresented in child welfare systems, despite the fact that they are likely to be underreported, because they risk harassment and abuse if their LGBT identity is disclosed.”
The Protecting LGBTQ Youth Act seeks to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act by calling on government agencies to research ways to protect LGBTQ youth from abuse and neglect, expand demographic information collected in child abuse reports to include sexual orientation and gender identity data, train personnel to meet the unique needs of LGBTQ youth, and have individuals experienced in working with LGBTQ youth and families participate in state task forces.

“The Protecting LGBTQ Youth Act is representative of the growing recognition that sexual orientation and gender identity shouldn’t be used to make children more vulnerable to discrimination and violence,” Thoreson told NBC News. “States don’t just have a responsibility to respect human rights; they have a responsibility to protect against human rights violations.”
Senate Armed Services Committee member Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., speaks during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on ""Nuclear Policy and Posture"" on Capitol Hill on Feb. 29, 2019. Carolyn Kaster / AP file Kaine also introduced on Tuesday the Child Welfare Workforce Support Act , which seeks to address high turnover rates among child welfare workers. The bill would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a five-year pilot program that would focus on recruiting, developing and retaining child welfare workers who can “meet the unique needs of infants and children.”
“With high turnover rates among staff, America’s child welfare system often lacks workers needed to care for at-risk youth,” Kaine said. “By strengthening the child welfare work force and specifically addressing the higher rates of abuse among LGBTQ children, these bills would help ensure that our child welfare system better supports vulnerable kids.”

The intersection is near the site where Hussle (legal name: Ermias Ashedom) was murdered in front of his store, Marathon Clothing, on March 31. Los Angeles city councilmember Marqueece Harris-Dawson announced that the intersection will become ""Ermias 'Nipsey Hussle' Asghedom Square,"" as reported in The Shade Room. The decision came off the heels of an online petition to change the intersection name in honor of the slain rapper.
Harris-Dawson said in a statement, ""Nipsey's genuine nature allowed him to be a light to everyone he interacted with from family, friends, fans, and his larger community. As a father, brother, and son, Nipsey was a rock helping to build an empire that will continue through generations. Nipsey will always be remembered for delivering a pure, authentic Los Angeles sound, his numerous philanthropic efforts, his innovative, community-focused business mindset, and his humble heart. ""
A memorial for the rapper will take place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles this Thursday. The late rapper's family confirmed the memorial today and the venue posted details on its website (please refer to it for complete information).
While Hussle was a Grammy-nominated rapper and a long-established figure on the hip-hop scene -- he released his first mixtape in 2005 -- his musical influence is overshadowed by his work as an entrepreneur and businessman, and particularly his influence on his home neighborhoods in South Los Angeles. He owned many businesses in the area and was renowned for his kindness to the community, giving jobs to struggling residents, donating money and clothing to a local elementary school.

"Texas abortion bill proposes death penalty for women, physicians",www.nbcnews.com,Dartunorro Clark,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/texas-lawmakers-consider-death-penalty-women-who-get-abortions-n993171,"Texas lawmakers are considering a bill that would ban abortion in the state and charge women who have abortions with homicide, which can carry the death penalty in the state. Rep. Tony Tinderholt, a Republican, introduced the “Abolition of Abortion in Texas Act,” or House Bill 896, in January to ""protect the rights of an unborn child"" but it was granted its first committee hearing on Monday and Tuesday.
Nearly 500 people testified, with 54 people testifying against the bill, according to The Washington Post.
“A living human child, from the moment of fertilization on fusion of a human spermatozoon with a human ovum, is entitled to the same rights, powers, and privileges as are secured or granted by the laws of this state to any other human child,"" the text of the bill reads.
Republican Rep. Matt Krause, who sits on the Texas House Committee on Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence, which heard the bill, said in a statement on Facebook before the hearing that it was ""the first legislative hearing since 1973 on this topic.""
Tinderholt introduced a similar bill in 2017, but it failed to leave committee. He was placed under state protection because of death threats he received after proposing the bill, according to The Texas Tribune.
Tinderholt did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Democrats on the committee excoriated the bill, calling the provisions hypocritical.
“I’m trying to reconcile in my head the arguments that I heard tonight about how essentially one is OK with subjecting a woman to the death penalty ... to do to her the exact same thing that one is alleging she is doing to a child,"" Democratic Rep. Victoria Neave said during the hearing, according to The Washington Post.
Tinderholt defended the bill, according to Fox 9 , a Texas television station.
“I think it’s important to remember that if a drunk driver kills a pregnant woman, they get charged twice. If you murder a pregnant woman, you get charged twice. So I’m not specifically criminalizing women. What I’m doing is equalizing the law,” Tinderholt said.
The bill would ban abortion at any stage of pregnancy and would criminalize women who have abortions and the physicians who perform them, even in cases of rape, human trafficking or incest. The bill directly conflicts with the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which outlawed criminalizing abortion.
Before the bill goes to the full Texas House for debate, it faces a challenge in committee.
Republican Rep. Jeff Leach, chairman of the House Committee on Judiciary and Civil Jurisprudence, told The Dallas News that he would not allow the committee to advance the legislation with provisions that penalize women.
“I cannot and will not support nor will I let come out of this committee any bill on [abortion] which targets the woman with either civil or criminal liability,” he told the paper.
Leach did not respond to a request for comment.

5 science-backed tips to help you lose the winter weight,www.nbcnews.com,"Samantha Cassetty, RD",04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/5-science-backed-tips-help-you-lose-winter-weight-ncna993096,"It’s pretty common to let healthy habits go on winter break, but come spring, you may notice your clothes are a bit tighter or you lack the energy for new, warm-weather adventures. Spring happens to be an excellent time to put some healthier habits in place: the warmer weather is perfect for increasing your activity levels and the longer hours of sunshine mean you can safely spend that extra active time outdoors . Plus, your farmer’s market will usher in some new produce with the season change, and many of those options (think: asparagus, spring peas and strawberries) freshen up your menu. One more thing to love about spring: No one’s pushing heavy holiday food week after week. If your healthy habits need some dusting off , here are five ways to get healthier and take off winter weight this spring. Connect with your motivation I’ve already mentioned many reasons why this is the best time of year to get healthy, but losing weight means taking a long-term view (as you likely know!), so the first step is to explore your personal reasons for taking off these extra pounds now. Think beyond the scale. For example, you may feel it’s harder to move around than you’d like, so you’re looking to move with more ease. Or maybe you had a close relative with a health condition and you’d like to offset those concerns. Or perhaps you’d like to take charge of your health without medications. There’s no right or wrong answer here, and your answer may change over time.
I recently learned that this is a first step to joining the WW program (formerly known as Weight Watchers) because it’s such an effective motivator. Exploring the reasons you want to lose weight can help cultivate a positive and forward-thinking mindset. Plus, you may find that you’ll experience benefits like more energy, better sleep , or less irritability sooner than a so-called goal weight. These healthy eating perks can be really powerful motivators to help you stick with your new, healthier habits.
'Real Housewife' Teddi Mellencamp shares her weight loss journey May 1, 2018 02:29 Think about your drinks Sure, heavy winter sips, like hot chocolate, are off the menu, but sugary soft drinks, frozen coffee drinks, lemonade, sweetened teas, sports drinks, and even iced matcha lattes can be loaded with added sugars. And then there are the margaritas and other spring-time cocktails. If you’re sipping sugary drinks on the regular, it’s a good idea to cut way back. Here’s why: Your body doesn’t compute liquids the same way it computes solids, so calorie-for-calorie, you’ll never feel as satisfied with sips.
Have coffee and tea drinks minus the sugary mix-ins (and double check the plant-based milk you’re using to lighten up your caffeine fix; it’s another sneaky sugar source); try basic alcoholic beverages, like beer, wine or plain spirits mixed with seltzer, and cap yourself at the daily target of one drink for women, two for men. This last suggestion isn’t about the added sugar , but it’s solid health and weight loss advice. After a few too many drinks , it’s pretty common to throw caution to the wind and rationalize the greasy happy hour nachos or the after-dinner chocolate mousse cake. If you want these things, you’re better off enjoying them mindfully, which also means minus the buzz.
You probably already know what I’m about to say here: Water is the way to go. It’s the best replacement for sugary drinks and spring is an ideal time to bring on the water infusions ! Strawberries, kiwi, lemon, lime and pineapple are some seasonal fruits that bring more flavor to your H20.
Though it’s not set in stone, a good number to aim for is 64 ounces of water per day , which will vary, depending on your activity levels, climate (hot, humid temps might call for more), and some other factors. One easy way to think about is it to fill up a 16-ounce water bottle first-thing in the morning . Aim to have two of those bottles by mid-afternoon and another two before you go to bed .
Related Weight loss Weight loss The best way to lose weight boils down to these three things Veg Out The truth is, you don’t need to count calories to lose weight if you get a few things right. For starters, eat more whole foods and especially more veggies, and cut way back on overly processed and super sugary stuff. A good goal is to aim for a half-plate of veggies at lunch and dinner. ( At breakfast, veggies are optional, but always encouraged !)
If you’re currently a veggie-phobe , start sprinkling them into foods you already enjoy. I’ve found that a fruit and veggie smoothie , an omelet or frittata, a pasta dish , and soup are some good entry-level options.
Another way to go is to trade starchy carbs for veggies in flavorful meals you already love. This Spaghetti Squash Pad Thai and this Vegetarian Spaghetti Squash Ramen are both perfect examples of veggie-forward meals that don’t skimp on flavor or satisfaction! You could also try subbing in zucchini noodles for spaghetti (in part or in full), consider serving a saucy dish (like a stir-fry) over riced broccoli or cauliflower, or try a cauliflower crust pizza instead of a regular pie . This type of swap is a great way to lighten up meals you love while also sneaking in those much-needed veggies!
Have a snack strategy I’ve found there are three distinct snack personalities: An auto-pilot snacker, an over-snacker and a strategic snacker. Here’s what I mean: Snacking on auto-pilot means you’re snacking on a schedule — say, 3 p.m. is snack-o-clock or you always need an after-dinner munchy or dessert — or you’re mindlessly snacking on office freebies (think: a tray of donuts, a candy dish, a leftover lunch platter). Over-snackers eat lightly at breakfast and lunch but snack their way until dinner (and often afterwards) to catch up with the hunger that was never satisfied earlier in the day. Both of these snacking behaviors will interfere with weight-loss goals.
Related Snack attack Snack attack 6 easy snack ideas that can help you reach your weight loss goals In general, if you’re eating meals made with whole foods and generous servings of veggies, you should feel comfortably satisfied for a few hours. If you feel the need to snack in an hour or two, it’s possible your meals are too light and need some tweaking. Most people need just one or two snacks a day, and they should be timed to when you’re going the longest stretch between meals.
Strategic snackers don’t over-rely on snacks, but instead, snack when the next meal is still a while away and they need some energy to keep them going. Another smart snack strategy is to stick with the theme of more whole food options, like a peach with some Greek yogurt or some red pepper strips with guac. These types of choices provide a steady stream of energy to power your day and they nourish your body with the substances it needs to support your weight-loss goals.
Try this one rule of intermittent fasting Intermittent fasting (or IF) helps you align your eating schedule to when your body’s hormones and metabolism are optimized to process food. But the structure of restricting eating to certain time windows also helps offsets the auto-pilot snacking that’s so common after dinner. Put a hard-stop on eating within two to three hours of bedtime. Not only will this help to curb late-night snacking, but it also helps make sure you’re eating when you have time to use the “energy” that food supplies. Plus, this habit enables better sleep , which also supports weight-loss efforts.

"Charles Van Doren, who was involved in 1950s game show scandals, dies",www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/charles-van-doren-who-was-involved-1950s-game-show-scandals-n993156,"HARTFORD, Conn. — Charles Van Doren, the dashing young academic whose meteoric rise and fall as a corrupt game show contestant in the 1950s inspired the movie ""Quiz Show"" and served as a cautionary tale about the staged competitions of early television, has died. He was 93. He died of natural causes Tuesday at a care center for the elderly in Canaan, Connecticut, said his son, John Van Doren. Funeral services will be private.
The handsome scion of a prominent literary family, Van Doren was the central figure in the TV game show scandals of the late 1950s and eventually pleaded guilty to perjury for lying to a grand jury that investigated them. He spent the following decades largely out of the public eye.
""It's been hard to get away, partly because the man who cheated on 'Twenty-One' is still part of me,"" he wrote in a 2008 New Yorker essay, his first public comment in years.
Before his downfall, he was a ratings sensation. He made 14 electrifying appearances on ""Twenty-One"" in late 1956 and early '57, vanquishing 13 competitors and winning a then-record $129,000. NBC hired him as a commentator.
In a February 1957 cover story on Van Doren, Time magazine marveled at the ""fascinating, suspense-taut spectacle of his highly trained mind at work.""
""Just by being himself,"" Time wrote, ""he has enabled a giveaway show, the crassest of lowbrow entertainments, to whip up a doting mass audience for a new kind of TV idol — of all things, an egghead.""
Later, as the triumph unraveled into scandal, he initially denied he had been given advance answers, but he finally admitted that the show was rigged.
He retreated to his family's home in rural West Cornwall, Connecticut, after telling a congressional committee in 1959 that he was coached before each segment of the show.
After spending much of the 1960s and '70s in Chicago, Van Doren and his wife, Geraldine, returned to Connecticut, residing for years in a small brown bungalow on the family compound. They did some teaching but largely lived in semi-seclusion, refusing to grant interviews and even leaving the country for several weeks when Robert Redford's film ""Quiz Show"" was released in the fall of 1994.
Van Doren refused to cooperate in the movie's making and declined to meet with actor Ralph Fiennes, who portrayed him in the film. Fiennes later told People magazine that after Van Doren brushed him off, he knocked on his door pretending to be lost so he could observe Van Doren's movements and speech patterns.
Van Doren broke his silence in 2008, writing an account of his downfall in The New Yorker and how he finally had publicly admitted a half-century earlier that he was ""foolish, naive, prideful and avaricious.""
""People who knew the entertainment business didn't have much doubt about what was going on, although they didn't speak out,"" he wrote.
In light of the large profits the rigged game shows were making, he added, ""why would they?""
He also disclosed that he eventually did watch ""Quiz Show"" and laughed at an insulting reference that a character made about him. He said he had been tempted to take a consulting fee from the producers, but his wife talked him out of it.
Van Doren's family had a proud literary standing at the time of the scandal. His father, Mark Van Doren, was a critic, biographer and poet who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1940. His uncle, Carl Van Doren, received a Pulitzer in 1939 for a biography of Benjamin Franklin.
Charles Van Doren was himself a rising young academic at Columbia when he became famous on the quiz show. He went on to win $129,000 on the show after defeating Herbert Stempel, a New Yorker portrayed by John Turturro in the movie.
Stempel later went public and said contestants were fed the answers to the questions prior to the show. He said he was told to lose because the show's producers thought Van Doren had star potential.
In 1962, Van Doren and nine other winners from three NBC shows — ""Twenty-One,"" ''Tic-Tac-Dough"" and ""Hi-Lo"" — pleaded guilty to lying to a grand jury that had investigated the scandal. They were spared jail terms by a judge who said the nation's scorn was punishment enough.
After the scandal broke, Van Doren lost the $50,000-a-year job NBC gave him when he defeated Stempel. He also was dropped from the faculty at Columbia, where his father had been a professor for decades.
Friends said Van Doren's family was shocked by his eventual revelation that he had been given the answers in advance.
Bucky Whitney, a longtime friend, recalled the family's shame.
""His father took it real hard. The old man was never the same after that,"" Whitney told a reporter who visited Cornwall when ""Quiz Show"" came out.
Van Doren later joined the Institute for Philosophical Research, a nonprofit Chicago think tank, and worked at Chicago-based Encyclopaedia Britannica for many years. Among his books were ""The Idea of Progress,"" a philosophical work, and ""A History of Knowledge; Past, Present, and Future.""
Van Doren and his wife had two children, Elizabeth and John.
""He was a loving husband and a terrific father, and he's going to be deeply missed,"" John Van Doren said.
In West Cornwall, neighbors were protective of ""Charley,"" as Van Doren was affectionately known.
Walter DeTheir, the proprietor of a store in Cornwall, said Van Doren was a quiet, shy man who came in regularly to pick up the Sunday New York Times.
""It's not that he isn't friendly, he just doesn't have much to say,"" DeTheir said.
In his New Yorker piece, Van Doren said he liked to avoid ""people who say, 'Aren't you Charles Van Doren?' Well, that's my name, I say to myself, but I'm not who you think I am — or, at least, I don't want to be."""
pushes the bounds of his power,www.nbcnews.com,Jonathan Allen,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-pushes-bounds-his-power-n993191,"WASHINGTON — In a newly emboldened , liberals sense the rise of a tyrant pushing all the boundaries of power at once and daring Congress, the courts and political critics to stand in his way at their own peril. For the Trump faithful, he has finally been freed to be a truly forceful leader.
In short, the right and the left are seeing the president they always thought was there.
In recent weeks, Trump has thumbed his nose at Congress to try to build a border wall, purged the Department of Homeland Security to get a harder-line position on immigration, withdrawn legal objections to gutting Obamacare benefits, moved to dismantle a major federal agency and successfully pressured the Department of Justice to investigate perceived political enemies he said Wednesday are guilty of ""treason"" for having pursued a probe of his campaign's ties to Russia.
It's as if someone hit the play button on a domineering presidency that had been paused by special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, a five-week government shutdown and the various distractions created by the president himself.
Trump: Russia probe was 'an attempted coup' April 10, 2019 01:36 There's nothing wrong with Trump using the powers granted to him by the Constitution or Congress' cession of authority to the executive, Rachel Bovard, policy director at the Conservative Policy Institute, said.
""We’re seeing the logical conclusion of Congress giving the executive branch a lot of power,"" she said in a phone conversation with NBC News during a break from training to get her concealed-carry permit in the District of Columbia. ""Congress has plenty of authority to take their authority back and they haven’t. ... They stomp their feet and scream about a tyrant.""
Conservatives thought President Barack Obama abused his powers, including when he created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protected certain immigrants who were brought to the country as children from deportation. And they believed, as many liberals do now, that the president's party in Congress was far too willing to let the executive run roughshod over the legislative branch.
In 2016, Trump's rival, Hillary Clinton, promised to use executive authority to address a series of hot-button issues, including her proposal to end the so-called gun-show loophole, which cheered liberals who were frustrated by Congress' ability to thwart parts of Obama's agenda.
That's not to say every action is equal in moral value or proportion. But the move of party taking precedence over institutional prerogative is part of a long-term trend that activists on the right and the left have seen as a means of enacting their favored policies.
That trend has combined with Trump's penchant for dramatic demonstrations of power to leave little question that he's testing the limits of what a president can do unilaterally.
Several states have sued him over his decision to take money appropriated for military construction projects — and from other accounts — and use it to build a wall that Congress denied funding for before voting to block his plan. Trump vetoed the latter bill and will force the courts to decide whether he's within his constitutional rights.
Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said Trump has used powers from three different baskets that should be viewed in separate terms.
""There’s legitimate use of legitimate power. There’s abuse of legitimate power. And then, there’s creating illegitimate powers than no one ever intended to give you,"" he said, pointing to Trump's decision to use funds appropriated for other purposes to build a border wall as illegitimate, and his decision to withdraw the government's objection to a lawsuit against Obamacare as a legitimate, but misguided, use of power.
""What I think progressives think about is 'what is a legitimate use of legitimate power?'"" he said. ""Things like environmental protection and civil rights protection and busting up anti-competitive monopolies are powers that go unused. Those were legitimate powers that have gone unused by the Bush and the Trump administrations and that progressives would want to utilize if we take back the White House.""
But there's a different kind of fight over what Trump depicts as an effort to use the power of the government to correct for what he sees as an abuse of federal authority against him.
Rather than a question of policy, it's a matter of politics and law that leaves no room for the possibility that it was legitimate both to investigate the Trump operation's ties to Russia and questions about the obstruction of justice, and for Mueller to find no evidence of a conspiracy with Russia.
From the South Lawn of the White House, the seat of executive power, Trump told reporters Wednesday that former government officials involved in starting and pursuing the investigation into his campaign were guilty of ""treason"" — a crime punishable by death — at nearly the same time Attorney General William Barr was telling Congress he believes the Obama administration spied on Trump's campaign.
Barr provided no evidence. No one has been charged with a crime. No jury has rendered a verdict. But the president and the nation's top law enforcement officer, speaking separately and yet in conjunction with each other, began to lay out a public case that American citizens are guilty.
""It was an illegal investigation,"" Trump said. ""Everything about it was crooked. ... There were dirty cops. These were bad people. ... And this was a — an attempted coup. This was an attempted takedown of a president. And we beat them.""
Leon Panetta: Trump weakening his WH by undermining top officials April 10, 2019 08:20 A few moments later, Trump dropped the ""T"" word.
""What they did was treason,"" he said. ""What they did was against our Constitution and everything we stand for.""
Under federal law, a person has to wage war against the United States or provide aid or comfort to the nation's enemies to be found guilty of treason.
""While there is a debate about how effective he is or whether its bold versus tyrannical, his rhetoric should be a cause for concern,"" Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, said in an email. ""His ongoing accusations about top law enforcement officials and his claims that they are guilty of things like treason goes beyond what any liberal or conservative should accept.""
Zelizer noted that Trump's allegations are made without producing evidence and that he uses the standing of his office to put them into the public discussion.
""This is dangerous stuff and a fundamental misuse of the office,"" Zelizer said. ""Not only can they harm individuals, but they undercut trust for major institutions. It should be treated as seriously as other forms of abusive executive power. It is difficult for Congress to know what to do about it, since it is rhetorical, so much of the weight for pushing back falls on his own party taking tough steps when he says things like this. Until now, they have only supported him.""
It remains to be seen what comes of the Barr investigation into the investigators.
Trump has often declared that the Obama-era officials should not have used the power of the government to look into him; it was, he has said, an abuse of their authority for political gain.
For that reason alone, his fans and his critics may come to similar conclusions about whether he is now using the Justice Department to pursue the truth, or abusing his powers to punish perceived political enemies.
Whichever interpretation they embrace, there's clearly a commonality in the way the left and the right view Trump, Zelizer said: ""Both sides agree this is a very imperial president — at least, he tries to be.""

Europe offers Britain a new deadline of Oct. 31 to sort out its Brexit mess,www.nbcnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/europe-offers-britain-new-deadline-oct-31-sort-out-its-n992931,"BRUSSELS — About 48 hours before Britain was scheduled to crash out of the European Union, its Brexit deadline was postponed until Halloween. The extension came after a high-stakes, six-hour summit in Brussels that ended early Thursday morning.
Twenty-seven prime ministers and presidents from across the continent had gathered to debate Britain's fate over a three-course dinner in Brussels' futuristic Europa Building.
British Prime Minister Theresa May was barred from attending what was effectively her country's sentencing.
The European leaders eventually emerged to offer the prime minister an Oct. 31 extension to sort out her Brexit mess. If before that date she achieves what she has failed to do so far, persuading British lawmakers to support her deal, then the extension would be terminated early.
It is the second time May has had to go to Europe pleading for more time. Brexit was initially scheduled to happen March 29, but at the last minute was pushed back to Friday.
Theresa May agrees to Brexit deadline extension April 11, 2019 01:56 The major upshot of this latest extension is that it saves the U.K. from leaving the E.U. in two days' time without any deal at all. Most experts warn a ""no-deal Brexit"" could tank the economy , bring food shortages , and risk conflict in Northern Ireland .
However, the agreement does little to solve the fundamental problems that have seen Brexit slide deep into chaos since June 2016, when Britain voted to leave the European Union.
""Please do not waste this time,"" European Council President Donald Tusk, who hosted the emergency summit, said at a news conference after the marathon dinner-meeting. ""During this time, the course of action will be entirely in the U.K.'s hands.""
By accepting the E.U.'s extension, May performed another reversal in a leadership that's become renowned for its high-profile 180-degree turns.
Related News What does it mean to be European in the Brexit era? We asked millennials She previously had said she would not accept an extension beyond June 30 because it would clash with upcoming European elections. For a country trying to leave the E.U., participating in this vote would be a major logistical, diplomatic and political headache. This extension means that situation now looks likely.
Many in Brussels are deeply troubled by the idea of the U.K. remaining as a temporary yet powerful and potentially disruptive member. In a bid to address those fears, the E.U. extension calls on the U.K. ""to act in a constructive and responsible manner"" and give its ""sincere cooperation"" to the E.U. during the delay.
There will be a ""review"" at the European Council meeting in June to check this spirit is being upheld.
To avoid European elections and end the extension early, May must sell her deal to her fractious Conservative Party, with several of its members already in open rebellion because Brexit has been delayed. And ultimately she has to try to find cross-party support in the House of Commons, something that has spectacularly eluded her so far.
British lawmakers have voted down her deal three times, on two of those occasions handing it the heaviest and fourth-heaviest defeats in parliamentary history.
Even May's offer to resign in a bid to appease the holdouts did not get her the numbers.
""I do not pretend the next few weeks will be easy or that there is a simple way to break the deadlock in Parliament,"" she told a separate briefing at 3 a.m. Thursday. ""But we have a duty as politicians to find a way to fulfill the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward.""
She said that ""nothing is more pressing or more vital.""
The prime minister is set to make a statement to Parliament later in the day. Her team will continue discussions with the opposition Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, a rare and extremely belated act of bipartisan cooperation that has yet has failed to yield results.
Related World The U.K. spends billions, stockpiles for a chaotic Brexit that may never happen With both their parties bitterly divided, these leaders could cause permanent splits and resignations no matter which course they take.
Indeed the struggle to find a solution has seen seismic ruptures in the fabric of British politics, with lawmakers emotionally and physically stretched, and each week bringing a new breakdown of parliamentary norms.
The chaos has seen growing calls for another public vote . Thousands of people recently marched through London calling for a second referendum. Senior government officials have said that the idea deserves consideration, something that seemed far-fetched even months ago.
Even more drastic, a petition to cancel Brexit altogether gained 6 million signatures on the Parliament's website.
Before a decision on the extension was announced, May was grilled by representatives of the 27 other E.U. members but was shut out of the room while they discussed her country's future over scallop salad, cod lion and iced macadamia nut parfait.
During this closed-door dinner, countries including Malta — population 500,000 — had more say over Britain's future than Britain itself.
Most countries were willing to grant a long, flexible extension to the U.K., but France was consistently a lone holdout, demanding Brexit be resolved sooner rather than later, according to four E.U. diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity. But the leaders were required to reach their decision unanimously.
The eventual date appeared to be a compromise between those wanting a longer extension and France's shorter proposal. Tusk, who had favored a longer delay, said: ""I think it's always best to have a piece of something than all of nothing.""

The ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" star told Vogue magazine for a cover story in its May issue that she decided last summer to begin a four-year apprenticeship with a law firm in San Francisco.
Kardashian West, 38, who did not complete college, said she plans to take the bar exam in 2022. Four states, including California, where she lives, offer an alternative path to passing the bar known as “reading the law,” or apprenticing with a practicing lawyer or judge.
The reality TV star said she was inspired by her involvement in the case of Alice Marie Johnson , 63, a grandmother who was serving life in prison in Alabama for a nonviolent drug conviction.
See Kim Kardashian West and freed inmate Alice Johnson meet for the first time June 14, 2018 10:10 She learned about Johnson through social media and lobbied on her behalf in a June 2018 Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump. Days later, Trump commuted the sentence for Johnson, who had at that point been in prison for more than two decades.
Kardashian West told Vogue that she believed she could do more for criminal justice reform if she knew more.
In advocating for Johnson at the White House, ""I would say what I had to say, about the human side and why this is so unfair,"" Kardashian West said. ""But I had attorneys with me who could back that up with all the facts of the case.""
""It’s never one person who gets things done; it’s always a collective of people, and I’ve always known my role, but I just felt like I wanted to be able to fight for people who have paid their dues to society,"" she said. ""I just felt like the system could be so different, and I wanted to fight to fix it, and if I knew more, I could do more.”
The law runs in the family.

Mnuchin says Treasury won't meet Democrats' deadline for Trump's taxes,www.nbcnews.com,msn.com,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/mnuchin-says-treasury-won-t-meet-democrats-deadline-trump-s-n993246,"The Treasury Department won't meet House Democrats' deadline of Wednesday to hand over 's tax returns, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. In a letter to Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mnuchin said the Treasury was continuing to review Democrats' request in light of ""serious issues"" about whether the request is proper.
Neal said in a brief statement only that he had received Mnuchin's letter and that he was consulting with legal counsel, promising a response ""in the coming days.""
Neal filed a formal request with the Treasury Department for the documents last week, saying, ""I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative, legal and oversight rights.""
For Facts' Sake: Trump is able to release his tax returns April 10, 2019 02:22 Mnuchin said at a Ways and Means hearing last month that he would protect Trump's privacy .
In his letter to Neal on Wednesday, Mnuchin cited the committee's previous finding, when it was under Republican control, that such a request would be an ""abuse of authority"" that would ""set a dangerous precedent"" by targeting an individual's tax returns for political reasons.
""The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power,"" he wrote Wednesday, saying he was consulting with the Justice Department about the legality and constitutionality of Neal's request.
Mnuchin said that ""for the same reasons,"" he intended to supervise the department's review personally.
Related Politics Mnuchin: White House lawyers spoke with Treasury Dept. about request for Trump tax returns Since he was a candidate, Trump has claimed that he can't release his taxes because he's under audit by the IRS. But in congressional testimony in February, Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, said he'd seen no proof that any audit was under way . And tax experts have said that even if he is under audit, there's nothing to stop Trump from releasing his returns .
Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the ranking Republican on Neal's committee, welcomed Mnuchin's letter, warning that the request ""sets a dangerous precedent.""
""The tax code must not to be used for political fishing expeditions,"" Brady said. ""The Treasury Department is right to carefully review the privacy impact this request would have on every taxpayer.""
Ways and Means is one of three congressional committees with the authority to seek to obtain the president's returns. The others are the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation.
As chairman of Ways and Means, Neal is authorized to request the information from the IRS. If the request is denied, Democrats could consider legal action.
Separately, Democrats in New York, the president's home state, introduced a bill in the Legislature on Monday that would allow the state to release any state tax return requested by the three congressional committees.
The bill would apply only to Trump's state returns — not the federal returns that Neal is seeking — but because the president's businesses are based there, his New York returns are thought to be likely to include much of the same information."

"National Enquirer up for sale, owner AMI says",www.nbcnews.com,Claire Atkinson,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/national-enquirer-sale-owner-ami-says-n993256,"American Media Inc. said Wednesday that the National Enquirer is up for sale. The company, run by chief executive David Pecker, a friend of President Donald Trump, said in a statement that it had decided to change direction and the tabloid title no longer fit with its portfolio of assets.
The possible sale of the National Enquirer was first reported by The Washington Post.
American Media did not say whether it was in talks with a possible buyer, but a sale would come just months after the supermarket tabloid revealed on its front page that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who owns the Post, was having an affair. Bezos later accused the National Enquirer of extortion and blackmail for threatening to publish embarrassing photos of him and his girlfriend.
The magazine publisher said it also would sell two other tabloids: the Globe and the National Examiner.
“We feel the future opportunities with the tabloids can be best exploited by a different ownership,” Pecker said in a statement, explaining that the company was developing a broadcast, audio and events business instead.
The National Enquirer’s potential sale comes after the company's board said it would investigate negotiations between the tabloid and Bezos’ legal team. The contentious conversations were shared by Bezos in a post on the website Medium titled, “No Thank You, Mr. Pecker.”
Bezos described how he wouldn’t be shamed after learning the magazine possessed compromising photographs. He alluded to the possible involvement of foreign governments in the incident.
The National Enquirer was also found to have engaged in “ catch and kill ” arrangements with women who claimed to have had affairs with Trump that included payments of hush money.
American Media also owns US Weekly, Star, OK!, In Touch and Life & Style.

Michael Keough, vice president of logistics for Arkema Inc.'s North American subsidiary, was indicted on felony assault charges tied to his actions ahead of a chemical fire and explosion at the company's Crosby facility, the Harris County District Attorney's office announced Wednesday . The company was also charged. Keough falsely told officials that Arkema was monitoring potentially explosive chemical tanks in real time when the company had insufficient data to give early warning, according to District Attorney Kim Ogg. These ""misrepresentations"" led two sheriff's deputies to drive directly into a toxic cloud, which then spread to exposing others, she said. Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg announces that a grand jury decided to indict Arkema and Michael Keough, vice president of logistics division of the company, for reckless assault during a press conference, in Houston on April 10, 2019. Yi-Chin Lee / Houston Chronicle via AP An attorney for Keough, Dan Cogdell, called the indictment ""absurd"" and ""beyond rational thought."" ""There has, quite literally, never been a prosecution like this one for one singular reason — what Mike did wasn't a crime"" Cogdell said in a statement. The charges against Keough were announced weeks after fires at two other Houston-area chemical plants, and on the day President Donald Trump visited Crosby to sign executive orders designed to speed up oil and gas pipeline projects. Ogg acknowledged during a press conference that criminal charges are rarely brought against company employees over environmental violations, but said civil regulations have proven insufficient to protect the public. ""Too often corporations are simply allowed to pay fines and that doesn't change corporate behavior,"" she said. The flooded plant of French chemical maker Arkema SA, which produces organic peroxides, is seen after fires were reported at the facilty in Crosby, Texas, on Aug. 31. Adrees Latif / Reuters Keough is the third Arkema employee to be indicted since the hurricane knocked out power at the company's Crosby facility. Without electricity, some of the chemicals at the plant caught fire and partially exploded, sending plumes of smoke skyward. Richard Rowe, the France-based company's chief executive, and plant manager Leslie Comardelle were charged with releasing toxic chemicals last year. They are set to be tried in May. In 2018, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board released a report saying that Arkema failed to consider how a Harvey-level flood could affect its electrical power system. A lawyer for the company, Rusty Hardin, said Wednesday that prosecutors are trying to hold Arkema responsible for an ""Act of God"" and called the case ""political."""

SUBSCRIBE April 11, 2019, 1:19 AM GMT By Associated Press NEW YORK — Opponents of New York City's emergency declaration ordering everyone in a heavily Orthodox Jewish neighborhood to be vaccinated for measles will file a lawsuit this week, a lawyer working with the group said Wednesday. Civil rights attorney Michael Sussman called the order threatening to fine residents of four ZIP codes in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn if they refuse to have their children vaccinated ""an overreach of authority."" Sussman also represented a group of parents in suburban Rockland County who challenged the county executive's order barring unvaccinated children from indoor public spaces. A state judge sided with the parents and issued a preliminary injunction against the emergency order last week. New York City and Rockland County are both struggling to contain a measles outbreak that has mainly affected Orthodox Jewish families. Some 285 measles cases have been identified in New York City since last fall, compared to two in all of 2017. There have been 168 cases reported in Rockland since the fall. Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday he's confident that New York City's vaccination order would survive any legal challenge. ""This is a public health emergency,"" the Democratic mayor said. ""And the reason the city government is empowered in a public health emergency is to save lives."" Authorities said the city health department will seek to interview Williamsburg residents who have been diagnosed with measles and everyone they have come in contact with. The health officials will try to persuade any unvaccinated person who has been exposed to measles to get the vaccine. People who refused the vaccine or who refuse to get their children vaccinated could be fined as much as $1,000. Also on Wednesday, officials in Westchester County just north of New York City announced that measles has been confirmed in eight children who were apparently exposed to the highly contagious virus while visiting Rockland County or Brooklyn. Six of the children are siblings."

California prosecutors to seek death penalty in 'Golden State Killer' case,www.nbcnews.com,Associated Press,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/california-prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-golden-state-killer-case-n993266,"U.S. news California prosecutors to seek death penalty in 'Golden State Killer' case Gov. Gavin Newsom has announced a moratorium on executing any of the inmates on death row, but that does not affect the ability to seek or impose it. Joseph James DeAngelo, suspected of being the Golden State Killer, appears in Sacramento County Superior Court as prosecutors announce they will seek the death penalty if he is convicted in the case, in Sacramento, Calif on April 10, 2019. Rich Pedroncelli / AP Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE April 11, 2019, 3:07 AM GMT By Associated Press SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California prosecutors announced Wednesday they will seek the death penalty if they convict the man suspected of being the notorious ""Golden State Killer"" who eluded capture for decades. The move comes less than a month after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a moratorium on executing any of the 737 inmates on the nation's largest death row. Newsom's reprieve lasts only so long as he is governor and does not prevent prosecutors from seeking nor judges and juries from imposing death sentences. Prosecutors from four counties briefly announced their decision during a short court hearing for Joseph DeAngelo. He was arrested a year ago based on DNA evidence linking him to at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes across California in the 1970s and '80s. He stood expressionless in an orange jail uniform, staring forward from a courtroom cage, as prosecutors from Sacramento, Santa Barbara, Orange and Ventura spoke. Although prosecutors from six counties were in court for the four-minute hearing, charges in those four counties include the special circumstances that could merit execution for 12 of the 13 murders under California law. His attorney, public defender Diane Howard, criticized seeking the death penalty against a 73-year-old man, saying in an email that the decision ""does not further justice and is wasteful."" With a multicounty prosecution team including more than 30 people, she cited a Sacramento County estimate that the prosecution will cost taxpayers more than $20 million. DeAngelo has yet to enter a plea and his trial is likely years away. 2018: Suspected 'Golden State Killer' arrested after decades April 26, 2018 02:41 Prosecutors wouldn't comment after the hearing, but Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said several prosecutors and family members of murder victims planned a Thursday news conference to denounce Newsom's moratorium. An announcement from Spitzer's office said victims' families ""will share their stories of losing their loved ones and how the governor's moratorium has devastated their pursuit of justice."" The serial killer would sneak into suburban homes at night, authorities said. If a couple was home, he would tie up the man, place dishes on his back and threaten to kill both victims if he heard the plates fall while he raped the woman. ""These are horrific crimes. Our sympathies are with the victims and families who have suffered at the hands of the Golden State Killer,"" Newsom spokesman Brian Ferguson said in a statement acknowledging that the governor's executive order does not affect the ability of local prosecutors to make charging decisions. California has not executed anyone since 2006, but Newsom said he acted last month because 25 inmates have exhausted their appeals and court challenges to the state's new lethal injection process are potentially nearing their end. He endorsed a repeal of capital punishment but said he could not in good conscious allow executions to resume in the meantime knowing that some innocent inmates could die. He also said he is exploring ways to commute death sentences, which would permanently end the chance of executions, though he cannot act without permission from the state Supreme Court in many cases. ""The death penalty does serve as a deterrent,"" Ron Harrington, older brother of Golden State Killer victim Patrick Harrington, said after witnessing Wednesday's announcement. ""Unfortunately now our governor has decided to interpose his own personal opinion regarding the death penalty."" Related Death penalty repeal sweeping across states as both parties get on board Newsom's announcement ""places decisions that local prosecutors make in a different light,"" said Death Penalty Information Center executive director Robert Dunham, whose organization has been critical of how the penalty is administered. Decisions should be made on the facts ""and not on their perception of gaining political points by opposing the governor."" Voters narrowly supported capital punishment in 2012 and 2016, when they voted to speed up executions by shortening appeals. Criminal Justice Legal Foundation legal director Kent Scheidegger said prosecutors' decision made sense despite Newsom's moratorium. ""It's a perfect example of a killer for whom anything less would not be justice,"" said Scheidegger, who is fighting in court to resume executions. ""I think it's entirely appropriate for DAs to continue seeking the death penalty in appropriate cases, because the actual execution will be well down the road and the governor's reprieve won't be in effect by then. Something else will have happened."""
