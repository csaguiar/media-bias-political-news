Myrtle Beach Pelicans Preview,www.chicagonow.com,Michael Ernst,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.chicagonow.com/cubs-den/2019/04/myrtle-beach-pelicans-preview/,"By Michael Ernst , Tuesday at 10:48 pm Aramis Ademan (photo by Stephanie Lynn)
After a disappointing 2018 season, the Myrtle Beach Pelicans will feature a dozen returning players, but that group being asked to repeat the High-A level still includes a few top prospects such as Aramis Ademan and Alex Lange . They will also be bolstered by a strong contingent coming up from South Bend led by Miguel Amaya , who many observers feel is the top prospect in the Cubs system. Two starting pitchers originally projected to help anchor the Pelicans staff will begin the year on the injured list ( Brendon Little and Erich Uelmen ) but can hopefully still contribute this season.
That isn't all though. Since last June I've stated many times how impressive the Cubs 2018 draft haul appears, and how important it could be for restocking the system. Well, three members of that class ( Paul Richan , Luke Reynolds , Jimmy Herron ) will begin their first full year of professional ball with the Pelicans. You could even include a fourth guy in that list as undrafted free agent Grant Fennell is a late addition to the Pelicans squad. Another few players, Andy Weber and Tyler Durna among them, nearly made the squad and could be among the first wave of promotions from South Bend during the course of the season. These numbers are particularly impressive given the Cubs top pick ( Nico Hoerner ) will be skipping High-A entirely, and the club's next two picks were a pair of prep outfielders. Position Players Miguel Amaya (Photo by Stephanie Lynn)
Top prospects to watch: Two years ago Aramis Ademan and Miguel Amaya were a pair of exciting 18-year olds expected to make waves with the Eugene Emeralds as high profile signings from the Cubs 2015 IFA class. Ademan jumped out of the gates to earn NWL All-Star honors that season before a late promotion to South Bend. His performance was enough for Baseball America and other outlets to rank him as the top prospect in the Cubs system at that time. Amaya, on the other hand, struggled at the plate with Eugene (.228/.266/.338). While he impressed me with his advanced skills for his age behind the dish, and the above average raw strength and approach he flashed offensively, most outlets took a lukewarm view of him as a prospect last offseason. I considered the two neck and neck however in terms of their ultimate ceiling and long-term potential.
Flash forward to last spring and the Cubs decided to aggressively push the still teenaged Ademan all the way to Myrtle Beach last season, making him one of the youngest players in the Carolina League. Although he showed off improved plate discipline, his lack of physical maturity showed, and the youngster struggled to produce on offense throughout the season. Meanwhile, Amaya was given the less aggressive, but still advanced-for-his-age posting to South Bend. Low and behold, Amaya would break out with nine home runs and a .288/.365/.500 first half line to garner not just MWL All-Star honors but an invitation to the Futures Game. He also leapfrogged Ademan on all Cubs prospect lists.
Now, the two will be teammates once again. Amaya carries all the momentum despite a second half offensive swoon, while some have soured on Ademan. It is important to keep in mind though, that only one was put into a situation to succeed last year. They will be on equal footing once again and fans shouldn't be surprised if it is Ademan that shows greater progress in 2019 while Amaya stalls a bit. Regardless of their head-to-head production this year, both remain in the team's long term plans. Jimmy Herron (photo by Rikk Carlson)
Joining them as a fixture in the lineup will be 2018 3rd round pick Jimmy Herron . The young outfielder showed impressive pitch recognition and bat control as he made his way up to South Bend last season. An elbow injury kept him from seeing much time in centerfield with Duke before and in the Cubs system after the draft, but I would expect to see his playing time increase their this season. Herron has nice blend of contact ability and plate discipline that makes him an intriguing top of the order hitter, that can also surprise with a bit of pop on occasion. It will be important for his development to build a defensive profile beyond leftfield.
Others: Competing with Herron for time in centerfield will be D.J. Wilson . The athletic outfielder has been plagued by nagging injury and near constant adjustments to his swing and approach. They'll be joined in the outfield by speedster Zach Davis as well as Kevonte Mitchell . Davis is probably the second fastest runner in the system behind Fernando Kelli. Mitchell has long been a sleeper prospect as a former two-sport prep star like D.J. Wilson but as he has continued to grow and add weight Mitchell has lost some of his speed without adding much in terms of power. This year will likely be make or break for him. If he does not turn some of his potential into production his time with the organization could be short.
Expect plenty of shuffling around Ademan in the infield for the Pelicans this season. After missing all of 2018 and much of 2017 due to various injuries Carlos Sepulveda returns to Myrtle Beach where he will attempt to restart his development. The undersized infielder showed off impressive bat-to-ball skills as a teenager with South Bend in 2016 before his career was sidetracked. He figures to share second base with Johnny Bethencourt . He too has flashed a solid hit tool while also seeing his 2018 season cut short due to injury. Former MWL All-Star Yeiler Peguero will likely bounce around to all three infield spots.
There also figures to be a playing time split at the corners between 2018 draftee Luke Reynolds and incumbent third baseman Wladimir Galindo . Both are more suited to first, but the club will keep their options open with them at the hot corner. Each will need to hit their way to the Majors however. The lefty swinging Reynolds combines good plate discipline with a gap-to-gap approach that bodes well for his chances to translate his 2018 collegiate success to the professional ranks. Galindo will need to make major strides with both his approach and ability to lift the ball if he wants to tap into his above average raw power on a consistent basis.

President Reuven Rivlin, who cut short his state visit to Canada to be at his wife's bedside in Petah Tikva's Beilinson Hospital, landed in Israel on Wednesday morning.Nechama Rivlin, who has long been suffering from pulmonary fibrosis - a respiratory illness which necessitated her constant attachment to an oxygen tank - underwent a lung transplant on March 11. The operation was a success and she appeared to be recovering well. But on Tuesday evening, her condition suddenly deteriorated, and the president's office put out an announcement stating that she had been sedated and placed on respiratory support, due to severe shortness of breath resulting from cardiac complications. In response to her condition, Rivlin decided to return to Israel immediately, even though other members of his family were with his wife.He was scheduled to be the guest of honor together with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday night at a United Jewish Appeal top donors dinner followed by a 70th anniversary Salute to Israel event attended by 1,600 members of the Canadian Jewish community, after which he was supposed to fly to Israel. But Rivlin bowed out of these two functions - where he would have underscored the importance of the relationship between the Jewish Diaspora and Israel - and left Canada earlier than intended.When the visit to Canada was originally planned, Rivlin was also scheduled to return home via New York so that he could meet with American Jewish community leaders. But then early elections in Israel were announced, and Rivlin had to forego the New York stopover.As soon as news of Nechama Rivlin's turn for the worse was made public, social media was flooded with thousands of get well messages. There were more than 6,000 on Facebook within the first hour of the announcement from the president's office.In addition, there were frequent news bulletins on Israeli television and radio stations, as well as on Israeli and overseas Jewish and general digital news outlets.An early morning update from the president's office on Wednesday stated that Mrs. Rivlin had a quiet night and was in stable condition.The Rivlins are a very close couple. The president has frequently introduced himself as the husband of the wife of the president of Israel. Despite her illness, Nechama Rivlin accompanied her husband on nearly all of his overseas trips, and would have probably gone to Canada with him, but for the fact that the long awaited lung transplant was made possible.

Thank you,
Ronit Hasin-Hochman, CEO, Jerusalem Post Group Yaakov Katz, Editor-in-Chief ormer Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has joined Ashkelon-based medical cannabis company Univo as an investor and professional adviser, the company announced on Wednesday. Olmert, the company said, will “help promote Univo’s business goals both in Israel and globally, and will support the company’s future fundraising efforts.” Olmert, who served as prime minister from January 2006 to March 2009, is currently the head of Israel’s Public Council for Healthy Lifestyles, and chairs the advisory board of venture capital firm Genesis Angels, which has invested in top medical technology companies in Israel. Founded in 2016, Tel Aviv Stock Exchange-traded Univo possesses licenses for the cultivation, research and development, production, and distribution of its own cannabis product. The company, led by CEO Golan Bitton, is currently developing a new 750 square-meter facility, including an on-site R&D laboratory, to cultivate a wide variety of cannabis strains. “The tech revolution has entered the medical cannabis space and is expediting all R&D, manufacturing and even regulatory procedures, with the goal of relieving pain for patients suffering from a spectrum of diseases,” said Olmert. “Israel is stepping up and joining the world’s most progressive nations in developing a pivotal local industry that has the potential to contribute to global medical cannabis R&D efforts,” he said. “After I examined Israel’s top medical cannabis companies, I chose to contribute my experience and knowledge to Univo, because I believe that Univo has the best chance of becoming an independent entity when it comes to manufacturing and distributing top cannabis-based products. I am thankful for the opportunity to step in and help this company become a global leader.” The global medical cannabis market was valued at $8.3 billion in 2017, and is projected to soar in value to $28b. by 2024, according to a recent report by Energias Market Research. In January, the Israeli government approved exports of domestically-grown medical cannabis to the worldwide legal market. Ido Hagag, a real estate developer and one of Univo’s major investors, said Olmert’s “connections with global markets and his capabilities in the health sector” will enable the company to improve patient care worldwide. “We’re proud to have Mr. Olmert supporting our vision and putting his trust in our manufacturing and supply chain. This is a major milestone for Univo that soon enough will bear fruit,” said Hagag. Olmert is the second former prime minister to enter the medical cannabis industry to date. Since September, Ehud Barak has served as chairman of Canndoc-InterCure, a holding company of Israeli medical cannabis firms. Barak is responsible for the company’s global growth strategy and the development of international business. The company is currently examining going public on the NASDAQ stock market.

“You taste a lot of stuff that’s really not exceptional,” says Thompson, who opened Jaguar Sun with his business partner chef Carey Hynes (formerly of Momofuku and Per Se) last September. But “once in a while you come across something that just opens your eyes a little bit wider and that’s what I felt about that rum.”
Distilled from sugarcane or its byproducts—including melado, piloncillo and molasses—charanda (which in the Purépecha language means “red-colored soil”) is a style of rum that has been made in Mexico for centuries. It wasn’t until 2003, however, that the spirit was granted protective denominación de origen status, stating that charanda must be made in the Mexican state of Michoacán in the region of Uruapan.
The Uruapan Charanda Blanco that captured Thompson’s attention is one of just a few commercially available charandas outside of Mexico. The spirit is made from an equal blend of sugarcane juice distilled in a copper pot still and molasses distilled in a modified French-style column still . The sugarcane used for both ingredients is grown nearby in the region’s famed red, volcanic soil.
Though Thompson admittedly tries to avoid obsessing over things as he’s “already airing on the side of being a geeky bartender,” he says what’s exciting about this 92-proof rum is finding out what it can’t do.
“I was concerned I was only going to be able to put it in geeky bartender drinks, but increasingly I’ve just been using it as a white rum,” says Thompson. “It checks a lot of boxes for me.”
When Thompson first tasted the charanda, he says it reminded him of a rhum agricole thanks to its prominent heat and hogo funk. But, he adds that its underlying big fruit flavor—like “exploding, overripe pineapples”—masks the esters and any potential harshness.
So far, Uruapan Charanda Blanco is featured in two cocktails on the menu at Jaguar Sun: a spirit-forward pineapple Daiquiri (“a drink that we see reordered over and over again, which is really cool”) and the Very Strong Baby (recipe below), which combines the spirit with pear eau de vie, strawberry-infused Campari, and vermouth.
Another box this funky spirit checks for Thompson is its price—it retails at a very reasonable $26 for a liter.
“There’s a whole universe of things that are very delicious and also expensive,” he says. “I think a lot of the time your job as a bartender is to seek out that value that hasn’t been explored yet and then pass that along to people by making inexpensive, delicious drinks that lead a guest to want to come back.”
It doesn’t hurt that the bottle is eye-catching.
“The fact that it’s visually beautiful goes a really long way with guests,” says Thompson. “That’s what I learned with mezcal . It can help somebody who doesn’t want to have a conversation with you about ancestral rum styles from some of the smaller states in Mexico open their minds to, ‘I don’t care what that is, just give it to me in a drink.’”
Thompson’s newfound love of Uruapan Charanda Blanco has also encouraged him to seriously consider rums and other rum-like spirits from outside the same standard Caribbean islands —from clairins in Haiti to Brazilian cachaça.
“Sugarcane spirits in general are in the midst of a really exciting time,” he says. “Even though [charanda] is not a Caribbean rum where a lot of the [rum] conversation is coming from, it’s still tapped into this idea of making really great unadulterated spirit and being really transparent about it—I think that’s really important.” Very Strong Baby"
It’s Terrifyingly Easy to Get Measles Vaccine Exemptions,www.thedailybeast.com,Kaiser Health News,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/measles-vaccine-exemptions-are-terribly-easy-to-get,"Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty

As measles outbreaks continue in the Northwest and across the nation, newly revealed health records from Oregon suggest it’s surprisingly easy to opt out of required vaccinations in that state—as in several others.
In Oregon—which has the highest kindergarten vaccine exemption rate in the U.S.—about 95 percent of parents whose kids skip one or more vaccines use a print-your-own certificate to do so.
That’s according to data from the Oregon Health Authority, which shows that of more than 31,500 non-medical vaccine exemptions submitted last year, nearly 30,000 were documented by parents who watched an online education video and then printed out a do-it-yourself form.
Fewer than 2,000 chose the second option: to talk to a health care provider and obtain a signature.
The state, where 7.5 percent of kindergartners were exempt from one or more vaccines in the 2017-18 school year, has had an education requirement for non-medical exemptions in place since 2013.
But Oregon state Rep. Mitch Greenlick, a Democrat who has proposed a bill to eliminate non-medical vaccine exemptions , criticized the module.
“It’s obviously letting too many people off the hook,” he said.
It’s clear why parents are overwhelmingly choosing the online option, said Dr. Saad Omer, a vaccine and infectious-disease expert at Emory University in Atlanta: convenience.
Omer and other public health officials find this trend worrisome because kids who remain unvaccinated can catch—and spread—dangerous diseases such as measles, posing a risk to themselves and the wider community.
In the U.S. this year, at least 387 cases of measles have been detected in 15 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the cases are clustered in six outbreaks, including an outbreak centered in Clark County, Washington. The county is considered part of the Portland, Oregon, metro area, a well-known hot spot for vaccine hesitancy. At least 78 cases of measles have been linked to that outbreak, with four of those confirmed in Oregon. The state has reported six additional measles cases not linked to that outbreak.
Across the U.S., nearly all cases of the highly contagious disease have occurred in unvaccinated children, officials said.
Evidence shows, however, that making it more difficult to obtain vaccine exemptions can reduce the rates of those who opt out.
“The ease of exemption is a big predictor,” said Omer, who has been named the inaugural director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, starting in July.
He favors counseling by a health care provider as one good way to strengthen requirements. That not only makes it harder to get exemptions, but also puts parents in touch with “the most trusted source” of information, Omer said.
In Washington state, overall vaccine exemption rates fell by about 40% after passage of a 2011 law that required a health care provider’s signature on exemption forms, according to a 2018 study by Omer.
Oregon is one of 17 states that allow exemptions based on philosophical opposition to vaccination, as well as religious or medical reasons. Only three states — California, Mississippi and West Virginia — ban all non-medical exemptions.
In 10 of the states that allow personal or philosophical exemptions, a parent’s signature on a statement or a form is all that’s required to opt out. In three states, the paperwork has to be notarized. Only two states—Washington and Michigan—require consultation with a health care provider.
Since 2015, when Michigan began requiring parents to participate in an education session at their local health department, vaccine waiver rates fell from 4.8 percent in 2014 to 3.6 percent in 2017, said Lynn Sutfin, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.
Three states—Arkansas, Oregon and Utah—offer an online education option, which includes scientifically based information compiled by state health officials.
Utah, with a 5.2 percent kindergarten exemption rate, began allowing use of the 20-minute online education module last summer. Since then, more than 8,700 certificates have been printed, said Rich Lakin, immunization program manager for the Utah Department of Health.
But the new option is rife with problems, said Lakin. People have submitted fictitious names such as “Mickey Mouse” into the system, he said. Others have used the web-based portal to criticize health officials for requiring documentation for exemptions.
In Oregon, Greenlick’s proposed bill to ban non-medical vaccine exemptions sparked a firestorm of opposition, with hundreds of parents showing up at recent public hearings to protest. Action is pending. “People have submitted fictitious names such as 'Mickey Mouse' into the system. Others have used the web-based portal to criticize health officials for requiring documentation for exemptions.”
Jennifer Margulis, 49, of Ashland, Oregon, said she has used the state’s online education module to exempt all four of her children from some vaccine requirements. She said the video, which takes about 40 minutes, requires active participation—clicking through a series of screens.
“You really have to pay attention. It’s a lot of information,” she said. “I did not find it convenient. I found it interesting and time-consuming.”
She said the online option is a good alternative for parents who want to make their own choices about vaccination, despite scientific evidence and advice from public health officials.
One Oregon lawmaker, Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat from Margulis’ district, has opposed the bill banning non-medical vaccine exemptions, calling for “less sweeping and authoritarian options.”
But a legislative aide, Adam Lohman, said Golden wasn’t aware so many Oregonians were opting out of vaccinations using the online module. “He would be interested in an option that preserves parent choice and makes it more stringent,” Lohman said.

Ben Platt: My Sexuality Shouldn’t ‘Replace the Music Itself’,www.thedailybeast.com,Joseph.Longo@thedailybeast.com (Joseph Longo),04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/ben-platt-on-his-debut-album-sing-to-me-instead-and-coming-out-my-sexuality-shouldnt-replace-the-music-itself,"EASE MY MIND Ben Platt: My Sexuality Shouldn’t ‘Replace the Music Itself’ The ‘Dear Evan Hansen’ star just released his debut album, ‘Sing To Me Instead.’ It’s brought more public interest in his personal life than he’s ever experienced before. 04.03.19 5:06 AM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Getty
Ben Platt is having a bit of a hard time navigating the press tour for his debut album, Sing to Me Instead. The Broadway actor best known for originating the title role in the smash musical Dear Evan Hansen never publicly came out as gay. But in the press, it was more or less assumed: He’s a Tony-winning performer, he appeared in the first two films of the musical franchise Pitch Perfect , and he’s also close friends with fellow openly gay actors Jonathan Groff, Noah Galvin and Taylor Trensch. ( The latter two both separately filled his Evan Hansen shoes. )
Construing these tidbits as an admission of gayness is harmful and reinforces stereotypes—not all Broadway actors are necessarily into guys, for instance ( Hugh Jackman would disagree ). So for the first decade of Platt’s career, his sexuality was a topic never fully broached.
Then in February, Platt dropped three music videos for songs from Sing to Me Instead. “Ease My Mind” stood out for showcasing an intimate storyline between Platt and out gay actor Charlie Carver. Entertainment news outlets quickly seized on the video as Platt’s official declaration of gayness. Out magazine headlined their post, “ Dear Evan Hansen Star Ben Platt Comes Out In Emotional Video ,” while Page Six went safely vague with “Ben Platt gets candid about sexuality on new album.” On the other hand, People magazine, never one to shy away from a coming-out story, premiered the video accompanied by an interview with Platt without mentioning that it was the first time he had publicly spoken about his sexuality.
The problem, though, is Platt doesn’t want his debut album to be overshadowed by a declaration. Partially because it’s not news to him. The 25-year-old came out to his parents at age 12, a remarkably early age among gay men.
“I love that a byproduct has been being able to be representation for the queer community and to show that’s very much part of who I am, but also I don’t want that to replace the music itself,” Platt told The Daily Beast.
Inspired by the theatricality of Carole King, James Taylor and Adele, Sing to Me Instead largely follows the narrative arc of one man going through a breakup. Platt, who wrote on all songs, above all else wanted to be “authentic” and “transparent” on the album, so naturally—unconsciously, even—he used male pronouns. The 40 songs he whittled down to 12 became an amalgamation of his experiences with past boyfriends, the earliest dating back to high school.
So how does someone who never publicly came out but was never in the closet promote his immensely personal new record without being usurped by talk of his own sexuality? “It essentially came with the deal, part of the territory,” he said.
Platt has readily answered almost all prying questions into his personal life during the album’s intensive promo campaign, even retweeting a USA Today profile circuitously centered entirely on his gayness which called Sing to Me Instead “not a coming-out album.” After all, he has a lot riding on this album. It’s his first ever non-theatrical record. ( Platt is already a Grammy winner for Dear Evan Hansen .) But he’d prefer people focus more on “the songs that I hope people from all different walks of life, all different sexualities and ages can connect to.”
To prepare, he studied what has worked for other openly gay artists, especially Brandi Carlile, whose queerness is “part of the tapestry rather than the tapestry itself,” he said. Carlile, for instance, is openly gay, married to actress Catherine Shepherd and raising two daughters. She also happens to be a stellar Americana, bluegrass musician —an unexpected place for a queer artist to succeed. That’s the career Platt desires. “Hopefully, music and otherwise, we’re getting to the point where it’s part of an assumed reality,” Platt says. “I’m Jewish, from New York and also like dudes.” “Hopefully, music and otherwise, we’re getting to the point where it’s part of an assumed reality. I’m Jewish, from New York and also like dudes.” — Ben Platt
On the album, Platt focuses on universal themes like longing, adoration and regret. “All the sentiments are things people could find their way into, and [I] just kind of endow them with my own specificity so they felt as real as they could feel,” he said. “Bad Habit” is a tear-inducing retrospective on a long-gone relationship. On “In Case You Don’t Live Forever.” he ponders what romantic moves he’ll regret not making, while “Run Away” closes the album with hope that by the time true love comes around, settling down won’t seem so scary.
Comparisons to Sam Smith have accompanied the album—with its melancholy lyrics sung in a deep voice over dramatic melodies. Yet Platt is remarkably more multi-dimensional, at least compared to Smith’s debut In the Lonely Hour . It’s here again where it becomes difficult to not consider the impact of a mainstream, openly gay singer presenting not just the perceived shame of gay love but the also the beauty, the simplicity and the mix of it all. “Grow As We Grow,” inspired by a conversation with a former boyfriend on the car ride home from a day trip to Disneyland, follows his desire for them to work on themselves—together. “People,” Platt says, come down on both sides: those who know they’ll need to focus on themselves and those who have had success working on the personal even with a partner at their side.
Platt is trying his hardest to be sincere, but he’s never had to get so personal before. With Dear Evan Hansen , he was fed specific messages of intent and meaning for press interviews by the show’s production team. He’s quickly realizing with a solo album, he’s the producer, the star and the writer. He gets to control the message, but it’s unclear if he knows exactly what he wants to say. “It’s this scary feeling of people can pull whatever they want and focus on whatever they want and twist whatever they want, but I’m just trying to say only things that I would be happy to read.” READ THIS LIST"
"Bubble Tea Got Me Through College, So I Went to Where It All Started",www.thedailybeast.com,Tim Johnson,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/chun-shui-tang-tea-house-my-journey-to-where-bubble-tea-began,"MEMORY LANE Bubble Tea Got Me Through College, So I Went to Where It All Started My friends raved about this peculiar beverage but, a small-town kid, I couldn’t understand the allure. Eventually, when my workload at university grew, it became my comfort drink. 04.03.19 5:06 AM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Getty
Pouring the liquid into my plastic cup, it’s thick, and creamy, and steamy. “The locals still call it ‘pearl tea,’” culinary guide Ai-Jia Yu tells me, adding, somewhat mysteriously, and without further explanation, “they also call it Kung Fu tea—but not the martial art.” Soon enough, the small balls of silicone rise to the surface, and as the ice melts in my cup and the tea rapidly cools, I get ready to tip back a glass of bubble tea, in its very birthplace.
I am no stranger to bubble tea. Attending school in Montreal, I made frequent trips to the city’s one-street Chinatown and a small, very unpretentious restaurant there (I once saw a mouse scurry across the dining room) became a Friday night mainstay for me. My friends raved about this peculiar beverage but, a small-town kid, at first I couldn’t understand the allure—cold tea, sucked through a giant straw, big enough to inhale those chewy, mostly tasteless gobs of silicone. But eventually, when my workload at university got heavy, it became my comfort drink (and food).
On a trip back from a couple days at the picturesque resort town of Sun Moon Lake, I stop in Taichung, Taiwan’s second city, where it all began back in 1987. Since its invention back then, bubble tea has become a global phenomenon—some $2 billion is consumed every year, and that market is growing. Smaller and, arguably, cooler, than the capital Taipei, Taichung is a city of almost three million, and is home to the national science museum, the national symphony orchestra and the national fine arts museum. Before the workshop, I wandered around the massive, free-flowing National Taichung Theater, a 620,000-square-foot opera house that includes experimental dining spaces and whimsical shops and a wide variety of culinary and arts workshops.
Taichung has also become a magnet for the country’s hipsters. I bought a package of teabags—packed playfully into a record slip that featured, for some reason, a dog listening intently to a gramophone—at Miyahara Formosa, a former eye clinic built in 1927 where the smiling employees dress in vintage, vaguely military-style uniforms. The handsome, restored red-brick building later housed a government health office, then abandoned, becoming derelict before being restored into its current form. Now the handsome space sells sweets and records-that-aren’t-records and hosts an ice-cream shop where hungry locals (hipsters and non-hipsters alike) line up out the door to order decadent scoops piled high with toppings.
But I’m in town, mostly, for the bubble tea. As it turns out, the history of this milky, sugary, tapioca-y treat is somewhat complicated. Sitting at a table in the Chun Shui Tang Tea House for their Pearl Milk Tea Workshop, I have all the elements before me—bucket of ice, small plastic shaker, and a few more ingredients handmade here in house—sugar cane syrup, black tea, milk, and their own secret-recipe house-made black tapioca pearls. Yu addresses, first, the fact that it’s served cold. “This is a hot place, and we needed something refreshing,” she explains, quite practically—spring and summer in Taiwan is a very humid time.
The formula, pioneered by company founder Liu Han-Chieh, and then later by product development manager Lin Hsiu Hui, went through various incarnations, starting with a shaken black tea with sugar cane syrup in the early 1980s that became a phenomenon on its own. “When you shook it, you got bubbles—and that’s why we called it bubble tea.” The condensed milk and the tapioca—the latter a popular element in local desserts—came a bit later. “She thought, ‘I like milk tea, and I like tapioca—what would it be like together?’”
The resulting concoction spread across Taiwan—now there’s a bubble tea joint everywhere you turn—and to neighboring countries, to Japan, and Korea, and on to Southeast Asia, eventually brought to North America by Taiwanese moving abroad. Vendors now sell hundreds of different varieties of the tea, and Chun Shui Tang alone sells some 80 different varieties. Employees undergo a rigorous, months-long training program to learn the special culture of the place—and how to make all those 80 drinks. You can also find a menu of typical Taiwanese snacks and light meals, which includes everything from Kung Pao chicken to braised bean curds, and pickled cabbage (and French fries, if that’s more your thing).
Yu walks me through the process, combining the various elements in the shaker, showing me the perfect finger placement to leverage an optimal, 30-second shake. As I pour it from the shaker, hot, over the ice, the tea comes out pleasantly foamy—Yu approves. Taking a first sip, the liquid goes down easily, crisp and cool, sweet but not cloying. I take a moment to drink and chew on the tapioca, too.
As she hands me certificate inscribed in both English and Chinese recognizing my successful completion of the course, I ask Yu if they expected this hometown beverage’s rather astounding global popularity. “It was really surprising. We never thought it would spread all over the world,” she says. “But we knew it was special, and wanted to share it.” And I got to enjoy it here, where it all began—a long way from winter in Montreal, no snow outside, no mice inside, just a fresh, foamy cup in front of me.

Here’s How Venezuela’s ‘Interim President’ Blew His Chance to Oust Maduro,www.thedailybeast.com,Annika Hernroth-Rothstein,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/juan-guaido-heres-how-venezuelas-interim-president-blew-his-chance-to-oust-maduro,"Frederico Parra/Getty
CARACAS, Venezuela—It was like the return of the king.
Juan Guaidó landed at Simon Bolívar Airport on Monday, March 5, at around noon EST, and the entire world was watching as he got out of the presidential plane. After live-tweeting his every move since leaving Venezuela on Feb. 22—including a viral video from inside the plane upon landing—the interim president walked the few hundred yards from the plane to immigration while the entire country held its breath.
Guaidó looked calm, almost cocky, as he passed through immigration and out into the streets to be met by thousands of adoring followers who had come to greet the man who represents hope and change in one of the world’s most broken countries. It appeared to be a success story, but according to most experts, this was not the expected outcome.
I’m having drinks with three senior diputados from the National Assembly a few days before Guaidó’s return and we’re discussing his absence. And, as I questioned the logic of it, they assured me that it was all going according to plan. He would sacrifice himself for the people.
""We need a hero. President Guaidó will return and be arrested and when he is, the intervention will happen and Maduro will be removed.”
And there is no question that Guaidó fits the bill.
I saw him for the first time a few weeks prior at Plaza Las Mercedes, right after he declared himself the rightful President of Venezuela. The masses had been gathering since the early morning and when I reached the square an hour before the set start time, there were already around 10,000 people waving flags and yelling for Nicolás Maduro’s resignation. Someone was throwing money in the air, stacks of useless Venezuelan currency, while holding a sign saying “Venezuela SOS.”
There was a strange mix of frustration and joy, as if these people were teetering on the edge of hope, but knew too much to fully give into it. Once Guaidó came on, the joy took over and even though he said nothing new or particularly surprising, he was greeted as a savior.
As powerful as the moment was, I could not help but think that it was reminiscent of 1998 and that other time the Venezuelan people chose an underdog to be the fixer of all things, a man named Hugo Chávez.
I spent the day before the Plaza Las Mercedes rally talking to my Venezuelan friend Alex, who is also a journalist and has seen Venezuela change from Chávez to Maduro. He sees a red thread throughout Venezuela’s modern political history.
According to Alex, Guaidó was always a placeholder and a lightning rod for a movement but wouldn't end up being president this time around, should it come down to a vote.
“Guaidó garners a cult of personality because my country has a historical preference for caudillos , the military-style authoritarians, and because he brought back a long-lost faith in politicians among everyday Venezuelans, but he will not end up being the president—he is just the precursor to real change.”
When asked who will be the magical third candidate, Alex immediately mentions Leopoldo López, the Voluntad Popular politician and former mayor of Chacao currently under house arrest. López has the credibility, Alex says, but without the stain of internal struggles that have plagued Guaidó since his grand declaration on Jan. 23.
“Guaidó is opening a lot of doors, but I doubt that he will end up walking through them.”
Guaidó’s path to the presidential palace, Miraflores, is not a given, and this is hardly the opposition’s first attempt to remove Maduro.
In the 2015 election, the opposition won the congress by a vast majority—113 opposition against 54 chavistas. In 2016 the supreme court ruled against the congress and said they were in violation of the constitution, tying their hands and rendering them politically impotent.
In July of that year, the opposition organized an unofficial referendum to put pressure on Maduro, calling for new legislative and judicial authorities and a transitional government. The Venezuelan people responded en masse, over 7 million people showing up to vote, but in the end the opposition chose not to use the overwhelming vote of no confidence against Maduro to take the issue further and it remained a symbolic non-action.
Over the next six months, protests erupted throughout Venezuela and over 230 protesters were killed by government forces and entities. By mid-2017, the government was cornered and it seemed the opposition had its moment to deliver the final blow. But when the cornered government called for dialogue, the opposition—rather than standing its ground—chose to accept Maduro’s offer.
As soon as the talks started the street protests died down. Maduro was able to regain his footing, and the opposition rolled over despite its overwhelming public support and broad congressional majority.
In 2018, there was another missed opportunity. Based on what they viewed as unconstitutional and unfair conditions the opposition chose not to participate in the elections.
The government paid two candidates to play the role of opposition, thus claiming a fair election, but rather than stage protests or attempt to enter the election to prove malfeasance they continued to complain from the sidelines, allowing the Maduro-directed charade to go on.
The elections were held on May 20, with only 25 percent of voters participating. Maduro received 6 million votes, 1.5 million less than in 2013 following the death of Chávez, but despite these numbers and the results being widely disputed both inside and outside the country, the opposition did very little. It was as if they were waiting for Guaidó.
This self-declared president offered hope to a people who had all but given up and when he publicly challenged Maduro, calling him a dictator and a usurper, the people responded. Once again people took to the streets by the tens of thousands. The fight had been ignited once more, but the renewed hope rested solely on one man’s shoulders and what his supporters didn’t know was that he would end up buckling under the weight.
""The opposition is failing because Guaidó bit off more than he could chew and now it looks like he’s improvising. He shouldn’t have left the country and relied on the international support. He lost national support by doing this. The fight is here in Caracas, not in Colombia or the U.S.”
Luis is a journalist who chose to leave Venezuela for Miami in 2005 but came back in 2017, thinking his country was about to change. Since then he has been thrown between hope and despair and with this latest fumble from the opposition, he has gone from loss of hope to outright rage.
""These people [the opposition politicians] are afraid of the street, of us! They are obsessed with this international support and finding a diplomatic solution, but they seem to be forgetting about all of the millions of people fighting on the streets and who give a damn about democracy.”
And he’s not alone in his anger. Guaidó is losing momentum, fast, and he has placed himself in the perilous position where his only salvation would be getting arrested or worse, thus fulfilling the promises made by him as well as in his name.
This focus on him as a person and the sole responsibility it brings fits perfectly into what Alex said about a culture that awaits a new messiah and, failing that, will try to build a cult of personality around a might-be messiah. Regardless of who will end up holding the presidency after this crisis, the focus remains on the individual rather than the ideology.
It is striking how little of this debate about Venezuela’s future has been a referendum on socialism, given the policies that brought the country to this point of no return. According to the opposition politicians I spoke to earlier in the week, the country has no real concept of socialism.
“When Chávez ran for president he only said the word socialism once. Once. He ran on a platform of socialism and implemented socialist policies, but he made sure to stay away from that word.”
Maybe that is why the political discourse in Venezuela has devolved into a cult of personality and why ideology is less of a factor in this crisis. The people in 1998 did not vote for a socialist ideology but for a person who promised them hope and 21 years later they are rallying in the streets for another man offering the very same thing.
Juan Guaidó may have international support, but within his own National Assembly his decision to declare himself President on January 23 came as a surprise. He has chosen not to bring the issue to a vote in the Assembly and rather position himself as a liberator who stands above the system within which he operates.
When I went to Las Mercedes rally a few weeks ago I saw women in the front holding pictures of the Virgin Mary and statues of Jesus and they were chanting Guaidó’s name.
I asked another group of women holding a large Venezuelan flag with Guaidó's name written all over it why they think he is the answer to the country’s problems and one of them said that he is the only one who stands up to Maduro and doesn’t back down.
“Guaidó has gotten the entire world to listen to us, and now Maduro has no place to go, no option but to step down.”
It is a beautiful sentiment but it seems to have been a misguided one, as Maduro so far has resisted the impulse to try to exterminate the competition. If Maduro continues to play it this safe he will most likely be able to kill off the opposition without harming a hair on Guaidó’s head, by simply watching them misplay their hand at every turn.
As the country has been hit by repeated massive blackouts, further crippling an already suffering population, public outrage is not merely directed at Nicolás Maduro but also at interim President Guaidó and an opposition that is expecting other actors to make the final push that the majority of the nation is waiting for.
“Enough with these rallies and the inspirational speeches—when are we marching on Miraflores?”
Luis’s frustrated words are echoed throughout the city, and the frustration is growing by the day as the divide between the political class and the people deepens, almost three months into this crisis.
In an attempt to re-mobilize, the opposition has been holding rallies throughout the country in the past few days, pointing to the blackouts and water shortages as yet another proof of Nicolás Maduro’s mismanagement of Venezuela, but the messaging seems to be either outdated or overdone as the public’s response is somewhat lackluster.
Guaidó himself is said to be working on a plan to turn the military and get it to help forcibly remove Maduro and, even though he doesn’t speak of it publicly, keep the paramilitary groups from taking over in the ensuing vacuum of power.
This plan would in all likelihood exclude an international military intervention, but trusting the Venezuelan military could turn out to be a crapshoot as its loyalties have yet to be truly tested. The country could end up having an Egypt-style interim military government, leaving the opposition behind and, for the third time in less than a decade, cheating the Venezuelan people out of their counter-revolution.
Letting the military lead could be the only viable option, especially given the recent arrival of Russian troops in Venezuela, but it will be a very hard sell to a public that has accepted Guaidó as its leader and been sold the dream of a heroic liberator. The opposition has relied on the traditional narrative and Juan Guaidó as the face of change and, given the massive public distrust toward the military and all other government entities, replacing him with it would mean risking any goodwill and momentum that remains.
Guaidó’s massive popularity may end up being his downfall, as he has become synonymous with the struggle for freedom. If he fails, the opposition fails with him and if that is the case Venezuela will be ruled by an emboldened Maduro, having survived the biggest challenge to his authority since he took office.
Guaidó has been presented and portrayed as the Messiah and as such he is expected to bring a miracle, and that is exactly what it will take now for the opposition to regain its upper hand after dropping the ball during the standoff over the humanitarian aid and spending much of his time nurturing an international alliance that so far has delivered little but beautiful promises, empty threats, and worsened privations.
Miracles are a tall order for any man at any time but for Venezuela today, they are just a recipe for disappointment, most likely another failed attempt at a new start. Should that be the outcome, the Venezuelan people’s fragile hope and freshly renewed faith in the political process would surely not recover and the nation would be left ripe for the picking to everyone from Maduro to Vladimir Putin to Hezbollah and all their interloping entities.
The hope expressed at Plaza Las Mercedes was lost somewhere between Caracas and Cúcuta and whether or not it will return is dependent on the opposition’s ability to retake the initiative from Nicolás Maduro and win back the hearts of its rightfully distrusting supporters.
The only thing everyone I spoke to seems to agree on is that time is running out and public patience along with it; the people want to take Miraflores while the opposition simply seems to want to take its time.
It has been just over two months since Juan Guaidó made that historic announcement and 30 million people thought they were weeks away from regime change. Now, Maduro is preparing for war and Juan Guaidó needs to choose his players—or at least a strategy—before he simply loses on walkover. The shine is off the halo and the Messiah is at risk of being exposed as just another man, unless he can pull off a last-minute resurrection. READ THIS LIST"
"Under Trump’s Ban, Transgender Troops Must Decide: Come Out or Hide",www.thedailybeast.com,samantha.allen@thedailybeast.com (Samantha Allen),04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/under-trumps-ban-transgender-troops-must-decide-come-out-or-hide,"CATCH-22 Under Trump’s Ban, Transgender Troops Must Decide: Come Out or Hide After April 12 new trans recruits will be forbidden, while serving trans troops will be forced to pick between having medical treatment for gender dysphoria and keeping their jobs.

The transgender troop ban will be like a door slamming shut.
When the policy goes into effect on April 12, openly transgender people won’t be able to get into the military—and many who are already inside will have to hide who they are, forced to pick between seeking medical treatment for gender dysphoria and keeping their jobs.
Mental health experts warn that will be a terrible double bind for transgender troops.
“We certainly have data to suggest that living with gender dysphoria or any kind of distress—just the day in, day out chronic stress of having an incongruence between one’s identity and one’s biological sex at birth—causes a range of physical and mental health problems,” Dr. Ashli Owen-Smith, a behavioral scientist at Georgia State University’s School of Public Health, told The Daily Beast.
Those problems include depression, anxiety, and increased suicidal ideation. As for treatment, the evidence is clear: transition-related medical care can have a positive impact on transgender mental health , as several studies have shown, and having that care withheld can have a negative impact , exacerbating other mental health problems.
As Dr. Owen-Smith explained: “It makes sense that if [treatment] is something that you want and that you feel that you need but you can’t access, then that creates even more distress than the distress you’re already experiencing just living with gender dysphoria.”
Now that all of the preliminary injunctions against the troop ban have been dissolved in accordance with a January Supreme Court ruling , the new policy on transgender military service will go into effect in a little over a week.
Many transgender service members, as The Daily Beast has previously reported, are currently scrambling to get a gender dysphoria diagnosis in time so that they can remain in the military under the policy’s grandfather clause.
But others already know they won’t be able to meet the deadline.
That means they’ll have to suppress their transgender identity if they want to stay in the service. Under the guidelines distributed by the Pentagon , transgender service members will be required to serve according to “the standards associated with their biological sex” and cannot “serve in their preferred gender.”
Receiving a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, while technically permissible, could very well mean discharge: If a military doctor says that a service member needs to transition “to protect the health of the individual”—and medical associations have said that transition-related health care is indeed necessary in many cases—that service member cannot stay.
One transgender male West Point cadet, who spoke to The Daily Beast on condition of anonymity because he could lose his commission if he comes out, wants to keep his identity hidden from military medical providers for precisely this reason.
This cadet might have been able to secure a gender dysphoria diagnosis before April 12, but because there will be a break in service between his forthcoming graduation from West Point and his commission, he wasn’t entirely certain that it would be safe to do so. “If nothing ends up changing and the ban does go into effect, then I probably won’t be able to stay in a whole 20 [years] because I will need to transition at some point, just for my own mental state.”
“If there’s any chance that I’d be denied my commission, I wouldn’t want to take it because my main goal right now is commission,” he told The Daily Beast.
That means he will continue serving, not knowing when or if it will be possible for him to one day serve openly. He wanted to make a career out of military service. Now, he’s not so sure.
“If nothing ends up changing and the ban does go into effect, then I probably won’t be able to stay in a whole 20 [years] because I will need to transition at some point, just for my own mental state,” he said.
Forced to weigh his need to transition against his desire to serve, this West Point cadet says that he has found some comfort in friendship with other cadets, who “don’t really care” if anyone is transgender “if you can do your job or if you can accomplish the mission.”
Indeed, studies have found that social support can be beneficial for transgender people. But that support can only carry him so far.
“They’re supportive and all,” the West Point cadet said of his friends, “and that helps get me through the rough patches, but I don’t know how long I can do that for, so that might be the difference between me serving five years and serving 20.”
Dr. Jamison Green, chair of the ethics committee for the World Professional Association of Transgender Health, believes that this policy will have a chilling effect on transgender service members who have yet to transition and will now be barred from doing so.
“The impact of this policy is not medically or ethically benign,” he told The Daily Beast.
For one, Dr. Green noted, closeted transgender service members may be afraid to discuss a wide array of mental health issues with military providers for fear of being diagnosed with gender dysphoria and potentially discharged.
“No doubt there are other medical conditions that service members may wish to conceal from their command staff because reporting the condition might lead to discharge,” said Green.
The West Point cadet who spoke with The Daily Beast said that he will have to “figure out what I can and can’t say to certain people”—a strategy that recalls the era of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell for cisgender gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members. But he also sympathizes with those service members who need more urgent help, and now may be dissuaded from seeking it.
“I think for some people it might be difficult because they don’t want to risk getting kicked out but they still do need help—and it’s important to get that help if you need it,” he said. “It’s sad that people probably will be deterred from getting the help that they need because they don’t want to get kicked out on accident.”
In a statement to The Daily Beast, a Department of Defense spokesperson reiterated the details of the policy and said, “We encourage all service members to consult a military medical provider for any medical issue they may have,” adding that “the military provides all necessary medical care to protect the health of our service members, including those who are in the process of being separated.” “Providing care for individuals who need care is about much more than dollars and cents”
In his initial tweets on the subject of transgender military service in July 2017, President Trump implied that there would be “tremendous medical costs involved.”
But not only is the cost of providing transition-related care minuscule relative to the military’s medical budget, the cost of forcing troops to stay in the closet could be much greater, experts warn, considering that a lack of treatment can exacerbate other conditions.
“Providing care for individuals who need care is about much more than dollars and cents,” Owen-Smith said, “but I suspect that if we were to conduct a more rigorous cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analysis, we would probably see that preventing these conditions is cost savings, rather than trying to treat them after they’ve already occurred.”
In the absence of conclusive data to that effect, though, Owen-Smith stressed that under a “moral and ethical framework,” providing medical treatment to transgender troops is “about taking care of one another and making sure that all of our citizens have access to the health care that they need.”
Indeed, the core issue, as Green noted, is that transgender service members who receive a diagnosis after April 12 will face “overt denial of care on the basis of a diagnosis that has not been proven to—and in fact does in no way—limit their capacity to serve.”
“This policy singles out a medical condition for discrimination on no basis other than animus and its imposition is antithetical to its stated purpose of maintaining military cohesion and readiness,” he said.
For at least one West Point cadet surrounded by supportive peers, the cruelty of that policy is baffling. “Other cadets and other soldiers don’t really care as long as the mission gets accomplished and everyone’s safe doing it,” he told The Daily Beast. “I don’t know why it’s such a big deal when it’s just people being themselves.”"
"On Middle East Peace, the White House Turns to... Alan Dershowitz",www.thedailybeast.com,betsy.woodruff@thedailybeast.com (Betsy Woodruff) asawin.suebsaeng@thedailybeast.com (Asawin Suebsaeng),04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/alan-dershowitz-says-hes-advising-trump-and-jared-kushner-on-middle-east-peace,"04.03.19 4:58 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty
Alan Dershowitz, the celebrity lawyer famous in the Trump era for criticizing the president’s legal antagonists on Fox News , has consulted with senior White House officials on efforts to negotiate a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians, The Daily Beast has learned.
“I’ve consulted with them about it,” Dershowitz told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. He said he has discussed the issue with Jared Kushner, special envoy Jason Greenblatt, Ambassador David Friedman, and President Trump himself.
While not a career diplomat, Dershowitz has written multiple books about Israel, and is working on a forthcoming one to be titled Defending Israel: The Story of My Relationship with My Most Challenging Client . He said he also discussed the Israeli/Palestinian peace process with members of the Obama administration. And over his years in public life, he’s built relationships with a number of powerful Israeli politicians.
Dershowitz said he has discussed relations between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority with the president’s team. And he said he spoke with White House advisers before they rolled out some of their biggest decisions on the issue, including moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing the Golan Heights as part of Israel .
“I compared the Golan Heights to a captured battleship,” he said. “I said, ‘You don’t give back a battleship you’ve captured in a defensive war.”
He added that if the Syrian regime controlled the Golan Heights, “they’d send barrel bombs with poisoned gas” down onto Israeli targets, “as they did to their own civilians.”
He said he and Kushner have also discussed the long-promised Israeli/Palestinian peace plan .
“We’ve had general conversations,” he said. “It changes all the time. I’m not privy to the specifics, the current specifics, but mostly it’s been one-way conversations—that is, they ask for my advice. They don’t tell me their secrets. They just ask me for my advice, and I give it to them.”
He said he also spoke with members of the Obama administration about the Israeli/Palestinian peace process.
“The president invited me to the Oval Office,” he said. “I was invited to speak to his national security team. In the end, they didn’t listen.”
“They listened to me very politely,” he added, of the Obama administration, “but they didn’t always agree. I’m sure that this administration won’t agree with everything I support either.”
Dershowitz said he was brought in at very start of the Trump administration, and that their talks have been episodic.
A source close to the president confirmed that, saying Trump encouraged senior officials—including Kushner—to keep Dershowitz in the loop on these matters from the first days of his presidency. The president has also stressed to those close to him that Dershowitz could be helpful because of his friendship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
“This Administration’s belief is that our peace efforts aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict benefit from the input and feedback from numerous experts, groups, and communities,” a Trumpadministration official told The Daily Beast on Tuesday, without weighing in on Dershowitz specifically. “We have met with Israelis, Palestinians, Americans, and a host of other interested parties and partners from a variety of backgrounds.”
Dershowitz, a Democrat who donated to Hillary Clinton, has received plaudits over the years from some conservatives for his staunch support for Israel. “Why does the media continue encouraging Hamas violence?” he asked last year in an opinion piece for The Hill .
The year before that, he published another piece defending the president, writing about “why Trump is right in recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital.”
Dershowitz has claimed that his defenses of Trump, particularly regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, have made him a social pariah among the liberal, elite crowd on Martha’s Vineyard. The New York Times published multiple articles chronicling what Dershowitz called “McCarthyism com[ing] to Martha’s Vineyard.”
His impassioned defenses have, however, helped him cultivate a powerful friend. Since 2017, Trump has favorably tweeted about Dershowitz almost a dozen times. “A must watch: Legal Scholar Alan Dershowitz was just on @foxandfriends talking of what is going on with respect to the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history. Enjoy!” the president posted in December 2017."
"This Is What It’s Like to Be Gay in Brunei, Where LGBT People Can Now Get Stoned to Death",www.thedailybeast.com,tim.teeman@thedailybeast.com (Tim Teeman),04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-is-what-its-like-to-be-gay-in-brunei-where-lgbt-people-can-now-get-stoned-to-death,"Travel LIFE AND DEATH This Is What It’s Like to Be Gay in Brunei, Where LGBT People Can Now Get Stoned to Death Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Photo Courtesy Shahiran Shahrani Wednesday, despite world outrage, Brunei legalizes the stoning to death of LGBT people. A gay asylum seeker from the country describes a scared LGBT population ‘going underground.’ Tim Teeman 04.03.19 4:58 AM ET
S hahiransheriffuddin bin Shahrani Muhammad, a gay asylum seeker from Brunei now living in Vancouver, has been talking to friends in Brunei about the law to stone gays to death , which comes into effect Wednesday, April 3.
“Shah” (as his friends know him) told The Daily Beast his gay friends were nervous, afraid, and becoming more and more isolated as the impact of the new law hits home. He wanted to use his full name, he said. It makes him feel safer to be open.
The law in the Southeast Asian country, ruled by the Sultan of Brunei as an absolute monarchy, will impose death by stoning or whipping for sodomy, adultery or rape, and amputation of a hand or foot for theft.
Following international outrage, the Brunei Prime Minister’s office claimed in an unapologetic, doubling-down statement that the new anti-gay stoning law was intended “to educate, respect and protect the legitimate rights of all individuals, society or nationality of any faiths and race.”
George Clooney and Elton John have called for boycotts of the Sultan’s international hotels, while—after nearly 24 hours of ignoring Daily Beast requests for comment last week—the U.S. State Department told us exclusively that the Trump administration was “concerned” about the new stoning law, but would not condemn Brunei for introducing it.
Britain, the European Union, and the U.N. have all condemned the law.
For gay people in the country, the practical implications of the new law are sinking in. In a country where homosexuality is illegal, LGBT people are already cautious and private; this new law, said Shah, has made them even more fearfully so.
“I think we all think the same thing: the burden of proof is high,” said Shah. “Four people have to have seen you have gay sex. Imagine that, unless it’s an orgy, and you all testify against each other. People make jokes like that, but there is nothing to laugh at.”
“People are becoming paranoid,” said Shah. “They are nervous about talking to each other. Things will go underground.” And this in a country already without LGBT meeting places or groups. Gay men meet each other using social networking apps.
A Facebook post Shah wrote critical of the government’s then-new guidelines about halal certification led to Shah being charged with sedition in 2017. “People wouldn’t talk to me, friends wouldn’t talk to me. Eventually, I took an illegal taxi across the border into Malaysia. I made sure no one was following me,” he said. He arrived in Canada in September 2018.
Shah reminds his friends that even if a burden of proof isn’t reached, homosexuality is still illegal in Brunei and gays can still be thrown in jail for up to 10 years or face a sizable fine. “Or all of that all at once. Then there’s the shame and guilt of it all, you will be constantly reminded of it by your family.” “ Another friend has had a partner of 10 years. They just decided not to see each other so much. They are afraid of being discovered. And they have been together for 10 years! This is what this law does; it makes gay people paranoid, nervous, mistrustful. ”
“My best friend and I spoke,” Shah said. “He told me, he and other LGBT people are stopping talking to each other, because they are worried about people finding out about them. Another friend has had a partner of 10 years. They just decided not to see each other so much. They are afraid of being discovered. And they have been together for 10 years! This is what this law does; it makes gay people paranoid, nervous, mistrustful. A lot of gay people will try and isolate themselves from other people to be completely safe,” said Shah. “I’m not sure how long it will go on for. A lot of people will see psychiatrists and psychologists.”
Shah’s friends hope they won’t fall foul of the new law or be affected by it, but Shah has reminded them it has happened to him. He cannot live in his homeland, he is estranged from his family. He has had to start a new life. A 40-year-old out-gay critic of the Sultan of Brunei’s regime, he fears for his life if he is made to return to the country, especially given the new law.
“LGBT+ people in Brunei don't often talk openly about things like this and this is no exception,” said Matthew Woolfe, founder of human rights group The Brunei Project. “For the most part, they tend to try to lay low and get through it. From those LGBT+ with whom I have connected with, there is a real fear about these laws and what is going to happen to them. I know of one person who is considering leaving the country and am aware of another who has already done so out of fear about what the future holds.”
There is little chance of persuading the government of Brunei to reverse its decision.
“The commencement order (for the new law) is an official government order that was posted on the website of the Attorney General's Chambers so there is every reason to believe that the Government is serious about implementing these final phases (of the Syariah Penal Code),” Woolfe told The Daily Beast.
“After years of repeatedly delaying implementation, this was the first time the Government gave an actual date for the laws to come into effect. To now not proceed with implementation after committing to a date would undermine the Government’s credibility.”
“What we want to see most of all is diplomatic pressure placed on Brunei,” said Woolfe. “I think that is the best chance we have of seeing these laws revoked so I encourage people to lobby their governments to take action. Governments should be taking every opportunity to place whatever pressure they can on Brunei to revoke these laws. They need to stop being so passive in their approach and really apply pressure. They need to make these violators of human rights believe that it is in their best interests to stop the violations.”
“I think that it is very unlikely that the laws being introduced will be reversed or revoked once implemented,” said Woolfe. “I think that all we can hope for at best is that they are never carried out and there is a good chance that they won't be.”
On Tuesday, when asked by The Daily Beast, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the State Department again would not directly condemn the new law.
On Tuesday evening, Robert Palladino, the department's deputy spokesperson, reissued statements already sent to The Daily Beast last Friday.
“Brunei’s decision to implement Phases Two and Three of the Sharia Penal Code and associated penalties runs counter to its international human rights obligations, including with respect to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
“All governments have an obligation to ensure that all people can freely enjoy the universal human rights and fundamental freedoms to which they are entitled. The United States strongly opposes violence, criminalization and discrimination targeting vulnerable groups, including women at risk of violence, religious and ethnic minorities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) persons.
“We continue to encourage Brunei to ratify and implement the United Nations Convention Against Torture, which it signed in 2015, and to sign, ratify, and implement the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.”
As well as declining to condemn Brunei, the State Department did not respond to questions from The Daily Beast on the existence or nature of any discussions Secretary of State Pompeo or officials had had with the Brunei government about the new law.
Shah was born and bought up in Brunei, though he attended boarding school in Britain. He spent 11 years in the U.K. from 17 to 28, where he lived a more open gay life and had boyfriends, then returned to Brunei and worked in health promotion. It “became more and more frustrating” from going from living an out life to a closeted one.
“Brunei is a very conservative country, in politics, religion and social views,” said Woolfe. “It is very hard for people to truly express themselves and this goes for not only LGBT+ but everyone really. It is harder for LGBT+ though because they are expected to conform to certain ideas and views about how they should act, look and live their lives.
“There are also no community-focused services available within the country that can provide LGBT+ people with information and support, so LGBT+ often have to rely on their own private networks for that support and if they don't have a strong network of people they can trust, it can be very lonely.
“Plus, there is also the fact that homosexual acts have a long history of criminalization in Brunei, which extends back to the time of British colonial rule, and this helps add to the stigma surrounding LGBT+.” “ I think LGBT people, LGBT Muslims, are a test of the established religion. I was born this way, what are they going to do about that? They condemn us, but God made us this way. By criminalizing us, killing us, they are failing God’s test, they are saying that God is wrong. ”
Shah’s Muslim faith continues to mean a lot to him. He grew up knowing that being LGBT was wrong in his religion. “But this is my faith. I still pray five times a day, observe Ramadan. My faith is very strong. I still consider myself a Muslim. I think LGBT people, LGBT Muslims, are a test of the established religion. I was born this way, what are they going to do about that? They condemn us, but God made us this way. By criminalizing us, killing us, they are failing God’s test, they are saying that God is wrong.”
Asked what being gay in Brunei was like, Shah said, “Quiet. It’s easy enough to find people if you have the app. And the app is a great metaphor to describe the LGBT community in Brunei: you won’t see any face on it unless it is a foreigner’s. Even when you meet someone either one of you can be so nervous identifying the other in public that you sometimes don’t meet. That’s how careful people are. You don’t give real names, or where you work. People hide, and it puts great strain on your relationships if you fall in love.”
Shah fell in love with only one Bruneian man. They were together for five years, but eventually the boyfriend’s family told him that he shouldn’t see Shah any more. They were worried that their neighbors had noticed Shah coming to visit too much. “We tried to keep on going, but it got too difficult. We had normal relationship issues, and all of the other stuff of being gay in Brunei on top of that. It was too much.”
A Brunei-based psychiatrist he saw had been helpful and positive. Some, he said, tell LGBT clients “to act straight so they can fly under the radar. They are not saying being gay is wrong—I have never heard any psychiatrist say that—but in this country it is more advice to be safe. Growing up, I tried to be ‘straight acting.’ Those who acted ‘gay' were seen as gay or trans. Bruneians don’t make any difference between the two. It’s so screwed up, and those people who are trans have the worst of the hassle and bad attitudes because they are the most visible.”
As a boy, Shah had been attracted to other boys, but “never admitted” it to himself. “I had girlfriends, but preferred looking at their ex-boyfriends,” he said. “Boarding school in England was as homophobic as Brunei sometimes.” He came out in the U.K. at university.
His mother would “throw suspicions” in his face about the friends he bought home to play games with—“but mostly they were straight and we were playing World of Warcraft.”
His sister would never stop matchmaking. His Chinese father would try to pair him with “nice Chinese girls.” To escape, Shah would go to gay bars in “KK,” Kota Kinabalu, in Malaysia.
“None of my family accept the fact I am gay. When I came out to my sister over the phone from here, I said, ‘You do know I’m gay.’ She said for the millionth time that she hoped I would find ‘the right girl.’ In her own way she’s trying to understand.”
He came out by text to his parents. “I told them because I’m being open, and telling the media about what it is like to be gay in Brunei. That’s why my family isn’t talking to me. I love them very much, and in a way I’m glad they’re not talking to me. I didn’t feel safe, but I have felt more safe naming myself and sharing my story. I want people to know that I am here, who I am, and what my story is. “ I fear for my life if I ever go back. I have never encountered anyone like me before: somebody openly gay from Brunei. I know I’ve pissed off the authorities. ”
“In Brunei I am seen as a traitor, so this way my family can claim no knowledge of me and be safe from the authorities. Distant family members keep an eye on them for me. I like to think we can repair our relationship in time.”
He doesn’t know when he will see his family again. “I fear for my life if I ever go back. I have never encountered anyone like me before: somebody openly gay from Brunei. I know I’ve pissed off the authorities. People who work in the civil service have told me to be careful if I go back. They won’t let what I’ve said go. I don’t think they’d execute me straight off. There would be a show trial.”
As well as the authorities, Shah is also nervous about the possibility of mob violence against LGBT people in Brunei. He is also concerned with the new Sharia laws affect women. A female friend has a non-Muslim male partner, who he is concerned for—""anyone who in their private lives goes against what the law says.”
Clooney and John’s hotel boycott would have no material effect, he said, but was still a useful international awareness-raising exercise. “There is also the Asian concept of ‘having face’ and trying to preserve that—and Bruneians being aware of the detrimental way the world sees them.”
Even if the anti-LGBT laws were changed, Shah said, “the culture would have to change too. It would take a lot, a revolution in political and public attitudes to make Bruneians OK with people being LGBT.” “ If you cannot get out, I would say to go to see a psychiatrist or psychologist who can help you find the healthiest way to survive this, and feel OK about yourself. ”
In Vancouver, Shah is planning on getting a work permit and then a job, maybe in health promotion as he was in Brunei, or do something to ‘give back to the community,’ like volunteering. And “find somebody to settle down to live with.”
Vancouver is a big city, Shah said, but has quite a small gay scene. “I was out shopping and saw two men holding hands. First, I thought, ‘Why can’t I have that? When can I have that?’ And then I thought, ‘There aren’t so many gay bars here because people literally don’t need them.’”
To LGBT people in Brunei, Shah says, “Stay safe, try to get out.”
“I have no hope really,” he added. “If you cannot get out, I would say to go to see a psychiatrist or psychologist who can help you find the healthiest way to survive this, and feel OK about yourself. Help strengthen your mental defenses—anything to get through it.”"
Tony Hale on the End of ‘Veep’ and ‘Arrested Development’,www.thedailybeast.com,matt.wilstein@thedailybeast.com (Matt Wilstein),04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-last-laugh-podcast-tony-hale-on-the-end-of-veep-and-arrested-development,"THE LAST LAUGH Tony Hale on the End of ‘Veep’ and ‘Arrested Development’ On episode two of ‘The Last Laugh’ podcast, Emmy-winning actor Tony Hale tells us what comes next now that his two iconic shows are both ending.
Subscribe to Th e Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts
Tony Hale is not Buster Bluth. He’s also not Gary Walsh. And that’s a good thing, because his two iconic TV characters are both deeply awkward people.
When Hale arrived to record the second episode of The Last Laugh podcast , he exuded a warmth and ease that is often hard to find in Buster or Gary but seems to come naturally to the 48-year-old actor.
Hale has won two Emmy Awards for playing the ultra-loyal servant to Julia Louis-Dreyfus’ Selina Meyer on Veep, which just premiered its seventh and final season on HBO this past Sunday. Before taking on that role, he was best known as the youngest Bluth sibling on Arrested Development , which just wrapped up what the actor says is almost certainly its final season on Netflix last month—16 years after it first premiered on Fox.
Our conversation centered on those two shows as well as some upcoming projects, including a pivotal role in Pixar’s Toy Story 4. But more than anything else, Hale told me he is just trying to stay “present” now that this life-changing phase of his career is coming to an end.
“Those first three years of Arrested , I was really overwhelmed because the whole time I was thinking, I should be feeling differently,” Hale told me. “And it’s because I’d just never been very present in my life. And so over the course of a lot of therapy and having the time to dissect that, it’s really woken me up to the many ways of being present.”
Hale even wrote a children’s book about it called Archibald’s Next Big Thing , which he is now adapting into an animated series for Netflix. The actor voices a chicken named Archibald who is always “focusing on the next big thing” while a bee follows him around, saying things like, “Hey, you gotta just be, man.”
Highlights from the interview are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts , the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts.
On the ‘bittersweet’ end of Veep
“This was bittersweet. Because we, not to kind of gush, but we care about each other so much, we have such a good time together. And knowing this was the last season was like, ‘Ahh, that stings.’ However, it was both bittersweet and incredibly joyous because of what Julia had just walked through with her own health journey. We were all very happy to be back together and also excited to see how Dave Mandel was going to wrap up the show. And it’s pretty satisfying. But each time an episode went by, we were like, ‘Ahh, we got three more, ahh, we got two more and ahh, we got one more and then we all just cried on that last episode.”
On Julia Louis-Dreyfus fighting cancer with comedy
“I think it’s always hard to watch a friend walk through that, but at the same time it was so inspiring to watch her attitude through it. Obviously she’s a fighter, but she does that fighting with humor and always thinking forward. I mean, of course it gets you down, but she always just kept going. Because it’s just tough, man. I mean, she never allowed herself to spiral. When you’re faced with that kind of a challenge, it’s really tough to stay positive. And she made it a daily choice to do that.”
How Gary Walsh would fair in the Trump administration
“I know Gary wouldn’t survive in the Trump administration. I know that with Gary, there are a lot of mother issues going on. So he kind of stays because there is so much pain in him of his own mom so [Selina] has replaced that. So he’s trying to work that out with her. With Trump, I don’t know where that would go. But again, Selina puts up with Gary, because he’s pretty absent-minded. I think Trump, like he does everybody, I think he would fire him after two days.”
On the ‘throughline of anxiety’ between Buster Bluth and Gary Walsh
“I think there’s definitely a throughline of anxiety in their life. Buster is more in a state of paralysis all the time. He just gets paralyzed by fear. And he’s also so overwhelmed. Anything that happens, he’s just constantly overwhelmed. So he’s just looking at life, wondering what’s going to come at him. But then he has these moments of joy. So I remember Mitch [Hurwitz] telling me that all Buster wants in life is safety. He gets freaked out because his safety is threatened. Whereas Gary, all he wants is the love of Selina. So I would always use that in everything I did. And that’s why she would scream at him, but it’s almost so sick, that if she were to hit Gary, to him, it’s like, at least she’s giving me affection. At least she’s touching me. Because he was so desperate for her to see him and for him to feel seen by her. Whereas Buster, he loves his mother, but he would choose safety over his mother.”

Instead of a clean break, we will now be talking about the EU for the next 20 years. All very disappointing. Posted on 4/3/19 | 12:16 PM CEST Steuersklav Erei
There are two insurance policies against a ‘soft’ Brexit. The first one is the EU insistence that EU Parliament elections be organised in the UK from 12 April as a precondition for any extension beyond that date (realistically beyond 22 May). The second one is the EU demand for a ‘soft Brexit’. This would be indefinite UK membership of the EU customs union and single market without any rebates or representation. The EU would also insist on an international Treaty (the so-called ‘Withdrawal Agreement’) giving the EU the power to annex Northern Ireland if the UK dared to break out of vassal status inthe future.
There would have to be an unusually high degree of insanity in the British government to manage to walk into BOTH of these traps. Posted on 4/3/19 | 12:18 PM CEST Anthony Chambers

The only game in town for ERG and others at the top was hard brexit/WTO or any version that leads to WTO. If you can’t get that then the ‘Remorseless logic’ is actually not leaving at all. Any soft brexit option is inferior to the real thing. ‘Remorseless logic’ is the slow and tentative coming to this conclusion. Posted on 4/3/19 | 12:40 PM CEST -> tpk

Suspiciously tame really. Did May promise Leavers that if they don’t manage anything that it will be no deal?
But in case May will not allow no deal: I told Leavers months ago that I would have signed the WA. Now they are loosing control. Posted on 4/3/19 | 12:48 PM CEST Paul NL
tpk,
As long as there are no new elections and the Conservatives are in government, Leavers still are in control. Listening to PMQ’s now, it sounds very much like a prelude to new elections. Posted on 4/3/19 | 1:11 PM CEST XK M
It is nothing but a trap that Ms. May is trying to set up for both the EU and Labour. Neither of them should fall for it, if May asks the EU for an extension it should be on the grounds that a) as the UK is still part of the EU it arranges EU elections on its territory, b) given that the intention is still for the UK to leave the EU, no UK politicians allowed to participate, c) no UK commissioner. If she doesn’t like it then she can leave without a deal next week (or even this week!) Gorbyn should ask her to implement his socialist paradise before he gives her his support.
no one should fall into her trap. Posted on 4/3/19 | 1:50 PM CEST Barry Schitpeaz

Surely if the EU demands things the UK Parliament won’t agree to, No Deal remains inevitable? This is all under less control than most people realise! Posted on 4/3/19 | 2:44 PM CEST Tom WTF Cotton
XK,
I always thought that the confusion was on the Brexitear side but in the last 48 hours I see a lot of confusion among reasonable Remainers!
The EU will not fall into any trap. Tusk gave a very thoughtful statement yesterday and Jumcker just built on that. The first deadline for May is 4/12. By that date (or really: 4/10) she must have managed to get a revised May/Corbyn deal through the HoC -or alternatively have found one of the HoC solutions acceptable to the government. Her pledge yesterday to accept the House’s decision is very meaningful in that regard.
Once there is an agreement – path A or path B, finalized no later than a week from today- Europe will give them until 5/22. If there isn’t, the option is long extension or No Deal.
Straightforward, isn’t it?
With all due respect to the 5 smaller parties and many voices here – how could a referendum possibly work? The EU will not accept any uncertainty. Which means a referendum by definition has to be paired with a long extension and EU elections in the UK – how likely you think that is to get a majority?
May was a desaster as a leader – but Corbyn is a close second. He now is forced to commit – and get Labor backlash. Will he discover the courage to lead? Or will he hide behind old red lines, the way May was hiding until yesterday?
I remain more optimistic than at any point in 2019. Posted on 4/3/19 | 5:50 PM CEST XK M
@Tom WTF Cotton, By trap to EU what I mean is that Ms. May will try once again to go for a short extension promising them discussion with labour, a short extension is of no use, it needs to be long enough to allow for a proper discussion within the UK parliament then get it agreed with the EU and then putting the whole new finally agreed WA, plus detailed PD to the public to choose if it’s better than what they already have or stay. It will take more a week I think Posted on 4/3/19 | 6:43 PM CEST Paul NL

Decolonisation across Africa and the Middle East brought about historic changes and was a moment of solidarity, optimism and radical rethinking. Nations across the continent articulated new projects of economic development and political sovereignty that considered the structural limits imposed by colonial rule. In particular, the lines separating the global and the local were purposefully blurred in order to articulate new forms of international solidarity. In a sense, these projects went beyond the nation and imagined a new global order that de-centred the nation as the only sphere of politics. This was certainly the case in Egypt, the focus of this article. However, the ways in which this radical form of internationalism was imagined differed greatly from one actor to the next; in particular, the forms of solidarity imagined by radical groups such as Egyptian feminists, workers, and students often broke free of the exclusionary imaginary of the nation state that always came back to exert itself on the articulations of leaders and state representatives. While both ends of this spectrum within anticolonial movements called for decolonization that was global, the ways in which they imagined this was vastly different.
In her book The Postcolonial Subject: Claiming politics/governing others in late modernity, Vivienne Jabri coined the term the colonial international to describe an international sphere still perforated by imperialism. Jabri argued that the changes put forward by postcolonial leaders such as Egypts Gamal Abdel Nasser should be understood as attempts to access the international.[1] The international was a colonial international, as Jabri phrased it, precisely because not all nation states were considered to be sovereign; in fact, the majority were not. Categories such as mandates and protectorates betrayed this linear logic of colonialism, whereby some nations were potential nation states[2] embodying sovereignty, but to reach this stage meant achieving a certain civilizational status. As Antony Anghie notes, Sovereignty existed in something like a linear continuum, based on its approximation to the ideal of the European nation-state.[3]
Regaining control over the institutions of international political economythe same institutions that reproduced global inequalitywas seen as the path to independence.[4] However, this is always done vis--vis the international; it is this tension that mediates anything and everything the postcolonial state does. Moments such as the 1955 Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference at Bandung were attempts at carving out a new internationalattempts that ultimately failed as we see the return of the colonial international in the late 1960s. Across Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, resistance to colonial rule materialised in varied and intersecting ways, whether through calls for independent industrialisation, cultural renewal, political self-determination, or the nationalisation of assets. In contexts such as Egypt, Nassers project was not merely a project of national independence, but an attempt at decolonizing both the national and the international. Resistance meant not only removing Egyptian production from this international sphere that was in and of itself colonial, but also the creation and articulation of new social and political projects that moved beyond binaries of East and West.[5]
The political economy of decolonisation was central to these attempts at decolonising the international. Take the Communiqu issued after the conference at Bandung, which called for cooperation within the Global South; the creation and sharing of technical expertise, research and development; the establishment of international bodies to coordinate economic development; and self-determination in terms of economic policy. Most importantly, the principles clearly delineate a program for national development based on industrialisation. The fourth principle calls for the stabilising of commodity trade in the region, and the fifth principle acknowledges the importance of primary commodities and the position of the postcolonial world in supplying them. As Partha Chatterjee notes, the Communiqu suggests that most countries at the conference saw themselves as exporters of raw commodities and importers of industrial products.[6] State-led economic development through industrialisation was envisioned as a means of interrupting the dependency they faced on global capital.
In Egypt, Nasserisma project that positioned itself as anticolonialwas formed in the early 1950s. The dismantling of the Egyptian landed elite, the (limited) land reform program, the introduction of free education and healthcare, and the guarantee of employment after graduation, were some of the material changes put in place by the Nasserist project. Also falling under material shifts are the major infrastructural projects the Nasserist ruling class embarked on, including the nationalisation of the Suez Canal and the building of the High Dam. These changes radically transformed the ability of many Egyptians to access social services and social mobility. None of these are beyond critique, and, as I show further on, despite being represented as part of an anticolonial state-building project they very much relied on the reproduction of capitalist development. The changes put in place reified a colonial understanding of sovereignty that ultimately reproduced the nation state as the bearer of what is sovereign. Partly, this is due to the centrality of the nation and nationalism to these projects.[7] It is also the result of Nasserisms adoption of state-led capitalist development.
Indeed the failures of the Nasserist project from an economic perspective were already diagnosed early on by leftist writers and intellectuals,[8] including scholars such as Samir Amin, who had laid out the traps inherent in adopting capitalist developmenteven if led by an anticolonial state.[9] Given that the expansion of capitalism in Egypt was tied to the expansion of imperialism from the very beginning, it becomes difficult to disentangle one from the other.[10] It is this that makes Nassers decision to adopt state-led capitalist development contentious. Industrialisation was based on notions of scientific progress, modern planning, and centring the state within capitalist production; it is difficult to ignore the modern telos underwriting industrialisation-as-development. It is perhaps only by rejecting altogether that the process of decolonisation could have reached its ultimate end.
I want to briefly turn to alternate trajectories of anticolonialism that existed during Egypts period of decolonisation. Indeed, much of the groundwork for the Nasserist project was laid before Nasser ever came to power. In the rest of this piece, I touch on how feminists and workers were part and parcel of Egypts decolonisation process, even if the history of this process is very much told through the lens of Nasser and the postcolonial Egyptian state.
Im especially interested in how, from the 1940s onwards, feminists began to put forward a distinctive articulation of nationalism where anti-capitalism became increasingly prominent. In terms of gender, this lent itself to more structural understandings of inequality that called for more radical transformations. This was undoubtedly connected to the increased prominence of socialist and Marxist theorising globally, including the proliferation of organizations and conferences that connected feminists across the postcolonial world, conferences at which capitalist inequality was a central theme. This gave feminists the analytical tools, including a means of analysing class conict, to analyse Egypts position vis-a-vis a rapidly changing world, and also provided a way of analysing what many of them saw as the main problem facing Egypt: social inequality. Some examples include Inji Efflatoun, who, as a delegate of the League of Women Students and Graduates of Egypt, the communist womens organization, to the World Congress of Women held in Paris in 1945, gave the following speech: I made a very powerful speech in which I linked the oppression of women in Egypt to the British occupation and imperialism. I not only denounced the British, but the King and the politicians as well. It was a very political speech in which I called for national liberation and the liberation of women.[11] Other feminists active as communists included Latifa al-Zayyat and Soraya Adham.
This was part of a growing international momentum around transnational and anti-colonial feminist solidarity. Laura Bier writes, As new alliances were forged in the international arena, groups of women activists, writers, students, and politicians circulated within the milieu of international conferences, visiting delegations, summits, and committee meetings. The resulting exchanges and networks were part of what made possible the sorts of imaginings that overflowed the boundaries of the nation state.[12] In Egypt, what is interesting is the ways in which the feminist project both intersected with and broke away from Nasserism as a state-led project. In particular, I want to draw attention to how feminists articulated concerns around womens workboth inside and outside of the homeand why this mattered for postcolonial states. In an incisive piece, Mai Taha reads debates Egyptian feminists had through the concept of the social factory.[13] She argues that projects such as Nassers centered the factory and industrialization in the development of the modern Egyptian nation state while deflecting the question of social reproduction, largely being carried out by women. Some feminist debates, therefore, centered around this displacement, and argued for a postcolonial state formation that took seriously social welfare and social reproductive benefits. Much of this debate focused on the gendered nature of work, and the ways in which public social services could be crafted to meet the extensive work women were faced with at multiple sites. Women joining the workforce was one of the major pillars of Nassers state feminist project, and new labour laws guaranteeing employment to those who had the correct qualifications were passed. In response, feminist demands for equal pay, maternity leave and day-care centres were articulated.[14] The 1959 Labour Code gave women fifty days of paid maternity leave and required employers to provide day-care facilities in workplaces.[15] New laws also provided women with equal access to higher education and fixed the workday for women to nine hours.
However, the provision of these rights through state legislation came at a cost: Through legislation, the state was able to intervene in womens networks of communal support by legalizing social life that inhabited the public and private spheres, instead of allowing women to be the architects of their own working conditions.[16] Additionally, much of what was promised never materialised, leading to shortages in services such as day care. Nevertheless, I am interested here in how feminist demands around womens labourinside and outside the homewere articulated and had an effect on the states feminist project. In particular, I want to note the understanding feminists had of the role of the state in easing or intensifying the gendered work burden, and thus the ways in which feminists lived their lives. In some ways it seems that the demands made by feminists around day-care, equal pay and maternity leavearticulated through the lens of a nationalist projectallowed feminists to negotiate with the Nasserist state project partly because of its own commitment to social welfare, economic development and Arab socialismas tenuous as this claim ended up being.
On the one hand, then, many feminists supported the Nasserist project, often with reservations, for many complex reasons; as mentioned earlier, Nasser was able to use this energy in expanding his project more broadly. This does not mean that they saw him as solely responsible for all the gains that were made during this period, most notably in areas of education and employment; as prominent Egyptian feminist Wedad Mitri noted, the womens movement in Egypt has always demanded the right of women to vote and be elected to ofce as part of any real grassroots democracy. In 1956, Gamal Abdel Nasser extended this right to us. But of course, it didnt just happen. It resulted from the struggle of generations and generations of women.[17] On the other hand, what I am interested in is the alternative future the feminist project itself was hinting at, or promising, that never came to fruition. So the ways in which these feminist articulations of anti-colonialism, nationalism and anti-capitalism were much more radical than the ones put forward by the state and its elites. I am also interested in how we can view this regionally and internationally; so, how the connections and discussions between feminists across the postcolonial world also points to more radical understandings of decolonization, what it means and how it should be achieved.
Similarly, we can see in Egypts rich history of worker contestation that notions of anticolonialism as connected to anti-capitalism were strongly embedded in activism. Throughout the 20th century, Egypt saw an active workers movement that was strongly nationalist and anti-colonial. The changes workers and peasants faced were very much connected to both the consolidation of capitalism and the expansion of imperialism. These two processes were not separate: each relied on the other. Many workers thus saw a connection between anti-imperialism and struggles around work, and for the Egyptian workers movement, there wasas for the feministsno easy split between nationalism and other causes such as anti-capitalism or feminism. I highlight these movements and the role nationalism played in them in order to show why the Nasserist project was able to extend itself so quickly and thoroughly by building on and co-opting these energies. I also highlight nationalism because of its connection to sovereignty; for all of these different actors, sovereigntyhow it could be achieved and what it would look likewas the imminent question. For feminists, workers and other groups, this always and inevitably included an anti-capitalist position. Sovereignty could only be imagined by breaking away from global capitalism; imperialism and capitalism were not two separate entities but rather two co-constitutive realities.
Drawing on Fanon, the exclusion of workers and peasantsand feministsfrom the project of decolonisation meant that the Nasserist project was unable to centre class struggle and other forms of radical struggles and fully liberate itself from the colonial international: For if you think you can manage a country without letting the people interfere, if you think that the people upset the game by their mere presence, whether they slow it down or whether by their natural ignorance they sabotage it, then you must have no hesitation: you must keep the people out.[18] As Fanon noted, the national government should always cede its power back to the people. It should, in effect, dissolve itself. Because nationalist consciousness during the anticolonial moment comes from the people, this is where it should reside. This leaves us with the question of whether, given the limits of history, anything else was possible; and whether instead postcolonial nations in the mid-twentieth century were bound to get caught in an impossible situation, a situation that presented no easy victory. And yet is this situation as impossible as it is made out to be? I am pointing here to the alternate futures that were imagined by multiple groups, that are important to archive but also bring to the front of debates around the on-going process of decolonization. Understanding the past through how the future was imagined has a lot to tell us about the mechanisms of power in our contemporary post-colonial period.

Decolonisation across Africa and the Middle East brought about historic changes and was a moment of solidarity, optimism and radical rethinking. Nations across the continent articulated new projects of economic development and political sovereignty that considered the structural limits imposed by colonial rule. In particular, the lines separating the global and the local were purposefully blurred in order to articulate new forms of international solidarity. In a sense, these projects went beyond the nation and imagined a new global order that de-centred the nation as the only sphere of politics. This was certainly the case in Egypt, the focus of this article. However, the ways in which this radical form of internationalism was imagined differed greatly from one actor to the next; in particular, the forms of solidarity imagined by radical groups such as Egyptian feminists, workers, and students often broke free of the exclusionary imaginary of the nation state that always came back to exert itself on the articulations of leaders and state representatives. While both ends of this spectrum within anticolonial movements called for decolonization that was global, the ways in which they imagined this was vastly different.
In her book The Postcolonial Subject: Claiming politics/governing others in late modernity, Vivienne Jabri coined the term the colonial international to describe an international sphere still perforated by imperialism. Jabri argued that the changes put forward by postcolonial leaders such as Egypts Gamal Abdel Nasser should be understood as attempts to access the international.[1] The international was a colonial international, as Jabri phrased it, precisely because not all nation states were considered to be sovereign; in fact, the majority were not. Categories such as mandates and protectorates betrayed this linear logic of colonialism, whereby some nations were potential nation states[2] embodying sovereignty, but to reach this stage meant achieving a certain civilizational status. As Antony Anghie notes, Sovereignty existed in something like a linear continuum, based on its approximation to the ideal of the European nation-state.[3]
Regaining control over the institutions of international political economythe same institutions that reproduced global inequalitywas seen as the path to independence.[4] However, this is always done vis--vis the international; it is this tension that mediates anything and everything the postcolonial state does. Moments such as the 1955 Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference at Bandung were attempts at carving out a new internationalattempts that ultimately failed as we see the return of the colonial international in the late 1960s. Across Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, resistance to colonial rule materialised in varied and intersecting ways, whether through calls for independent industrialisation, cultural renewal, political self-determination, or the nationalisation of assets. In contexts such as Egypt, Nassers project was not merely a project of national independence, but an attempt at decolonizing both the national and the international. Resistance meant not only removing Egyptian production from this international sphere that was in and of itself colonial, but also the creation and articulation of new social and political projects that moved beyond binaries of East and West.[5]
The political economy of decolonisation was central to these attempts at decolonising the international. Take the Communiqu issued after the conference at Bandung, which called for cooperation within the Global South; the creation and sharing of technical expertise, research and development; the establishment of international bodies to coordinate economic development; and self-determination in terms of economic policy. Most importantly, the principles clearly delineate a program for national development based on industrialisation. The fourth principle calls for the stabilising of commodity trade in the region, and the fifth principle acknowledges the importance of primary commodities and the position of the postcolonial world in supplying them. As Partha Chatterjee notes, the Communiqu suggests that most countries at the conference saw themselves as exporters of raw commodities and importers of industrial products.[6] State-led economic development through industrialisation was envisioned as a means of interrupting the dependency they faced on global capital.
In Egypt, Nasserisma project that positioned itself as anticolonialwas formed in the early 1950s. The dismantling of the Egyptian landed elite, the (limited) land reform program, the introduction of free education and healthcare, and the guarantee of employment after graduation, were some of the material changes put in place by the Nasserist project. Also falling under material shifts are the major infrastructural projects the Nasserist ruling class embarked on, including the nationalisation of the Suez Canal and the building of the High Dam. These changes radically transformed the ability of many Egyptians to access social services and social mobility. None of these are beyond critique, and, as I show further on, despite being represented as part of an anticolonial state-building project they very much relied on the reproduction of capitalist development. The changes put in place reified a colonial understanding of sovereignty that ultimately reproduced the nation state as the bearer of what is sovereign. Partly, this is due to the centrality of the nation and nationalism to these projects.[7] It is also the result of Nasserisms adoption of state-led capitalist development.
Indeed the failures of the Nasserist project from an economic perspective were already diagnosed early on by leftist writers and intellectuals,[8] including scholars such as Samir Amin, who had laid out the traps inherent in adopting capitalist developmenteven if led by an anticolonial state.[9] Given that the expansion of capitalism in Egypt was tied to the expansion of imperialism from the very beginning, it becomes difficult to disentangle one from the other.[10] It is this that makes Nassers decision to adopt state-led capitalist development contentious. Industrialisation was based on notions of scientific progress, modern planning, and centring the state within capitalist production; it is difficult to ignore the modern telos underwriting industrialisation-as-development. It is perhaps only by rejecting altogether that the process of decolonisation could have reached its ultimate end.
I want to briefly turn to alternate trajectories of anticolonialism that existed during Egypts period of decolonisation. Indeed, much of the groundwork for the Nasserist project was laid before Nasser ever came to power. In the rest of this piece, I touch on how feminists and workers were part and parcel of Egypts decolonisation process, even if the history of this process is very much told through the lens of Nasser and the postcolonial Egyptian state.
Im especially interested in how, from the 1940s onwards, feminists began to put forward a distinctive articulation of nationalism where anti-capitalism became increasingly prominent. In terms of gender, this lent itself to more structural understandings of inequality that called for more radical transformations. This was undoubtedly connected to the increased prominence of socialist and Marxist theorising globally, including the proliferation of organizations and conferences that connected feminists across the postcolonial world, conferences at which capitalist inequality was a central theme. This gave feminists the analytical tools, including a means of analysing class conict, to analyse Egypts position vis-a-vis a rapidly changing world, and also provided a way of analysing what many of them saw as the main problem facing Egypt: social inequality. Some examples include Inji Efflatoun, who, as a delegate of the League of Women Students and Graduates of Egypt, the communist womens organization, to the World Congress of Women held in Paris in 1945, gave the following speech: I made a very powerful speech in which I linked the oppression of women in Egypt to the British occupation and imperialism. I not only denounced the British, but the King and the politicians as well. It was a very political speech in which I called for national liberation and the liberation of women.[11] Other feminists active as communists included Latifa al-Zayyat and Soraya Adham.
This was part of a growing international momentum around transnational and anti-colonial feminist solidarity. Laura Bier writes, As new alliances were forged in the international arena, groups of women activists, writers, students, and politicians circulated within the milieu of international conferences, visiting delegations, summits, and committee meetings. The resulting exchanges and networks were part of what made possible the sorts of imaginings that overflowed the boundaries of the nation state.[12] In Egypt, what is interesting is the ways in which the feminist project both intersected with and broke away from Nasserism as a state-led project. In particular, I want to draw attention to how feminists articulated concerns around womens workboth inside and outside of the homeand why this mattered for postcolonial states. In an incisive piece, Mai Taha reads debates Egyptian feminists had through the concept of the social factory.[13] She argues that projects such as Nassers centered the factory and industrialization in the development of the modern Egyptian nation state while deflecting the question of social reproduction, largely being carried out by women. Some feminist debates, therefore, centered around this displacement, and argued for a postcolonial state formation that took seriously social welfare and social reproductive benefits. Much of this debate focused on the gendered nature of work, and the ways in which public social services could be crafted to meet the extensive work women were faced with at multiple sites. Women joining the workforce was one of the major pillars of Nassers state feminist project, and new labour laws guaranteeing employment to those who had the correct qualifications were passed. In response, feminist demands for equal pay, maternity leave and day-care centres were articulated.[14] The 1959 Labour Code gave women fifty days of paid maternity leave and required employers to provide day-care facilities in workplaces.[15] New laws also provided women with equal access to higher education and fixed the workday for women to nine hours.
However, the provision of these rights through state legislation came at a cost: Through legislation, the state was able to intervene in womens networks of communal support by legalizing social life that inhabited the public and private spheres, instead of allowing women to be the architects of their own working conditions.[16] Additionally, much of what was promised never materialised, leading to shortages in services such as day care. Nevertheless, I am interested here in how feminist demands around womens labourinside and outside the homewere articulated and had an effect on the states feminist project. In particular, I want to note the understanding feminists had of the role of the state in easing or intensifying the gendered work burden, and thus the ways in which feminists lived their lives. In some ways it seems that the demands made by feminists around day-care, equal pay and maternity leavearticulated through the lens of a nationalist projectallowed feminists to negotiate with the Nasserist state project partly because of its own commitment to social welfare, economic development and Arab socialismas tenuous as this claim ended up being.
On the one hand, then, many feminists supported the Nasserist project, often with reservations, for many complex reasons; as mentioned earlier, Nasser was able to use this energy in expanding his project more broadly. This does not mean that they saw him as solely responsible for all the gains that were made during this period, most notably in areas of education and employment; as prominent Egyptian feminist Wedad Mitri noted, the womens movement in Egypt has always demanded the right of women to vote and be elected to ofce as part of any real grassroots democracy. In 1956, Gamal Abdel Nasser extended this right to us. But of course, it didnt just happen. It resulted from the struggle of generations and generations of women.[17] On the other hand, what I am interested in is the alternative future the feminist project itself was hinting at, or promising, that never came to fruition. So the ways in which these feminist articulations of anti-colonialism, nationalism and anti-capitalism were much more radical than the ones put forward by the state and its elites. I am also interested in how we can view this regionally and internationally; so, how the connections and discussions between feminists across the postcolonial world also points to more radical understandings of decolonization, what it means and how it should be achieved.
Similarly, we can see in Egypts rich history of worker contestation that notions of anticolonialism as connected to anti-capitalism were strongly embedded in activism. Throughout the 20th century, Egypt saw an active workers movement that was strongly nationalist and anti-colonial. The changes workers and peasants faced were very much connected to both the consolidation of capitalism and the expansion of imperialism. These two processes were not separate: each relied on the other. Many workers thus saw a connection between anti-imperialism and struggles around work, and for the Egyptian workers movement, there wasas for the feministsno easy split between nationalism and other causes such as anti-capitalism or feminism. I highlight these movements and the role nationalism played in them in order to show why the Nasserist project was able to extend itself so quickly and thoroughly by building on and co-opting these energies. I also highlight nationalism because of its connection to sovereignty; for all of these different actors, sovereigntyhow it could be achieved and what it would look likewas the imminent question. For feminists, workers and other groups, this always and inevitably included an anti-capitalist position. Sovereignty could only be imagined by breaking away from global capitalism; imperialism and capitalism were not two separate entities but rather two co-constitutive realities.
Drawing on Fanon, the exclusion of workers and peasantsand feministsfrom the project of decolonisation meant that the Nasserist project was unable to centre class struggle and other forms of radical struggles and fully liberate itself from the colonial international: For if you think you can manage a country without letting the people interfere, if you think that the people upset the game by their mere presence, whether they slow it down or whether by their natural ignorance they sabotage it, then you must have no hesitation: you must keep the people out.[18] As Fanon noted, the national government should always cede its power back to the people. It should, in effect, dissolve itself. Because nationalist consciousness during the anticolonial moment comes from the people, this is where it should reside. This leaves us with the question of whether, given the limits of history, anything else was possible; and whether instead postcolonial nations in the mid-twentieth century were bound to get caught in an impossible situation, a situation that presented no easy victory. And yet is this situation as impossible as it is made out to be? I am pointing here to the alternate futures that were imagined by multiple groups, that are important to archive but also bring to the front of debates around the on-going process of decolonization. Understanding the past through how the future was imagined has a lot to tell us about the mechanisms of power in our contemporary post-colonial period.

Coming soon: The death of the filibuster,www.politico.com,BURGESS EVERETT,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/03/senate-republicans-filibuster-1250082,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
The filibuster is in peril.
With Republicans expected to change the Senate rules to slash debate time on President Donald Trump’s nominees this week, it will mark the third time the “nuclear option” — changing Senate rules by a simple majority — has been triggered in just six years. Story Continued Below
Each of those unilateral moves by a Senate majority to weaken the Senate’s age-old precedents centered on nominations, leaving the legislative filibuster and its 60-vote threshold unscathed. But some senators say it’s just a matter of time before even that Senate institution is more or less wiped away by a majority tired of seeing its big ideas blocked.
Though the Senate is up for grabs in 2020, neither party is expected to come away with a supermajority due to the limited number of competitive races. And that likely puts the supermajority requirement itself in jeopardy — particularly if one party controls the White House, House and Senate and wants to move its agenda.
And in true Senate fashion, Republicans and Democrats are already bickering over who is more likely to blow up the Senate as soon as 2021.
“It’ll go down the road,” Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said of the filibuster. “If the Democrats take control of the Senate and we’re in a strong minority then they’ll change it immediately.” POLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

“If eliminating the legislative filibuster will serve Sen. McConnell’s purposes, he’ll eliminate it,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). “After what Sen. McConnell has done to this institution, there will be many people who will be putting pressure on us to do the same thing.”
The latest change by Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-Ky.) to cut debate time from 30 hours to two hours apiece for lower level executive nominees and District Court picks was, somewhat ironically, initially blocked by filibuster-wielding Democrats on Tuesday.
Just one Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, opposed moving to debate the rules change, making a broader argument that the Senate's rules are intended to balance ""competing interests of majorities, minorities, and individual senators.""
""They facilitate the compromise and accountability that are essential to the governing of a large, diverse nation,"" Lee said. ""I oppose changing the post-cloture time rule. I certainly oppose breaking the rules of the Senate to do so. The current rules can work for the American people; they simply require us to do the same.""
But McConnell will move to use the nuclear option later this week to make the change anyway by a simple majority, overruling Democratic objections and speeding up Trump’s nominations — a top priority of the president, who has long railed against Democratic delays. Last week, Trump handed McConnell a list of nominees at a party meeting and urged the GOP leader to get them confirmed.
The move by the Republican leader potentially sets the table for future, more radical changes, just as former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s (D-Nev.) foray into scrapping the supermajority requirement on certain nominees laid the groundwork for this week’s move by the GOP.
“We’re going to be the House of Representatives by the time my term is done. And that will be McConnell’s legacy,” said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who was just reelected to a six-year term. “We’re headed to a majoritarian institution. And maybe we’re better off. Maybe we’d be able to have actual debates and real amendments. The House has more debate than we do.”"

Black leaders blast Dem war on super PACs,www.politico.com,MAGGIE SEVERNS,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/03/black-donors-super-pacs-1250892,"2020 elections Black leaders blast Dem war on super PACs The Collective PAC argued the left's strident anti-super PAC stance would harm candidates of color who don't have big fundraising networks. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Top black donors and operatives are calling on fellow Democrats to abandon their push against super PACs, arguing that one of Democrats’ most popular 2020 talking points will ultimately cut off much-needed resources for candidates of color.
In a letter obtained by POLITICO, The Collective PAC — which helps elect black candidates to office — asked major liberal groups like Indivisible and Democracy for America to stop calling for Democratic presidential contenders to distance themselves from single-candidatesuper PACs. Such groups play an important role in electing candidates of color, they argued, especially in primaries, when the Democratic establishment has often overlooked black contenders and left it to outside donors to bolster their campaigns. Story Continued Below
“Whether intentional or not, the effect of what you are calling for is to shut down the one reliable source of revenue for engaging voters of color and for supporting candidates of color,” wrote Quentin JamesandStefanie Brown James, the founder and co-founder of The Collective PAC. “One of the few sources of funding for the work to engage voters of color and support candidates of color has come from Super PACs.”
The Collective PAC’s stance is at odds with much of the Democratic Party: Most candidates for president have said they do not want super PACs supporting their bids, and some, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have taken additional steps to disavow the influence of money in politics as they make their case to voters. The issue was a major talking point in 2016 for Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has powered his campaigns via small-dollar online contributors and on Tuesday announced he had raised $18 million in his 2020 campaign.

But new candidates can need help from outside groups and wealthy supporters in order to break into a campaign, prominent black fundraisers argue. Among those pushing the argument is Steve Phillips, a Democratic donor who launched an effort in 2008 that ultimately spent more than $10 million bolstering Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign. Last December, Phillips announced he would raise money for a super PAC supporting Sen. Cory Booker in 2020.
“The Democratic Party and the progressive ecosystem have a very bad track record in terms of investing in candidates of color,” Phillips said in an interview. “There are not many people in this country who have moved more money to communities of color and have moved more money to candidates of color than I have, and I’m not going to be lectured by people who don’t have a similar track record.”
Booker, like other presidential candidates, has said he does not want a super PAC supporting his presidential bid, in addition to rejecting corporate PAC money — another increasingly common Democratic campaign tactic. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has also drawn support from a super PAC, which has spent more than $1 million running ads boosting his candidacy.
In March a coalition of nine grassroots Democratic organizations — End Citizens United, Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Democracy for America, Indivisible, United We Dream, Public Citizen, Credo Action, MoveOn and Working Families Party — signed on to a public letter calling on all Democratic candidates for president to disavow the super PACs."

IME, it's hispanic families who are most in danger from Latino gangs (mostly MS-13). Gangs surged under Obama's second term and they kill each other...brutally. Some victims are even immigrant children who fled El Salvador specifically to get away from the gang. But the gang finds them, HERE. In America. Our area's most recent MS-13 gang murder targeted a 16-year old boy who knew they were after him, so he moved to another county so his family might be spared the savage violence of the gang, should they get to him, which they did. MS-13 gang members stabbed him over 100 times (it's their trademark-knives and machetes) and dumped his body in another state. I could enumerate many other such gang murders in my area over the past 8 years or so. So yes, hispanic immigrants do indeed support building the wall and stopping criminals from coming in to recruit/find their children in our now over-crowded high schools and even elementary schools."

But your odds of being shot in a mass shooting are close to your odds of being struck by lightening. Why not focus on mental health, bullying and other issues that lead to violence? 2. Abortion. That's the big issue for Christians. This is why Republicans own the religious right. Talk to African Americans and you'll find nearly half are pro-life. Not all liberals agree on abortion. Let each state decide. We should just drop the issue as a party and allow states and individuals to decide. If liberals did those two things, conservatism would pretty much cease to exist as a force in American politics. So many poor White people would support universal health care and other social programs. So much good would be possible. And probably the problems of abortion and guns would be much reduced as people have a better quality of life. Politics is all about picking your battles. Of course, I know this will never happen. hmmmm thats fantasy though because reality is VERY different. in reality: - millions of liberals are fine with guns, i do agree separation from the extremists could help the STEREOTYPE of liberals and make extremists on the right more open to people on the left but the reality is millions already support the 2A - millions of conservatives are fine with abortion its not really a right left thing, its a non-extremists vs extremist thing. Not to mention the reality that abortion isnt going anywhere. since we have a constitution its never going to go back to the states, it cant. We are a first world country and like the majority of other first world countries abortion is here to stay because women will never have their rights stepped backwards and be treated as lessers. the solution for liberals and conservatives in politics is to ignore and distance themselves from extremists . . but sadly so many have a win and my team above all mentality that they allow the extremist to operate among them cause they get a percentage of the vote they worry about losing. everyday people left and right are basically fine Originally Posted by MeThePeople homosexual conduct is what makes them homosexual Originally Posted by Hicup homosexuality is objectively wrong, but because science tells me it is, not politics.

Democrats race to embrace legal weed,www.politico.com,PAUL DEMKO,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/03/democrats-presidential-candidates-marijuana-1312878,"Legalizing pot is the new Democratic litmus test The near-universal backing of cannabis legalization is a stark contrast to recent presidential campaigns. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
Democratic presidential candidates have come a long way from “I didn’t inhale.”
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has boasted that his state, one of the first to legalize recreational marijuana use in 2012, has “the best weed in the United States of America.” Sen. Bernie Sanders has been proposing some form of legalization for more than two decades. Sen. Kamala Harris has reminisced about lighting up in college. And Sen. Cory Booker makes overhauling drug laws a linchpin of his stump speeches.Nearly every Democrat in the field has embraced some form of legalization. Story Continued Below
The near-universal backing is a stark contrast to recent presidential campaigns, when legalization was a fringe issue that seldom surfaced on the trail or during debates. And while legalizing pot may not rank among the top five issues important to voters, it could prove crucial as Democrats winnow the field.
“In these early stages where you're at 18 [candidates] and you're trying to get a little bit of an edge over the rest … maybe this is the differentiator,” said Joe Trippi, a veteran Democratic strategist who’s worked on numerous presidential campaigns.
The change is driven by the rapid spread of legal cannabis markets. Ten states and the District of Columbia have full legalization, and another 23 states permit medicinal uses with permission from a doctor, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . Even deep-red states like Arkansas and Utah have recently enacted medical marijuana laws. Sales topped $8 billion last year and could hit $80 billion by 2030, according to Cowen Equity Research .
We’re reporting on the growing popularity of medical marijuana and CBD, despite the relatively little scientific evidence for different ailments. If you currently use medical marijuana/CBD, or if you’re a health care professional who has recommended them to your patients, we want to hear from you .
More than half of the declared field earned an “A” rating from cannabis advocacy group NORML, which promotes recreational use, not just medical use.
“I don’t see a path for how a Democrat running for president could win the presidential primary unless they do have a positive cannabis position,” said Neil Levine, CEO of the Cannabis Trade Federation, an industry-backed advocacy group.
Meanwhile, arguably the biggest weed legalization skeptics — former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (who earlier this year called it “perhaps the stupidest thing anybody has ever done”) and Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown (NORML gives him a “C”) — have taken a pass on the 2020 presidential contest. Another outlier, former Vice President Joe Biden, who has a long track record of supporting tough drug laws, hasn’t joined the field.
The issue also is gaining traction in an otherwise largely gridlocked Congress. Last week, the House Financial Services Committee overwhelmingly passed legislation that would let banks provide services to legal marijuana businesses, with 11 Republicans joining all committee Democrats in supporting the bill. Because marijuana remains a controlled substance under federal law, the pot business is now largely cash only.
Congress also used last year’s farm bill to legalize hemp — a non-psychoactive variety of the cannabis plant. And it passed a significant overhaul of criminal justice policies aimed at enhancing opportunities for ex-drug offenders that was strongly backed by the Trump administration.
Marijuana advocates are looking for ways to sustain the momentum, expecting the issue to fade as candidates spend more time on health care, immigration and other high-profile issues. By KATIE JENNINGS and JILLIAN DEUTSCH
Don Murphy, the Marijuana Policy Project’s director of federal policies, is having second thoughts about plans to staff a booth at the Iowa State Fair in August while candidates work the crowd, because the field has so enthusiastically embraced legalization.
But Murphy and other advocates are still waiting for candidates to offer fleshed-out platforms, rather than just rhetorical gestures.
“There's trash talking before the fight — and then there's the fight,” Murphy said. “I'd be happier with their rhetoric if I saw some real fight in the ring.”
Anti-legalization forces are hoping to use the Democratic candidates’ positions to paint them as out of touch with most of the country and pushing a marginal issue to enable a multi-billion-dollar industry that peddles a product with significant health risks.
“This is a very low priority issue for voters, period,” said Kevin Sabet, CEO of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, which opposes legalization. “The average voter -- this is not on the radar.”
But public opinion has steadily shifted in favor of legalization. More than 6 in 10 adults now favor legalization, according to the Pew Research Center — double the level of support at the turn of the century.
The cannabis industry remains a minor but burgeoning political player. Industry groups spent $2.7 million on lobbying last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, more than six-fold increase over just two years earlier."

Go big: Constitutional amendment needed for climate change,www.bayjournal.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.bayjournal.com/article/go_big_constitutional_amendment_needed_for_climate_change," Go big or ‘no home’: We need green amendments in state constitutions By Tamara Toles O’Laughlin on April 03, 2019 Leave a comment
In August 2018, the Maryland Environmental Health Network and its membership of impacted residents in the community, health advocates and environmental activists came together to strategize on ways to confront the root causes of climate and health threats in our state. Among other ideas, we decided to raise our collective voice in favor of bold action. What developed was a proposal for an addition to the state constitution, now known as the Healthy Green Maryland Amendment.
While it may seem like a difficult task, amendments to state constitutions happen with relative frequency when the state legislature determines that there is a need. For example, Pennsylvania and Montana have amended their state constitutions to provide for a green amendment, a right to clean air and pure water for their citizens. Twice since 2013, individuals used Pennsylvania’s amendment (passed in 1971) to win victories at the state’s highest court to prevent fracking because of the health issues it causes. New York and New Jersey are considering similar proposals.
The bill for a Heathy Green Maryland Amendment, sponsored by Del. Stephen Lafferty among others, built on a 2018 proposal and made explicit the right to a healthy environment, now and for future generations, vested in the government as a plain duty to hold the promise of public lands and the enjoyment of them as a multigenerational pledge. This amendment, alongside plans to add community solar projects, clean energy jobs and climate-conscious transportation, would make Maryland the first state in the nation to realize the vision for a Green New Deal.
By taking the form of an amendment, this pledge would be bound by our state’s declaration of rights. And why not? That’s where we keep the highest values of our union, where we balance our freedoms for, and responsibilities to, one another.
We have built constitutions at every level to imperfectly defend against tyranny and oppression, and it’s more clear than ever that there is no greater threat to liberty in this age than what climate change will do to our way of life, our freedom to migrate, and our pursuit of the state vision of happiness, be it crab, beach, or Old Bay-related. All of it — including human health — is threatened by rising tides, eroded shores and development that occurs without consideration of these impacts.
A recent poll of statewide voters from OpinionWorks found that a resounding 74 percent of Marylanders support a Healthy Green Maryland Constitutional Amendment. Not only that, but 71 percent of Maryland voters are worried about climate impacts on their property, health or family. Similarly, 75 percent, including more than half of the Republicans polled, expressed concern about the weakening rollbacks or lack of action on climate change at the national level, with 65 percent of voters supporting increased action in the state to combat climate change. This is a clear mandate to ramp up environmental action in Maryland.
Although the Healthy Green amendment bill will not go forward in 2019, we have the opportunity in 2020 to give people the chance to make their own decision and hold a referendum in the state.
The 2019 bill may have been ahead of its time, but it was surely not ahead of our need for it. In fact, the United Nations Environment Program published its first Global Report on the Environmental Rule of Law, in January where it explicitly recognized the rights of future generations and the need for action on climate within a constitutional framework as a right to a healthy environment. The Healthy Green Maryland Amendment was supported by attorneys from four states covering the Chesapeake.
The validation of environmental and health rights is necessary, urgent, possible, and inevitable, if we can hold onto it in the face of the unsubstantiated fear of change.
Change is already here, and it’s coming at the speed of climate. Maryland could be well-positioned to act if we can recall that constitutions are meant to be shaped and sheared to meet the challenges of the time. Rather than become stale and held in unnecessary reverence — they should adapt to the challenge of the day to remain relevant.
In recent days we’ve witnessed one of the largest mobilizations on climate, ever. On March 14, 1 million youths answered the call to camaraderie, made possible by technology, and emerged in real life in more than 2,000 protest sites in 125 countries. Every shout, every sign, and every single body in motion (and empty classroom chair) served as a referendum for immediate action on climate and the end of incrementalism in the age of extinction level threat. More than a few gathered in Annapolis as a part of a growing response to the static promise of the legislative session.
And on hand at this year’s legislative session was 14-year-old Kallan Benson, a single silent protester, an energetic standard bearer for her generation. Kallan dedicated 90 days of her young life to protest, preceding the weekly gatherings for #climatestrike Fridays. She was supported by numerous faith partners and members of ecumenical traditions who have long understood that creation care happens beyond church halls.
It’s time to admit that we are at the end of incremental campaigning for piecemeal wins. It’s time to go big or risk our place on the planet.
A growing number of legislators recognize the necessity of action at this scale, and understand the power of an environmental rights amendment. During a hearing for the bill, our favorite inquiry (paraphrased here) came from Del. Vaughn Stewart, who asked how we could reasonably hesitate to act on climate and health when Maryland has considered constitutional amendments to enable sports, slots and marijuana, among other things.
It’s time to “go big.” We have the entire future of Maryland to consider — and it demands action. Our mandate is scrawled on the placards of tweens and teens. Let’s follow their direction to act, and do it next in the run-up to the next general election. Otherwise, we may have no place to call home.

White Horse Mountain worth the millions paid to protect it,www.bayjournal.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.bayjournal.com/article/white_horse_mountain_worth_the_millions_paid_to_protect_it," White Horse Mountain worth the millions paid to protect it By Whitney Pipkin on April 03, 2019 Leave a comment
Hugging the slow s-curves of road winding into a mountainous sliver of West Virginia’s Hampshire County, I remembered why they call this portion of the Chesapeake Bay watershed “wild”— and why clean water advocates were desperate to keep it that way.
I was headed to White Horse Mountain , an almost entirely tree-covered heap of rocky hills hugging and draining into the South Branch of the Potomac River. It’s one of the largest undeveloped forestlands remaining in the region, home to rare wildflowers and habitats, hike-worthy vistas and the occasional bobcat or black bear. And it’s only recently been reopened to the public.
Five years ago, the Potomac Conservancy began raising more than $3 million — twice the nonprofit’s annual operating budget — to buy White Horse Mountain and keep its 1,730 acres of hardwood forest, rocky outcroppings and shady streams from being developed into 70 homes. Their fundraising efforts trumpeted the importance of preserving the forest not only because it filters cool, clean water headed for the Potomac but so the public could continue to visit and enjoy the mountain.
Now, they can.
“The ability to get onto land that’s [been] conserved — being able to enhance wildlife and having places where the public can get on and experience those animals — is unique,” said Emily Warner, the conservancy’s senior director of land conservation and a West Virginia native.
Last year, after successfully completing the months-long purchasing process and protecting the land from development through a conservation easement, the nonprofit turned the ownership of White Horse Mountain over to the state. West Virginia’s Division of Natural Resources is maintaining it as a wildlife area, open to hunters, hikers, birders, mountain bikers and others whose uses align with conservation goals.
The state played a similar role 15 years ago when a timber company that owned White Horse Mountain leased it to the DNR to be managed as the Springfield Wildlife Management Area. The relic title still appears on the Google Maps label for the green area that includes White Horse Mountain. The area gained a reputation over the years as prime hunting grounds.
“When it got sold to the developer, it was a big loss to the local community,” said Rich Rogers, a wildlife biologist with the DNR who has hunting stories of his own tied to this land.
The land reopened to the public this fall, and the hunters who’d sought deer and turkey in these forests for decades flocked back.
While local hunters might know their way through these woods “like the back of their hand,” Rogers said, the state has only begun its work to make the property more accessible to other outdoors enthusiasts. The division recently hired a wildlife manager to oversee White Horse Mountain and three other wildlife areas, and he’ll be logging plenty of hours at White Horse this spring and summer.
New signs will go up at the entrance, parking areas will be built and roads left rutted by winter hunting vehicles will be restored, Rogers said. In the future, the division will work on removing invasive mile-a-minute vines in the forests and weedy fescue in the fields, replacing them with native species.
But there are already plenty of unique and native habitats to take in during an excursion on White Horse Mountain — as long as you remember it could be a wild one.
“Right now, it’s more like a refuge than a state park,” said the conservancy’s Warner. “It’s similar to other wildlife management areas in West Virginia: no campgrounds or swing sets or ballparks. There are a few trails, but mostly it’s woods and dirt roads.”
“Whatever you can do to amuse yourself with that,” she said, “go for it.”
Just east of the small town of Springfield, Rogers and I turned off Springfield Pike onto Swisher Hollow Road, where a small bridge straddles Abernathy Run. The nondescript road winds past the homes of a couple of private landowners — one of whom has discarded old vehicles and trash along the road, an eyesore that DNR staff say they’ll deal with soon. The road forks twice and we kept to the left, then right, with a gate closing off an old road that made the second choice clear.
Under a late-March sky that was still making up its mind between snow and rain, we decided to drive up a well-trod portion of the road that loops around the mountain. If we weren’t in a sturdy truck, or had better weather and a half-day to kill, I’d say the route would be easier by foot.
The forest around us was a diverse mix of hardwoods with some saplings just getting a foothold along the road. Rogers said that the mix of tree ages is one feature of the property that makes it so appealing to conservationists — and wildlife.
It’s not uncommon to see white-tailed deer and wild turkey in these parts. If the hunting season is open (in the fall for deer and from fall through April/May for turkey), be sure to wear bright-colored clothing and stay on the trails to avoid a hunter mistaking you for an animal. Black bear, bobcats and fishers — a dark-colored weasel that can look like some sort of black panther when it leaps past your headlight beams — are here, too. Rogers and others at the DNR are studying the bobcats and should know more about their activities soon.
Birds like the powder-blue, cerulean warbler, whose population has been diminishing, depend on a variety of habitats, including early successional forests. West Virginia “is a big part of their range,” Rogers said.
“This [younger] age of forest is what we’re really missing in West Virginia, where a lot of our forests have matured,” Rogers said, gesturing to the saplings sprouting nearby. “This is what really seemed to be lacking.”
The diversity of both ages and species of trees on White Horse Mountain is a remnant of its history as a landscape that was, in Rogers’ opinion, well-managed for years by a local timber company. Other pockets of the mountain are home to clusters of black cherry trees, fowl-friendly grasslands and rare rocky habitats that Warner said increase the diversity of plants and wildlife that can be spotted in one small space.
The Nature Conservancy donated eight of the area’s acres to permanently protect one of those habitats, called the Rock Dome Preserve, located on a southeast part of the mountain that’s not easily accessible and not open to the public. A recent study found that the mossy rockface, made of rare sandstone and acidic glades and sandstone cliffs, is likely home to two types of equally rare wildflowers: the imperiled oldfield toadflax and critically imperiled eastern fameflower.
Portions of the rocky area — and a rockface that Rogers said contains a historic shell midden — are visible on a drive-by from Clarence Taylor Road. After taking the long drive up and around White Horse Mountain, pull off the road for a moment here, where it runs alongside the South Branch of the Potomac River, to take in the height of it.
Don’t forget to admire that cool, clear water in the river, for which the mountain was preserved — at least in part — to protect.

For a direct route to the best roadside parking spot, type “Swisher Hollow Road & White Horse Loop, WV” into Google Maps.
The gate to White Horse Loop is closed after hunting season ends (in April/May), but visitors are welcome to travel the road by foot.
The path from Swisher Hollow Road to a powerline clearing on White Horse Loop is just less than 2.5 miles one way, with a change in elevation of more than 700 feet. The full White Horse Loop to the powerline and back along White Horse Ridge Road is 4 miles. The road continues another 1.5 miles beyond the powerline for an even longer hike.

Williams finds new home on Saluki offense,www.wsiltv.com,Sean Conway,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.wsiltv.com/story/40241567/williams-finding-new-home-on-saluki-offense,"CARBONDALE -- A true team player will do whatever it takes to help their team to win, regardless of what position the coach puts them in. One Saluki is changing gears to do his part in helping his team this upcoming season.
After coming to SIU as a quarterback, redshirt freshman Javon Williams Jr. is moving to running back next season.
Having already learned the offense from his season as a Q-B, including his use in the ground game, Williams says the move has been fairly smooth this spring.
""It was an easy transition, just because of my natural ability to run the football,"" said Williams.
""Just looking at him, he's an impressive looking guy. He's big, 240, he can move well, cut well. I mean, just he doesn't have any problems running the ball from the quarterback position, so I mean, he transitioned that well, and he's learning the offense from the running back position every day. and he's getting better at it,"" said SIU redshirt freshman quarterback Nic Baker.
While running the football may be something Williams knows how to do, one job that's new to him is protecting the quarterback in the passing game.
""You know, he just needs reps, he needs reps, and that's why when he's in there, he gets the ball a lot, just because somehow he needs to feel that from the running back position, and there's things that he's got to continue to pick up on. I feel like he's picked up on the pass protection part of things, which is always the toughest,"" said SIU head football coach Nick Hill.
""Pass protection. Coach says I'm doing okay, but I feel like there's room for improvement, just picking up the corner cat or just knowing who I'm getting,"" said Williams.
Those improvements will come in time with practice and repetition.
One thing Williams never lacks in though, is confidence in his ability to move the ball down the field.
""Oh, just put the ball in my hands, I'm going to do something with it, man,"" said Williams.
Saluki fans will get a chance to see what Williams can do with the ball in his hands at the annual Spring Game Saturday, April 6 th ."

SIU returned home to host Murray State Tuesday afternoon.
Katelyn Massa and Megan Brown got Southern going, leading off the second inning with back-to-back homers. SIU added two runs more off bases loaded walks later in the inning.
Holly Marousek took care of the rest, retiring the final 17 batters she faced on the way to a complete game shutout helping the Salukis get their sixth straight win, 4-0 was the final.
It's a quick turnaround for the Salukis who are back in action Wednesday at St. Louis."

Market Remains Overvalued,www.advisorperspectives.com,Doug Short,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2019/04/02/market-remains-overvalued,"By Jill Mislinski
Here is a summary of the four market valuation indicators we update on a monthly basis.
The Crestmont Research P/E Ratio ( more ) The cyclical P/E ratio using the trailing 10-year earnings as the divisor ( more ) The Q Ratio, which is the total price of the market divided by its replacement cost The relationship of the S&P Composite price to a regression trendline To facilitate comparisons, we've adjusted the two P/E ratios and Q Ratio to their arithmetic means and the inflation-adjusted S&P Composite to its exponential regression. Thus the percentages on the vertical axis show the over/undervaluation as a percent above mean value, which we're using as a surrogate for fair value. Based on the latest S&P 500 monthly data, the market is overvalued somewhere in the range of 50% to 125%, depending on the indicator, down from 67% to 127% the previous month.
We've plotted the S&P regression data as an area chart type rather than a line to make the comparisons a bit easier to read. It also reinforces the difference between the line charts - which are simple ratios - and the regression series, which measures the distance from an exponential regression on a log chart.
The chart below differs from the one above in that the two valuation ratios (P/E and Q) are adjusted to their geometric mean rather than their arithmetic mean (which is what most people think of as the ""average""). The geometric mean increases our attention to outliers. In our view, the first chart does a satisfactory job of illustrating these four approaches to market valuation, but we've included the geometric variant as an interesting alternative view for the two P/Es and Q. In this chart, the range of overvaluation would be in the range of 62% to 140%, down from last month's 81% to 141%.
The Average of the Four Valuation Indicators The next chart gives a simplified summary of valuations by plotting the average of the four arithmetic series (the first chart above) along with the standard deviations above and below the mean.
At the end of last month, the average of the four is 91% - down from 95% the previous month.
Here is the same chart, this time with the geometric mean and deviations. The latest value of 156% is up from last month's 150%.
As we've frequently pointed out, these indicators aren't useful as short-term signals of market direction. Periods of over- and under-valuation can last for many years. But they can play a role in framing longer-term expectations of investment returns. At present, market overvaluation continues to suggest a cautious long-term outlook and guarded expectations. However, at today's low annualized inflation rate and the extremely poor return on fixed income investments (Treasuries, CDs, etc.) the appeal of equities, despite overvaluation risk, is not surprising. For more on that topic, see our periodic update:
Market Valuation, Inflation, and Treasury Yields: Clues from the Past Market Valuation and Actual Subsequent 10-Year Total Returns Many of our readers have requested we reproduce a chart by John Hussman that inverts the S&P 10-year total returns. Hussman says ""the most reliable correlation between valuations and subsequent returns is on a 12-year horizon, which is the point where the autocorrelation profile of valuations typically hits zero."" The correlation of valuations Hussman uses for comparison is at about 90%.
You will notice that nominal returns are used - this is a direct result of a sort of Fisher-effect in which inflation ends up being washed out of the calculation. The nominal growth rate of the economy is highly correlated with the level of interest rates, but also negatively correlated with market valuations, all over the same time period.
Here are the Geometric Average of the Four again and the recreated Hussman charts together. Please again note that the Hussman returns chart is inverted .
Points of 'secular' undervaluation such as 1922, 1932, 1949, 1974 and 1982 typically occurred about 50% below historical mean valuations, and were associated with subsequent 10-year nominal total returns approaching 20% annually. By contrast, valuations similar to 1929, 1965 and 2000 were followed by weak or negative total returns over the following decade. That's the range where we find ourselves today. Of course, we also won't be surprised if the S&P 500 ends up posting weak or negative total returns in the 2007-2017 decade, which would require nothing but a run-of-the-mill bear market over the next couple of years. - John Hussman"
MAS investigations on 1MDB ongoing in Singapore Malaysia Today,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/highlight/2019/03/20/mas-investigations-on-1mdb-ongoing-in-singapore/,"MAS investigations on 1MDB ongoing in Singapore By March 20, 2019 7:35 PM Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) (AFP pic)
SINGAPORE: There are ongoing investigations into other financial institutions and individuals suspected of being involved in 1MDB-related offences, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).
In its inaugural Enforcement Report released here today, MAS said the 1MDB review is its most comprehensive anti-money laundering and countering of financing of terrorism exercise to date.
In the report, 1MDB is one of the featured cases for money laundering-related control breaches by entities and individuals.
MAS said it worked closely with the Attorney-General’s Chambers, Commercial Affairs Department as well as foreign regulatory and law enforcement agencies, to uncover a complex web of transactions involving numerous offshore shell companies and conspirators operating in multiple jurisdictions.
The central bank said it had taken decisive regulatory action by shutting down banks, imposing financial penalties against financial institutions which failed to meet the expected anti-money laundering standards and banned errant individuals from Singapore’s financial industry.
MAS has ordered BSI Bank Ltd and Falcon Private Bank Ltd, Singapore branch, to shut down.
A total of S$30 million (RM90 million) in fines has also been imposed on eight financial institutions, namely BSI Bank Ltd, Falcon Private Bank Ltd, Singapore branch, Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore branch, Coutts & Co Ltd, Singapore branch, UBS AG, Singapore branch, DBS Bank Ltd, United Overseas Bank and Credit Suisse.
The central bank has also issued directives such as bank managements to investigate lapses, address control deficiencies and take appropriate disciplinary measures against bank staff involved.
It also issued prohibition orders (POs) against eight individuals, ranging from three years to a lifetime.
The lifetime POs were issued to four persons, namely to Yeo Jiawei, a former BSI Singapore banker, Yak Yew Chee, a former managing director of Swiss bank BSI, Jens Fred Sturzenegger, a former branch manager of Falcon Private Bank Ltd, Singapore branch, and Tim Leissner, a former Goldman Sachs director.
MAS’ Enforcement Report outlines its enforcement priorities and provides for greater accountability and transparency into the actions taken against breaches of its rules and regulations.
The report will be published every 18 months.
“As Singapore’s financial industry grows in size and complexity, so will the risks of financial misconduct,” said MAS’ executive director (enforcement) Gillian Tan, in a statement accompanying the report.
She said enforcement played a critical role in financial supervision through the detection, investigation and punishment of serious misconduct.
“This is intended to deter illegal and unethical behaviour and protect consumers,” she added.
Tan said the Enforcement Report provided detailed insights into MAS’ enforcement work and priorities, and the public and financial sectors with a comprehensive picture of ongoing efforts to preserve the integrity of Singapore’s financial markets.

Her response to questions about when she planned on having kids? “I said, ‘You know, if elected, I’ll have 150,000 children who I will have to take care of,’” said Sewell, a Democratic congresswoman who represents Alabama’s 7th district.
Such is the life of a woman running for office — even as women have made strides toward greater political representation.
“People see the end result,” said Sewell. “They never see the journey.” And that makes talking about the obstacles along that path all the more important.
By 2018, when Veronica Escobar became one of the first two Latinas elected to represent Texas in Congress, she had worked in local politics for quite some time — first as an aide then as an elected official. She was familiar with what she describes as self-imposed guilt about “about not being there when my kids were little.” She knew what to expect from the rigors of a campaign. Even so, as she approached a congressional run, there was one thing that seemed especially daunting.
“My biggest fear was my inability to raise money, and it’s what everyone from D.C. was like: ‘Can you raise the money?’ ‘Can you raise the money?’” Escobar said. “And it’s particularly hard, I think, for women of color and women from working-class families and middle-class families.”
She remembers operatives telling her to figure out who could donate the maximum contribution of $2,700 to her campaign, or even double that, a combined primary/general election donation of $5,400 — a massive sum that felt unattainable and out of touch with her reality.
“I felt badly asking family members for $100, because that’s a big check to write in my community,” said Escobar. “And I had folks from the outside saying, ‘I want you to put together a list of everybody that you have in your circle that will double max.’ Uh, nobody?”
“When you grow up self-reliant, or you think you’re self-reliant — the hard part [is] asking for help,” said Sewell, who joined Escobar onstage for a “Women Rule” recording at the SXSW festival in Austin last month. “That’s the hardest part about [running for office], in my opinion.”
Which isn’t to say that the other aspects of running for office are easy.
There’s the personal toll. Escobar recalled a recent conversation with her 22-year-old son, who was in third grade when she first entered politics. She asked him what it was like having his mom in the arena. “And he said, ‘You know, you weren’t there a lot, but we got used to it.’ And I wanted to cry,” said Escobar. “Because I was, like, ‘But you’re supposed to say that it taught you that women can do anything, and that it made you feel empowered that you had this mom that was doing this stuff.”
There’s also the propensity for self-judgement. “Sometimes, we, as women, can be our worst enemies,” said Sewell. “Men look in the mirror, and they see ‘president,’ ‘governor,’ and ‘senator.’ And we look in the mirror, and we see pimples and wrinkles.”
But more often than not, the barriers to progress are external and seemingly intractable.
While writing her senior thesis at Princeton in the 1980s, Sewell interviewed Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to Congress. “The question I asked her was, ‘As between being black and a woman, which has been the biggest barrier to your life as a congressperson and to your life, in general?’” Sewell recalled. “And she looked at me, and without hesitation, she said the following, and I say it, too: ‘Unequivocally, being a woman.’ Now, what does that say, that 30 years later, I’m saying the exact same thing?”

The City Without Jews prefigured the rise of the Third Reich.,slate.com,Jordan Hoffman,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://slate.com/culture/2019/04/the-city-without-jews-restoration.html,"Joaquin Phoenix Puts on a Happy Face in the First Trailer for Joker For a story about the forced expulsion of an entire ethnic group, Hans Karl Breslauer and Ida Jenbach’s The City Without Jews is oddly good-natured. Adapted from Hugo Bettauer’s novel, the 1924 satire is not dissimilar from other light silent films of the era. The scenario was topical, but intended as ludicrous, a “be-careful-what-you-wish-for” fable whose moral argues for tolerance, if of a somewhat backhanded kind. Just 14 years later the Nuremberg Laws were passed in Austria and the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration was established in Vienna, with Adolf Eichmann at its head. By 1942, there were only 800 Viennese Jews left in hiding , down from more than 200,000 when Bettauer wrote his book 20 years earlier. Once home to Freud, Schnitzler, and Schönberg, Vienna really had become a city without Jews. The City Without Jews was a successful book, as was most of Bettauer’s output at the time. A novelist and newspaperman, Bettauer was known for capturing Vienna’s zeitgeist and getting it onto paper quickly. ( The City Without Jews was one of five books he published in 1922.) The film wasn’t as big of a sensation, with critics or with audiences, but it was still a success, selling out enormous theaters in Vienna. In Berlin and elsewhere, it caused something of a stir, prompting hisses, derisive laughter, and demands for ticket refunds. In suburban Wiener Neustadt, a group of early Nazis threw stink bombs to disrupt a screening. (It played in New York City in 1928 but got only a fleeting mention in the New York Times .) The film was thought lost for decades, until an incomplete version was found in an Amsterdam archive in 1991. In 2016, a collector discovered a complete copy at a Paris flea market . With the aid of crowdsourcing, the Austrian Film Archive debuted a clean, full version last year. It continues to tour at festivals, cinematheques, and museums worldwide, and will screen on Thursday with musical accompaniment at the Leo Baeck Institute, one of the five principal organizations that form, like Voltron, the Center for Jewish History in New York. “I hate to bring up the old cliché of the frog in slowly boiling water not realizing it’s in danger, but, well, I’ll bring it up anyway, because it’s apt,” Leo Baeck’s executive director William Weitzer says. Looking at the speed with which institutionalized anti-Semitism grew from a speculative topic into violent law is something he cautions “we can’t be inured from.” He is eager to showcase the film with an eye toward the striking, recent rise of anti-Semitism in Europe ; the spike in Jewish emigration, particularly in France ; and the success of far-right parties around the world. A reflection of Trumpist repercussions in the United States was less of an inspiration—“though maybe give it enough time,” he darkly jokes. In the movie, the city of Utopia is in economic disarray. Its people are poor and angry. Some blame the Jews. (So far, none of this is fiction except for the name of the city; the novel was explicitly set in Vienna and featured characters who were clear stand-ins for politicians of the day.) Some politicians think kicking the Jews out of town will solve all their problems. There are three councilors, one of whom is virulently anti-Semitic, even though his daughter is married to Jew. Another is more lenient. (His daughter is dating a Jew, too.) A third has anti-Semitism perpetually on the brain. At the end of the movie, he falls into a delusional haze and sees Jewish stars floating around his head. The doctors declare him a Zionist. (This is intended as comedy.) The chancellor is convinced to pass an edict. The archdiocese mutters something about us all being flesh and blood but doesn’t push back too hard. The Jews must go (unless they are second-generation half-Jews), but they are allowed to bring their fortunes with them. (Naturally they’ll have to pay a heavy tax, which was very much the case for Jews who tried to leave Vienna later.) The Jews exit, mostly by train, in an eerily bloodless foreshadowing of Holocaust cinema to come. Then Utopia falls further apart. The banks are a mess, no other nations will trade with them, their theaters have turned bland, women are buying frumpy dresses, and even the prostitutes in the beer hall cry that they “have nothing without my Cohn!” We check in with some of the Jews we’ve met (one comic relief character is having a rough time fitting in in Palestine) and the lost boyfriend returns with a Guy Incognito –esque mustache, pretending to be French. With Utopia’s back against the wall, the chancellor begrudgingly lets the Jews return. The message is positive but still worrying. Jews shuttle back and forth, less like people and more like an idea. “The film, looked at now, has a bit of an extreme philo-Semitism that can then lead to anti-Semitism,” Leo Baeck’s Weitzer comments. He’s hit upon something key. The City Without Jews renounces any top-down edict to expel Jews. But not really because it is immoral; mostly because Jews are good with money. If one wants to get even more sinister, one could interpret the film as saying that one city alone can’t drive out its Jews. For this solution to be final, all of Europe must unite on the idea and become Judenrein . The City Without Jews never became one, but this pro-tolerance work, with just a little bit of tweaking, could have mutated into an inadvertent anti-Semitic tract. Noah Isenberg, who wrote the catalog essay on The City Without Jews for the Austrian Film Archives and will be presenting it at the Leo Baeck Institute, points out that the topics of passing, intermarriage, and who gets dubbed an outsider are central to the story, and enhanced in the film version. (Much of the background for this piece was gleaned from a manuscript of Isenberg’s catalog essay A Cinematic Salvo From Interwar Austria: Hans Karl Breslauer’s Die Stadt Ohne Juden [The City Without Jews, 1924] soon to be published in German by the Austrian Film Archive.) Although Bettauerwas born Jewish and converted at the age of 18, Isenberg warns not to read too much into Bettauer’s change of faith. “It was very much the norm” he says. “There is no contemporary analogy. He was just as Jewish after his conversion; this was just a ticket into European culture.” The reemergence of the film from the fog of history has extra resonance considering the fate of its key creators. Less than a year after the film’s release, in March 1925, a Nazi named Otto Rothstock shot and killed Hugo Bettauer. It was the first political murder by a Nazi in Austria. Rothstock’s defense was that he was trying to protect German culture from a degenerate Jewish influence. He was found guilty but sent to a mental asylum. He was released a year later and lived until at least 1977, when he gave an unrepentant interview to Austria’s ORF broadcasting company. Hans Karl Breslauer left the film industry and began writing light newspaper columns under a pen name, eventually joining the Nazi Party. After the war, he was an unsuccessful fiction writer. Noah Isenberg says there isn’t enough evidence to suggest whether Breslauer, who worked closely with Jews his whole career, was a true believer or, like Bettauer years earlier, this was a conversion merely to “stay afloat.” Less lucky was the film’s co-screenwriter Ida Jenbach, a Jew, who was deported to the Minsk ghetto. Her time and place of death after the deportation remain unknown. “Bettauer tells an anecdote that he was inspired to write the book by seeing placards littering Vienna, decrying miscegenation, in 1920,” Isenberg says. “There were these folkish, nationalist political campaigns about Jews defiling gentile women,” Isenberg tells me. (It’s worth noting that the two inter-religious relationships in the film are between Jewish men and non-Jewish women.) “It’s a crazy parallel to the rhetoric of miscegenation today. This film is not the stuff of sci-fi. The timeliness has not gone away, regrettably.”"

Nearly a quarter of Colorado Springs’ registered voters have returned their ballots for the city’s April 2 election to select a mayor and three at-large City Council members and decide whether firefighters get collective bargaining privileges.
By Friday, 61,070 ballots had been returned, and nearly 4,000 more arrived by midday Monday, City Clerk Sarah Johnson said.
The city mailed out 267,714 ballots in early March.
With one day left in the election, voter turnout is about 24 percent, compared with the city’s 41.2 percent average for general municipal elections over the past 10 years.
Turnout in the 2017 municipal election was about 32 percent, with 84,496 of 261,251 ballots returned.
Johnson said the number of ballots still could exceed 80,000.
“I’m hoping so,” she said. “I’m ever optimistic.”
While it’s too late for ballots to be mailed, those who haven’t voted still have time, Johnson said. Ballots returned to any of the city’s drop boxes around town or to the clerk’s office by 7 p.m. Tuesday will be counted.
Drop box locations are listed at coloradosprings.gov/city-elections . The city clerk’s office is in the City Administration Building, 30 S. Nevada Ave.
Eleven candidates are vying for the three council seats. Councilmen Bill Murray and Tom Strand are seeking re-election. Also running are Regina English , a nonprofit founder who works with at-risk youth; Army veteran Tony Gioia , a former El Paso County planning commissioner; former state Rep. Gordon Klingenschmitt ; Terry Martinez , former principal at Will Rogers Elementary School; Athena Roe , an attorney who works on probate reform; former at-large Councilman Val Snider , who served from 2011-15; Army veteran Dennis Spiker ; Randy Tuck , who worked in construction; and former Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams .
Four candidates are running for mayor: Lawrence Martinez, John Pitchford , Juliette Parker and incumbent John Suthers .
Also on the ballot is Issue 1, seeking collective bargaining rights for the city’s firefighters."

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced on Thursday the three final teams who will compete for the privilege of completing a project tasking them with building shelters that will make life habitable on Mars and the moon.
NASA, on Thursday, named the top three finalists in its 3D-Printed Habitat Challenge , CNN reported Monday . Three teams were selected out of the remaining 11 that had been tasked with creating designs for structures that would allow humans to feasibility live for some time period on Mars , the moon and elsewhere, according to Fox News . What might a human habitat on Mars look like? We challenged citizen inventors to imagine life-supporting environments on the Red Planet by creating a full-scale habitat design using modeling software. Three winners were recently selected: https://t.co/ffUmjvDyN4 pic.twitter.com/7Xu4JLU1td
The three teams — SEArch+/Apis Cor, Zoperhous and Mars Incubator — split a $100,000 prize, Fox reported.
The challenge began in 2015, Fox reported.
The teams will compete in a final round in May and will be tasked with 3D-printing their models. The winner will receive $800,000.
The final competitions come after President Donald Trump signed Space Policy Directive 1 in 2017. The directive promised to “refocus America’s space program on human exploration and discovery.” Trump also authorized NASA to “lead an innovative space exploration program to send American astronauts back to the moon, and eventually Mars.”

US Islamic Scholar Praises Brunei’s Death Penalty For Homosexuality,dailycallernewsfoundation.org,Joshua Gill,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://dailycallernewsfoundation.org/2019/04/02/us-islamic-scholar-praises-bruneis-death-penalty-for-homosexuality/,"Home >> US News >> US Islamic Scholar Praises Brunei’s Death Penalty For Homosexuality US Islamic Scholar Praises Brunei’s Death Penalty For Homosexuality Posted by: Joshua Gill in US News April 2, 2019 0 394 Subscribe: CDN Daily Briefing
An American scholar of Islam publicly praised the sultan of Brunei for instituting death by stoning for “rectum-sex enthusiasts” in accordance with Sharia law.
Daniel Haqiqatjou, a Harvard alumnus and writer and lecturer on Islam and modernity, wrote and shared an article on social media Saturday in which he fawned over the Sultan of Brunei for instituting the death penalty for “rectum-sex enthusiasts” and urged other Muslim majority countries to follow suit. Haqiqatjou founded the Alasna Institute, which provides training in Islamic apologetics, and has been featured in articles on CNN, The Washington Post, Al Jazeera, The Atlantic, and First Things.
“If you have had a rough week or are feeling down in the dumps, I have just the news to cheer you up. The Muslim country of Brunei is implementing hudud to crack down on sodomites and fornicators!” Haqiqatjou wrote on his website MuslimSkeptic , using the Arabic word meaning “punishments mandated by God.”
“The Sharia protects all of our rights, individually and communally. When rectum-sex enthusiasts are allowed to promote their gender-bending degeneracy openly, that deeply harms all of us,” he added.
Haqiqatjou also mocked politicians and celebrities proposing boycotts of Brunei-owned hotels and businesses, and suggested that Muslims should counteract boycotts by frequenting Brunei. He also suggested that Muslim from western nations go to Brunei to witness public canings so that the could learn what is, in his view, the proper way to implement Sharia.
“I think Muslims need to counteract any boycott by making Brunei their next vacation destination spot,” Haqiqatjou wrote. “Maybe some of these expensive spiritual tourism tours led by shuyukh can make Brunei the next go-to site, maybe attend a caning or two so Western Muslims can experience first hand what implementing hudud actually means. Just a thought.”
“By the way, how silly that these Western politicians and celebrities can’t stand it that a Muslim country implements the Sharia,” he added. “They are frothing with anger. Isn’t it great?”
Haqiqatjou has criticized western Muslims in past writings, like his response to the Pulse Nightclub shooting , warning that out of fear of Islamophobia they are embracing a western liberal ideology that does not actually respect or line up with Muslim teachings.
His praise for the death penalty for homosexuality in Brunei, however, seems to conflict with comments he has made in the past concerning violence against LGBT individuals.
“I have been clear that bullying, assaulting, or indiscriminately killing people merely because they self-identify as or are presumed to be gay is something Muslims around the world should oppose according to their religious principles and traditions,” he wrote in his response to the Pulse Nightclub shooting.
“In actuality, I do care about those who consider themselves gay, lesbian, or transgender, whether they are Muslims or non-Muslims” he added.
Homosexuality and adultery will be punishable by flogging or death by stoning as of April 3.

The chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party was indicted Tuesday on conspiracy and bribery charges for attempting to influence the state’s insurance commissioner through campaign donations, according to the Department of Justice.
NCGOP chairman Robin Hayes, also a former U.S. Congressman from the state’s 8th District, was indicted along with wealthy Durham businessman Greg Lindberg and two of his associates, John Gray and John Palermo.
All four were charged with conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud and bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds and aiding and abetting. Hayes was also charged with three counts of making false statements to the FBI, according to the indictment.
Additionally, the indictment mentioned “Public Official A,” who was identified by Politico as North Carolina Rep. Mark Walker .
The indictment alleges that from April 2017 through August 2018, Lindberg made donations arranged by Gray and Palermo to the North Carolina GOP and into two independent expenditure committees created to benefit the re-election campaign of North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey. In exchange for the donations, Causey agreed to replace his senior deputy commissioner, who was responsible for overseeing one of Lindberg’s companies.
At some point, Causey contacted authorities to report the scheme, and began recording his conversations with Gray and Palermo. The FBI took over the case in August of 2018. Causey was not charged in the indictment.
Walker is mentioned as a target of Lindberg’s in his initial effort to influence Causey to replace his employee. The indictment alleges that Lindberg reached out to Walker through Gray, asking if Walker could call Causey on his behalf. Walker allegedly phoned Causey and endorsed Lindberg as a businessman. Several days later, a $150,000 donation was made to the Mark Walker Victory Fund by Lindberg, according to Politico.
Walker briefly spoke with Politico, denying any wrongdoing. “We’re not even part of this investigation,” Walker said. “I’m not going to get into [that with] you with any kind of details.” Walker’s spokesman, Jack Minor, reiterated that Walker has been neither charged or indicted, and is fully cooperating with the probe.
For his part, Hayes allegedly funneled half of a $500,000 donation made by Lindberg to the NCGOP into Causey’s re-election account. North Carolina Republican Party counsel Josh Howard said the party had been cooperating with the investigation “for several months.” Hayes had announced his retirement as the state GOP chair Monday, citing health concerns.
“The indictment unsealed today outlines a brazen bribery scheme in which Greg Lindberg and his co-conspirators allegedly offered hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions in exchange for action that would benefit Lindberg’s business interests,” said Assistant District Attorney General Brian Benczkowski in a statement .
All four men had surrendered to authorities prior to the hearing and were released on a $100,000 unsecured bond, according to CBS WBTV.
None of the people indicted responded directly to requests for comments made by Politico.
It is the second major political controversy for the Tar Heel state this year, having been forced to order a new election for the state’s 9th Congressional district due to corruption.

Saudi Arabia appears to be buying silence from the children of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the form of million-dollar houses and thousands of dollars every month, The Washington Post reports. Officials told the newspaper that the payments are an attempt to force the Khashoggi family to be restrained in their public statements about the killing of their father by Saudi operatives in Istanbul six months ago. The homes and monthly payments of at least $10,000 to each sibling were approved by King Salman in an attempt “to make a wrong right,” the officials added. It’s possible that the two sons and two daughters could also receive tens of millions of dollars as part of “blood money” negotiations that are expected to take place when the trials of Khashoggi’s accused killers are completed. A Saudi official rejected the suggestion that the Khashoggi family was being forced to remain silent. “Such support is part of our custom and culture,” the official said. “It is not attached to anything else.” Saudi Arabia Paying Khashoggi’s Kids Thousands Every Month Cheat Sheet ®"
