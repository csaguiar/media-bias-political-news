Beto O'Rourke Looks to Regain Steam with Climate Change Proposal,www.cbn.com,John Jessup,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/beto-orourke-looks-to-regain-steam-with-climate-change-proposal,"Democratic presidential candidates are trying to break out from the two-dozen opponents by going specific with their agendas.
After an initial hot start, Beto O'Rouke has been steadily losing steam in the polls. Now the one-time top contender is out front with the first comprehensive proposal.
""Muy Buenos Dias ( A very good morning) from Yosemite Valley here in California where we are announcing the most ambitious climate plan in the history of the United States,"" O'Rouke said Monday.
The former Texas congressman is trying to reignite his once bright but fading star as the first candidate to lay out a major policy plan. And his focus is on climate change.
""I want you to be part of this effort,"" he told supporters.
The 10-year, $5 trillion plan, he says, would require the participation of all Americans and touch every sector from housing to health care, transportation, and pensions.
The four-part proposal would start on day one of an O'Rourke presidency by recommitting to the Paris Climate Accord and undoing the Trump administration's environmental agenda.
It would also raise taxes on businesses and the wealthy to fund the sweeping plan, which aims to cut carbon emissions to ""net zero"" by 2050 and get halfway there by 2030.
""It's hard to argue there's anything more important facing this country - this generation today,"" O'Rourke said.
He named climate change the ""greatest threat"" America faces.
The plan gives O'Rourke the chance to potentially avoid recent characterizations as a political lightweight."
Second 'Drag Queen Story Hour' Reader in Houston Exposed as a Convicted Child Sex Offender,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/second-drag-queen-story-hour-reader-in-houston-exposed-as-a-convicted-child-sex-offender,"The Houston, Texas group known as the Houston MassResistance activists have exposed a second ""drag queen"" as a convicted child sex offender, who was involved in reading stories to children at a local library.
LifeSite News reports the man was convicted of multiple sexual assaults against four young children (ages 4, 5, 6, and 8) in 2004. He was incarcerated and is listed as a ""high-risk sex offender.""
The man was part of a local drag queen group called the ""Space City Sisters"" who were invited by the Houston Public Library to read stories to little children during an event promoted as ""Drag Queen Story Hour."" The convicted sex offender served as a greeter for the event, according to LifeSite News . The activists also uncovered that the man had worked as a transgender prostitute and a porn actor.
According to their website, the Space City Sisters is a local chapter of a national organization of cross-dressing homosexual men. The men dress as parodies of Catholic nuns in order to mock Catholicism. The organization is active in gay pride parades and LGTBQ events across the country.
In March, the MassResistance activists also found another drag queen reading to children during a story time hour was also a sex offender.
Library officials later apologized for failing to conduct a background check on men who read to children at an event hosted by drag queens, according to MSN ."
"North Carolina Campus Shooting Leaves 2 Dead, 4 Injured",www.cbn.com,Associated Press,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/april/shots-reported-at-university-of-north-carolinas-charlotte-campus-school-on-lockdown,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — A shooting on a North Carolina university campus left two people dead and four wounded Tuesday, prompting a lockdown and chaotic scene in the state’s largest city.
UNC Charlotte issued a campus lockdown late Tuesday afternoon, saying shots had been fired. Later in the evening, the campus was declared secure after a suspect was taken into custody.
“Shots reported near kennedy. Run, Hide, Fight. Secure yourself immediately,” the university said in an alert, referring to the school’s Kennedy building on campus.
Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency said on Twitter that two people were killed, two others had life-threatening injuries and another two people were treated for less serious injuries. They said the numbers could change.
Aerial shots from local television news outlets showed police officers running toward a building, while another view showed students running on a campus sidewalk.
The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department later said that the campus had been secured and that officers were going through buildings to let people who had sheltered in place know that it was safe. Police said that one suspect was in custody, and it didn’t appear that others were involved.
It was not immediately clear whether the victims were students.
The university has more than 26,500 students and 3,000 faculty and staff. The campus is located northeast of the city center and is surrounded by residential areas.
Sam Rice, a senior on UNC Charlotte’s tennis team, told Spectrum News that he was in the library studying for a final exam when he heard people yelling “shooter, shooter.” He said he heard police yelling for people to stay down and stay on the floor.
He was “waiting for someone to tell us everything was going to be OK.”
When people were told to leave, he ran out in his socks, running over glass on the floor.
His reaction is “just shock,” he told the television station. “It doesn’t feel real.”
Susan Harden, a UNCC professor, and Mecklenburg County Commissioner was at home when she heard of the shooting. She went to a staging area, she said, to provide support.
Harden said she has taught inside the Kennedy building, where the shootings occurred.
“It breaks my heart. We’re torn up about what’s happened,” Harden said. “Students should be able to learn in peace and in safety and professors ought to be able to do their jobs in safety.”

"Violence in Venezuela: Maduro's Military Fights Guaido Uprising, Drives Over Civilian Protestors",www.cbn.com,CBN News,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/april/violence-in-venezuela-maduros-military-fights-guaido-uprising-drives-over-civilian-protestors,"CBN News Contributing Reporter Chuch Holton appeared on CBN's Newswatch program Tuesday to talk about the situation in Venezuela and what his sources in the Venezuelan military were telling him about the uprising.
Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido took to the streets with a top activist and some heavily armed soldiers Tuesday, calling for the military to rise up and overthrow socialist leader Nicolás Maduro.
Violent street battles erupted during the early morning hours in parts of Caracas in what was the most serious challenge yet to Maduro’s rule.
Despite media reports that the rebellion seems to have limited military support, CBN News Contributing Reporter Chuck Holton says this move has been planned by members of the military for some time.
""I've been meeting with members of the Venezuelan military who defected back on Jan. 23rd when the aid got burned there,"" Holton told CBN 's Newswatch program Tuesday. ""What they were telling me is that this has been planned for some time. Now they believe it may have gone off a little half-cocked, but they told me the military of Venezuela has been behind Guaido in large parts, a vast majority of them, but they have been waiting for the right moment to strike.""
""These troops have families,"" Holton noted. ""And if they stand up to Maduro, the troops and their families are in great peril. This is a widespread movement not just in Caracas.""
Guaido started the day's events when he appeared in an early morning video that showed him surrounded by heavily-armed soldiers outside a Caracas air base. He said the soldiers were joining him to protect the country's constitution.

— Juan Guaidó (@jguaido) April 30, 2019
Guiado then took to the streets with activist Leopoldo Lopez who said he'd just been set free by members of the military in response to an order from Guaido.
Lopez said, ""I want to tell the Venezuelan people: this is the moment to take to the streets and accompany these patriotic soldiers.""
One of the soldiers said ""it's now or never.""

Thousands of protestors have responded to the call to rise up. Maduro's military has responded as well and has targeted the protestors. This graphic video below shows a military vehicle driving into a crowd and running over people.

— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) April 30, 2019
Guiado is the head of the Venezuelan National Assembly and is recognized by dozens of countries — including the US — as Venezuela's president.
Maduro's government said it's putting down what it callse a small coup attempt by military traitors working with right-wing opponents.
The country's Supreme Court issued arrest warrants for Guaido, Lopez, and other opposition leaders.
President Donald Trump tweeted his support for the protestors saying: ""I am monitoring the situation in Venezuela very closely. The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom! ""

Earlier, Rubio encouraged Guaido supporters, tweeting, ""Today there can be no bystanders in #Venezuela... military, police, judicial & political leaders you must either support restoring constitutional democracy or you are a supporter of Cuba's efforts to colonize Venezuela...the choice you make will define the rest of your life.""
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded to the uprising in Venezuela tweeting this morning: ""Today interim President Juan Guaido announced the start of Operacion Libertad. The U.S. government fully supports the Venezuelan people in their quest for freedom and democracy. Democracy cannot be defeated.""

40 Million Americans Will Miss At Least One Credit Card Payment In 2019,www.cbn.com,MoneyTips,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/april/40-million-americans-will-miss-at-least-one-credit-card-payment-in-2019,"It's another lean financial month. You'll be lucky just to make the minimum payment on your credit card bill. Should you wait until you can pay a larger portion of your bill, or pay what you can on time?
In a recent WalletHub survey, almost 16% of respondents said they expected to miss at least one credit card payment in 2019, equating to over forty million people nationwide. That's the wrong answer to the above question.
It's far better to make a partial credit card payment on time than it is to delay payment. Not only will you incur late fees (typically in the $20-$40 range) per missed payment, you'll also temporarily lose your grace period. Grace periods keep interest charges from the beginning until the end of the monthly payment cycle. Without a grace period, interest accrues from the time of purchase.
You may also incur a penalty annual percentage rate (APR) that's higher than your usual card APR (typically near 30%).
If your payment is more than thirty days late , then the late payment will be reported to the credit reporting agencies. The late payment will drop your credit score and cause lenders to re-assess your risk. You may have trouble qualifying for credit/loans or pay more for the privilege in the future. You can check your credit score and read your credit report for free within minutes by joining MoneyTips .
Convinced? Good. Now how do you avoid late credit card payments? Survey results suggest that you set a reminder.
The top reason by far to miss a credit card payment is the old classic – ""I forgot."" Approximately 46% of respondents gave this reason for missing a payment.
Does that excuse work anywhere else in life? It won't work with credit card companies, either – more than once. The survey found that 91% of people who asked to get a credit card late fee waived were successful (although it's unclear if a second request will be granted). Even if the fee is waived, you'll still lose the grace period and may see a penalty APR.
With all the ways to set reminders, there's no reason to forget a payment. Set regular alerts on your phone or computer. See if your credit card issuer offers reminders. Use old-school handwritten notes. Tattoo your payment schedule on your forehead if you have to. Do whatever it takes.
If all reminder options fail – or you're too busy traveling, as 9% of respondents were – consider setting up an automatic payment through your bank account. Since high-income consumers were twice as likely as low-income consumers to miss credit card payments due to forgetfulness, automatic payment may be a viable option. Consumers should only use automatic payments if they monitor their bank balance and can keep enough money in the account to avoid overdrafts.
As for the 29% of respondents who don't have enough money, the question is why. Are you spending more than you can afford to pay? Review your budget and look for ways to save.
Meanwhile, divide the money you do have to ensure that at least the minimum payment is made on all bills. Credit card debt is probably the highest interest debt you have. It must be addressed immediately after any payments on secured assets (like a mortgage or car payment).
Ultimately, if you can't pay your credit card bill on time for financial reasons, you have to charge less or find a way to get more income. It's critical to make at least the minimum payment on time to avoid making a bad situation even worse.

New Account Credit Card Fraud Up 24% In 2018: The Top Frauds of 2018,www.cbn.com,MoneyTips,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/april/new-account-credit-card-fraud-up-24-in-2018-the-top-frauds-of-2018,"Welcome to the 2018 Consumer Fraud Awards Show! We have a great show for you, with criminal activity galore. Tonight's winners are chosen based on information from the Consumer Sentinel Network 2018 Data Book and brought to you by the Consumer Information Group at your Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Okay, there really isn't a consumer fraud awards show – but it has been a banner year for fraud and identity theft reports. After a three-year decline from a peak of 1.526 million fraud reports in 2014 to 1.29 million in 2017, 2018 fraud reports shot up to 1.427 million.
Similarly, identity theft reports peaked in 2015 at just over 490,000, sank for two consecutive years, and rose to over 444,000 in 2018. The number of combined annual fraud and identity theft reports is at a record high. One–quarter of those reporting fraud lost money in the process, resulting in a median loss of $375 and $1.48 billion in total losses.
The three top consumer reports of 2019 were imposter scams (18% of all reports), debt collection issues (16%), and identity theft (15%). There's little challenge to the top three, as no other category reached 6% of total reports.
Imposter scams involve someone pretending to be a trusted person to get you to send money or give out your personal information. These situations include romance scams and fraudsters claiming to be relatives in distress, technical support experts, government representatives, or well-known businesspeople in order to get your money.
Debt collection issues refer to creditors or third-party debt collectors who call repeatedly or continuously, use profanity, fail to send written notices of the debt, falsely represent the status or amount of the debt, falsely threaten legal action, or otherwise violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.
The databook defines identity theft as someone appropriating your personal identification information, such as your Social Security Number or credit card account number, to commit theft or fraud. The most common types of identity theft reported include credit card fraud, bank fraud, phone or utility fraud, employment or tax-related fraud, loan or lease fraud, and government documents or benefits fraud.
While debt collection reports fell by 24% to move to second place, both imposter scams and identity theft are still going strong. Almost 20% of people lost money in imposter scams, with a median loss of $500 and $488 million in total losses. Identity theft losses are shifting in focus, with tax fraud losses dropping by 38% while fraudulent new credit card accounts increased by 24%. Let MoneyTips protect your credit and your identity with a free trial .
FTC data revealed an interesting relationship between fraud reporting and age. Younger people report losing money more often to fraudulent schemes compared to older people. Approximately 43% of Americans 20-29 years old reported fraud losses, compared to only 15% of Americans 70-79 years old.
However, when they did lose money to fraud, older Americans lost more on average. The 20-29 age group reported a median of $400 in losses, while the 70-79 age group reported a median loss of $751 – and those aged eighty and above had a whopping $1,700 median loss to fraud.
Older Americans may have seen scams before and be more skeptical than their younger counterparts – or it could be that older Americans are less likely to report the losses unless the losses are too large to ignore. They may be ashamed to admit they were victims of fraud, thinking that they should have known better.
If you're a victim of fraud and/or identity theft, be sure to report what happened to the FTC and local law enforcement. Don't be embarrassed. As the statistics show, you aren't alone – and your report may help catch fraudsters and prevent further damage.
Whether or not you've been a fraud victim in the past, avoid becoming one in 2019.
Take common-sense steps to protect your personal information, both in electronic and hard copy form. Learn to recognize common e-mail/telephone scams and be skeptical of any unsolicited requests for personal information.
Fight the increase in fraudulent credit card accounts by applying credit freezes to your accounts to keep identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name. Check your credit report regularly. Consider using a credit monitoring service if you're too busy to monitor all of your accounts. You can start monitoring your credit and see your credit report and score for free within minutes by joining MoneyTips .
There probably won't be a 2019 Consumer Fraud Awards Show. If there is one, don't have a reason to take part in it. That's one red carpet you want to avoid.

The Top 200 Healthiest Foods and Why It's More Important Than Ever to Eat Them,www.cbn.com,Lorie Johnson,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/april/the-top-200-healthiest-foods-and-why-its-more-important-than-ever-to-eat-them,"When we think about life's biggest decisions, images of choosing the right spouse, career or home come to mind. What to eat? Not so much.
New research may change that. Scientists now know our body has five natural defense systems that are magnificently effective at warding off our scariest diseases. There is a catch, however. These defense systems only work properly when nourished with healthy foods.
In his new book Eat to Beat Disease Dr. William Li explains how our body's defense systems work and lists 200 foods that keep them humming.
""We don't need to spend all of our time thinking about what to cut out of our diet,"" he told CBN News, ""It's now time to start thinking about what we can add to our lives,"" adding, ""we want to eat lots of foods that can activate our health defenses and because there are so many choices and everybody can find something they like in the 200 foods that I list, you can start eating healthy with the foods you already love.""
Readers will be thrilled to discover delicious sourdough and pumpernickel bread actually feed one of our health defense systems, as do certain cheeses. Many foods, called ""grand slams"" fuel all five defense systems.
Angiogenesis
This health defense system keeps cancers small. Believe it or not, we all have cancer cells within our body, but angiogenesis is a form of protection that starves those cancer cells and prevents them from growing and invading the rest of our body. Angiogenesis regulates our blood vessels. More than 100 foods can enhance angiogenesis such as pomegranate, black raspberries, and tomatoes. Dr. Li takes it a step further by pointing out that when it comes to tomatoes, cooked, San Marzano contains the most cancer-fighting lycopene.
""Almost 36,000 men have been studied,"" he said, ""And it was found that those who ate two to three servings of cooked tomatoes, that's tomato sauce, a week, had a thirty percent decreased risk of developing prostate cancer.""
Vitamin K-2 is key to controlling angiogenesis, you can find this vitamin in Gouda, Jarlesburg, and Edam
""This vitamin K2, which is a healthy side effect of making the cheese itself, is a powerful anti-angiogenic, cancer starving substance,"" said Dr. Li.
Microbiome
It may sound a little gross, but trillions of living bacteria call our intestinal tract home. Not only that, but we rely heavily on these microscopic critters to keep every aspect of our minds and bodies operating smoothly. The kind of bacteria and the amount of them comprise a very complex ecosystem called our microbiome. Dr. Li says a balanced microbiome leads to good physical and mental health.
""The healthy bacteria that live inside our bodies, 39 trillion bacteria live inside us, communicate with our immune system. They help our bodies heal. They even talk to our brain.""
Dr. Li says fermented foods like Kim Chi and yogurt contain healthy bacteria, also known as probiotics. Fiber-rich foods like broccoli, which are called prebiotics, play a role because they feed the good bacteria. Some people are surprised to learn sourdough bread boosts our microbiome.
""It turns out that sourdough is made with Lactobacillus reuteri. It's that bacteria that creates that nice tangy taste,"" he explained, ""That bacteria boosts our immune system, it can actually speed our healing, our ability to heal wounds and it also communicates to our brains to release that social hormone oxytocin that makes us feel good.""
Pumpernickel bread, which is made from rye flour, also fortifies the microbiome. ""Rye flour will decrease the levels of an unhealthy bacteria in our gut that creates a toxin that causes inflammation,"" he said, ""So eating pumpernickel bread can lower that bacteria and lower inflammation.""

D-N-A
We all know D-N-A contains the genetic code we inherited from our parents. However, it's much more than that. It issues commands to our entire body, telling it what to do. Unfortunately, it's a fragile system that is constantly under attack from the environment. Natural enemies such as ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure can weaken D-N-A, as can toxins such as second-hand smoke and gasoline fumes. (Dr. Li recommends standing down-wind of these fumes when filling our cars).
Foods that repair and strengthen our D-N-A include kiwifruit, spinach, and lentils. Get this: over 100 different types of oysters strengthen D-N-A, particularly Pacific oysters. In one study, the oysters reduced D-N-A damage by a whopping 90 percent!
Stem Cells
Only recently have scientists uncovered the protective properties of our own stem cells, which are vital for growing and maintaining our organs. Researchers now tell us these foundational life units can actually regenerate our bodies throughout our lives.
""When we were kids we were taught salamanders and starfish regenerate, but people can't,"" Dr. Li said, ""Science is turning that upside down. We know that we do regenerate from the inside out using our stem cells.""
As if we need another reason to love chocolate, recent studies show the dark bean can be a super fuel for stem cells.
""And I write about in my book about a study with men who have coronary disease,"" Dr. Li explained, ""And when they were given dark cocoa, the chocolate alone was able to double the number of stem cells in their bloodstream, and when they measured their blood flow they were able to double that as well. So it's quite remarkable.""
Immune System
Our immune system is one of the most well-known health defense systems, yet scientists continue to learn more about how it works. It keeps us from getting an infection after we've been exposed to bacteria, fights off viruses and more. In short, a strong immune system provides protection against any pathogen seeking to harm us.
""We now know the immune system is more powerful than we ever thought,"" said Dr. Li, ""In fact, it can protect us against cancer.""
In addition to cancer, dozens of other conditions can be blamed on weak immune systems such as allergies, Celiac Disease, Psoriasis, even Diabetes.
Foods that stimulate the immune system include mushroom, garlic, and particularly extra virgin olive oil.
""There's actually a natural substance in the olive called hydroxytyrosol which is a powerful way to cut off the blood supply feeding cancer,"" said Dr. Li, ""It's also anti-inflammatory.""
Dr. Li says certain olive oils contain more of the healing hydroxytyrosol and polyphenols than others. He recommends buying olive oil made from Koroneiki, Picual or Moraiolo olives.
""So when I go shopping for olive oil,"" Dr. Li said, ""I pick up the bottle, and I turn it around, and I look for the name of the olive. What kind of olive was this oil pressed from?""
So while many of view food as an afterthought, Dr. William Li says putting a little thought into what we eat can pay dividends when it comes to our health.
""While medicines can be used to treat disease, foods can prevent it in the first place,"" he said."
Mueller Frustrated With Barr Over Portrayal of Findings,www1.cbn.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/mueller-frustrated-with-barr-over-portrayal-of-findings,"AG Barr Grilled in Senate as Mueller Letter Emerges Criticizing Barr's Summary of Findings 04-30-2019 Drew Parkhill Attorney General Bill Barr, Special Counsel Bob Mueller, and President Donald Trump (AP Photos)
Attorney General William Barr is on Capitol Hill today for what was expected to be an explosive hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
It's the first time Barr has faced lawmakers' questions since releasing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.
The hearing comes as a Washington Post story reveals Mueller told Barr he was frustrated with how the conclusions of his investigation were being portrayed. The Post story and the Justice Department said Mueller made it clear that he didn't believe Barr's summary of Mueller's report was inaccurate or misleading.
""After the Attorney General received Special Counsel Mueller's letter, he called him to discuss it,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. ""In a cordial and professional conversation, the Special Counsel emphasized that nothing in the Attorney General's March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading. But, he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the Special Counsel's obstruction analysis.""
But Mueller also wrote that the document ""did not fully capture the context, nature and substance"" of his report and that it created confusion about some results of the investigation.
Mueller did ask the attorney general to release introductions and executives summaries included in the report.
The story has increased concerns among Democrats about Barr's handling of the Mueller report."

Natural enemies such as ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure can weaken D-N-A, as can toxins such as second-hand smoke and gasoline fumes. (Dr. Li recommends standing down-wind of these fumes when filling our cars).
Foods that repair and strengthen our D-N-A include kiwifruit, spinach, and lentils. Get this: over 100 different types of oysters strengthen D-N-A, particularly Pacific oysters. In one study, the oysters reduced D-N-A damage by a whopping 90 percent!
Stem Cells
Only recently have scientists uncovered the protective properties of our own stem cells, which are vital for growing and maintaining our organs. Researchers now tell us these foundational life units can actually regenerate our bodies throughout our lives.
""When we were kids we were taught salamanders and starfish regenerate, but people can't,"" Dr. Li said, ""Science is turning that upside down. We know that we do regenerate from the inside out using our stem cells.""
As if we need another reason to love chocolate, recent studies show the dark bean can be a super fuel for stem cells.
""And I write about in my book about a study with men who have coronary disease,"" Dr. Li explained, ""And when they were given dark cocoa, the chocolate alone was able to double the number of stem cells in their bloodstream, and when they measured their blood flow they were able to double that as well. So it's quite remarkable.""
Immune System
Our immune system is one of the most well-known health defense systems, yet scientists continue to learn more about how it works. It keeps us from getting an infection after we've been exposed to bacteria, fights off viruses and more. In short, a strong immune system provides protection against any pathogen seeking to harm us.
""We now know the immune system is more powerful than we ever thought,"" said Dr. Li, ""In fact, it can protect us against cancer.""
In addition to cancer, dozens of other conditions can be blamed on weak immune systems such as allergies, Celiac Disease, Psoriasis, even Diabetes.
Foods that stimulate the immune system include mushroom, garlic, and particularly extra virgin olive oil.
""There's actually a natural substance in the olive called hydroxytyrosol which is a powerful way to cut off the blood supply feeding cancer,"" said Dr. Li, ""It's also anti-inflammatory.""
Dr. Li says certain olive oils contain more of the healing hydroxytyrosol and polyphenols than others. He recommends buying olive oil made from Koroneiki, Picual or Moraiolo olives.
""So when I go shopping for olive oil,"" Dr. Li said, ""I pick up the bottle, and I turn it around, and I look for the name of the olive. What kind of olive was this oil pressed from?""
So while many of view food as an afterthought, Dr. William Li says putting a little thought into what we eat can pay dividends when it comes to our health.
""While medicines can be used to treat disease, foods can prevent it in the first place,"" he said.

Mueller Frustrated With Barr Over Portrayal of Findings,www.cbn.com,Associated Press,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/mueller-frustrated-with-barr-over-portrayal-of-findings,"Attorney General William Barr is on Capitol Hill today for what was expected to be an explosive hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
It's the first time Barr has faced lawmakers' questions since releasing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report.
The hearing comes as a Washington Post story reveals Mueller told Barr he was frustrated with how the conclusions of his investigation were being portrayed. The Post story and the Justice Department said Mueller made it clear that he didn't believe Barr's summary of Mueller's report was inaccurate or misleading.
""After the Attorney General received Special Counsel Mueller's letter, he called him to discuss it,"" Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said. ""In a cordial and professional conversation, the Special Counsel emphasized that nothing in the Attorney General's March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading. But, he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the Special Counsel's obstruction analysis.""
But Mueller also wrote that the document ""did not fully capture the context, nature and substance"" of his report and that it created confusion about some results of the investigation.
Mueller did ask the attorney general to release introductions and executives summaries included in the report.
The story has increased concerns among Democrats about Barr's handling of the Mueller report."
'This is the Deed to Our Land': Israel's Ambassador Takes Out Bible at UN to Prove Jewish People's Claim to Israel,www1.cbn.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/this-is-the-deed-to-our-land-israels-ambassador-takes-out-bible-at-un-to-prove-jewish-peoples-claim-to-israel,"Israel's UN ambassador Danny Danon used the Bible to defend the Jewish people's claim to the land of Israel during a special session at the United Nations Security Council on Monday.
Danon was tasked with the job of proving the case for Jews' connection to the Holy Land during the session. He outlined four reasons, ""the Bible, history, international law, and the pursuit of international peace and security.""
In a dramatic moment, Danon opened the Bible and read aloud God's covenant with Abraham from Genesis 17: ""And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your descendants after you throughout the generations for an everlasting covenant. And I will give to you and your descendants after you all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God.""
Danon then raised up the Bible, turned to attendees and said, ""This is the deed to our land.""
""From the book of Genesis to the Jews' exodus, from Egypt to receiving the Torah on Mt. Sinai, and to the realization of God's covenant in the holy land of Israel, the Bible paints a consistent picture. The entire history of our people and our connection to Eretz Israel begins right here,"" he continued while lifting up the Bible once again.
Danon argued that all of the Abrahamic religions – Judaism, Christianity, and Islam – affirm the Jewish people's connection to Israel.
""The Qur'an itself accepts the divine deed of the Jewish people to the land of Israel,"" he said.
'The #Koran itself accepts the divine deed of the #Jewish people to the land of #Israel ,' says Israeli Ambassador @dannydanon in his address to the UN Security Council: pic.twitter.com/a5hbT5rWk0
— i24NEWS English (@i24NEWS_EN) April 29, 2019
Danon then told the group how the Jews were expelled from Israel.
""In 70 CE, Roman Emperor Titus destroyed our Second Temple, expelled the Jewish people, and renamed the land nestled between Egypt and Lebanon 'Syria-Palestina, as a southern province of Syria. THAT is where the name Palestine comes from, though Jews still lived in Jerusalem,"" he argued.
2/4 In 70 CE, Roman Emperor Titus destroyed our Second Temple, expelled the Jewish people, and renamed the land nestled between Egypt and Lebanon ""Syria-Palestina,"" as a southern province of Syria. THAT is where the name Palestine comes from, though Jews still lived in Jerusalem.
— Ambassador Danny Danon | דני דנון (@dannydanon) April 29, 2019
He also placed blame for the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the feet of Palestinian leaders.
3/4 To blame Jewish communities in Judea/Samaria for lack of peace misreads history. The Arabs have rejected:
1937 Peel Commission Report
1947 UN Partition Plan
1948 Israel truce
2000 Camp David Summit
2001 Taba Summit
2007 Annapolis Conference #UNSC
— Ambassador Danny Danon | דני דנון (@dannydanon) April 29, 2019
Danon said in order for peace to be possible, four things must happen, starting with the Palestinians recognizing Israel's right to exist.
4/4 Real peace will be possible when these four pillars are realized.
1. The Palestinians must accept and recognize the JEWISH State of Israel
2. The Palestinians must end their campaign of incitement
3. Regional cooperation
4. Israel will never compromise our security #UNSC

"Anti-Semitic Attacks Spike, Killing Most Jews in Decades | CBN News",www1.cbn.com,Associated Press,05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/anti-semitic-attacks-spike-killing-most-jews-in-decades,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) - Israeli researchers reported Wednesday that violent attacks against Jews spiked significantly last year, with the largest reported number of Jews killed in anti-Semitic acts in decades, leading to an ""increasing sense of emergency"" among Jewish communities worldwide.
Capped by the deadly shooting that killed 11 worshippers at Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue on Oct. 27, assaults targeting Jews rose 13% in 2018, according to Tel Aviv University researchers. They recorded nearly 400 cases worldwide, with more than a quarter of the major violent cases taking place in the United States.
But the spike was most dramatic in western Europe, where Jews have faced even greater danger and threats. In Germany, for instance, there was a 70% increase in anti-Semitic violence.
""There is an increasing sense of emergency among Jews in many countries around the world,"" said Moshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, an umbrella group representing Jewish communities across the continent.
""It is now clear that anti-Semitism is no longer limited to the far-left, far-right and radical Islamist's triangle - it has become mainstream and often accepted by civil society,"" he said.
Tel Aviv University's Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry releases its report every year on the eve of Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day, which begins Wednesday at sundown. This year, the report comes just days after another fatal shooting attack Saturday against a synagogue in southern California. The attack on the Chabad of Poway synagogue on the last day of Passover killed one woman and wounded three other people, including the rabbi.
In addition to the shooting attacks, assaults and vandalism, Kantor also noted the increased anti-Semitic vitriol online and in newspapers, including a recent anti-Semitic cartoon that appeared in The New York Times' international edition. It depicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a dog wearing a Star of David collar and leading a blind and skullcap-wearing President Donald Trump.
The Times has since apologized, calling the image ""offensive,"" and vowing to refrain from publishing such bigoted cartoons again. Still, it sparked outrage among dozens of American Jewish groups that subsequently sent a letter calling on the newspaper to ""become far more sensitive to anti-Semitism in the future.""
""Anti-Semitism has recently progressed to the point of calling into question the very continuation of Jewish life in many parts of the world. As we saw with the second mass shooting of a synagogue in the U.S., many parts of the world that were previously thought of as safe no longer are,"" Kantor added.
""Anti-Semitism has entered gradually into the public discourse,"" he said. ""Threats, harassments and insults have become more violent, inciting to even more physical violence against Jews. It feels like almost every taboo relating to Jews, Judaism and Jewish life has been broken.""
The ascendancy of British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has also contributed to a growing sense of fear among Britain's Jewish community. Critics say Corbyn, a longtime critic of Israel, has long allowed anti-Jewish prejudice to go unchecked. Corbyn's supporters have been accused of sharing Holocaust denial and international Jewish banking conspiracies on social media. Several members of the party have quit it in protest.
Similarly, the inclusion of anti-Semitic activists in the Yellow Vests protests in France have raised greater concerns in a country in which anti-Semitic acts already account for half of all its documented hate crimes.
Kantor added that there has been an improvement in cooperation between Jewish communities and law enforcement agencies in Europe, and several European governments have taken strong steps as well, including fully adopting the working definition of anti-Semitism as outlined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.
The report says there has been a growing awareness of the threat among government agencies responsible for the well-being and security of their Jewish citizens.
Israel has also taken steps, hosting a global forum to combat anti-Semitism, and the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial has reported wide participation in its online course on the origins of anti-Semitism. Netanyahu said following the attack in southern California he would be convening a special meeting over the rising anti-Semitic attacks worldwide.

Democratic leaders met with President Trump at the White House Tuesday to discuss rebuilding America's infrastructure, saying they share the same goal.
That includes building new roads, increasing broadband, and improving the power grid. They say the president agreed to invest $2-trillion into a new plan.
No one has explained how the massive spending plan would be paid for. But some top business groups and labor unions like the idea of increasing the federal gasoline tax, which is 18.3 cents a gallon right now.
Both House Speaker Nancy Selosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) say Tuesday's meeting with President Trump was productive.
Sen. Schumer said, ""It was a very constructive meeting. It's clear that both the White House and all of us want to get something done on infrastructure in a big and bold way. And there was goodwill in this meeting, and that was different than some of the other meetings that we've had, which is a very good thing.""
The president reportedly said he's ready to do a deal, even if it's not the 'typically Republican' thing to do.
""I think a deal can be had if everybody is willing to put their battle axes away for a period,"" said former Rep. Bill Shuster (R-PA) who once served as chairman of the House's transportation committee.
It was a rare moment of agreement and bipartisanship, but it's unclear how long it will last with congressional Democrats ramping up their new investigations into Trump's finances and the Mueller report.
White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said it's not likely the administration will work with a Congress that's investigating the president.
""To have an impeachment hearing on Monday, say, and then to think you're going to talk infrastructure on Tuesday, that's not how the world works, let alone Washington, DC,"" Mulvaney said."

The violence took place Sunday in the village of Silgadji, not far from the volatile border with Mali.
Urbain Kabore, the communications director for the Sahel region of Burkina Faso, said Monday that the six people were slain after Sunday services.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility though violent Islamic extremism has been increasingly destabilizing the country. A number of jihadist groups are known to operate the area.
Authorities said that in a separate incident in the east of Burkina Faso, five teachers were shot to death Friday.
The Islamic extremists also have targeted foreigners, abducting and killing a Canadian geologist earlier this year.

Pompeo Says 'Military Action Is Possible' to Intervene in Venezuela Crisis,www.cbn.com,George Thomas *,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/may/pompeo-says-military-action-is-possible-to-intervene-in-venezuela-crisis,"Venezuela's dictator Nicolas Maduro appears to still be in control of the South American nation following a day of violent skirmishes between his supporters and opposition forces.
Still, the country's leading politician trying to unseat him from power is urging his countrymen to keep up the pressure.
In a video posted on social media, opposition leader Juan Guaidó urged Venezuelans to take to the streets again today and called on the country's powerful military to join the people seeking change.
Guaidó claims the military, seen as a linchpin to whether the embattled Maduro remains in power, is deserting his government.
""We now know for sure that the claim that the regime has control of the Armed Forces, is false,"" Guaidó said in the video. ""We know that Maduro does not have the support nor the respect of the Armed Forces, much less that of the people of Venezuela.""
Some Venezuelan troops have defected to support Juan Guaido against dictator Nicolas Maduro.
Overnight, the head of Venezuela's secret police broke ranks with Maduro, saying the time had come to ""rebuild the country"" and ""seek new ways of doing politics.""
White House National Security Advisor John Bolton says Venezuela's minister of Defense, Supreme Court chief justice and commander of the Presidential Guard have pledged to support Guaidó whom the US views as the rightful leader of Venezuela.
Bolton is urging them to make good on their promises.
On Tuesday, violent confrontations erupted in pockets of Venezuela's capital city Caracas between Guaidó's military supporters and Maduro regime loyalists.
The White House is endorsing Guaidó's latest bid to oust Maduro, and warning Cuba to stay out of the South American nation - threatening to impose new sanctions on the communist country for its role in the crisis.
The US says about 20,000 Cuban troops and agents are working to prop up the Venezuelan dictator.
""Obviously we are seeing the Venezuelan people strive to get a government that they control, not have a government controlled by an authoritarian military regime that in turn is controlled by Cubans and other forces external to Venezuela,"" said Bolton.
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is claiming that Maduro was about to relinquish power, and even had a plane on the tarmac ready to leave the country for Cuba, but was urged by Russia to stay.
""We literally had Nicolas Maduro getting prepared to get on his airplane and head out of the country before he was stopped. Stopped really at the direction of the Russians,"" Pompeo said during an gala and award ceremony in Washington, DC Tuesday evening.
Russia's meddling is a clear sign to the administration that it's pushing against America's Monroe Doctrine, which limits the influence of foreign governments in our hemisphere.
While past American presidents may have neglected the doctrine, Trump's stance indicates the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well.
In an interview with Fox Business Network, Pompeo said the US is prepared to take military action in Venezuela if necessary.
""Military action is possible,"" Pompeo warned . ""If that's what's required, that's what the United States will do."" He added the administration would prefer a peaceful transition of power in the country.
All this is happening as Guaidó released a short video early Tuesday showing him standing alongside members of the military claiming he had the support of the country's soldiers and urging Venezuelans to take on Maduro.
That led to several fierce skirmishes between opposition and government supporters, including a moment when an armored military vehicle was seen running over civilians.

— Alejandro Alvarez (@aletweetsnews) April 30, 2019
But by nightfall, the socialist dictator appeared still in control of the country and pushed back against Pompeo's claims that he was preparing to leave.
With his minister of Defense and other military officials by his side, a defiant Maduro said all attempts to remove him from office had failed and vowed to punish those trying to overthrow his government.
""There are videos of all kinds. We know who they are, we have to look for them,"" Maduro warned"

Palestinian Christians Assaulted by Muslim Gunmen,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/palestinian-christians-assaulted-by-muslim-gunmen,"Arab Palestinian Christians are urging the Palestinian Authority to protect them after they were assaulted by Muslim gunmen.
The Jerusalem Post reports that the attack happened in a Christian village called Jifna, near Ramallah. Violence erupted following a disagreement between a Christian woman and the son of a prominent leader affiliated with Fatah.
Before the attack, the woman filed a police report claiming that the son of the leader had attacked her family.
The PA police questioned the suspect, after which his father and dozens of gunmen raided the village and began harassing Christians there. Residents told the Jerusalem Post that the gunmen demanded the Christians pay the Jizyah tax, a tax forced on non-Muslims living in Islamic territories.
""The village witnessed scenes of anarchy and lawlessness,"" residents of Jifna said in a statement. ""Women and children were terrorized by the shooting, and houses were targeted with Molotov cocktails and rocks. The attackers were part of an unruly mob lacking any sense of patriotism. They were led by an influential personality from the Ramallah district.""
The residents called the police, but they didn't arrive until three hours after the attack began.
PA Governor of Ramallah, Dr. Leila Ghanem, condemned the attack and said those who ""try to destabilize the security and social peace"" will be punished.
Wadie Abunassar, a prominent Christian Palestinian leader spoke out about the attacks on Facebook.
""We hope that everyone will learn that Christians are an inalienable part of the Palestinian people, that they should not be vulnerable in any way,"" Abunassar said. ""No influential individuals, regardless of their religious or political identity, should be allowed to violate the law and exploit their power for their personal interests.""
Christian persecution watchdog Open Doors ranks the Palestinian territories as 58 out of the top 100 worst countries to be a Christian.
""Those who convert to Christianity from Islam, however, face the worst Christian persecution and it is difficult for them to safely participate in existing churches. In the West Bank they are threatened and put under great pressure, in Gaza their situation is so dangerous that they live their Christian faith in utmost secrecy. Nevertheless, the number of converts from Islam is growing slowly,"" the group says on its website."

'This is the Deed to Our Land': Israel's Ambassador Takes Out Bible at UN to Prove Jewish People's Claim to Israel,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/this-is-the-deed-to-our-land-israels-ambassador-takes-out-bible-at-un-to-prove-jewish-peoples-claim-to-israel,"Israel's UN ambassador Danny Danon used the Bible to defend the Jewish people's claim to the land of Israel during a special session at the United Nations Security Council on Monday.
Danon was tasked with the job of proving the case for Jews' connection to the Holy Land during the session. He outlined four reasons, ""the Bible, history, international law, and the pursuit of international peace and security.""
In a dramatic moment, Danon opened the Bible and read aloud God's covenant with Abraham from Genesis 17: ""And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your descendants after you throughout the generations for an everlasting covenant. And I will give to you and your descendants after you all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God.""
Danon then raised up the Bible, turned to attendees and said, ""This is the deed to our land.""
""From the book of Genesis to the Jews' exodus, from Egypt to receiving the Torah on Mt. Sinai, and to the realization of God's covenant in the holy land of Israel, the Bible paints a consistent picture. The entire history of our people and our connection to Eretz Israel begins right here,"" he continued while lifting up the Bible once again.
Danon argued that all of the Abrahamic religions – Judaism, Christianity, and Islam – affirm the Jewish people's connection to Israel.
""The Qur'an itself accepts the divine deed of the Jewish people to the land of Israel,"" he said.

Danon then told the group how the Jews were expelled from Israel.
""In 70 CE, Roman Emperor Titus destroyed our Second Temple, expelled the Jewish people, and renamed the land nestled between Egypt and Lebanon 'Syria-Palestina, as a southern province of Syria. THAT is where the name Palestine comes from, though Jews still lived in Jerusalem,"" he argued.

He also placed blame for the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the feet of Palestinian leaders.

Danon said in order for peace to be possible, four things must happen, starting with the Palestinians recognizing Israel's right to exist.
4/4 Real peace will be possible when these four pillars are realized.
1. The Palestinians must accept and recognize the JEWISH State of Israel
2. The Palestinians must end their campaign of incitement
3. Regional cooperation

A team of activists is hoping to change that this year by bringing glimpses of the Holocaust to the younger generation through a social media project called Eva. Stories.
Eva.Stories explores what it would be like for a Jewish teen to have an Instagram account in the 1940s when the Nazis committed one of the worst genocides against the Jewish people the world has ever seen.
""If we want to bring the memory of the Holocaust to the young generation, we have to bring it to where they are,"" the project's co-producer, Mati Kochavitold told the New York Times. ""And they're on Instagram.""
Kochavitold, who comes from a family of Holocaust survivors, teamed up with his daughter to create a series of 70 Instagram stories that detail the ultimate demise of a young Jewish girl named Eva Heyman living in Hungary in 1944.
The stories were released on Wednesday, just hours before Israelis stop to mourn the victims of the Holocaust during Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Memorial Day). The will end on Thursday after Israel observes a two-minute nationwide moment of silence in commemoration of the Holocaust.

The project is based on the life of a real Hungarian girl named Eva Heyman. She was one of 430,000 Hungarian Jews who were sent to the Nazi concentration camps. The Kochavis poured over her diaries to adapt the events leading up to her death to Instagram.
""This is the way to make the Holocaust accessible to the young crowd,"" said Kochavi. ""Only 2.7 percent of the total discussion about the Holocaust around the world today, is initiated by the younger generation, which is a significant decline in comparison to previous years.""
""In an age when Holocaust survivors are scarce, people's attention span is dropping and thrills are quick to achieve — there is a need to find new models of memory and testimony,"" he added.

Pompeo Says 'Military Action Is Possible' to Intervene in Venezuela Crisis,www1.cbn.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/may/pompeo-says-military-action-is-possible-to-intervene-in-venezuela-crisis,"Pompeo Says 'Military Action Is Possible' to Intervene in Venezuela Crisis 05-01-2019 6031851934001 NewsBlock_9AM_050119_HD1080_104.233_292 Some Venezuelan troops have defected to support Juan Guaido against dictator Nicolas Maduro (Photo: screen capture) 6031851934001 Pompeo Says 'Military Action Is Possible' to Intervene in Venezuela Crisis
Venezuela's dictator Nicolas Maduro appears to still be in control of the South American nation following a day of violent skirmishes between his supporters and opposition forces.
Still, the country's leading politician trying to unseat him from power is urging his countrymen to keep up the pressure.
In a video posted on social media, opposition leader Juan Guaidó urged Venezuelans to take to the streets again today and called on the country's powerful military to join the people seeking change.
Guaidó claims the military, seen as a linchpin to whether the embattled Maduro remains in power, is deserting his government. ""We now know for sure that the claim that the regime has control of the Armed Forces, is false,"" Guaidó said in the video. ""We know that Maduro does not have the support nor the respect of the Armed Forces, much less that of the people of Venezuela.""
Some Venezuelan troops have defected to support Juan Guaido against dictator Nicolas Maduro.
Overnight, the head of Venezuela's secret police broke ranks with Maduro, saying the time had come to ""rebuild the country"" and ""seek new ways of doing politics.""
White House National Security Advisor John Bolton says Venezuela's minister of Defense, Supreme Court chief justice and commander of the Presidential Guard have pledged to support Guaidó whom the US views as the rightful leader of Venezuela.
Bolton is urging them to make good on their promises.
On Tuesday, violent confrontations erupted in pockets of Venezuela's capital city Caracas between Guaidó's military supporters and Maduro regime loyalists.
The White House is endorsing Guaidó's latest bid to oust Maduro, and warning Cuba to stay out of the South American nation - threatening to impose new sanctions on the communist country for its role in the crisis.
The US says about 20,000 Cuban troops and agents are working to prop up the Venezuelan dictator.
""Obviously we are seeing the Venezuelan people strive to get a government that they control, not have a government controlled by an authoritarian military regime that in turn is controlled by Cubans and other forces external to Venezuela,"" said Bolton.
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is claiming that Maduro was about to relinquish power, and even had a plane on the tarmac ready to leave the country for Cuba, but was urged by Russia to stay.
""We literally had Nicolas Maduro getting prepared to get on his airplane and head out of the country before he was stopped. Stopped really at the direction of the Russians,"" Pompeo said during an gala and award ceremony in Washington, DC Tuesday evening.
Russia's meddling is a clear sign to the administration that it's pushing against America's Monroe Doctrine, which limits the influence of foreign governments in our hemisphere.
While past American presidents may have neglected the doctrine, Trump's stance indicates the Monroe Doctrine is alive and well.
In an interview with Fox Business Network, Pompeo said the US is prepared to take military action in Venezuela if necessary.
""Military action is possible,"" Pompeo warned . ""If that's what's required, that's what the United States will do."" He added the administration would prefer a peaceful transition of power in the country.
All this is happening as Guaidó released a short video early Tuesday showing him standing alongside members of the military claiming he had the support of the country's soldiers and urging Venezuelans to take on Maduro.
That led to several fierce skirmishes between opposition and government supporters, including a moment when an armored military vehicle was seen running over civilians. !!!

But by nightfall, the socialist dictator appeared still in control of the country and pushed back against Pompeo's claims that he was preparing to leave.
With his minister of Defense and other military officials by his side, a defiant Maduro said all attempts to remove him from office had failed and vowed to punish those trying to overthrow his government.
""There are videos of all kinds. We know who they are, we have to look for them,"" Maduro warned"

OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso — A Burkina Faso government spokesman says six people, including a pastor, have been killed in an attack on a Christian church in the country's north.
The violence took place Sunday in the village of Silgadji, not far from the volatile border with Mali.
Urbain Kabore, the communications director for the Sahel region of Burkina Faso, said Monday that the six people were slain after Sunday services.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility though violent Islamic extremism has been increasingly destabilizing the country. A number of jihadist groups are known to operate the area.
Authorities said that in a separate incident in the east of Burkina Faso, five teachers were shot to death Friday.
The Islamic extremists also have targeted foreigners, abducting and killing a Canadian geologist earlier this year.

Taylor Swift’s ‘ME!’ Is Bad, And a Symptom of Our Self-Obsessed Culture
As Faithwire previously reported , the dad, “Clark,” was convicted on charges of “family violence” after insisting on calling his teenage daughter by her birth name — “Maxine.”
Now, according to The Federalist , the Supreme Court of British Columbia has issued a sweeping “protection order” in the case, threatening the dad with immediate arrest “without a warrant” should the police conclude there’s “reasonable” ground to suggest he had privately or publicly referred to his daughter as a female.
In addition, the court issued a gag order, preventing the dad from discussing his case in the media — he is even prohibited from sharing court documents describing his own gag order. This is strange, not least because all the records are publicly available .
All in all the court has come down very heavily on the father, who is simply concerned for the welfare of his own child and wants her to carefully consider such a life-defining decision. What is the background?
At the end of February, the Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled that the 14-year-old girl, “Maxine,” was eligible to receive her desired male hormone injections — this was decided without her parents’ consent, after Maxine decided, on her own accord, to become a boy.
Clark insisted that in the months prior to this decision, Maxine had exhibited signs of emotional instability and depression and had been acting out sexually, even making a brief foray into lesbianism.
Her father claimed that her mental health had been volatile since he and his wife underwent a divorce — he also claimed that Maxine’s decision to become a boy was the result of this emotional strife and demanded that he be involved in her healthcare moving forward.
However, despite his repeated pleas, the hospital administering her treatment, as well as the teenager’s school, refused to let the dad get involved.
Clark’s appeal against the ruling over the testosterone injections is set to be heard May 14."
Global Persecution Report: 'Christians Are the Most Persecuted ...and It's Accelerating' | CBN News,www1.cbn.com,Jennifer Wishon *,04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/april/global-persecution-report-christians-are-the-most-persecuted-and-its-accelerating,"Global Persecution Report: 'Christians Are the Most Persecuted ...and It's Accelerating'
WASHINGTON – Religious persecution plagues countries around the world and the problem is only getting worse. Now, an annual report by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom ( USCIRF ) gives us a clear picture of the world's top offenders.
Burma, Central African Republic, China, Eritrea, Iran, Nigeria, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Vietnam are where people of faith face the most aggressive and violent forms of persecution.
Gary Bauer, one of the nine commissioners on USCIRF, is particularly concerned about China's inclusion on the list because of the influence it wields.
""So here's a rising power. It's economy is growing bigger and bigger each year, its military is expanding. It's got worldwide ambitions and every place it reaches it's bringing these values of persecution along with them,"" he tells CBN News.
So called ""tier two"" countries of concern include Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Cuba, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Laos, Malaysia, and America's NATO ally Turkey.
Turkey, of course, made international headlines for holding American Pastor Andrew Brunson hostage for nearly two years before releasing him last fall.
""One of the things the commission is really focused on is not only when there are governments perpetrating violence but when governments are tolerating the perpetration of violence,"" USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava told CBN News after release of the report.
This report is unique in that the nine commissioners on USCIRF aren't burdened by diplomacy. Unlike many State Department accounts, these observers are free to tell it like they see it.
""We believe as a commission that no person of whatever faith they are should have to fear within their house of worship,"" says Commissioner Tony Perkins.
For the world's Christians, the situation is especially dire.
""Christians are the most persecuted religious group in the world and it's accelerating,"" says Bauer.
In its report, the commission calls on President Trump to appoint a special adviser on international religious freedom, target top offenders with sanctions, and put money toward the State Department's effort to help houses of worship protect themselves. ""Churches, which are soft targets, have become targets for terrorists and so we believe this would be a very effective role for our government to come alongside these governments to provide the training that would be a combination of police officers, the law enforcement agencies, the domestic security, along with the houses of worship to provide the security,"" says Perkins, who has also served on the security team at his own church.
For so many people around the world, finding religious tolerance is increasingly a matter of life and death."
The Top 200 Healthiest Foods and Why It's More Important Than Ever to Eat Them,www1.cbn.com,,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/may/the-top-200-healthiest-foods-and-why-its-more-important-than-ever-to-eat-them,"The Top 200 Healthiest Foods and Why It's More Important Than Ever to Eat Them
When we think about life's biggest decisions, images of choosing the right spouse, career or home come to mind. What to eat? Not so much.
New research may change that. Scientists now know our body has five natural defense systems that are magnificently effective at warding off our scariest diseases. There is a catch, however. These defense systems only work properly when nourished with healthy foods.
In his new book Eat to Beat Disease Dr. William Li explains how our body's defense systems work and lists 200 foods that keep them humming.
""We don't need to spend all of our time thinking about what to cut out of our diet,"" he told CBN News, ""It's now time to start thinking about what we can add to our lives,"" adding, ""we want to eat lots of foods that can activate our health defenses and because there are so many choices and everybody can find something they like in the 200 foods that I list, you can start eating healthy with the foods you already love.""
Readers will be thrilled to discover delicious sourdough and pumpernickel bread actually feed one of our health defense systems, as do certain cheeses. Many foods, called ""grand slams"" fuel all five defense systems.
Angiogenesis
This health defense system keeps cancers small. Believe it or not, we all have cancer cells within our body, but angiogenesis is a form of protection that starves those cancer cells and prevents them from growing and invading the rest of our body. Angiogenesis regulates our blood vessels. More than 100 foods can enhance angiogenesis such as pomegranate, black raspberries, and tomatoes. Dr. Li takes it a step further by pointing out that when it comes to tomatoes, cooked, San Marzano contains the most cancer-fighting lycopene.
""Almost 36,000 men have been studied,"" he said, ""And it was found that those who ate two to three servings of cooked tomatoes, that's tomato sauce, a week, had a thirty percent decreased risk of developing prostate cancer.""
Vitamin K-2 is key to controlling angiogenesis, you can find this vitamin in Gouda, Jarlesburg, and Edam
""This vitamin K2, which is a healthy side effect of making the cheese itself, is a powerful anti-angiogenic, cancer starving substance,"" said Dr. Li.
Microbiome
It may sound a little gross, but trillions of living bacteria call our intestinal tract home. Not only that, but we rely heavily on these microscopic critters to keep every aspect of our minds and bodies operating smoothly. The kind of bacteria and the amount of them comprise a very complex ecosystem called our microbiome. Dr. Li says a balanced microbiome leads to good physical and mental health.
""The healthy bacteria that live inside our bodies, 39 trillion bacteria live inside us, communicate with our immune system. They help our bodies heal. They even talk to our brain.""
Dr. Li says fermented foods like Kim Chi and yogurt contain healthy bacteria, also known as probiotics. Fiber-rich foods like broccoli, which are called prebiotics, play a role because they feed the good bacteria. Some people are surprised to learn sourdough bread boosts our microbiome.
""It turns out that sourdough is made with Lactobacillus reuteri. It's that bacteria that creates that nice tangy taste,"" he explained, ""That bacteria boosts our immune system, it can actually speed our healing, our ability to heal wounds and it also communicates to our brains to release that social hormone oxytocin that makes us feel good.""
Pumpernickel bread, which is made from rye flour, also fortifies the microbiome. ""Rye flour will decrease the levels of an unhealthy bacteria in our gut that creates a toxin that causes inflammation,"" he said, ""So eating pumpernickel bread can lower that bacteria and lower inflammation.""

DNA Repair
We all know DNA contains the genetic code we inherited from our parents. However, it's much more than that. It issues commands to our entire body, telling it what to do. Unfortunately, it's a fragile system that is constantly under attack from the environment. Natural enemies such as ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure can weaken DNA, as can toxins such as second-hand smoke and gasoline fumes. (Dr. Li recommends standing down-wind of these fumes when filling our cars).
Foods that repair and strengthen our DNA include kiwifruit, spinach, and lentils. Get this: over 100 different types of oysters strengthen DNA, particularly Pacific oysters. In one study, the oysters reduced DNA damage by a whopping 90 percent!
Stem Cells
Only recently have scientists uncovered the protective properties of our own stem cells, which are vital for growing and maintaining our organs. Researchers now tell us these foundational life units can actually regenerate our bodies throughout our lives.
""When we were kids we were taught salamanders and starfish regenerate, but people can't,"" Dr. Li said, ""Science is turning that upside down. We know that we do regenerate from the inside out using our stem cells.""
As if we need another reason to love chocolate, recent studies show the dark bean can be a super fuel for stem cells.
""And I write about in my book about a study with men who have coronary disease,"" Dr. Li explained, ""And when they were given dark cocoa, the chocolate alone was able to double the number of stem cells in their bloodstream, and when they measured their blood flow they were able to double that as well. So it's quite remarkable.""
Immune System
Our immune system is one of the most well-known health defense systems, yet scientists continue to learn more about how it works. It keeps us from getting an infection after we've been exposed to bacteria, fights off viruses and more. In short, a strong immune system provides protection against any pathogen seeking to harm us.
""We now know the immune system is more powerful than we ever thought,"" said Dr. Li, ""In fact, it can protect us against cancer.""
In addition to cancer, dozens of other conditions can be blamed on weak immune systems such as allergies, Celiac Disease, Psoriasis, even Diabetes.
Foods that stimulate the immune system include mushroom, garlic, and particularly extra virgin olive oil.
""There's actually a natural substance in the olive called hydroxytyrosol which is a powerful way to cut off the blood supply feeding cancer,"" said Dr. Li, ""It's also anti-inflammatory.""
Dr. Li says certain olive oils contain more of the healing hydroxytyrosol and polyphenols than others. He recommends buying olive oil made from Koroneiki, Picual or Moraiolo olives.
""So when I go shopping for olive oil,"" Dr. Li said, ""I pick up the bottle, and I turn it around, and I look for the name of the olive. What kind of olive was this oil pressed from?""
So while many of view food as an afterthought, Dr. William Li says putting a little thought into what we eat can pay dividends when it comes to our health.
""While medicines can be used to treat disease, foods can prevent it in the first place,"" he said."
"'Downright Sickening': CA Preps Graphic Sex Ed with Bondage, 'Blood Play', and K-3 Gender Queer",www1.cbn.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/downright-sickening-ca-preps-graphic-sex-ed-with-bondage-blood-play-and-k-3-gender-queer,"'Downright Sickening': CA Preps Graphic Sex Ed with Bondage, 'Blood Play', and K-3 Gender Queer 05-01-2019 Heather Sells
The state of California is poised to adopt a no-holds-barred K-12 health curriculum that teaches children as young as kindergarten about gender identity issues and talks explicitly with high school students about every imaginable sex act.
The State Board of Education has been taking public comment on the curriculum for months and despite protests from various parent and conservative groups, it appears it will adopt it this month.
Greg Burt, a spokesman for the California Family Council , says protestors are running out of time.
""We expect them to simply rubber stamp it,"" he told CBN News on Wednesday, ""but we are going to make it as painful as possible. If this is what they intend to expose kids to, if this is where they're going then the whole state needs to know about it.""
A new 18,000-member parent group, Informed Parents of California (IPOC), will join the council to protest the curriculum during a May 8th rally at the capitol.
IPOC co-founder Stephanie Yates calls the curriculum ""downright sickening. It's dangerous. It's reckless and it will destroy our children's physical, emotional and mental health,"" she said.
The curriculum draws on guidance from the California Healthy Youth Act, which took effect in 2016. It requires ""comprehensive"" sex ed for students in middle and high school but also allows them to opt-out, if their parent or guardian makes a request in writing.
However, students may not opt out of instruction related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or discrimination.
State senator Mike Morrell (R-Rancho Cucamonga) is seeking to remedy that with a new bill that will allow K-6 parents the ability to opt-in to the sex ed curriculum for their children, rather than having to opt-out. The bill would also require school districts to post elementary-age sex ed curriculum on their websites.
""Many parents have expressed concern that much of the material is unsuitable for young students and in some cases, even indecent,"" said Morrell.
IPOC parents say some of the biggest concerns include: a book for kindergarten through third grade which teaches kids that they can be a boy, girl, neither, gender queer or gender fluid and that adults might not understand their gender identity.
A book for fourth, fifth and sixth-grade boys discusses slang words for genitals and explains masturbation and sexual fantasies.
A book for high school students introduces sex acts for all sexual orientations and introduces the concepts of bondage, body fluid, blood play, fisting and other sexual behaviors once considered to be acts of debauchery.
Burt acknowledged that local school districts have the final say on what they teach but said the state's curriculum is still a huge influence. ""What we find is school districts will use this framework as a guide to decide what curriculum and books to pick,"" he said."

The ministry has been planning the "" Alive from New York "" event for Saturday, May 4, to show 4-D images of unborn babies in the womb.
The move was launched in response to New York state's radical new abortion law that allows abortion of viable babies right up until the moment of birth.
Focus on the Family President Jim Daly wrote in his online blog : ""It's a confirmation of what we've long known. There are many people who don't want the world to see these images of pre-born life because the abortion industry is predicated on a lie -- namely that a baby is just a blob of tissue inside the womb.

Burly Man Coffee Co. Destroys Leftist Label of 'Toxic Masculinity': 100 Cars for Single Moms,www1.cbn.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/burly-man-coffee-co-destroys-leftist-label-of-toxic-masculinity-100-cars-for-single-moms,"Burly Man Coffee Co.

(Image credit: Burly Man Coffee Company)
A South Florida coffee company says it's fighting back against the message of ""toxic masculinity"" by donating their profits to help struggling single mothers.
Back in March, Burly Man Coffee launched their charitable giving campaign by giving a vehicle to a single mom in Lake Worth, Fla. The company's ultimate goal is to donate 100 cars to single mothers.
The first recipient was Celeste Bokstrom, who's a full-time caretaker for her severely non-verbal, autistic 16-year-old son, Logan. She has spent four years without a vehicle, making it difficult to buy groceries or get to doctors' appointments.
It took Bokstrom two years to save enough money to purchase a used car online. Then she faced utter disappointment when she went to register the vehicle and found out the car was stolen.
""I was shocked and extremely disappointed,"" Bokstrom said in a press release. ""It took me a long time to save up enough money to buy a car. I lost it all in a moment. I was devastated.""
Burly Man Coffee learned about the single mother's struggles and decided to give her a new car, an iPad for her son to communicate, and many other resourceful tools for his care. The company also provided her with a shopping spree and a makeover.
In addition, Mike Cohen, director of the Center for Brain in Jupiter, Fla., partnered with the coffee company to provide Logan with Neurofeedback therapy. Using this innovative technology, Cohen has helped autistic individuals to be able to speak and has also improved the quality of life for numerous other people suffering from brain trauma.
When representatives of the coffee company came to give her the gifts, Bokstrom couldn't believe it. Her reaction seen on the video below is priceless.
""I had no idea this was going to happen to me. I had faith and believed that God knew my struggles, but I never expected this,"" she said in a press release. ""Receiving a car has changed my world. And Logan is now getting the help he deserves. I'm so grateful. Burly Man Coffee has changed our lives for the better.""
Jeremy Wiles, the owner of the coffee company, says it's his company's goal to help single mothers, but to also fight back against an unhealthy agenda against men.
""Coffee is our craft, and helping people is our passion,"" he said in a press release. ""But, I'm also sick of turning on the TV and hearing the far left political and social warriors push their toxic masculinity message in our faces. Not all men are barbaric, sexist, misogynistic, racist monsters. We wanted a way to share our passion for great coffee and help others, but also push back against this dangerous agenda that targets men. So, we started Burly Man Coffee.""
""We associated the term being 'Burly' with being a man who is brave, kind, generous, and patriotic,"" the press release continued. ""Our brand represents every hard-working American whose virtues have more value than the toxic agenda being shoved in their faces. We've been astounded at the level of support we've received since launching Burly Man Coffee in December 2018. The fast-growing number of people joining the coffee club is a clear indicator that people appreciate great coffee and want to partner with a company that uses their hard-earned dollars to represent their values.""
The company has also released several comedic videos online featuring a bearded ""Burly Man"" character to deliver their strong political and social messages. The videos have gone viral.
Tiana Wiles, the coffee company's co-owner, revealed in a press release they chose single mothers as their mission because she was raised by a single mom and knows the difficulties and challenges they face.
""There are single moms barely staying afloat because some men have abandoned ship. Burly Man Coffee has stepped up to fill in the gap and provide relief by meeting their most critical needs,"" the press release said. ""This is an opportunity to demonstrate what real men do. They take care of those in need. If we can change the life of a mother and her child for the better, then we are doing something right.""

Capitalism vs Socialism: New Film Explores the 'Greatest Humanitarian Achievement in History',www1.cbn.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/capitalism-vs-socialism-new-film-explores-the-greatest-humanitarian-achievement-in-history,"Capitalism vs Socialism: New Film Explores the 'Greatest Humanitarian Achievement in History'
WASHINGTON – Online searches for ""socialism"" have spiked amidst increasing chatter from politicians of all stripes – from President Donald J. Trump to self-described democratic socialists like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).
At the 2019 annual meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference, President Trump swore off socialism before a receptive crowd.
""Socialism is about only one thing: it's called power for the ruling class,"" Trump said before concluding with a pledge he delivered at his State of the Union address weeks earlier: ""America will never be a socialist country.""
While polls show Americans overwhelmingly favor capitalism, they also reveal an increasing openness to socialist economic policies, particularly among Democrats and younger voters.
With the rise of interest in socialism, Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute, wants people to take a fresh look at its counterpart.
""Democratic capitalism has pulled billions of people out of poverty. It is the greatest humanitarian achievement in the history of mankind,"" Brooks told CBN News.
Brooks teamed up with Emergent Order to produce a documentary called ""The Pursuit."" It features him traveling across the globe – to Europe, to Kentucky coal country, and the remote Indian foothills of Dharamsala to meet with the Dalai Lama.
The film highlights the benefits of capitalism by focusing on Brooks' lifelong passion: finding ways to lift people out of poverty. His quest also takes viewers on a journey exploring different ideas that lead to true happiness.
""We're in this culture war about capitalism: should we have socialism or capitalism? And that's the wrong argument. That's the wrong discussion,"" Brooks explained. ""We should be talking about am I my brother's keeper or am I not my brother's keeper? And if I am what's the best way to do it? That's what this film is about.""
Brooks, 54, said during his lifetime, the world has witnessed an 80 percent decline in poverty. He credits that decline to capitalism, calling it a miraculous tool for good when based on morality rather than greed.
""The point of capitalism is not for me and you to get richer. It's to share the abundance and earned success - the equal dignity of life with other people,"" he told CBN News.
""Here's the great irony of our times: People in the wealthiest countries in the world are increasingly turning against the very system that's lifted us out of poverty,"" Brooks said in the film's trailer .
He pointed out that people in democratic socialist economies like Denmark appear to be happy. However, he said he discovered what separates Americans is a sense of joy that comes from our self-made will to flourish.
""I'm not trashing Denmark. I think Denmark is great. I think a lot of people are very happy in Denmark,"" he continued. ""But I'm really truly joyful that I'm an American.
""The thing that I really learned going to talk about these democratic socialist countries is that I want to live in a country of ambitious riffraff, because that's what I am and that's what we all are,"" he told CBN News. ""We're trying to build something from nothing. That's not the ethos in most countries around the world.""
Brooks believes the film plunges much deeper than simply comparing economic theories and systems. It imagines the possibilities of a better world by exploring the themes of opportunity, prosperity, compassion, and human dignity for everyone.
""The Pursuit"" released in theaters April 29th and will be available digitally on iTunes on May 7th."
Life Post-Abortion: Could it Be a Better America?,www1.cbn.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/life-post-abortion-could-it-be-a-better-america,"Life Post-Abortion: Could it Be a Better America?
WASHINGTON – As the US Supreme Court may be turning more conservative, a day could come when it overturns Roe v Wade, the ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. While that panics some women, it encourages others.
A symposium of such women in Washington, DC promoted the idea that a post-abortion America could actually be a better one. Some women can't imagine a world without Roe v Wade, a world without legalized abortion. But actually imagining the post-Roe world was what the ""Women Speak"" symposium was about. The pro-life group Americans United for Life organized the event, with its leader Catherine Glenn Foster arguing women would no longer need to kill their unborn children if society was more accepting of motherhood. Careers vs. Babies
She asserted, ""It is not women who need to change, but a nation that would discriminate against pregnant and parenting women."" Because of that prejudice, many women feel they'll threaten their careers, their opportunities if they embrace motherhood.
Writer Alexandra DeSanctis of National Review answered, ""It's actually deeply disempowering to women to tell them that they need the right to kill their own child in order to be flourishing, in order to be happy."" Foster told CBN News , ""The Supreme Court has this mistaken assumption that women rely on abortion to succeed in society. They say that we can't make it on our own, that we're not enough, that we have to have abortion, legalized abortion on demand, all nine months of pregnancy, in order to succeed. And that is simply false."" Perpetuating a Culture of Death
She suggests as women fill up more and more positions in the working world, businesses and the women will both be better off if institutions learn to positively accommodate motherhood. If they won't, it sends a deadly message. ""It perpetuates this culture of death, this idea that not only can women not succeed without abortion, but that death can be preferable to life,"" Foster stated. ""And it is simply harmful to all Americans."" Like the nation's seniors and less healthy citizens. Both Social Security and Medicare face having to make deep cuts soon because abortion has killed off so many Americans who would be supporting those systems. ""Since Roe v Wade, 61 million Americans are not here because they've been aborted,"" said Rep. Vicki Hartzler (R-MO) adding that many of them would now be in their prime contributing years. ""If every baby had been allowed to live, we wouldn't be having this crisis with Social Security and Medicare,"" she concluded. The women speaking at and attending the ""Women Speak"" symposium hope Americans will begin to realize a post-abortion world wouldn't be about losing a right, but getting rid of something toxic. Because as Foster put it, ""Abortion actually harms us."""

"Alabama House Passes Near-Total Abortion Ban, and It Lines Up with the State Constitution",www.cbn.com,Dale Hurd,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/may/alabama-house-passes-near-total-abortion-ban-and-it-lines-up-with-the-state-constitution,"Lawmakers in the Alabama House have passed one of the most pro-life laws in the country. But can it withstand a court challenge?
The state house voted on a measure Tuesday that would outlaw almost all abortions in the state. The legislation known as the Human Life Protection Act would make it a Class A felony to perform an abortion at any stage in a woman's pregnancy. It could mean a prison sentence from 10 to 99 years.
The Republican-led state House of Representatives passed the proposal after Democrats walked out.
Republicans had voted down Democrats' attempt to amend the bill to add an exemption for rape and incest. The bill does include an exemption for a threat to the mother's health.
The bill passed by a vote of 74 - 3. It now moves to the state Senate.
The Alabama Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union plans to challenge the bill in court if it becomes law, saying in a statement:
""The people of Alabama are paying the bill for unconstitutional legislation and we hope that the Senate members will realize its detrimental impact and stop this bill from becoming law. Otherwise, it will be challenged in federal court.""
As CBN News reported in April, the bill would be used to directly challenge Roe v. Wade — the landmark 1973 US Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. If passed and signed into law, it would most likely be struck down by lower courts. However, the goal is for the case to make it to the Supreme Court for a new judicial showdown.
""The goal of this bill is to address Roe v Wade,"" said Republican Rep. Terri Collins, the House bill's sponsor. ""I believe the Roe v Wade decision was based on a lack of information that the baby in a womb is a person.""
The measure comes after Alabama voters wrote anti-abortion language into the state constitution, declaring the state recognizes the ""rights of unborn children."" Around 59 percent of voters approved the constitutional amendment last November."
"Furious Dems Label AG Barr a Liar, GOP Ready to Investigate Anti-Trump Investigators",www.cbn.com,Eric Philips,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/may/furious-dems-label-ag-barr-a-liar-gop-ready-to-investigate-anti-trump-investigators,"WASHINGTON – Attorney General William Barr testified before the Senate today where he faced heated questioning and accusations from Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.
At center stage – the 400-page Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, and Barr's interpretation of it.
Barr's March 24th letter was not a summary of the report but a statement of the principle conclusions.
A few days after that review's release, Special Counsel Robert Mueller wrote to Barr concerned that the condensed rendition created more questions than it answered.
Mueller's communication said Barr's review ""did not fully capture the context, nature and substance of this office's work and conclusions...There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results…This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.""
In a followup phone call, Barr says Mueller told him he did not think the 4-page review was inaccurate, but he wanted more.
Barr said, ""His concern focused on his explanation of why he did not reach a conclusion on obstruction and he wanted more put out on that issue.""
Sen. Maise Hirono (D-HI) called Barr a liar. ""You lied to Congress,"" Hirono said. ""America deserves better. You should resign.""
And Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) called for Barr's resignation saying he ""deliberately misled Congress about his knowledge of Mueller's concerns over his summary.""
Barr's original summary had sent the president on a victory tour proclaiming, ""No collusion, no obstruction!""
That led to questions of whether Barr purposely mischaracterized the report.
Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) said, ""The report outlined substantial evidence that the Trump campaign welcomed encouraged and expected to benefit electorally from Russia's interference in the election.""
But Republicans insist the bottom line is the bottom line.
Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said, ""Ok he didn't collude with the Russians and he didn't specifically do anything to stop Mueller but attempted obstruction of a crime that never occurred I guess is sort of the new standard around here.""
And Graham made clear that he feels this investigation is linked to Hilary Clinton's mishandling of proprietary emails during her time as secretary of state.
""We know that the person in charge of investigating hated Trump's guts,"" Graham said. ""These are the people that made a decision that Clinton didn't do anything wrong and that counterintelligence of the Trump campaign was warranted.""
That's something Republicans are vowing to look into after the Mueller report is put to bed.
Barr was set to testify in front of the Democrat-controlled House subcommittee Thursday, but he's now canceled that because of debate over the format of that hearing.
Still yet to be seen is whether Mueller himself will testify, though his boss William Barr says he doesn't have a problem with it."

Destroys Leftist Label of 'Toxic Masculinity': 100 Cars for Single Moms,www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/burly-man-coffee-co-destroys-leftist-label-of-toxic-masculinity-100-cars-for-single-moms,"A South Florida coffee company says it's fighting back against the message of ""toxic masculinity"" by donating their profits to help struggling single mothers.
Back in March, Burly Man Coffee launched their charitable giving campaign by giving a vehicle to a single mom in Lake Worth, Fla. The company's ultimate goal is to donate 100 cars to single mothers.
The first recipient was Celeste Bokstrom, who's a full-time caretaker for her severely non-verbal, autistic 16-year-old son, Logan. She has spent four years without a vehicle, making it difficult to buy groceries or get to doctors' appointments.
It took Bokstrom two years to save enough money to purchase a used car online. Then she faced utter disappointment when she went to register the vehicle and found out the car was stolen.
""I was shocked and extremely disappointed,"" Bokstrom said in a press release. ""It took me a long time to save up enough money to buy a car. I lost it all in a moment. I was devastated.""
Burly Man Coffee learned about the single mother's struggles and decided to give her a new car, an iPad for her son to communicate, and many other resourceful tools for his care. The company also provided her with a shopping spree and a makeover.
In addition, Mike Cohen, director of the Center for Brain in Jupiter, Fla., partnered with the coffee company to provide Logan with Neurofeedback therapy. Using this innovative technology, Cohen has helped autistic individuals to be able to speak and has also improved the quality of life for numerous other people suffering from brain trauma.
When representatives of the coffee company came to give her the gifts, Bokstrom couldn't believe it. Her reaction seen on the video below is priceless.
""I had no idea this was going to happen to me. I had faith and believed that God knew my struggles, but I never expected this,"" she said in a press release. ""Receiving a car has changed my world. And Logan is now getting the help he deserves. I'm so grateful. Burly Man Coffee has changed our lives for the better.""
Jeremy Wiles, the owner of the coffee company, says it's his company's goal to help single mothers, but to also fight back against an unhealthy agenda against men.
""Coffee is our craft, and helping people is our passion,"" he said in a press release. ""But, I'm also sick of turning on the TV and hearing the far left political and social warriors push their toxic masculinity message in our faces. Not all men are barbaric, sexist, misogynistic, racist monsters. We wanted a way to share our passion for great coffee and help others, but also push back against this dangerous agenda that targets men. So, we started Burly Man Coffee.""
""We associated the term being 'Burly' with being a man who is brave, kind, generous, and patriotic,"" the press release continued. ""Our brand represents every hard-working American whose virtues have more value than the toxic agenda being shoved in their faces. We've been astounded at the level of support we've received since launching Burly Man Coffee in December 2018. The fast-growing number of people joining the coffee club is a clear indicator that people appreciate great coffee and want to partner with a company that uses their hard-earned dollars to represent their values.""
The company has also released several comedic videos online featuring a bearded ""Burly Man"" character to deliver their strong political and social messages. The videos have gone viral.
Tiana Wiles, the coffee company's co-owner, revealed in a press release they chose single mothers as their mission because she was raised by a single mom and knows the difficulties and challenges they face.
""There are single moms barely staying afloat because some men have abandoned ship. Burly Man Coffee has stepped up to fill in the gap and provide relief by meeting their most critical needs,"" the press release said. ""This is an opportunity to demonstrate what real men do. They take care of those in need. If we can change the life of a mother and her child for the better, then we are doing something right.""

Life Post-Abortion: Could it Be a Better America?,www.cbn.com,Paul Strand,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/life-post-abortion-could-it-be-a-better-america,"WASHINGTON – As the US Supreme Court may be turning more conservative, a day could come when it overturns Roe v Wade, the ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. While that panics some women, it encourages others.
A symposium of such women in Washington, DC promoted the idea that a post-abortion America could actually be a better one.
Some women can't imagine a world without Roe v Wade, a world without legalized abortion. But actually imagining the post-Roe world was what the ""Women Speak"" symposium was about.
The pro-life group Americans United for Life organized the event, with its leader Catherine Glenn Foster arguing women would no longer need to kill their unborn children if society was more accepting of motherhood.
Careers vs. Babies
She asserted, ""It is not women who need to change, but a nation that would discriminate against pregnant and parenting women.""
Because of that prejudice, many women feel they'll threaten their careers, their opportunities if they embrace motherhood.
Writer Alexandra DeSanctis of National Review answered, ""It's actually deeply disempowering to women to tell them that they need the right to kill their own child in order to be flourishing, in order to be happy.""
Foster told CBN News , ""The Supreme Court has this mistaken assumption that women rely on abortion to succeed in society. They say that we can't make it on our own, that we're not enough, that we have to have abortion, legalized abortion on demand, all nine months of pregnancy, in order to succeed. And that is simply false.""
Perpetuating a Culture of Death
She suggests as women fill up more and more positions in the working world, businesses and the women will both be better off if institutions learn to positively accommodate motherhood. If they won't, it sends a deadly message.
""It perpetuates this culture of death, this idea that not only can women not succeed without abortion, but that death can be preferable to life,"" Foster stated. ""And it is simply harmful to all Americans.""
Like the nation's seniors and less healthy citizens. Both Social Security and Medicare face having to make deep cuts soon because abortion has killed off so many Americans who would be supporting those systems.
""Since Roe v Wade, 61 million Americans are not here because they've been aborted,"" said Rep. Vicki Hartzler (R-MO) adding that many of them would now be in their prime contributing years.
""If every baby had been allowed to live, we wouldn't be having this crisis with Social Security and Medicare,"" she concluded.
The women speaking at and attending the ""Women Speak"" symposium hope Americans will begin to realize a post-abortion world wouldn't be about losing a right, but getting rid of something toxic.
Because as Foster put it, ""Abortion actually harms us."""
"'Downright Sickening': CA Preps Graphic Sex Ed with Bondage, 'Blood Play', and K-3 Gender Queer",www.cbn.com,Heather Sells,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/downright-sickening-ca-preps-graphic-sex-ed-with-bondage-blood-play-and-k-3-gender-queer,"The state of California is poised to adopt a no-holds-barred K-12 health curriculum that teaches children as young as kindergarten about gender identity issues and talks explicitly with high school students about every imaginable sex act.
The State Board of Education has been taking public comment on the curriculum for months and despite protests from various parent and conservative groups, it appears it will adopt it this month.
Greg Burt, a spokesman for the California Family Council , says protestors are running out of time.
""We expect them to simply rubber stamp it,"" he told CBN News on Wednesday, ""but we are going to make it as painful as possible. If this is what they intend to expose kids to, if this is where they're going then the whole state needs to know about it.""
A new 18,000-member parent group, Informed Parents of California (IPOC), will join the council to protest the curriculum during a May 8th rally at the capitol.
IPOC co-founder Stephanie Yates calls the curriculum ""downright sickening. It's dangerous. It's reckless and it will destroy our children's physical, emotional and mental health,"" she said.
The curriculum draws on guidance from the California Healthy Youth Act, which took effect in 2016. It requires ""comprehensive"" sex ed for students in middle and high school but also allows them to opt-out, if their parent or guardian makes a request in writing.
However, students may not opt out of instruction related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation or discrimination.
State senator Mike Morrell (R-Rancho Cucamonga) is seeking to remedy that with a new bill that will allow K-6 parents the ability to opt-in to the sex ed curriculum for their children, rather than having to opt-out. The bill would also require school districts to post elementary-age sex ed curriculum on their websites.
""Many parents have expressed concern that much of the material is unsuitable for young students and in some cases, even indecent,"" said Morrell.
IPOC parents say some of the biggest concerns include: a book for kindergarten through third grade which teaches kids that they can be a boy, girl, neither, gender queer or gender fluid and that adults might not understand their gender identity.
A book for fourth, fifth and sixth-grade boys discusses slang words for genitals and explains masturbation and sexual fantasies.
A book for high school students introduces sex acts for all sexual orientations and introduces the concepts of bondage, body fluid, blood play, fisting and other sexual behaviors once considered to be acts of debauchery.
Burt acknowledged that local school districts have the final say on what they teach but said the state's curriculum is still a huge influence. ""What we find is school districts will use this framework as a guide to decide what curriculum and books to pick,"" he said."

Jakes Announces Launch of Divinity School, Draws Backlash from Others in Academia",www.cbn.com,Steve Warren,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/cwn/2019/may/bishop-t-d-jakes-announces-launch-of-divinity-school-draws-backlash-from-others-in-academia,"Dallas megachurch pastor and televangelist Bishop T.D. Jakes has announced plans to launch his own online Jakes Divinity School next January.
The school will begin enrolling students early next year.
Jakes, the senior pastor of The Potter's House, will serve as chancellor. Former Regent University Professor Dr. Antipas Harris, a Yale-trained theologian, has been named as president.
According to the school's website , ""Jakes Divinity School prepares leaders for the future through academic rigor with experiential-learning, spiritual formation, and creative innovation necessary to minister in the Church and society.""
The online school will offer accredited degrees through partnerships with Southern California's Vanguard University and North Central University , a Christian college in Minnesota.
""As the potter forms the clay into a vessel of purpose, the vision at JDS is to form leaders for ministry in the church and society. Throughout more than 40 years of ministry, Bishop TD Jakes, our founder, and chancellor has poured of himself into millions of people around the world. He has a passion for equipping others to do the same,"" Harris said in a video announcement shared on Instagram Saturday.

A post shared by Dr. Antipas L. Harris (@drantipas) on Apr 25, 2019 at 8:34pm PDT
""There remains much more mission work, pastoral care, leadership and thought leading to be done. The moral decay of our world is leading a generation on a spiritual search. The Holy Spirit sends out a clarion call for us to study deeper, understand more, bear witness greater, lead better and go further. For theological education and spiritual formation, we can meet the complexities of ministry for the 21st century,"" he added.
The school will offer four Bachelor's degrees in the areas of ministry leadership, anti-human trafficking, Hispanic Ministry and Leadership, and Humanitarian Leadership. Master's degrees will be offered in two areas: Leadership studies and theological studies.
The school will also offer an advanced Doctor of Ministry program.
Some academics are questioning Jakes' new venture.
""I have ONE question ... who is their accreditation with? I looked and did not see one!! ***All right, y'all can enroll in this school if you want to, invest all that money in a degree for it not to count for anything, other than you went to Jakes Divinity School!,"" Quincy James Rineheart, a theologian and historian of African American religion, wrote in a Facebook post .
""Lastly, as a person who graduated from two accredited theological schools, Candler School of Theology (Emory University) and Chicago Theological Seminary, I have serious concerns about their curriculum,"" Rineheart continued.
But others are applauding Jakes' efforts to leave a lasting legacy.
In a Facebook post , Marquez Ball, senior pastor of Uplift Church in Quote: : ""So ... Jakes Divinity School. I'm far, very far from a Jakes follower however some of us need to calm down. The hate we give our own is sicking (sic). It's true Jakes doesn't have an earned degree and I know how we educated black, colored, negro preachers can be. Spurgeon didn't have a degree and he started a school, John McArthur started the Masters Seminary and he doesn't have a doctorate. So is it ok for white people to start schools but black people must first have 17 PhD's etc in order to start a school?"" he asked.
""Jakes has a major scholar leading the school and that's great. Some of y'all who are hating on Jakes haven't built a small group much less a school so.... CALM DOWN. He's a black man trying to leave a legacy and as a black man I don't have to agree with him on everything to celebrate a black man leaving a legacy. Maybe some black scholar who keeps getting overlooked by white schools can find a home and funding at Jakes school... let's fight for advancement and stop hating on each other. If you don't think he's worthy ... YOU START A BETTER SCHOOL or... s ,"" Ball added."
Father Subject to 'Arrest Without Warrant' if He Refuses to Call Daughter by Male Name,www.cbn.com,"Will Maule, Faithwire",05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/may/father-subject-to-arrest-without-warrant-if-he-refuses-to-call-daughter-by-male-name,"A Canadian court has warned a concerned father that he could be summarily arrested if he refuses to call his daughter by her preferred male name.
Taylor Swift’s ‘ME!’ Is Bad, And a Symptom of Our Self-Obsessed Culture
As Faithwire previously reported , the dad, “Clark,” was convicted on charges of “family violence” after insisting on calling his teenage daughter by her birth name — “Maxine.”
Now, according to The Federalist , the Supreme Court of British Columbia has issued a sweeping “protection order” in the case, threatening the dad with immediate arrest “without a warrant” should the police conclude there’s “reasonable” ground to suggest he had privately or publicly referred to his daughter as a female.
In addition, the court issued a gag order, preventing the dad from discussing his case in the media — he is even prohibited from sharing court documents describing his own gag order. This is strange, not least because all the records are publicly available .
All in all the court has come down very heavily on the father, who is simply concerned for the welfare of his own child and wants her to carefully consider such a life-defining decision.
What is the background? At the end of February, the Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled that the 14-year-old girl, “Maxine,” was eligible to receive her desired male hormone injections — this was decided without her parents’ consent, after Maxine decided, on her own accord, to become a boy.
Clark insisted that in the months prior to this decision, Maxine had exhibited signs of emotional instability and depression and had been acting out sexually, even making a brief foray into lesbianism.
Her father claimed that her mental health had been volatile since he and his wife underwent a divorce — he also claimed that Maxine’s decision to become a boy was the result of this emotional strife and demanded that he be involved in her healthcare moving forward.
However, despite his repeated pleas, the hospital administering her treatment, as well as the teenager’s school, refused to let the dad get involved.
Clark’s appeal against the ruling over the testosterone injections is set to be heard May 14."
The Top 200 Healthiest Foods and Why It's More Important Than Ever to Eat Them,www.cbn.com,Lorie Johnson,04-30-2019,2019,4,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/health/2019/may/the-top-200-healthiest-foods-and-why-its-more-important-than-ever-to-eat-them,"When we think about life's biggest decisions, images of choosing the right spouse, career or home come to mind. What to eat? Not so much.
New research may change that. Scientists now know our body has five natural defense systems that are magnificently effective at warding off our scariest diseases. There is a catch, however. These defense systems only work properly when nourished with healthy foods.
In his new book Eat to Beat Disease Dr. William Li explains how our body's defense systems work and lists 200 foods that keep them humming.
""We don't need to spend all of our time thinking about what to cut out of our diet,"" he told CBN News, ""It's now time to start thinking about what we can add to our lives,"" adding, ""we want to eat lots of foods that can activate our health defenses and because there are so many choices and everybody can find something they like in the 200 foods that I list, you can start eating healthy with the foods you already love.""
Readers will be thrilled to discover delicious sourdough and pumpernickel bread actually feed one of our health defense systems, as do certain cheeses. Many foods, called ""grand slams"" fuel all five defense systems.
Angiogenesis
This health defense system keeps cancers small. Believe it or not, we all have cancer cells within our body, but angiogenesis is a form of protection that starves those cancer cells and prevents them from growing and invading the rest of our body. Angiogenesis regulates our blood vessels. More than 100 foods can enhance angiogenesis such as pomegranate, black raspberries, and tomatoes. Dr. Li takes it a step further by pointing out that when it comes to tomatoes, cooked, San Marzano contains the most cancer-fighting lycopene.
""Almost 36,000 men have been studied,"" he said, ""And it was found that those who ate two to three servings of cooked tomatoes, that's tomato sauce, a week, had a thirty percent decreased risk of developing prostate cancer.""
Vitamin K-2 is key to controlling angiogenesis, you can find this vitamin in Gouda, Jarlesburg, and Edam
""This vitamin K2, which is a healthy side effect of making the cheese itself, is a powerful anti-angiogenic, cancer starving substance,"" said Dr. Li.
Microbiome
It may sound a little gross, but trillions of living bacteria call our intestinal tract home. Not only that, but we rely heavily on these microscopic critters to keep every aspect of our minds and bodies operating smoothly. The kind of bacteria and the amount of them comprise a very complex ecosystem called our microbiome. Dr. Li says a balanced microbiome leads to good physical and mental health.
""The healthy bacteria that live inside our bodies, 39 trillion bacteria live inside us, communicate with our immune system. They help our bodies heal. They even talk to our brain.""
Dr. Li says fermented foods like Kim Chi and yogurt contain healthy bacteria, also known as probiotics. Fiber-rich foods like broccoli, which are called prebiotics, play a role because they feed the good bacteria. Some people are surprised to learn sourdough bread boosts our microbiome.
""It turns out that sourdough is made with Lactobacillus reuteri. It's that bacteria that creates that nice tangy taste,"" he explained, ""That bacteria boosts our immune system, it can actually speed our healing, our ability to heal wounds and it also communicates to our brains to release that social hormone oxytocin that makes us feel good.""
Pumpernickel bread, which is made from rye flour, also fortifies the microbiome. ""Rye flour will decrease the levels of an unhealthy bacteria in our gut that creates a toxin that causes inflammation,"" he said, ""So eating pumpernickel bread can lower that bacteria and lower inflammation.""

DNA Repair
We all know DNA contains the genetic code we inherited from our parents. However, it's much more than that. It issues commands to our entire body, telling it what to do. Unfortunately, it's a fragile system that is constantly under attack from the environment. Natural enemies such as ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure can weaken DNA, as can toxins such as second-hand smoke and gasoline fumes. (Dr. Li recommends standing down-wind of these fumes when filling our cars).
Foods that repair and strengthen our DNA include kiwifruit, spinach, and lentils. Get this: over 100 different types of oysters strengthen DNA, particularly Pacific oysters. In one study, the oysters reduced DNA damage by a whopping 90 percent!
Stem Cells
Only recently have scientists uncovered the protective properties of our own stem cells, which are vital for growing and maintaining our organs. Researchers now tell us these foundational life units can actually regenerate our bodies throughout our lives.
""When we were kids we were taught salamanders and starfish regenerate, but people can't,"" Dr. Li said, ""Science is turning that upside down. We know that we do regenerate from the inside out using our stem cells.""
As if we need another reason to love chocolate, recent studies show the dark bean can be a super fuel for stem cells.
""And I write about in my book about a study with men who have coronary disease,"" Dr. Li explained, ""And when they were given dark cocoa, the chocolate alone was able to double the number of stem cells in their bloodstream, and when they measured their blood flow they were able to double that as well. So it's quite remarkable.""
Immune System
Our immune system is one of the most well-known health defense systems, yet scientists continue to learn more about how it works. It keeps us from getting an infection after we've been exposed to bacteria, fights off viruses and more. In short, a strong immune system provides protection against any pathogen seeking to harm us.
""We now know the immune system is more powerful than we ever thought,"" said Dr. Li, ""In fact, it can protect us against cancer.""
In addition to cancer, dozens of other conditions can be blamed on weak immune systems such as allergies, Celiac Disease, Psoriasis, even Diabetes.
Foods that stimulate the immune system include mushroom, garlic, and particularly extra virgin olive oil.
""There's actually a natural substance in the olive called hydroxytyrosol which is a powerful way to cut off the blood supply feeding cancer,"" said Dr. Li, ""It's also anti-inflammatory.""
Dr. Li says certain olive oils contain more of the healing hydroxytyrosol and polyphenols than others. He recommends buying olive oil made from Koroneiki, Picual or Moraiolo olives.
""So when I go shopping for olive oil,"" Dr. Li said, ""I pick up the bottle, and I turn it around, and I look for the name of the olive. What kind of olive was this oil pressed from?""
So while many of view food as an afterthought, Dr. William Li says putting a little thought into what we eat can pay dividends when it comes to our health.
""While medicines can be used to treat disease, foods can prevent it in the first place,"" he said."

WASHINGTON – Attorney General William Barr testified before the Senate today where he faced heated questioning and accusations from Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.
At center stage – the 400-page Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, and Barr's interpretation of it.
Barr's March 24th letter was not a summary of the report but a statement of the principle conclusions.
A few days after that review's release, Special Counsel Robert Mueller wrote to Barr concerned that the condensed rendition created more questions than it answered.
Mueller's communication said Barr's review ""did not fully capture the context, nature and substance of this office's work and conclusions...There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results…This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations.""
In a followup phone call, Barr says Mueller told him he did not think the 4-page review was inaccurate, but he wanted more.
Barr said, ""His concern focused on his explanation of why he did not reach a conclusion on obstruction and he wanted more put out on that issue.""
Sen. Maise Hirono (D-HI) called Barr a liar. ""You lied to Congress,"" Hirono said. ""America deserves better. You should resign.""
And Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) called for Barr's resignation saying he ""deliberately misled Congress about his knowledge of Mueller's concerns over his summary.""
Barr's original summary had sent the president on a victory tour proclaiming, ""No collusion, no obstruction!""
That led to questions of whether Barr purposely mischaracterized the report.
Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) said, ""The report outlined substantial evidence that the Trump campaign welcomed encouraged and expected to benefit electorally from Russia's interference in the election.""
But Republicans insist the bottom line is the bottom line.
Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said, ""Ok he didn't collude with the Russians and he didn't specifically do anything to stop Mueller but attempted obstruction of a crime that never occurred I guess is sort of the new standard around here.""
And Graham made clear that he feels this investigation is linked to Hilary Clinton's mishandling of proprietary emails during her time as secretary of state.
""We know that the person in charge of investigating hated Trump's guts,"" Graham said. ""These are the people that made a decision that Clinton didn't do anything wrong and that counterintelligence of the Trump campaign was warranted.""
That's something Republicans are vowing to look into after the Mueller report is put to bed.
Barr was set to testify in front of the Democrat-controlled House subcommittee Thursday, but he's now canceled that because of debate over the format of that hearing.
Still yet to be seen is whether Mueller himself will testify, though his boss William Barr says he doesn't have a problem with it."
"Alabama House Passes Near-Total Abortion Ban, and It Lines Up with the State Constitution",www1.cbn.com,,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/may/alabama-house-passes-near-total-abortion-ban-and-it-lines-up-with-the-state-constitution,"Alabama House Passes Near-Total Abortion Ban, and It Lines Up with the State Constitution 05-01-2019 Steve Warren
Lawmakers in the Alabama House have passed one of the most pro-life laws in the country. But can it withstand a court challenge?
The state house voted on a measure Tuesday that would outlaw almost all abortions in the state. The legislation known as the Human Life Protection Act would make it a Class A felony to perform an abortion at any stage in a woman's pregnancy. It could mean a prison sentence from 10 to 99 years.
The Republican-led state House of Representatives passed the proposal after Democrats walked out.
Republicans had voted down Democrats' attempt to amend the bill to add an exemption for rape and incest. The bill does include an exemption for a threat to the mother's health.
The bill passed by a vote of 74 - 3. It now moves to the state Senate.
The Alabama Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union plans to challenge the bill in court if it becomes law, saying in a statement: ""The people of Alabama are paying the bill for unconstitutional legislation and we hope that the Senate members will realize its detrimental impact and stop this bill from becoming law. Otherwise, it will be challenged in federal court.""
As CBN News reported in April, the bill would be used to directly challenge Roe v. Wade — the landmark 1973 US Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationwide. If passed and signed into law, it would most likely be struck down by lower courts. However, the goal is for the case to make it to the Supreme Court for a new judicial showdown. ""The goal of this bill is to address Roe v Wade,"" said Republican Rep. Terri Collins, the House bill's sponsor. ""I believe the Roe v Wade decision was based on a lack of information that the baby in a womb is a person.""
The measure comes after Alabama voters wrote anti-abortion language into the state constitution, declaring the state recognizes the ""rights of unborn children."" Around 59 percent of voters approved the constitutional amendment last November."

The hate we give our own is sicking (sic). It's true Jakes doesn't have an earned degree and I know how we educated black, colored, negro preachers can be. Spurgeon didn't have a degree and he started a school, John McArthur started the Masters Seminary and he doesn't have a doctorate. So is it ok for white people to start schools but black people must first have 17 PhD's etc in order to start a school?"" he asked.
""Jakes has a major scholar leading the school and that's great. Some of y'all who are hating on Jakes haven't built a small group much less a school so.... CALM DOWN. He's a black man trying to leave a legacy and as a black man I don't have to agree with him on everything to celebrate a black man leaving a legacy. Maybe some black scholar who keeps getting overlooked by white schools can find a home and funding at Jakes school... let's fight for advancement and stop hating on each other. If you don't think he's worthy ... YOU START A BETTER SCHOOL or... s ,"" Ball added."

(Image credit: John Jessup: CBN News)
WASHINGTON – About one hundred people – religious leaders, Trump administration officials, and their guests – celebrated the ""power of prayer"" at the White House Wednesday night ahead of the day set aside annually for Americans of all faiths to pray for thanks and guidance.
""America will be a nation that believes forever, and we certainly believe – more than anyone – the power of prayer,"" President Donald J. Trump declared in the State Dining Room before continuing with an unscripted flourish: ""It's the most powerful thing there is.""
In his opening remarks preceding the National Day of Prayer, the president welcomed representatives of various faiths, including Christians, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, and Hindus.
""Tonight we break bread together united by our love of God, and we renew our resolve to protect the sacred freedom of religion – all of us,"" he said.
The president also acknowledged the recent religiously-motivated attacks both in the United States and abroad.
""All of us in this room send our love and prayers to the Jewish Americans wounded at the Chabad of Poway shooting in California,"" he said. ""And our hearts break for the life of Laurie Gilbert-Kaye who was so wickedly taken from us.""
""We mourn for the Christians murdered in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday and grieve for the Muslims murdered at their mosques in New Zealand,"" he added. ""Here at home, we also remember the three historically black churches burned recently in Louisiana and the horrific shooting last year at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.""
The roomful of staff and supporters of Trump's religious liberty policies applauded when he called for an end to violence and terrorism against people of all faiths.
Many well-known evangelical Christian leaders attended the White House dinner. They were perhaps his most enthusiastic supporters, greeting the president warmly as he and First Lady Melania Trump entered the room hand-in-hand. Some of them included Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, James and Shirley Dobson, Jentzen Franklin, Jerry Falwell, Jr., Franklin Graham, Mike Huckabee, Robert Jeffress, Alveda King, Johnnie Moore, Ralph Reed, and Paula White.
Saluting their approval of his record, he referenced what many of them acknowledge originally motivated their support for his candidacy.
""I'm thrilled to report that tomorrow the Senate will confirm the 100th federal judge through the court system,"" he announced. ""Under my administration, we're getting to a level where we're going to be breaking records with respect to the judiciary, which means a lot to the people in this room who were treated very poorly. With time you'll see what happens.""
The president offered his own report card, citing the confirmation of 145 federal judges and two Supreme Court justices.
Wednesday's event is the kick off to the National Day of Prayer, which lands on the first Thursday of May each year according to a law passed by Congress in 1988.
Last week, Mr. Trump issued a presidential proclamation in honor of the event, writing: ""On this National Day of Prayer, Americans once again come together to give thanks to Almighty God for the bountiful blessings He has bestowed on our great Nation and ask for His unfailing counsel. We acknowledge our dependence on God's love to guide our families, communities, and our country away from harm and toward abundance and peace.""
""Our Nation's honored tradition of prayer has sustained us and strengthened our trust that God will continue to watch over and accompany us through the best of times and the darkest hours. May we as Americans never forget the power of prayer and the greatness of our Creator. On this National Day of Prayer, let each of us, according to our own faiths, call upon God for His guidance and express our gratitude for the love and grace He bestows on our country,"" the proclamation read."

Nashville, TN – America's favorite clean comedienne is taking her show to the box office with a new documentary. It's called ""Chonda Pierce: Unashamed."" And it's playing in theaters across the country May 7 and May 9.
This is Chonda's third documentary. And this time, she's telling jokes and turning the spotlight on successful people who are taking bold stands in their Christian faith.
In an interview at her home just outside Nashville, Pierce joked, ""Documentaries are for people that are deceased.""
""Now, the first one, ""Laughing in the Dark"" – I thought I was almost dead.""
""And then ""Enough"" came out and that was coming back to life. It ended happier."" ""What I love about this movie is it has very little to do about me, hallelujah!""
The Push to Silence Christian Voices
The film features interviews with people like David and Jason Benham. The realtors and twin brothers saw HGTV cancel their popular program when people complained about their history of support for the traditional definition of marriage and their opposition to abortion. Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and recording artist Danny Gokey are also featured in the film, voicing their concerns about a public push to silence Christian voices in America.
Pierce has seen a push to silence her voice in recent years.
20 Years in the Business and ""I Still Get Push Back""
Chonda told CBN News, ""It is so fun that even in this day age, I have been at this for 20 years, and I cannot tell you how often I still get push back.""
Pierce is the most awarded comedienne in the country. And people are still sometimes baffled to learn she is a Christian.

""I'm No Pat Robertson, But...""
""And I think as the world goes on and I am no theologian. And I am no Pat Robertson, but I read everything he writes,"" she joked.
""But I think as time goes on, it is going to get harder before it gets easier to stand up for Christ. It's going to be a time of great push back. We are in a place where the church can no longer be lukewarm,"" Pierce said"

Fed Signals Neither a Rate Hike Nor a Cut is Likely Soon,www.cbn.com,Associated Press,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/finance/2019/may/fed-signals-neither-a-rate-hike-nor-a-cut-is-likely-soon,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged Wednesday and signaled that it’s unlikely to either raise or cut rates in coming months amid signs of renewed economic health but unusually low inflation.
The Fed left its benchmark rate — which influences many consumer and business loans — in a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. Its low-rate policy has helped boost stock prices and supported a steadily growing economy.
A statement from the Fed spotlighted its continuing failure so far to lift annual inflation to at least its 2% target rate. The Fed’s preferred 12-month inflation barometer is running at about 1.5%. In pointing to persistently low inflation, the statement might have raised expectations that the Fed’s next rate change, whenever it happens, could be a rate cut. The Fed cuts rates when it’s trying to stimulate inflation or growth.
But at a news conference later, Chairman Jerome Powell declined to hint of any potential coming rate cut. He suggested, in fact, that the current too-low inflation readings may be transitory or might not be fully capturing real-world price increases.
“The committee is comfortable with our current policy stance,” Powell said.
The chairman’s comments appeared to deflate a modest stock market rally that occurred after the Fed issued its statement, with its mention of unusually low inflation. Stock losses deepened later in the afternoon, with the Dow Jones industrial average ending the day down 162 points.
In its statement Wednesday, the Fed announced a technical adjustment to reduce the interest it pays banks on reserves as a way to keep its benchmark rate inside its approved range, rather than at the upper end of that range.
The central bank’s decision to make no change in its rate policy — approved on a 10-0 vote — had been expected despite renewed pressure from President Donald Trump for the Fed to cut rates aggressively to help accelerate economic growth.
The Fed sketched a more upbeat view of the economy, saying “economic activity rose at a solid rate.” In March, the Fed had said it appeared that growth had slowed from the fourth quarter of last year.
The generally brighter outlook for the economy and the stock market represents a sharp rebound from the final months of 2018, when concerns about a possible global recession and fear of further Fed rate increases had darkened the economic picture. Stock prices tumbled late last year, especially after the Fed in December not only raised rates for the fourth time in 2018 but suggested that it was likely to keep tightening credit this year.
Yet starting in January, the Fed engineered an abrupt reversal, suggesting that it was finished raising rates for now and might even act this year to support rather than restrain the economy. Its watchword became “patient.” And investors have responded by delivering a major stock market rally.
The market gains have also been fed by improved growth prospects in China and some other major economies and by the view that a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, the United States and China, is nearing a resolution.
Last week, the government reported that the U.S. economy grew at a surprisingly strong 3.2% annual rate in the January-March quarter. It was the best performance for a first quarter in four years, and it far surpassed initial forecasts that annual growth could be as weak as 1% at the start of the year.
If economic prospects were to brighten further, could Fed officials rethink their plans to suspend further rate hikes and perhaps resume tightening credit?
Possibly. But investors don’t seem to think so. According to data tracked by the CME Group, investors foresee zero probability that the Fed will raise rates anytime this year. And in fact, their bets indicate a roughly 60% likelihood that the Fed will cut rates before year’s end.
One factor in that dovish view is that the economy might not be quite as robust as the latest economic figures suggest. The first quarter’s healthy 3.2% annual growth rate was pumped up by some temporary factors — from a surge in restocking of companies’ inventories to a narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit — that are expected to reverse themselves. If so, this would diminish the pace of growth and likely hold down inflation.
Indeed, for all of 2019, growth is expected to total around 2.2%, down from last year’s 2.9% gain, as the effects of the 2017 tax cuts and billions of dollars in increased government spending fade.
At the same time, the Fed is still struggling to produce inflation of roughly 2%. This week, the government reported that the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge rose just 1.5% in March from 12 months earlier. Many analysts say they think the Fed won’t resume raising rates until inflation hits or exceeds its 2% target.
Too-low inflation is seen as an obstacle because it tends to depress consumer spending, the economy’s main fuel, as people delay purchases in anticipation of flat or even lower prices. It also raise the inflation-adjusted cost of a loan.
In the meantime, President Donald Trump has attacked Powell’s leadership as being too restrictive toward rates and has pressed the Fed to cut rates — something few mainstream economists favor.
On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that the U.S. economy has “the potential to go up like a rocket” if the Fed would only slash rates and resume the emergency bond-buying programs it unveiled after the Great Recession to ease long-term loan rates to stimulate spending and growth.
Asked at this news conference about Trump’s attacks, Powell replied that the Fed is a “nonpolitical institution” that doesn’t consider outside criticism in making its policy decisions.
“We don’t think about other factors” beyond how the economy and financial system are faring, Powell said. He said the Fed’s rate-setting panel thinks its rate policies are “in a good place.”

""Kill them now or you kill them later,"" are the words that came from the mouth of Alabama State Rep. John Rogers as Democrats and Republicans debated the passage of a bill Tuesday that virtually banned abortion in the state of Alabama.

The United States sent its first official delegation to Auschwitz Thursday to join thousands of Jews from around the world in participating in the 31st annual ""March of the Living"".
The annual event takes place each year on Yom HaShoah, the day Israel stops to remember the six million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust.
Dozens of Holocaust survivors, some of whom were once imprisoned in the camp, and thousands of other Jews walk from the Auschwitz concentration camp to the Birkenau extermination camp in honor of those who died there.
It is a profound experience for the participants and the first time the US has ever sent an official delegation.
""This is an incredibly powerful experience for me. It is the first time I have ever been to Auschwitz,"" US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman told Israeli radio.

Friedman said the delegation is a symbol of the United States' dedication to fighting anti-Semitism.
""The U.S. government is always ready to do battle against anti-Semitism and those who peddle this vile hatred, wherever it may exist – whether at book fairs in Europe and the Middle East where you can still find copies of the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' and 'Mein Kampf'; online where hate forums still flourish; or with people such as the shooter in Pittsburgh or most recently, the shooter at a Chabad synagogue in Poway, CA, who still seek to perpetrate violent acts against Jewish people merely because of their faith. We won't stop and we won't rest until we can shine the light in these dark corners and root it out forever,"" he said in a statement.

JERUSALEM, Israel –Sirens blared as Israel came to a halt for two minutes Thursday to honor the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust on Holocaust Memorial Day.
The entire nation united with a heart of grief.
“It’s our first time being here during the Holocaust memorial and it was very powerful. It was something that we’ve never seen and that everyone groups together as a country, which was pretty amazing,” Robert Dunn from Philadelphia told CBN News.
Even young people took a moment to honor the victims.
Two brothers from California said they didn’t study the Holocaust in school but knew what it was about.
“We freeze. Because we remember the Jews that were in the war that died so it doesn’t happen again,” Benjamin Weiss, 6, said.

Events began the previous night when the Israeli flag was lowered to half-mast at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem.

This is not a legitimate criticism of Israel… but a systematic, poisonous and shallow hatred that constantly undermines the legitimacy of the Jewish nation-state and only the Jewish nation-state.""
Rivlin agreed.
""Political forces where anti-Semitism and racism are part of their language, their legacy or their ideology can never be our allies….there is no such thing as loving Israel and hating Jews, just like there is no such thing as loving Jews and hating Israel.""
Israel remembers the holocaust every year according to the Hebrew calendar on the anniversary of the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto uprising.
Though the Jewish fighters were almost all killed, it marked a shift in thinking. Later, it helped shape Israel’s national identity symbolizing the struggle for survival against impossible odds."

COLOMBO, SRI LANKA — Catholic services are being canceled for a second weekend in Sri Lanka’s capital after the government warned of more possible attacks by the same Islamic State-linked group that carried out Easter suicide bombings.
Rev. Edmund Tillakaratne, spokesman for the Colombo diocese, said Thursday that Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith had canceled all Sunday services in the diocese based on the latest security reports.
Last week, Muslims were told to stay home for Friday prayers and all of Sri Lanka’s Catholic churches were closed. Instead of the usual Sunday Mass, Ranjith delivered a homily before clergy and national leaders at his residence that aired on television.
The April 21 bombings at churches and luxury hotels killed 253 people and officials have warned that suspects linked to the bombings are still at large.
A Cabinet minister said Tuesday that intelligence warnings had indicated government ministers could be targeted by the same group, which pledged its loyalty to the Islamic State group.
Ranjith has criticized the government’s apparent failure to share near-specific intelligence on the Easter plot and some of the suspects involved.
Sri Lankan police late Wednesday released the names and photographs of nine suicide bombers who carried out the Easter attacks. They included extremist preacher Mohamed Zahran, also known as Zahran Hashim, who was described as the attack leader, and another suicide bomber’s wife, who blew herself up, along with her children and three police officers, at a villa belonging to her father-in-law, who is a prominent spice trader."

(AP Photo)
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged Wednesday and signaled that it’s unlikely to either raise or cut rates in coming months amid signs of renewed economic health but unusually low inflation.
The Fed left its benchmark rate — which influences many consumer and business loans — in a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. Its low-rate policy has helped boost stock prices and supported a steadily growing economy.
A statement from the Fed spotlighted its continuing failure so far to lift annual inflation to at least its 2% target rate. The Fed’s preferred 12-month inflation barometer is running at about 1.5%. In pointing to persistently low inflation, the statement might have raised expectations that the Fed’s next rate change, whenever it happens, could be a rate cut. The Fed cuts rates when it’s trying to stimulate inflation or growth.
But at a news conference later, Chairman Jerome Powell declined to hint of any potential coming rate cut. He suggested, in fact, that the current too-low inflation readings may be transitory or might not be fully capturing real-world price increases.
“The committee is comfortable with our current policy stance,” Powell said.
The chairman’s comments appeared to deflate a modest stock market rally that occurred after the Fed issued its statement, with its mention of unusually low inflation. Stock losses deepened later in the afternoon, with the Dow Jones industrial average ending the day down 162 points.
In its statement Wednesday, the Fed announced a technical adjustment to reduce the interest it pays banks on reserves as a way to keep its benchmark rate inside its approved range, rather than at the upper end of that range.
The central bank’s decision to make no change in its rate policy — approved on a 10-0 vote — had been expected despite renewed pressure from President Donald Trump for the Fed to cut rates aggressively to help accelerate economic growth.
The Fed sketched a more upbeat view of the economy, saying “economic activity rose at a solid rate.” In March, the Fed had said it appeared that growth had slowed from the fourth quarter of last year.
The generally brighter outlook for the economy and the stock market represents a sharp rebound from the final months of 2018, when concerns about a possible global recession and fear of further Fed rate increases had darkened the economic picture. Stock prices tumbled late last year, especially after the Fed in December not only raised rates for the fourth time in 2018 but suggested that it was likely to keep tightening credit this year.
Yet starting in January, the Fed engineered an abrupt reversal, suggesting that it was finished raising rates for now and might even act this year to support rather than restrain the economy. Its watchword became “patient.” And investors have responded by delivering a major stock market rally.
The market gains have also been fed by improved growth prospects in China and some other major economies and by the view that a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, the United States and China, is nearing a resolution.
Last week, the government reported that the U.S. economy grew at a surprisingly strong 3.2% annual rate in the January-March quarter. It was the best performance for a first quarter in four years, and it far surpassed initial forecasts that annual growth could be as weak as 1% at the start of the year.
If economic prospects were to brighten further, could Fed officials rethink their plans to suspend further rate hikes and perhaps resume tightening credit?
Possibly. But investors don’t seem to think so. According to data tracked by the CME Group, investors foresee zero probability that the Fed will raise rates anytime this year. And in fact, their bets indicate a roughly 60% likelihood that the Fed will cut rates before year’s end.
One factor in that dovish view is that the economy might not be quite as robust as the latest economic figures suggest. The first quarter’s healthy 3.2% annual growth rate was pumped up by some temporary factors — from a surge in restocking of companies’ inventories to a narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit — that are expected to reverse themselves. If so, this would diminish the pace of growth and likely hold down inflation.
Indeed, for all of 2019, growth is expected to total around 2.2%, down from last year’s 2.9% gain, as the effects of the 2017 tax cuts and billions of dollars in increased government spending fade.
At the same time, the Fed is still struggling to produce inflation of roughly 2%. This week, the government reported that the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge rose just 1.5% in March from 12 months earlier. Many analysts say they think the Fed won’t resume raising rates until inflation hits or exceeds its 2% target.
Too-low inflation is seen as an obstacle because it tends to depress consumer spending, the economy’s main fuel, as people delay purchases in anticipation of flat or even lower prices. It also raise the inflation-adjusted cost of a loan.
In the meantime, President Donald Trump has attacked Powell’s leadership as being too restrictive toward rates and has pressed the Fed to cut rates — something few mainstream economists favor.
On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that the U.S. economy has “the potential to go up like a rocket” if the Fed would only slash rates and resume the emergency bond-buying programs it unveiled after the Great Recession to ease long-term loan rates to stimulate spending and growth.
Asked at this news conference about Trump’s attacks, Powell replied that the Fed is a “nonpolitical institution” that doesn’t consider outside criticism in making its policy decisions.
“We don’t think about other factors” beyond how the economy and financial system are faring, Powell said. He said the Fed’s rate-setting panel thinks its rate policies are “in a good place.”

The annual event takes place each year on Yom HaShoah, the day Israel stops to remember the six million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust.
Dozens of Holocaust survivors, some of whom were once imprisoned in the camp, and thousands of other Jews walk from the Auschwitz concentration camp to the Birkenau extermination camp in honor of those who died there.
It is a profound experience for the participants and the first time the US has ever sent an official delegation.
""This is an incredibly powerful experience for me. It is the first time I have ever been to Auschwitz,"" US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman told Israeli radio.

Friedman said the delegation is a symbol of the United States' dedication to fighting anti-Semitism.
""The U.S. government is always ready to do battle against anti-Semitism and those who peddle this vile hatred, wherever it may exist – whether at book fairs in Europe and the Middle East where you can still find copies of the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' and 'Mein Kampf'; online where hate forums still flourish; or with people such as the shooter in Pittsburgh or most recently, the shooter at a Chabad synagogue in Poway, CA, who still seek to perpetrate violent acts against Jewish people merely because of their faith. We won't stop and we won't rest until we can shine the light in these dark corners and root it out forever,"" he said in a statement.
Thousands of students from around the world, including almost 6,000 from the U.S. alone, will also attend.

Avengers: Endgame in some ways resembles a Wagnerian opera with a lot of good and some annoying bad, as well as, several loose plot points and self-referential nods to previous Marvel movies.
The opening is one of the best movie openings in a long time, and the ending is emotionally powerful. In fact, in many ways, the movie expresses the most important rule in filmmaking, which is to touch the audience's emotions with very sad scenes, as well as, very funny scenes, keeping the audience intrigued for much of the movie. That said, some of the false threads should have been cut, and the movie would have been reduced to a much more reasonable, compact, and more compelling time frame.
In the previous Avengers movie, Infinity War , the evil, crazed environmentalist, Thanos, obtained all the ultra-powerful ""Infinity Stones"" and snapped his fingers, killing half of all the sentient creatures in the universe.
(Major spoilers removed. Go to Movieguide.org for full review , spoliers included.)
Plot point after plot point, character arc after character arc, motivation after motivation leads to the final battle. Who will win? Who will die?
Avengers: Endgame has one unified plot with many characters and themes merging into it. In the interest of finding the emotional moment in each scene, some of the plot points are unresolved and some of the storylines are left hanging. At one point in the movie, this gets to be tedious and may be confusing if you haven't seen all the previous Marvel movies up to now. That said, the good outweighs the bad. But, Avengers: Endgame has a lot of foul language, including strong blasphemies, intense action violence, and other immoral content that warrant extreme caution.
On the good side, family is of prime importance in the movie's main storyline. Also, people are respected as equals, and individual life is appreciated. Patriotism, freedom, and free enterprise are portrayed in a strong positive light as in previous movies.
On the negative side, some children are taught to curse. Even Captain America curses, even though it doesn't ring true to his character from previous movies. Avengers: Endgame also contains strong references to witchcraft and a gratuitous, annoying reference to perversity in one scene. Eventually, some important relationships come to naught. Also, it becomes clear that some beloved characters aren't going to appear in the next Marvel movie unless it's in a flashback. Most annoying to one reviewer was the constant nods to political correctness.
Marvel has developed a good formula. They just need a little more attention to detail. Clearly, they love families. So, they should avoid getting edgy and using so much foul language, since it alienates the very people they want to reach.
Some of the reviewers thought Marvel has reached its summit. If so, they're sowing the seeds of alienating the huge audience they've built up in the past 22 movies, not counting the first three Spider-Man movies released by Sony. However, there have been filmmakers and studios that looked like they were peaking, then they self-corrected and went on to greater achievements. Show Guest Bio:"

OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso — A Burkina Faso government spokesman says six people, including a pastor, have been killed in an attack on a Christian church in the country's north.
The violence took place Sunday in the village of Silgadji, not far from the volatile border with Mali.
Urbain Kabore, the communications director for the Sahel region of Burkina Faso, said Monday that the six people were slain after Sunday services.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility though violent Islamic extremism has been increasingly destabilizing the country. A number of jihadist groups are known to operate the area.
Authorities said that in a separate incident in the east of Burkina Faso, five teachers were shot to death Friday.
The Islamic extremists also have targeted foreigners, abducting and killing a Canadian geologist earlier this year.

Today millions of Americans across the country will take part in the National Day of Prayer .
The public prayer day was created in 1952 by a joint resolution of Congress and signed into law by President Harry S. Truman. In 1988, the law was unanimously amended by both the House and the Senate and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on Thursday, May 5, 1988, designating the first Thursday of May as a day of national prayer. Every president since 1952 has signed a National Day of Prayer proclamation.
This year's theme is ""Love One Another,"" taken from the words of Jesus in John 13:34, ""Love one another, just as I have loved you.""
Dr. Ronnie Floyd, president of the task force that mobilizes millions to participate in the of prayer, explained why the theme is key to revival in America.
""It really breaks my heart on where our country is,"" Floyd said in an interview with CBN News. ""We're so divided. We don't show respect for one another. We're not treating people even close to the way Jesus would want to treat people and would want us to treat others. And we need to understand that love is the real Christian badge of discipleship. And even Jesus said there in John 13, he said that by our love will people know that we are disciples of Jesus Christ.""
He went on to share how Christians can practically live out the love theme.
""I believe first of all we exemplify the life of Christ, the character of Christ, we treat people with the highest respect,"" said Floyd. ""I believe that we share God's love wherever we go when God opens the opportunity. We're able to have conversations about the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It's us living out the gospel every day, whether it's in relationship to showing compassion in certain matters, certain areas or certain people. It's churches standing up and being what it needs to be.""
""It's people living out their Christian life wherever they are. Whether they be in politics. Whether they be in media. Whether they be in education. Whether they be in business. It's so important that we live out the gospel in every way, everywhere we go."" he said.
Floyd also shared that spiritual revival is the greatest need in America and the church today.
""I know that government cannot fix us, and politics cannot heal us,"" said Floyd. ""And I also know that it's been decades since the last move of God in a great way across this nation. We're overdue. And the church needs to rise up and pray like never before. Pray like it really matters. Pray like we really believe God. And let's trust the Lord for the next great spiritual awakening in the United States. That's what the greatest need is in America today.""
He said he hopes for the day when prayer for America becomes more than a once a year ritual saying, ""I really want us to build a conscientious commitment that everyday needs to be a day when we pray for America in some capacity.""
He added, ""Also to instill faith again in America that God still works, and faith in God that God is able to overcome any obstacle this nation faces and any obstacle that we face.""
""And then also that we might be able to take what happens in prayer gatherings and observances by the thousands upon thousands and thousands on this National Day of Prayer, we are able to literally see a 'love one another' movement literally race across this country and that soon we will be able to experience the next great move of the Lord Jesus Christ in this nation,"" he said.

President Trump Calls on Americans to Use the 'Power of Prayer' to End Violence and Protect Religious Liberty - CBN News,www1.cbn.com,,05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/president-trump-calls-on-americans-to-use-the-power-of-prayer-to-end-violence-and-protect-religious-liberty,"Homepage US News CBNNews.com President Trump Calls on Americans to Use the 'Power of Prayer' to End Violence and Protect Religious Liberty 05-01-2019 John Jessup President Donald Trump greets guests at the annual White House National Day of Prayer Dinner Wednesday night. (Image credit: John Jessup: CBN News)
WASHINGTON – About one hundred people – religious leaders, Trump administration officials, and their guests – celebrated the ""power of prayer"" at the White House Wednesday night ahead of the day set aside annually for Americans of all faiths to pray for thanks and guidance.
""America will be a nation that believes forever, and we certainly believe – more than anyone – the power of prayer,"" President Donald J. Trump declared in the State Dining Room before continuing with an unscripted flourish: ""It's the most powerful thing there is.""
In his opening remarks preceding the National Day of Prayer, the president welcomed representatives of various faiths, including Christians, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, and Hindus.
""Tonight we break bread together united by our love of God, and we renew our resolve to protect the sacred freedom of religion – all of us,"" he said.
The president also acknowledged the recent religiously-motivated attacks both in the United States and abroad.
""All of us in this room send our love and prayers to the Jewish Americans wounded at the Chabad of Poway shooting in California,"" he said. ""And our hearts break for the life of Laurie Gilbert-Kaye who was so wickedly taken from us.""
""We mourn for the Christians murdered in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday and grieve for the Muslims murdered at their mosques in New Zealand,"" he added. ""Here at home, we also remember the three historically black churches burned recently in Louisiana and the horrific shooting last year at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.""
The roomful of staff and supporters of Trump's religious liberty policies applauded when he called for an end to violence and terrorism against people of all faiths.
Many well-known evangelical Christian leaders attended the White House dinner. They were perhaps his most enthusiastic supporters, greeting the president warmly as he and First Lady Melania Trump entered the room hand-in-hand. Some of them included Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, James and Shirley Dobson, Jentzen Franklin, Jerry Falwell, Jr., Franklin Graham, Mike Huckabee, Robert Jeffress, Alveda King, Johnnie Moore, Ralph Reed, and Paula White.
Saluting their approval of his record, he referenced what many of them acknowledge originally motivated their support for his candidacy.
""I'm thrilled to report that tomorrow the Senate will confirm the 100th federal judge through the court system,"" he announced. ""Under my administration, we're getting to a level where we're going to be breaking records with respect to the judiciary, which means a lot to the people in this room who were treated very poorly. With time you'll see what happens.""
The president offered his own report card, citing the confirmation of 145 federal judges and two Supreme Court justices.
Wednesday's event is the kick off to the National Day of Prayer, which lands on the first Thursday of May each year according to a law passed by Congress in 1988.
Last week, Mr. Trump issued a presidential proclamation in honor of the event, writing: ""On this National Day of Prayer, Americans once again come together to give thanks to Almighty God for the bountiful blessings He has bestowed on our great Nation and ask for His unfailing counsel. We acknowledge our dependence on God's love to guide our families, communities, and our country away from harm and toward abundance and peace.""
""Our Nation's honored tradition of prayer has sustained us and strengthened our trust that God will continue to watch over and accompany us through the best of times and the darkest hours. May we as Americans never forget the power of prayer and the greatness of our Creator. On this National Day of Prayer, let each of us, according to our own faiths, call upon God for His guidance and express our gratitude for the love and grace He bestows on our country,"" the proclamation read."
Israel Stops to Remember the Heroes and Martyrs of the Holocaust,www1.cbn.com,,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/israel-stops-to-remember-the-heroes-and-martyrs-of-the-holocaust,"Israel Stops to Remember the Heroes and Martyrs of the Holocaust 05-02-2019
JERUSALEM, Israel –Sirens blared as Israel came to a halt for two minutes Thursday to honor the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust on Holocaust Memorial Day.
The entire nation united with a heart of grief.
“It’s our first time being here during the Holocaust memorial and it was very powerful. It was something that we’ve never seen and that everyone groups together as a country, which was pretty amazing,” Robert Dunn from Philadelphia told CBN News.
Even young people took a moment to honor the victims.
Two brothers from California said they didn’t study the Holocaust in school but knew what it was about.
“We freeze. Because we remember the Jews that were in the war that died so it doesn’t happen again,” Benjamin Weiss, 6, said.
“My dad just told me about it and also I think of my great grandmother Bubbe Ida, who survived the Holocaust,” Aviv Weiss, 8, added.
Events began the previous night when the Israeli flag was lowered to half-mast at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Reuven Rivlin addressed the opening ceremony of Yom HaShoah – Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Day. Both spoke about growing anti-Semitism and the need to fight it.
.""We live today in a paradox, the worldwide admiration for the Jewish State is accompanied in certain circles with the rise of hatred of Jews,” Netanyahu said. “The radical right, radical left and radical Islamic groups agree only on one thing: hatred of Jews…. This is not a legitimate criticism of Israel… but a systematic, poisonous and shallow hatred that constantly undermines the legitimacy of the Jewish nation-state and only the Jewish nation-state.""
Rivlin agreed.
""Political forces where anti-Semitism and racism are part of their language, their legacy or their ideology can never be our allies….there is no such thing as loving Israel and hating Jews, just like there is no such thing as loving Jews and hating Israel.""
Israel remembers the holocaust every year according to the Hebrew calendar on the anniversary of the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto uprising.
Though the Jewish fighters were almost all killed, it marked a shift in thinking. Later, it helped shape Israel’s national identity symbolizing the struggle for survival against impossible odds."
Barr Says 'No' to House Dem's Testimony Request After Bruising Senate Showdown,www1.cbn.com,,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/may/barr-says-no-to-house-dems-testimony-request-after-bruising-senate-showdown,"Barr Says 'No' to House Dem's Testimony Request After Bruising Senate Showdown 05-02-2019
WASHINGTON - Attorney General William Barr pulled the plug on Thursday's testimony before the House Judiciary Committee.
""He is terrified of having to face a skilled attorney,"" Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) told reporters.
But the Justice Department says that's not the case. It objects to committee Democrats' 'unprecedented' decision to have Barr take questions from congressional lawyers, not just members of Congress.
Congressman Steve Cohen (D-Tenn) arrived at Thursday's hearing with a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, an apparent jab at Barr.
Barr's refusal to appear before the House Committee comes just one day after a contentious, five-hour, back and forth with Senate Democrats.
Much of the debate, centered on a letter from Special Counsel Robert Mueller to Barr criticizing aspects of his four-page summary of Mueller's principal conclusions in the Russia investigation.
In it Mueller writes, ""The summary letter the department sent to Congress and released to the public...did not fully capture the context, nature and substance of this office's work and conclusions.""
According to Barr, Mueller made it clear to him he did not think Barr's summary misled the American people.
""He said his concern focused on his explanation of why he did not reach a conclusion on obstruction. And he wanted more put out on that issue,"" Barr testified.
""But he was very clear with me that he was not suggesting that we had misrepresented his report,"" he went on to say.
""The letter is a bit snitty, I think it was probably written by one of his staff people,"" Barr said later.
Barr went on to criticize the fact that the special counsel did not make a decision when it came to obstruction of justice, another focal point of Thursday's hearing.
""If he felt that he shouldn't go down the path of making a traditional prosecutive decision, then he shouldn't have investigated,"" Barr said.
Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) used the hearing to question the origins of the entire investigation.
""We know that the person in charge of investigating hated Trump's guts. These are the people that made a decision that Clinton didn't do anything wrong and that counter-intelligence investigation of the Trump campaign was warranted,"" Graham said.
When it comes to collusion, obstruction and a future testimony from Robert Mueller: Graham says no more.
""I'm not going to do anymore, enough already. It's over,"" Graham told reporters.
But it may not be over for Barr. Several Democrats, including many presidential candidates, are calling for him to step down.
""America deserves better. You should resign,"" said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI),
""I think he's lost the confidence of the American people, I think he should (resign),"" said former Vice President Joe Biden.
President Trump, however, is standing by the attorney general. ""I heard he was - he really performed incredibly well today,"" Trump told Fox Business.
The House Judiciary is still holding Thursday's hearing, without Barr. And the legal battle over releasing the full Mueller report and its underlying evidence could lead to a vote to hold the attorney general in contempt."
Attorneys for Covington Catholic Student Sandmann Sue NBC Universal for $275M for Defamation,www1.cbn.com,,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/attorneys-for-covington-catholic-student-sandmann-sue-nbc-universal-for-275m-for-defamation,"Attorneys for Covington Catholic Student Sandmann Sue NBC Universal for $275M for Defamation 05-02-2019 Catholic student Nick Sandmann being confronted by Native American elder (Photo: Screen capture from video)
Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann's attorney is suing NBC Universal for $275 million.
Sandmann is the teenager who found himself at the center of controversy after attending a March for Life event in January.
Video of him standing face-to-face with a Native American man went viral. Reports went out that he and other schoolmates were mocking the Native Americans at rallies that day, and that he had blocked a Native American activist from walking to the Lincoln Memorial.
Sandmann and a few other boys were wearing ""Make America Great Again"" hats, and some media critics have accused the major news outlets of assuming the boys were racists because of their MAGA hats.
Sandmann's lawyer says the NBC Universal media corporation ""created a false narrative by portraying the alleged 'confrontation' as a 'hate crime' committed by Nicholas.""
""Today, @LLinWood and I filed a $275,000,000 lawsuit against NBCUniversal on behalf of Nicholas Sandmann. The facts of the suit show the anti-Trump narrative NBC pushed so hard,"" attorney Todd V. McMurtry posted on Twitter. Today, @LLinWood and I filed a $275,000,000 lawsuit against NBCUniversal on behalf of Nicholas Sandmann. The facts of the suit show the anti-Trump narrative NBC pushed so hard. Here is a link if you wish to read it: https://t.co/X6v4HBqxXk pic.twitter.com/jcRTnWh5hl
— Todd V. McMurtry (@ToddMcMurtry) May 1, 2019
The case says NBC made ""false and defamatory accusations"" against the teenager, stating: Plaintiff Nicholas Sandmann (""Nicholas""), a minor, the 16-year old student who stood quietly for several minutes after being unexpectedly confronted without explanation by Nathan Phillips (""Phillips""), a Native American activist, who beat a drum and sang loudly within inches of his face on January 18, 2019, at the Lincoln Memorial (the ""January 18 incident"").
The lawsuit later states: NBCUniversal's attacks on Nicholas included at least fifteen (15) defamatory television broadcasts, six (6) defamatory online articles, and many tweets falsely accusing Nicholas and his Covington Catholic High School (""CovCath"") classmates of racists acts... NBCUniversal created a false narrative by portraying the ""confrontation"" as a ""hate crime"" committed by Nicholas.
It continues: NBCUniversal created panels on its talk shows to frame the January 18 incident as one involving a ""hate crime"" and demonstrating ""white supremacy"" as a result of ""whites"" being ""emboldened"" by President Trump's presence in the White House and repeated these premises over and over, while continuously showing a carefully selected few seconds from the heavily edited videos that omitted the entire context of the incident.
Sandmann's attorneys have already filed defamation lawsuits against CNN and the Washington Post as well.
After the wall-to-wall media coverage, Sandmann and other students at Covington faced violent threats that escalated to the point where their school had to be closed down for security reasons."

The reappearance of ISIS leader Abu-Bakr Al-Baghdadi suggests the Islamic State group has survived the war in Syria. In a new video, the ISIS leader talks about the Easter attacks in Sri Lanka.
All of this has brought renewed pain to some of the parents of children who have joined ISIS. On the CBN News program ""The Global Lane"" Christianne Boudreau shared the story of how her 21-year-old son left Canada and died fighting with ISIS. She said her faith has helped her overcome the heartache.
""I still have some of those difficult days, trust me if never goes away--especially wondering what those last moments were, not being there as a parent trying to protect them, save them, feeling so helpless,"" Boudreau explained. ""For so long, no matter how much I begged him to come home, it was absolutely devastating and nowhere to turn. Who could understand what I was going through without the name calling and all the negative comments and understanding what pain our family was in?""
Did Boudreau beat herself up wondering how she could have prevented this? Did she question her parenting skills?
""I think every parent does. We all question ourselves. It's the first thing we do is we go within ourselves. And the guilt you carry is overwhelming,"" she painfully recalled. Although her son Damien left church at the age of 17 and converted to Islam, Boudreau says her Christian faith helped her get through the dark times that followed.
""It's the only thing that I could hang on to. What else do you have? I lost another son in 2001 and almost lost my faith at that time and in the end I only came through because of it,"" she said. ""You try to find something to hang on to even though that anger is there, you still need to have that strength to keep pulling you through to wake you up in the morning, to find a new purpose and a new goal in life.""
Boudreau heads up an organization called Mothers for Life Network . The group is helping people overcome loss and grief and it's also raising awareness about how to prevent children from becoming radicalized. She's also featured in the new Clarion Project documentary. ""Kids Chasing Paradise.""

President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence hosted a Rose Garden ceremony for the National Day of Prayer Thursday morning, and the president spoke about the power of prayer while also announcing practical steps to protect religious freedom.
""Our Nation's honored tradition of prayer has sustained us and strengthened our trust that God will continue to watch over and accompany us through the best of times and the darkest hours. May we as Americans never forget the power of prayer and the greatness of our Creator,"" Trump declared in his day of prayer proclamation .
The president made news by announcing new conscience protections for religious health care providers so that they're not forced to violate their religious beliefs about abortion.
""Just today we finalized new protections of conscience rights for physicians, pharmacists, nurses, teachers, students and faith-based charities,"" Trump said. Watch that announcement BELOW :
""Every citizen has the absolute right to live according to the teachings of their faith and the convictions of their heart. This is the bedrock of American life. To protect this heritage my Administration has strongly defended religious liberty,"" he said.
And he cited other important faith-based actions he's taken, like working to liberate preachers from the IRS threats they've faced because of the Johnson Amendment, which bans non-profits like churches and ministries from supporting or opposing political candidates.
He further explained his support for religious freedom in his proclamation, saying, ""Our Nation acknowledges that religious liberty is a natural right, given to us by our Creator, not a courtesy that government extends to us. The First Amendment recognizes the freedom of religion and safeguards this right against government infringement.""
The president went on to cite the success of prison reform efforts, and then turned to a real-life example of the power of faith helping fight the drug crisis in America. He called up a recovering opioid addict named Ashley Evans, who briefly shared how faith has restored her life.
""Finding God saved my life. It's been incredible,"" Ashley said. ""It's been a journey, but without Him, I could not do this... God has been with me every step of the way and everything has worked out.""
She said it's only ""by the grace of God"" that she's now free. And she also thanked her behavioral health worker Angie Dennis whom Trump called up to the podium as well. Angie explained she helped Ashley by sharing with her, ""The biggest honor I could have was to pass along to Ashley that it's a relationship with Jesus, it's not a religion or a bunch of rules. It's just that personal relationship. And if you trust Him and do your part, then trust Him and ask for help for the rest. He'll open doors that no one can close.""
As he thanked them for sharing their story, Trump declared, ""Prayer works miracles and prayer saves lives.""
The president went on to cite the verse from Isaiah 40:31, that those who hope in the Lord will ""run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint."" He said that's how he and Vice President Pence have survived two tough years so far in the White House.
""Today we pray for America,"" Pence said in some prepared remarks . ""And as we pray, let's pray with confidence, as was inscribed in those ancient words millennia ago, that if His people, who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, that He'll do like He's always done through the long and storied history of this nation: He'll hear from Heaven and He'll heal this land, this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""
In closing, President Trump said, ""We once again place our hopes in the hands of our Creator.""
Later, Pastor Paula White prayed the closing prayer, speaking God's word over President Trump, citing Psalm 139:16 that God has ordained every one of his days. She also declared the White House to be holy ground and launched into spiritual warfare, asking God to watch over the president and his family."
"Muslim Tells Christians: 'We Tried Warning You,' It's Time to 'Wake Up' about Threat of Radical Islam",www1.cbn.com,,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/may/muslim-tells-christians-we-tried-warning-you-its-time-to-wake-up-about-threat-of-radical-islam,"Muslim author Mohammad Tawhidi shares with CBN News' Sr. International Correspondent George Thomas how America can fight against the threat of radical Islam.
As Sri Lankan authorities worry about the potential of more suicide attacks by the group behind the Easter Sunday bombings, one Muslim activist is issuing an urgent warning to Christians around the world about the growing and very real threat of radical Islam.
""If Christians don't wake up, if Christians leaders don't wake up, then we Muslims who fled from extremists can't help you anymore,"" said Mohammad Tawhidi , a Muslim author from Australia. ""We tried warning you.""
Tawhidi, a third-generation Iranian-born Muslim and author of The Tragedy of Islam , says political correctness is allowing radical Muslims with their dangerous and deadly ideology, to flourish.
""When we come to the West and try to warn the governments and intelligence agencies about what is happening, about the people we fled from, we have this new political correctness agenda that tells us that 'oh, we are the racists, we are the ones who are traitors and the extremists need to be understood and embraced'.""
Tawhidi says even though the Islamic terror group ISIS lost its territory in Syria and Iraq, the group's followers and sympathizers are still actively planning mayhem.
""We are fighting a real caliphate, not a so-called caliphate, this is the true extremist Islamist militant ideology that is taking over our lands and our countries,"" Tawhidi warned.
This week, a German newspaper published an exhaustive study of all Islamic terror attacks around the world since the September 11, 2001, strikes on America.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt Islamic extremists have carried out 31,211 attacks in the last 18 years.
Those attacks have killed 146,811 people around the world. Most of the victims have been Muslims.
The newspaper analyzed all the information gathered by the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland to come up with the number of attacks and lives lost.
The list concludes with the recent attacks in Sri Lanka that killed at least 253 people and injured more than 500 when suicide bombers targeted churches and hotels on the island nation.
Tawhidi, who describes himself on his website as ""Muslim scholar, thinker and educator,"" says he's on a mission to tackle the ""spread of Islamic extremism"" and believes the key is to reform Muslim societies and their mindset.
""Look, I'm a Muslim, but I cannot live in an Islamist theocracy,"" Tawhidi told CBN News . ""I can live in a Christian government, based on their constitution, because that is where peace lies. I cannot live in a place where ISIS rules the area.""
""No Muslim with a brain that works would want to live under ISIS,"" Tawhidi added.

""We know that the person in charge of investigating hated Trump's guts. These are the people that made a decision that Clinton didn't do anything wrong and that counter-intelligence investigation of the Trump campaign was warranted,"" Graham said.
When it comes to collusion, obstruction and a future testimony from Robert Mueller: Graham says no more.
""I'm not going to do anymore, enough already. It's over,"" Graham told reporters.
But it may not be over for Barr. Several Democrats, including many presidential candidates, are calling for him to step down.
""America deserves better. You should resign,"" said Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI),
""I think he's lost the confidence of the American people, I think he should (resign),"" said former Vice President Joe Biden.
President Trump, however, is standing by the attorney general. ""I heard he was - he really performed incredibly well today,"" Trump told Fox Business.
The House Judiciary is still holding Thursday's hearing, without Barr. And the legal battle over releasing the full Mueller report and its underlying evidence could lead to a vote to hold the attorney general in contempt."
'Pray Like It Really Matters': Dr. Ronnie Floyd's Urgent Message on the National Day of Prayer,www.cbn.com,Charlene Aaron,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/pray-like-it-really-matters-dr-ronnie-floyds-urgent-message-on-the-national-day-of-prayer,"Today millions of Americans across the country will take part in the National Day of Prayer .
The public prayer day was created in 1952 by a joint resolution of Congress and signed into law by President Harry S. Truman. In 1988, the law was unanimously amended by both the House and the Senate and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan on Thursday, May 5, 1988, designating the first Thursday of May as a day of national prayer. Every president since 1952 has signed a National Day of Prayer proclamation.
This year's theme is ""Love One Another,"" taken from the words of Jesus in John 13:34, ""Love one another, just as I have loved you.""
Dr. Ronnie Floyd, president of the task force that mobilizes millions to participate in the of prayer, explained why the theme is key to revival in America.
""It really breaks my heart on where our country is,"" Floyd said in an interview with CBN News. ""We're so divided. We don't show respect for one another. We're not treating people even close to the way Jesus would want to treat people and would want us to treat others. And we need to understand that love is the real Christian badge of discipleship. And even Jesus said there in John 13, he said that by our love will people know that we are disciples of Jesus Christ.""
He went on to share how Christians can practically live out the love theme.
""I believe first of all we exemplify the life of Christ, the character of Christ, we treat people with the highest respect,"" said Floyd. ""I believe that we share God's love wherever we go when God opens the opportunity. We're able to have conversations about the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It's us living out the gospel every day, whether it's in relationship to showing compassion in certain matters, certain areas or certain people. It's churches standing up and being what it needs to be.""
""It's people living out their Christian life wherever they are. Whether they be in politics. Whether they be in media. Whether they be in education. Whether they be in business. It's so important that we live out the gospel in every way, everywhere we go."" he said.
Floyd also shared that spiritual revival is the greatest need in America and the church today.
""I know that government cannot fix us, and politics cannot heal us,"" said Floyd. ""And I also know that it's been decades since the last move of God in a great way across this nation. We're overdue. And the church needs to rise up and pray like never before. Pray like it really matters. Pray like we really believe God. And let's trust the Lord for the next great spiritual awakening in the United States. That's what the greatest need is in America today.""
He said he hopes for the day when prayer for America becomes more than a once a year ritual saying, ""I really want us to build a conscientious commitment that everyday needs to be a day when we pray for America in some capacity.""
He added, ""Also to instill faith again in America that God still works, and faith in God that God is able to overcome any obstacle this nation faces and any obstacle that we face.""
""And then also that we might be able to take what happens in prayer gatherings and observances by the thousands upon thousands and thousands on this National Day of Prayer, we are able to literally see a 'love one another' movement literally race across this country and that soon we will be able to experience the next great move of the Lord Jesus Christ in this nation,"" he said.

Attorneys for Covington Catholic Student Sandmann Sue NBC Universal for $275M for Defamation,www.cbn.com,Talia Wise,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/attorneys-for-covington-catholic-student-sandmann-sue-nbc-universal-for-275m-for-defamation,"Covington Catholic High School student Nicholas Sandmann's attorney is suing NBC Universal for $275 million.
Sandmann is the teenager who found himself at the center of controversy after attending a March for Life event in January.
Video of him standing face-to-face with a Native American man went viral. Reports went out that he and other schoolmates were mocking the Native Americans at rallies that day, and that he had blocked a Native American activist from walking to the Lincoln Memorial.
Sandmann and a few other boys were wearing ""Make America Great Again"" hats, and some media critics have accused the major news outlets of assuming the boys were racists because of their MAGA hats.
Sandmann's lawyer says the NBC Universal media corporation ""created a false narrative by portraying the alleged 'confrontation' as a 'hate crime' committed by Nicholas.""
""Today, @LLinWood and I filed a $275,000,000 lawsuit against NBCUniversal on behalf of Nicholas Sandmann. The facts of the suit show the anti-Trump narrative NBC pushed so hard,"" attorney Todd V. McMurtry posted on Twitter.

— Todd V. McMurtry (@ToddMcMurtry) May 1, 2019
The case says NBC made ""false and defamatory accusations"" against the teenager, stating:
Plaintiff Nicholas Sandmann (""Nicholas""), a minor, the 16-year old student who stood quietly for several minutes after being unexpectedly confronted without explanation by Nathan Phillips (""Phillips""), a Native American activist, who beat a drum and sang loudly within inches of his face on January 18, 2019, at the Lincoln Memorial (the ""January 18 incident"").
The lawsuit later states:
NBCUniversal's attacks on Nicholas included at least fifteen (15) defamatory television broadcasts, six (6) defamatory online articles, and many tweets falsely accusing Nicholas and his Covington Catholic High School (""CovCath"") classmates of racists acts... NBCUniversal created a false narrative by portraying the ""confrontation"" as a ""hate crime"" committed by Nicholas.
It continues:
NBCUniversal created panels on its talk shows to frame the January 18 incident as one involving a ""hate crime"" and demonstrating ""white supremacy"" as a result of ""whites"" being ""emboldened"" by President Trump's presence in the White House and repeated these premises over and over, while continuously showing a carefully selected few seconds from the heavily edited videos that omitted the entire context of the incident.
Sandmann's attorneys have already filed defamation lawsuits against CNN and the Washington Post as well.
After the wall-to-wall media coverage, Sandmann and other students at Covington faced violent threats that escalated to the point where their school had to be closed down for security reasons."
'I Was Praying for the Disarming of the Spirits of Murder': UNC Charlotte Students Prayed as Active Shooter Opened Fire,www.cbn.com,Talia Wise,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/i-was-praying-for-the-disarming-of-the-spirits-of-murder-unc-charlotte-students-prayed-as-active-shooter-opened-fire,"Thousands gathered on the campus of UNC Charlotte Wednesday evening to honor the victims of a shooting that took the lives of two students and injured four others.
It was the final day of classes when 22-year-old Trystan Terrel opened fire in an anthropology class.
Students rushed out from classes shouting ""active shooter"" and sought to take cover.
UNCC freshman Rebecca Ince hid for nearly an hour and while in hiding she prayed for the other students and staff on campus.
""I was praying for the disarming of the spirits of murder and just pleading the blood of Jesus over our campus,"" she told CBN News.
Moments before hiding, Rebecca was studying in Atkins library, located just 500 feet from the building where the shooting was taking place. She saw a massive stampede and heard people shouting.
""I heard 'get out of here. There's a live shooter on campus. He's in Kennedy, don't go in Kennedy. He's wearing black you got to get out of here',"" she explained.
Students were describing Terrel who is a former student at the college. According to reports, he sat down in the lecture for 10 minutes before opening fire. Police have not explained a motive, but believe it was no accident that he chose that particular location.
As Rebecca tried to find a safe place to hide she saw squad cars and helicopters arrive on the campus. She ended up in the student union with eight other girls.
""We put chairs, cases of water bottles, heavy binders, boxes, just anything that could either buy us time that would ultimately cease someone from entering,"" she explained.
She and the eight other girls decided to pray together. Rebecca said she felt the tangible presence of God.
""We were pleading the blood of Jesus over the place, I was praying scripture and saying, 'Lord, we know that you are a wall of fire around us and the Glory that is in our midst'. Everyone was saying amen and coming into agreement, which I think had a lot to do with how thick the presence of God was in there,"" she explained.
Rebecca said it was the grace of God that kept her alive and that the Holy Spirit specifically ordered her steps that day. She said she was going to go home after her lectures but believes He had on to stay on campus.
""Down to the shoes that I wore and the lunch that I ate the Holy Spirit played a part in everything,"" she said.
She said she was planning to wear slip-on heels that morning, but said God told her to wear sneakers.
""I had no idea why, but I don't know how I would have ran or got where I needed to be if I had not wore the New Balances,"" she said.
Although Rebecca and other students were safe when she heard the news that two students died she grappled with doubt.
""I didn't understand. God, hadn't I prayed? Hadn't I had faith? He reminded me of His sovereignty and my friends understood the same in my group chat. They prayed earnestly and were so comforting and supportive,"" she wrote on Twitter.
my condolences go out to the victims families. I want you to know what the Lord is close to the broken-hearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit. you are not alone. I am praying for your healing and comfort. #uncc #unccstrong

Those are the types of questions and emotions that many students on campus are dealing with.
""You never expect it to happen and then it does and you just don't know how to handle those emotions,"" student Maria Juan told ABC News.
21-year-old Riley Howell is being hailed as a hero. Police say he gave his life tackling the shooter to the ground.
""Riley Howell was my classmate and friend and I do not want his courageous act to protect all the students in that classroom and among the rest of the university to go unnoticed,"" student David Belnap told ABC News.
The vigil honoring him and a second victim was filled to max capacity Wednesday night.
Terrel is being charged with two counts of murder, four counts of attempted murder, four counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, among other charges."
'I See a Bad Future Ahead': Bloodshed in Venezuela as Maduro's Forces Open Fire to Stop the Uprising,www.cbn.com,George Thomas *,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/may/i-see-a-bad-future-ahead-bloodshed-in-venezuela-as-maduros-forces-open-fire-to-stop-the-uprising,"Tensions are still high in Venezuela after violent protests turned deadly this week. A Venezuelan human rights group claims four people died in street clashes this week after the opposition leader Juan Guaido called for a military uprising.
Thursday was relatively calm in the Venezuelan capital city Caracas as government forces were out in full force trying to stabilize the country after a violent 48 hours.
Residents are back on the streets trying to resume life under very difficult circumstances.
Caracas resident Ana Morales said, ""I see a bad future ahead if we continue in the situation that we are living, if things do not change, I do not believe they will. Because how are we going to live like this with this situation? Our salaries are not enough. We have problems, we do not even have appliances. If something breaks there is no way to get something new, everything is too expensive.""
Several days ago, the head of Venezuela's secret police did write a letter saying he was no longer supporting dictator Nicolas Maduro, but it doesn't appear to have shaken the dictator's support from other officials.
Wednesday, police forces loyal to the socialist dictator fired buckshot at protesters who had heeded Guaido's call to take to the streets. A 27-year-old woman was reportedly shot in the head and at least 46 people injured when pro- and anti-government supporters clashed in a suburb of Caracas.
Guaido urged members of the military on Tuesday to revolt against Maduro hoping high-ranking military officers would defect and shake the leader's grip on power. It didn't happen.
In a show of defiance, Maduro, flanked by members of the national Bolivarian armed forces, paraded along an army base in Caracas early this morning. He praised them for their loyalty and vowed to punish those who tried to overthrow his government.
Maduro, who has the backing of Russia and China, has refused to step down following months of demonstrations and pressure from the United States and more than 60 countries.
Meanwhile, Cuba, which reportedly has 20,000 troops and agents in Venezuela propping up Maduro's government, held a rally in Havana in support of the dictator.
All this coming as Washington decides what to do next. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said US military action is possible in Venezuela to help opposition leader Juan Guaido unseat Maduro.
Guaido is urging his supporters to remain in the streets. He's calling for public employees to go on strike tomorrow."
"A Christian Mom's Worst Nightmare: Her Son Converted to Islam and Died for ISIS, Now She's on a Mission",www.cbn.com,Gary Lane,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/may/a-christian-moms-worst-nightmare-her-son-converted-to-islam-and-died-for-isis-now-shes-on-a-mission,"The reappearance of ISIS leader Abu-Bakr Al-Baghdadi suggests the Islamic State group has survived the war in Syria. In a new video, the ISIS leader talks about the Easter attacks in Sri Lanka.
All of this has brought renewed pain to some of the parents of children who have joined ISIS.
On the CBN News program ""The Global Lane"" Christianne Boudreau shared the story of how her 21-year-old son left Canada and died fighting with ISIS. She said her faith has helped her overcome the heartache.
""I still have some of those difficult days, trust me if never goes away--especially wondering what those last moments were, not being there as a parent trying to protect them, save them, feeling so helpless,"" Boudreau explained. ""For so long, no matter how much I begged him to come home, it was absolutely devastating and nowhere to turn. Who could understand what I was going through without the name calling and all the negative comments and understanding what pain our family was in?""
Did Boudreau beat herself up wondering how she could have prevented this? Did she question her parenting skills?
""I think every parent does. We all question ourselves. It's the first thing we do is we go within ourselves. And the guilt you carry is overwhelming,"" she painfully recalled.
Although her son Damien left church at the age of 17 and converted to Islam, Boudreau says her Christian faith helped her get through the dark times that followed.
""It's the only thing that I could hang on to. What else do you have? I lost another son in 2001 and almost lost my faith at that time and in the end I only came through because of it,"" she said. ""You try to find something to hang on to even though that anger is there, you still need to have that strength to keep pulling you through to wake you up in the morning, to find a new purpose and a new goal in life.""
Boudreau heads up an organization called Mothers for Life Network . The group is helping people overcome loss and grief and it's also raising awareness about how to prevent children from becoming radicalized. She's also featured in the new Clarion Project documentary. ""Kids Chasing Paradise.""

President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence hosted a Rose Garden ceremony for the National Day of Prayer Thursday morning, and the president spoke about the power of prayer while also announcing practical steps to protect religious freedom.
""Our Nation's honored tradition of prayer has sustained us and strengthened our trust that God will continue to watch over and accompany us through the best of times and the darkest hours. May we as Americans never forget the power of prayer and the greatness of our Creator,"" Trump declared in his day of prayer proclamation .
The president made news by announcing new conscience protections for religious health care providers so that they're not forced to violate their religious beliefs about abortion.
""Just today we finalized new protections of conscience rights for physicians, pharmacists, nurses, teachers, students and faith-based charities,"" Trump said. Watch that announcement BELOW :
""Every citizen has the absolute right to live according to the teachings of their faith and the convictions of their heart. This is the bedrock of American life. To protect this heritage my Administration has strongly defended religious liberty,"" he said.
And he cited other important faith-based actions he's taken, like working to liberate preachers from the IRS threats they've faced because of the Johnson Amendment, which bans non-profits like churches and ministries from supporting or opposing political candidates.
He further explained his support for religious freedom in his proclamation, saying, ""Our Nation acknowledges that religious liberty is a natural right, given to us by our Creator, not a courtesy that government extends to us. The First Amendment recognizes the freedom of religion and safeguards this right against government infringement.""
The president went on to cite the success of prison reform efforts, and then turned to a real-life example of the power of faith helping fight the drug crisis in America. He called up a recovering opioid addict named Ashley Evans, who briefly shared how faith has restored her life.
""Finding God saved my life. It's been incredible,"" Ashley said. ""It's been a journey, but without Him, I could not do this... God has been with me every step of the way and everything has worked out.""
She said it's only ""by the grace of God"" that she's now free. And she also thanked her behavioral health worker Angie Dennis whom Trump called up to the podium as well. Angie explained she helped Ashley by sharing with her, ""The biggest honor I could have was to pass along to Ashley that it's a relationship with Jesus, it's not a religion or a bunch of rules. It's just that personal relationship. And if you trust Him and do your part, then trust Him and ask for help for the rest. He'll open doors that no one can close.""
As he thanked them for sharing their story, Trump declared, ""Prayer works miracles and prayer saves lives.""
The president went on to cite the verse from Isaiah 40:31, that those who hope in the Lord will ""run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint."" He said that's how he and Vice President Pence have survived two tough years so far in the White House.
""Today we pray for America,"" Pence said in some prepared remarks . ""And as we pray, let's pray with confidence, as was inscribed in those ancient words millennia ago, that if His people, who are called by His name will humble themselves and pray, that He'll do like He's always done through the long and storied history of this nation: He'll hear from Heaven and He'll heal this land, this one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.""
In closing, President Trump said, ""We once again place our hopes in the hands of our Creator.""
Later, Pastor Paula White prayed the closing prayer, speaking God's word over President Trump, citing Psalm 139:16 that God has ordained every one of his days. She also declared the White House to be holy ground and launched into spiritual warfare, asking God to watch over the president and his family."
"Muslim Tells Christians: 'We Tried Warning You,' It's Time to 'Wake Up' about Threat of Radical Islam",www.cbn.com,George Thomas *,05-02-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/world/2019/may/muslim-tells-christians-we-tried-warning-you-its-time-to-wake-up-about-threat-of-radical-islam,"Muslim author Mohammad Tawhidi shares with CBN News' Sr. International Correspondent George Thomas how America can fight against the threat of radical Islam.
As Sri Lankan authorities worry about the potential of more suicide attacks by the group behind the Easter Sunday bombings, one Muslim activist is issuing an urgent warning to Christians around the world about the growing and very real threat of radical Islam.
""If Christians don't wake up, if Christians leaders don't wake up, then we Muslims who fled from extremists can't help you anymore,"" said Mohammad Tawhidi , a Muslim author from Australia. ""We tried warning you.""
Tawhidi, a third-generation Iranian-born Muslim and author of The Tragedy of Islam , says political correctness is allowing radical Muslims with their dangerous and deadly ideology, to flourish.
""When we come to the West and try to warn the governments and intelligence agencies about what is happening, about the people we fled from, we have this new political correctness agenda that tells us that 'oh, we are the racists, we are the ones who are traitors and the extremists need to be understood and embraced'.""
Tawhidi says even though the Islamic terror group ISIS lost its territory in Syria and Iraq, the group's followers and sympathizers are still actively planning mayhem.
""We are fighting a real caliphate, not a so-called caliphate, this is the true extremist Islamist militant ideology that is taking over our lands and our countries,"" Tawhidi warned.
This week, a German newspaper published an exhaustive study of all Islamic terror attacks around the world since the September 11, 2001, strikes on America.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt Islamic extremists have carried out 31,211 attacks in the last 18 years.
Those attacks have killed 146,811 people around the world. Most of the victims have been Muslims.
The newspaper analyzed all the information gathered by the Global Terrorism Database at the University of Maryland to come up with the number of attacks and lives lost.
The list concludes with the recent attacks in Sri Lanka that killed at least 253 people and injured more than 500 when suicide bombers targeted churches and hotels on the island nation.
Tawhidi, who describes himself on his website as ""Muslim scholar, thinker and educator,"" says he's on a mission to tackle the ""spread of Islamic extremism"" and believes the key is to reform Muslim societies and their mindset.
""Look, I'm a Muslim, but I cannot live in an Islamist theocracy,"" Tawhidi told CBN News . ""I can live in a Christian government, based on their constitution, because that is where peace lies. I cannot live in a place where ISIS rules the area.""
""No Muslim with a brain that works would want to live under ISIS,"" Tawhidi added.

Beneath the temple mountain in Jerusalem were at least 37 great water cisterns, one of which held between two and three million gallons of water. These cisterns kept people alive in the hot, parched summer months.
In biblical Israel, water became a symbol of life, a metaphor that any person living or traveling in the area could readily understand. The prophet Jeremiah used the metaphor of water to describe God. But rather than referring to God as a cistern of living water, Jeremiah called Him a spring of living water:
For My people have committed two evils: They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, to hew for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water. Jeremiah 2:13 (NASB)
The prophet, of course, was thinking of spiritual, not physical, water and thirst. God, Jeremiah was saying, is a natural, free-flowing, drink-all-you-want spring of spiritual life.
Through Jeremiah, God rebuked Israel’s idolatry by using water and cisterns as a picture they would readily understand. Not only had God’s people forsaken their free-flowing spring of spiritual life; they had built cracked, broken cisterns of their own that leaked the water and ran dry as fast as they were filled. Their cisterns? Idols. Trying to get spiritual life from an idol was like pouring water into a cracked cistern — the more effort they poured in, the more futile and wasteful their spiritual quest became.
Hundreds of years later, Jesus clarified this concept. He stood up at the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem and said that streams of living water could flow from the people if they would believe in Him:
“If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, ‘From his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’” John 7:37-38 (NASB)
To the devout Jews who were listening, Jesus’ words would have amounted to blasphemy; living water could flow only from God Himself, as Jeremiah had said. But they may also have remembered Isaiah 58:8-11, where God had told their forefathers that those who believe and obey Him would be “like a spring whose waters never fail” (v. 11, NIV).
Standing on a mountain honeycombed with cisterns, Jesus’ words divided Jerusalem like a cracked cistern (John 7:43).
What Jesus didn’t tell them, but John tells us (John 7:39), was that Jesus was referring to the Holy Spirit. His offer still stands for us today: Believe in Jesus, receive the Holy Spirit, and become a source of living water, of spiritual life.
If you are spiritually thirsty, you need never go through a dry season again. Let His living water flow from within you today.
An exercise for the thirsty or weary : Read and meditate on Psalm 42. Then consider Jesus’ promise of John 7:37-38 (above) and run to Him today.

"Christians Are Not Supposed to Argue, Right?",feeds.cbn.com,Beth.Patch,05-01-2019,2019,5,http://feeds.cbn.com/spiritual-life/christians-arent-supposed-to-argue-right,"Christians Are Not Supposed to Argue, Right? Related Products Shane Pruitt
“Christians are not supposed to argue, right?” My wife, Kasi, and I have learned the benefit of healthy arguing in our marriage, but the truths I share below are not just for married couples. When it comes to knowing how to argue, these truths apply to all relationships.
One of the most practical ways to work on your marriage, friendships, or other relationships is by learning how to communicate well. A healthy relationship will allow you to have healthy conflict resolution. Basically, you’ll know how to argue well. Every solid relationship requires the art of arguing.
You may be thinking, Wait. Couples are not supposed to argue. After all, isn’t every day in marriage like an episode of The Bachelor, with helicopter rides, dinner on the beach, and your partner swooning over every word you say? Unfortunately, reality TV is far from reality, because in real life there are real couples, real friends, and real business relationships that have very real arguments. In fact, people in relationships who say they don’t argue typically fall into one of three categories: They’re lying. There is a bully. For example, in a marriage, when there is a bully in the house, very little arguing takes place. If one person is strongly dominant and the other is extremely passive, the reason they don’t argue is because one is a bully and the other won’t ever speak up for himself. Both people have completely given up on having a growing and maturing marriage or relationship. Sadly, in marriage people become functional roommates or partners, letting each other do his or her own thing, or they leave in search of something or someone who will make them happy. At one time, the relationship was easy, natural, and pleasant. However, they’ve come to realize it would take a lot of work to see the relationship grow and develop, so they give up on it. They just “go along to get along.”
But, for those who are willing to tell the truth and admit they argue, here are some healthy ways to do it: You Must Care Enough to Argue
One of the worst feelings in the world is not caring enough to communicate your frustrations, letdowns, and needs. Couples and friends who don’t care enough to argue are probably close to giving up. Some of the most difficult statements to hear your spouse or friend say are “It doesn’t matter anymore. Do whatever you want. You just do your thing, and I’ll do mine.” At that point, unless something changes, you can be sure the end is near. In contrast, when you care, it means you want to do whatever it takes to resolve the issue. You’re willing to talk, disagree, and then make the necessary changes and sacrifices. Arguing Well Is About Learning, Not Winning
When you listen to the needs, worries, and frustrations of the other person and learn how to serve each other better, then you have victory in an argument. There are times when you can win a debate and still lose in the long run. Relationships are about learning, not winning. When a disagreement takes place with healthy and mature communication, then sacrificial changes are made to show each other beautiful, unconditional love. That is true winning. A Good Argument Involves Both People Talking and Both People Listening
A good argument is not one person doing all the talking while the other person does all the listening. That is called a lecture. Arguing well is one person talking while the other listens without interrupting. Then it becomes time for the talker to become the listener who avoids interrupting. Also, a good talker communicates with kindness, self-control, and humility. A good listener truly concentrates on what the other person is saying and isn’t distracted by thinking about his comeback. Arguing Well Is Not Arguing About the Same Things Over and Over Again
If you’re continuing to argue about the same things, it means one or both of you are not listening or learning. It’s been said that the definition of insanity is doing something over and over again and expecting a different result. When disagreements come, we must communicate, listen, and make the necessary changes. Argue for the Glory of God
Christian marriages are not about us as individuals or even as couples. Actually, they’re about something much bigger than us. According to Ephesians 5, marriage is the visual illustration God has given the world to show Christ’s relationship to His bride, the church. Our relationships preach a gospel message to the world; that truth alone makes marriage eternally important.
It’s necessary for us to ask ourselves this question often: What kind of message are my relationships preaching to a watching world? We must understand that our lives, our actions, and our relationships are designed by God to bring Him glory. When this is most important, then we’ll strive to live and love in a way that looks very similar to the way that Jesus lived and loved."
Florida Teens Stranded at Sea Pray for Help - Then Get Rescued by Boat Named 'Amen',www1.cbn.com,,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/florida-teens-stranded-at-sea-pray-for-help-then-get-rescued-by-boat-named-amen,"CBNNews.com 'I Cried Out': FL Teens Stranded at Sea Pray for Help, Get Rescued by Boat Named 'Amen' 05-03-2019 Emily Jones ABC News Video Screenshot/Good Morning America
Two Florida teens are celebrating the power of prayer after a fun beach day turned into a nightmare.
Tyler Smith and Heather Brown, who've been friends since fourth grade, were swimming off the coast of Vilano Beach when they suddenly became stranded in the open water.
They drifted two miles away from shore and quickly realized how much danger they were in.
The pair desperately fought the waves for two hours and held on to each other to stay above water.
That's when they turned to God for help.
""I cried out, 'if you really do have a plan for us, like, come on. Just bring something.'"" Smith told Fox 30 .
Before long, a boat captain sailing from South Florida to New Jersey happened to spot the teens on the verge of drowning.
""I started swimming towards it. I was like, 'I'm going to get this boat. Just stay here. I'm going to get this boat. We are going to live.'"" Brown said.
Captain Eric Wagner and his crew pulled the teens out of the water and saved their lives.
""Over all the wind, waves, and engines, we thought we heard a desperate scream,"" Wagner told Fox 30 . ""Exhausted and near the end, the boy told me he called out for God's help. Then we showed up.""
Ironically, the boat that rescued them is named ""The Amen.""
""I told them the name of the vessel, that's when they started to cry,"" Wagner said. ""The young couple was gracious and grateful to us and to God. It was the latter all along.""
Everyone involved believes God had truly answered their desperate prayers. Surviving at sea: Two teens stranded off shore in St. Johns county are saved by a man sailing to New Jersey.

'Dangerous': Facebook Permanently Bans Anti-Semite and Right-Wing Activists from Platform,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2019/may/dangerous-facebook-permanently-bans-anti-semite-and-right-wing-activists-from-platform,"Facebook announced that it has permanently banned ""dangerous individuals and organizations"" from its main platform and from Instagram.
Anti-Semite and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, Infowars founder Alex Jones, Milo Yiannopoulos, Laura Loomer, and Paul Joseph Watson are among the high profile figures purged from the platform.
Facebook says these figures violated the company's policy against hate and violence.
""We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,"" a statement from a Facebook representative said, according to The New York Times . ""The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.""
Facebook told CNN that when making its decision, it examines if the person or organization has ever called for violence against people based on ethnicity, race, or nationality, used hate speech, or identifies with a hateful ideology.
Most of the personalities Facebook deplatformed Thursday are also banned from Twitter.
Some are happy to see these figures removed from social media.
""The social media companies not only have the right, but an ethical responsibility to remove disinformation and hate speech and those who spread it from their platforms,"" Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights told the Times.
But critics believe the censorship is dangerous.
Journalist Tim Pool, who reports on social media censorship, believes Facebook made a mistake.
""I cannot stress how much of a dramatic escalation this is. I don't care whether you like these people or not this is going to rapidly radicalize many, many people,"" he said.
Very weird and the people who got banned of didn't know before it happened.

Economist and political commentator Eric Weinstein says Facebook does not consistently enforce its anti-hate policies.
""I'm not a free speech absolutist. Nor is the US absolutist. Companies are not the government,"" he explained.
""What I oppose here is *simple* statements from Tech Utopians about how they are against *all* Hate, Violence & Misinformation while *selectively* enforcing & profiteering.""
The great danger is selective, cryptic & inconsistent rules tilting all discussion. This leads to an appearance of 'conversation' that can sway opinion, elections, civil society etc.
It is a new threat: the *appearance* of a fair & civil public discussion which is really fixed.

American Jews on Guard After Recent Attacks Prove Anti-Semitism is Alive in America,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/american-jews-on-guard-after-recent-attacks-prove-anti-semitism-is-alive-in-america,"JERUSALEM, Israel – Israel is calling on the world to take renewed action against anti-Semitism.
This comes after a spike in hateful acts including last week’s deadly attack on a US synagogue, the second in six months.
""Barely six months ago we saw the worst attack on Jews in American history,” Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon said while addressing the UN. “We spoke about it right here. From the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh to the Chabad synagogue in Poway California, anti-Semitism is no longer a fringe bigotry in the US.”
Danon spoke just days after a 19-year-old gunman fired on worshippers in the Chabad synagogue in California, killing one woman and injuring three others.
It was eerily similar to the October tragedy in Pittsburgh where another lone gunman attacked a synagogue killing eleven.
Both had posted anti-Semitic remarks online prior to their actions.
“Then as now, all the right people are saying all the right things. They express their sympathies and call for an end to this violence and bigotry. But it seems we have learned nothing from the Pittsburgh attack. And it will likely to continue to do nothing following the attack in San Diego,” he said.
Danon wants action, saying the time for just talk is over.
“Those who engage in anti-Semitism must be punished. Whether it's here at the UN, political leaders, editors, policy pundits or college professors it doesn't matter…. until it becomes criminal this bigotry will persist,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Anti-Defamation League released statistics showing that anti-Semitic acts in the US alone more than doubled in 2018.
David Schizer, head of the Joint Distribution Committee tells CBN News the Jewish community has to be brave and do the best it can.
“I think we always have to be vigilant, needless to say, to be American and Jewish is an incredibly comfortable thing. This is the greatest place in the world to be if you’re Jewish but it doesn’t mean everyone in the country necessarily feels that way,” he explained.
Robert Dunn, who is a Philadelphia native, says he’s not afraid to be identified as a Jew but says they have to be careful.
“We have to protect ourselves and our family. When we go to synagogue particularly during high holidays we now have security and I’m always looking around to make sure that I recognize most if not all the people in the synagogue,” Dunn told CBN News.
Researchers at Tel Aviv University confirmed the spike on a global level.
""We have seen among Jews worldwide, but especially in Western Europe and in Northern America, a rising concern, a rising feeling of insecurity -- a feeling of doubting their belonging to their place, of being part of society around them and of the political parties they used to be part of.,” said Professor Dian Porat.
Porat says this puts tremendous stress on the Jewish people.
She cautions against reports that indicate attacks might be decreasing.
“There is more protection of sites, of community centers, synagogues etc. and less Jews, and this is I would say is a tragic phenomena.""
For now, vigilance is the answer but in the long run authorities must find a way to uproot anti-Semitism and stop it in its tracks."
Palestinian Authority Turns to Russia to Save it From Economic Collapse,www.cbn.com,Emily Jones,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/palestinian-authority-turns-to-russia-to-save-it-from-economic-collapse,"JERUSALEM, Israel - The Palestinian Authority is urging Russia to help solve its financial crisis after Israel began deducting terror salaries from its monthly transfer of tax revenues to the PA.
The Jerusalem Post reported Friday that the PA rejected a solution from the European Union to provide funds to Palestinian terrorists' families on a needs-based system, but refused to give any money to terrorists themselves.
""There have been attempts to find alternative channels to pay the prisoners and martyrs allowances, which we will not accept,"" PA Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Information Nabil Abu Rudaineh said on Thursday.
""Israel must pay the whole funds without any deductions,"" Rudaineh continued, adding that Israel ""must honor all agreements and pay the funds in full.""
PA President Mahmoud Abbas met with head of the Russian Representative Office in Ramallah Aganin Rashidovich on Thursday and discussed the PA's financial crisis with him.
The Jerusalem Post did not say what the Russian response was.
Abbas claims that Israel's decision to deduct terror salaries from the monthly transfer of tax revenues to the PA has put the Palestinian economy on the verge of collapse.
The Palestinian Authority is protesting Israel's decision by refusing to accept any of its tax revenues, which according to the UN, makes up 65% of the PA's budget.
On Thursday, Israel's public broadcaster KAN reported that the PA rejected and returned to Israel the tax and tariff revenues that it had received at the beginning of the week, which totaled to about NIS 500 million ($138.8 million). Palestinian officials said this was the third time the PA has refused to accept the money since the beginning of the year."
How Israel Stopped Syria from Becoming a Global Nuclear Nightmare,www.cbn.com,CBN News,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www.cbn.com/api/urlredirect.aspx?u=http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/israel/2019/may/how-israel-stopped-syria-from-becoming-a-global-nuclear-nightmare,"On September 6, 2007, shortly after midnight, Israeli fighters advanced on Deir ez-Zour in Syria. Israel often flew into Syria as a warning to President Bashar al-Assad. But this time, there was no warning and no explanation. This was a covert operation, with one goal: to destroy a nuclear reactor being built by North Korea under a tight veil of secrecy in the Syrian desert.
Gordon Robertson talks with Yaakov Katz about his new book, Shadow Strike , on Friday's 700 Club.
Shadow Strike tells, for the first time, the story of the espionage, political courage, military might and psychological warfare behind Israel's daring operation to stop one of the greatest known acts of nuclear proliferation. It also brings Israel's powerful military and diplomatic alliance with the United States to life, revealing the debates President Bush had with Vice President Cheney and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert as well as the diplomatic and military planning that took place in the Oval Office, the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem, and inside the IDF's underground war room beneath Tel Aviv.
These two countries remain united in a battle to prevent nuclear proliferation, to defeat Islamic terror, and to curtail Iran's attempts to spread its hegemony throughout the Middle East. Yaakov Katz's Shadow Strike explores how this operation continues to impact the world we live in today and if what happened in 2007 is a sign of what Israel will need to do one day to stop Iran's nuclear program. It also asks: had Israel not carried out this mission, what would the Middle East look like today?"

"As Barr Battles Dems, a Shocking New Report: FBI Sent Undercover Agent to Track Trump Team in 2016",www1.cbn.com,,05-03-2019,2019,5,http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/politics/2019/may/as-barr-battles-dems-a-shocking-new-report-fbi-sent-undercover-agent-to-track-trump-team-in-2016,"Attorney General William Barr (Photo credit: Patrick Robertson/CBN News) 6032633922001 As Barr Battles Dems, a Shocking New Report: FBI Sent Undercover Agent to Track Trump Team in 2016
WASHINGTON - We know now the FBI assigned an undercover agent to observe the Trump campaign in 2016.
The New York Times reports an FBI investigator, described as an attractive blonde woman, using the name Azra Turk, posed as a research assistant to observe Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos.
The revelation shows the lengths the FBI took to find out if the Trump campaign was aiding Russia in its election meddling scheme and gives fuel to the president's claims his campaign was spied on.
During his Senate testimony Wednesday, Attorney General William Barr said he's assigned a team at the Justice Department to help him review the origins of the Trump-Russia probe.
Meanwhile, Democrats are fuming after Barr refused to testify before the House Judiciary Committee Thursday. He made that decision after learning committee attorneys, rather than members of Congress, would be questioning him.
When Barr didn't show, Congressman Steve Cohen brought in a ceramic chicken and a bucket of KFC, then proceeded to eat the fried chicken from the dais.
He drew attention and laughs, but not everyone was laughing. The committee chairman is threatening to hold Barr in contempt.
""We can't have him or anybody in the administration dictate the manner in which we function,"" House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-NY) told his committee.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) says Barr lied about his dialogue with the Mueller team. ""The attorney general of the United States was not telling the truth to the Congress. That's a crime,"" the speaker told reporters during her weekly press conference.
The Justice Department calls Pelosi's accusation, ""reckless, irresponsible and false."" However, it's not just Barr the Democrats are targeting. Chairman Nadler and others want to hear from a number of key witnesses in the Mueller report like former White House counsel Dan McGahn, but President Trump is reserving the presidential right of executive privilege to block their testimony.
The president says he completely cooperated with Mueller's team and the investigation should be over.
In an interview with Fox News Thursday, the president said, ""I would say, it's done.""
The Trump administration calls the Mueller report the final word while Democrats see it as a new starting point."
