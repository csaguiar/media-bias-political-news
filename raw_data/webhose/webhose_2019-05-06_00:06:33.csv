The germ, a fungus called Candida auris, preys on people with weakened immune systems, and it is quietly spreading across the globe. Over the last five years, it has hit a neonatal unit in Venezuela, swept through a hospital in Spain, forced a prestigious British medical center to shut down its intensive care unit, and taken root in India, Pakistan and South Africa.

Why don’t Floridians know much about the state’s history? | The Florida Squeeze,thefloridasqueeze.com,Kartik Krishnaiyer,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://thefloridasqueeze.com/2019/04/06/why-dont-floridians-know-much-about-the-states-history/,"Florida Politics, History and Society since 2013 Why don’t Floridians know much about the state’s history? April 6, 2019 · by Kartik Krishnaiyer · in Florida History · Leave a comment
Of course while writing that headline I had Sam Cooke’s music going through my head. But it’s a serious question…
For whatever reason, the rich history of Florida, the first part of the continental United States to be colonized by Europeans, as well as a place with a rich pre-Columbian history is often ignored by its residents.
While many other states in the union openly boast about their history, and residents tend to be more informed about it, Florida’s history remains largely hidden. In the coming months we’ll aim to educate and inform more about much of our state’s history.
But first a few questions. Why is it that Floridians know so little about the state’s history or don’t care?
Is it the transient nature of the state’s population that creates this phenomena?
Or could it be that as Americans we are taught colonial British history and are predisposed to ignore much of what the Spanish built?
Maybe it is because the explosive growth in population of the state after World War II has left the impression among many that Florida was simply a rural backwater beforehand (this in many ways is true, but doesn’t detract from our unique history)?
Is it that we’ve become so concerned about racism that everything that happened in Florida prior to 1965 is viewed with contempt? (This has even led to a bizarre change in the name of a state park as any white officeholder in Broward County prior to the 1960’s is presumed to have been a racist – many were so since we’re changing names why rename the county and its primary city, Fort Lauderdale, one of which is named for a classic Bourbon Democrat and the other for a slayer of Native Americans?)
I asked this question also via Twitter and got a few responses. Floridians – why do we not honor or even know our history the way residents of other states do? Is it the transient nature of things? Is it because it’s largely Spanish rather than English? Is it due to the sad racist history of Fla? Writing a piece for @Flasqueeze on it.

Florida’s history is illustrious and proud. In the coming months we’ll be rerunning/updating some old history features here and writing some new ones. In the meantime we’d like your opinions as to why Floridians don’t know or care about history as much as they should, and your thoughts about what we should cover. Thanks much! Rate this: "

Despite Venezuela's worsening humanitarian crisis fueled by political unrest and economic sanctions, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence announced new sanctions targeting the government and companies that transport oil to Cuba as part of the Trump administration's ongoing effort to oust Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
Recognizing that ""oil is the lifeblood"" of the Venezuelan government, Pence said in Houston on Friday that the United States is sanctioning 34 vessels owned or operated by Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA)—the state-run oil company—and two international businesses and a vessel that have recently shipped crude oil to Cuba, a key ally of Maduro.
""Cuba is a major importer of crude oil from Venezuela,"" the U.S. Treasury Department noted in a statement Friday, ""and in return, sends assistance to Venezuela in the form of political advisers, intelligence and military officials, and medical professionals, all of whom are used to ensure Maduro's hold on power.""
Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez immediately spoke out against the sanctions. ""I strongly reject new measures of economic piracy adopted by Washington to damage #Venezuela and steal its resources,"" he tweeted in Spanish on Friday. ""They will fail.""
""These measures are an act of extraterritoriality, interference, and imperial arrogance,"" Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez added on Saturday.

The administration's move on Friday came after President Donald Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton said, in an interview with Reuters last weekend, that the administration was considering the so-called ""secondary sanctions.""
After Pence's announcement, the women-led peace advocacy group CodePink highlighted Bolton's interview and tweeted Saturday, ""Reminder: sanctions are an act of war. #HandsOffVenezuela.""

The U.S. sanctions are just the latest move by the Trump administration to pressure Maduro to step down.
Bolton and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced previous sanctions on PDVSA in late January, just days after Trump rejected Maduro's most recent election as illegitimate and threw his support behind opposition leader Juan Guaidó, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly who has declared himself ""interim president.""
Last week, as Guaidó ramped up efforts to oust Maduro, the Venezuelan government barred the opposition leader from holding public office for 15 years.
Maduro has remained in power despite calls from some Venezuelans, the Trump White House, and about 50 other countries for him to turn over the government to Guaidó.
Members of the Trump administration—including Pence, in a tweet on Friday—have repeatedly threatened that ""all options are on the table,"" including foreign military intervention, to force Maduro out.
Both opponents and supporters of Maduro took to the streets of Caracas on Saturday, Al Jazeera reported , for ""the latest rival rallies to be held in the capital amid a protracted political crisis and rising anger over blackouts that have left millions without electricity and water .""

Maduro and other critics of the Trump administration's push for regime change in Venezuela charge that the U.S. economic sanctions are "" strangling "" the South American country and exacerbating its humanitarian crisis .
""Trump is strangling Venezuela with sanctions—and it's not working,"" Stephen Kinzer, a senior fellow at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University, wrote in his column for The Boston Globe in March.
""As these sanctions escalate, the lives of ordinary Venezuelans become steadily worse,"" Kinzer explained. ""Food and medicine are in short supply, inflation is raging, and living standards have collapsed. Government corruption and mismanagement fuel this freefall, but fiats from Washington have decisively accelerated it.""

Free Market Solutions to Climate Change Aren't 'Realistic',www.commondreams.org,Carla Santos Skandier,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/04/06/free-market-solutions-climate-change-arent-realistic,"The fossil fuel industry has benefited from market-distorting incentives for decades
by Carla Santos Skandier 0 Comments The youth-led Sunrise Movement visited Democratic representatives in November of 2018, imploring them to endorse the Green New Deal. (Photo: @sunrisemvmt/Twitter)
Last month’s vote in the Senate on a Green New Deal resolution was a waste of time, an attempt by the Republican leadership to jockey Democrats into a supposedly embarrassing vote that nearly all of them in the end sidestepped by voting “present.” But the exercise did show how some politicians intend to signal support for addressing climate change without embracing the systemic changes the Green New Deal demands.
Welcome to the world of realistic solutions.
They were touted during Senate debate on the Green New Deal by people like Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who usually caucuses with the Democrats. He voted no on the resolution, sponsored by Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and in the House by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), because, he said, the policy focus should be to “increase investments in green energy—including research and development—to create price parity with carbon.” Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona issued a statement after the vote saying we should “address a changing climate with realistic, achievable solutions.” Republicans who wanted to rhetorically distance themselves from the climate-change deniers to their right made similar statements.
If Senate Democrats that day weren’t preoccupied with denouncing Republican political gamesmanship, you would have likely heard even more evidence of a strong Democratic “realistic solutions” caucus. It would sound like the New Democrat Coalition call for “market-driven climate initiatives that carry political weight,” such as a cap-and-trade system that allows corporations to buy the right to pollute, or the viral confrontation Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) had with a group of children from the Sunrise Movement, during which she indicated support for “real, meaningful climate change legislation” but declared the Green New Deal “will not pass the Senate, and you can take that back to whoever sent you here and tell them.”
The world of “realistic solutions” to climate change revolves around the sun of the free market. Their success depends on getting the cost of renewable energy resources below that of fossil fuels, in part through incentives and investment in renewables and technological innovation.
The problem is that the energy market is not a free market.
The fossil fuel industry has benefited from market-distorting incentives for decades. That starts with the familiar breaks and subsidies in the tax code, which alone are estimated to have enabled almost half of the U.S. discovered oil fields to be economically viable . There are also numerous “hidden” incentives, such as the below-market-value royalties and lease contracts (which for the coal industry have cost taxpayers an estimated $30 billion over 30 years ) and the research and development investments on such projects as carbon capture and sequestration, (designed to enable fossil fuel companies to keep extracting oil but which critics have said would not become feasible in time to meet generally accepted global warming targets). Add to those the well-known “externalities”—costs related to fossil fuel activities that aren’t paid by companies but rather by individuals and governments in the form of hospital bills, contamination sites, and extreme weather events, just to name a few.
The industry also benefits from the very fact that American power infrastructure, such as transmission and distribution grids, is built around centralized fossil fuel sources, not decentralized sources such as solar and wind. The same is true for existing fossil fuel generation facilities, for which investments are often made based on a three-decade return expectation. Early retirement of these facilities would be seen as a missed earning opportunity (even if that means ignoring sunk costs just to cover the marginal cost of production). Finally, we cannot ignore how CEO compensation at the energy majors is structured to promote increased fossil fuel production and does not generally incentivize the expansion of renewables.
When the supply and demand curve seems to start working in favor of renewables, the Trump administration has intervened in the market to protect the fossil-fuel industry’s profit potential. In just the past year, the administration sought to allow power plants to pass onto consumers the full operating costs of their plants if they have at least a 90-day supply of fuel available (a standard that can only be met by coal and nuclear plants and would keep inefficient plants from shutting down), use a Cold War statute to offer loans or purchase commitments to help failing generation facilities (again supporting coal), and is proposing to offer leases for new offshore oil drilling sites “ under favorable terms that will be difficult for future presidents to revoke or rewrite ”—or future markets to correct.
Even setting aside the slanting of the market in favor of fossil fuels, there is no historical evidence that the free market can solve the climate crisis on its own—and certainly not within the 11-year timeframe called for by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In 2017, the U.S. invested around $40.5 billion in renewables but it was still the world’s top oil and gas producer, surpassing traditional oil countries such as Russia and Saudi Arabia. And this is not unique to the United States. As the International Energy Agency explained in its 2017 Global Energy & CO2 report , even with renewables enjoying the “highest growth rate of any sources,” fossil fuel remains for more than three decades a flat 81 percent of the global energy mix.
The general public might not know these details, but it is hard to imagine that members of Congress aren’t aware of the not-free market in energy; many of the free market flaws were enabled through congressional legislation in the first place. So instead of “realistic solutions” based on a free-market fantasy, how about grappling with what’s really real: the need, for the sake of the planet, to dismantle the system that encourages profiting from fossil fuel extraction. That means ending fossil fuels incentives, leases, licenses, and financing, but it also means rethinking the way we own, control, and structure our society and institutions so we are no longer reinforcing an extractive political economy.

Respectfully, you have become a functional Protestant. You are putting yourself ahead of the Magisterium in deciding what is “true” and what is not. If you can decide Pope Paul VI is not a saint, and that particular teaching is wrong and is not binding on you, every Catholic will eventually claim the same right.

I am happy that you have been able to invent such a god and have been able to work miracles – no doubt “miracles of affirmation”– in your own life.

Regarding: “Friedrich Nietzsche, who may be considered the spokesman of the West, has claimed: ‘God is dead! God remains dead! And we have killed him…’ We have murdered God. In view of God’s death among men, Nietzsche would replace him with a prophetic ‘Superman.’” While Nietzche may be interesting to the writers and readers of the American Conservative and the creator of the prophetic “Superman,” Nietzche is not the evangelizer of the movement. I believe this honor goes to Ayn Rand the author of the Virtue of Selfishness, Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead. It is Rand who has set the world on fire. Rand has made selfishness a virtue. Selfishness is where the problem lies and is also the greatest lie. And in the modern age of social media, how does one break through this great lie that is perpetuated every minute of every day?
Further: “But civilized man is fundamentally an heir, he receives a history, a culture, a language, a name, a family. This is what distinguishes him from the barbarian. To refuse to be inscribed within a network of dependence, heritage, and filiation condemns us to go back naked into the jungle of a competitive economy left to its own devices.” This statement implies that virtue comes from the past, a better age. This may be true, but I believe this is a small truth in the face of the power selfishness has over the world. Selfishness is an eternal truth, a unifying truth of greed. It is my belief that the eternal truth of selfishness can only be defeated by greater eternal and unifying truths. For the sake of the discussion presented by the article, I put forward that these greater eternal and unifying truths start with love, thankfulness and forgiveness. These truths unify all religions and all people of conscience. It is my belief that if we cannot unify the world to these greater truths, we will lose and deservedly so, because we are lost.

Rod’s fairly um, liberal comment policy is what makes the comment section worth reading. There are other blogs with posts followed by hundreds of comments, but these are almost invariably dull and dispiriting because the range of views is so narrow, with the true believers convinced that they have nothing to learn from the outsiders—they don’t even acknowledge the outsiders’ rights to define their own position.

The spiritual collapse thus has a very Western character.
This is rather limited opinion and I wish more ‘punditry’ would focus on the Far East Asian countries in terms of capitalism and society.
1) I still believe the reason why the West won the Cold War was the example of Japan Inc. Western Capitalism was successful outside of the European/US hegemony and a functional capitalist country could succeed like Japan in the 1970s and 1980s where as the communist satellites were failing. So the Asia nations, especially China 1978, followed the Japanese example of a hyper-competitive society can succeed better than Soviet communism.
2) The Japan Inc. also changed the nature of family formation in that it was wise to put off family formation to focus on competitive careers. (Yes this is creating a demographic labor supply trap long term as well that the US entered in 2015.) So I think the West is not rejecting Fatherhood but learning to put off until they have a secure career and decent health insurance.
So it is reasonable for Africa religious bishops to lecture us on our beliefs but show me how functional many of these African nations compared to the West. And better yet how our conservative punditry is screaming dirty Immigrants that are somehow more religious in nature. I see the bishops arguments and Southern Immigration threat as two sides of the same coin. J April 7, 2019 at 3:34 pm
Rick, if love means someone telling you that your sin is good and keep doing it then you don’t understand love. Love means willing the good for the other and that can mean saying “no.” Love also means speaking the truth and we cannot stop doing that even if it offends or leads to persecution. You are simply hoping to justify sin and persecuting those who disagree with you. Elijah April 7, 2019 at 3:53 pm

I never said Paul VI wasn’t a saint. I said his canonization was a naked political act. It was. Whether canonizations are infallible is a matter of debate among theologians. I don’t pretend to be an expert on that, which is why I didn’t say he wasn’t a saint.
But if he is a saint, that does not give his 1960s comments about the UN a shred of infallibility. And it doesn’t give his arrogant abuse of papal power over the liturgy any credibility. Let the fifty-year record of his radical New Order stand for itself. Don’t let the Party determine it for you though its abuse of the canonization process for political ends.

A Priest Defends Jordan Peterson,www.theamericanconservative.com,Rod Dreher,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/a-priest-defends-jordan-peterson/,"Well said, KS! We are “so far into the post modern chaos that the call to order has to be made by a dour and sour person as an emergency response.” Fr.J April 7, 2019 at 9:02 pm
Fr.J here, the original author. The original purpose of what I sent in to Rod Dreher was to give some background information on Jordan Peterson’s views on relationships between men and women in order to better respond to the issues raised in the post entitled “The Unromantic Jordan Peterson.” If I gave the impression that Jordan Peterson is some kind of panacea for all social ills, or some kind of magic guru that never speaks an untruth, I apologize. I think he says a lot of true and helpful things. That’s my opinion, and if you feel like forgetting that I’m a priest while you read this if it helps you dissociate this from any kind of “official church teaching,” do so. If you happen to find those things obvious, that’s fine. I’ve found that I do better when someone makes me work a little for what other people find obvious, and I know I’m not alone in that. And if someone becomes popular for saying obvious things, that’s a lot better than becoming popular for saying false things. The comparison between Jesus and Jordan Peterson was solely to illustrate how misinterpreting true statements can be dangerous. For the comparison to work, I needed an author or a teacher whose statements are generally held to be true by the audience, and who the bad consequences of misusing their true statements are as immediately apparent. This rules out Mohammed, Freud, Marx, etc., on the basis of their ideas likely being seen as false by this audience, and falsehoods (including JP’s) can obviously cause harm. It also rules out Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Chesterton, and more because the process of demonstrating that misinterpreting their true statements has historically caused problems would require a post of its own. Speaking of Jesus, however helpful or un-helpful Jordan Peterson may be, Jesus is the one the world actually NEEDS. Maybe we should do a post about that. Many of you, however, want to talk about this feminine=chaos/masculine=order thing. And yes, I agree, it looks weird, especially considering that it’s usually men who make war and women who tell us to clean our rooms. It’s also the part that’s most relevant to the original purpose of this post, so it’s important. Here’s the paragraph in question: “First, JP sees the principle of Chaos, in both her good and evil aspects, as being somehow connected to the Feminine. This is where I think his comparative religion scholarship really shines. He makes the case that the mythological figures that represent the evil and good aspects of chaos are almost universally feminine. Whether or not you buy his quasi-biological explanation, that the female role in the process of pro-creation is a hidden, mysterious role, while the male role is an un-hidden obvious one, he would contend that one tampers with this association at your peril. By reflection, JP sees the principle of Order, in both his good and evil aspects, as being somehow connected to the Masculine. He has mythological arguments for this too. The mediator, then, is ALSO masculine, acting as the representative of Order, working both with and against chaos. Whenever I hear JP calling young men to live in certain ways, I see him as informed by, and appealing to, this schema. And their strong response serves to lend credence to his theory: this is built into them on a subconscious level.” 76 pages (149-215), and 70 footnotes, of “Maps of Meaning,” are dedicated to drawing out the connection between Chaos/Order and Feminine/Masculine. There are re-tellings of myths, interpretations of those myths according to the scheme, and psychological explanations of why this association takes place. Some of these are probably instances of confirmation bias, such as his interpretation of the story of St. George and the Dragon (183-184). Sometimes a dragon is just a dragon. Others, however, more or less explicitly make the identification themselves, such as Lao-Tzu’s description of the inchoate aspects of the Tao as feminine (156). But why does it matter? Given that all societies are potentially functional, potentially weak or tyrannical systems of order that have individuals that take from chaos what is good and fight back what is bad, what does it matter if order is mythically personified as male, or if chaos is mythically personified as female? And what difference does it make for “real life” outside the myth? Of course, if you like the idea of governing relations between the sexes by myths, no further argument is needed. And governing these relations by myth is surely saner than attempting to eliminate them altogether. But for those of us who are a bit more skeptical, here’s the connection with the “real world.” Every society is a kind of order of persons. Every society, in order to survive, must bring in the new people (the children, unless you’re talking about a society of monks or nuns), and discipline into them the order of the society. They have to take on their society’s version of the role of the “hero,” who both uses and fights against chaos. This is true for both the boys and the girls. And yet, it behooves the society to represent order as masculine. Why? “Such rituals [of maturation] tend to be more complex and far-reaching for males than for females. This is perhaps in part because male development seems more easily led astray, in a socially harmful manner, than female (adolescent males are more delinquent and aggressive) and in part because female transition to adulthood is catalyzed “by nature” in the form of comparatively rapid maturation and the naturally dramatic onset of menstruation.” (Maps of Meaning, 222) In other words, Order is probably going to appear more masculine in a well-functioning society, because if it doesn’t, it means something probably went wrong and the boys won’t get it! Tyrants and chaos-causers of both sexes will always happen, because people have free will and no system is perfect. But the system can still have an optimal calibration, and that isn’t necessarily right in the equality-middle, either. Jordan Peterson does not, in Maps of Meaning, make specific recommendations on what this should look like, leaving thorny practical questions like “should women participate in combat?” or “is agnatic primogeniture just?” to us. Jordan Peterson does not say how much reinforcement of this should take place in cultural myths, how much in gender roles, and how much sameness is helpful. Maybe he deals with those questions later, in videos, articles, etc. But he gives us a way of talking about it. A quasi-mythological way, but still a way. “Men are physically stronger, women are indispensable to the raising of children,” may have worked in the past, but the world is becoming too dominated by technology for that one. “Men are characterized by forming, women by being formed,” Aristotle’s characterization, is too sexist and based on bad embryology. “Men act, women receive,” a common Catholic spiritual trope, makes for some really weird things when you try to apply it to a Christian’s relationship with Jesus Christ. “Men specialize, women are holistic,” Edith Stein’s characterization, is too limited to what kinds of jobs people have. “Men transcend themselves by finding things outside themselves, women transcend themselves by bringing things into themselves,” is my personal favorite from D.C. Schindler, but it is too metaphysical for everyday wear and tear. But I think we can get some good mileage out of Jordan Peterson’s. KS"

Rep. Eric Swalwell plays tough guy with Tomi Lahren over ‘gun safety’ Posted at 10:29 pm on April 6, 2019 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
As Twitchy reported Thursday, word is that Rep. Eric Swalwell, whom you might have seen on cable TV for the past two years pushing the Russian collusion narrative, is running for president alongside every other Democrat in politics, and the focus of his campaign is going to be on taking guns and attacking the NRA .
The Atlantic reported that Swalwell was “running for president on gun safety,” but that’s not true — if he wanted to promote gun safety, he’d encourage citizens to buy guns and take gun safety classes offered by the NRA. When the guy pulls the nuclear weapons card at the first sign of pushback against gun confiscation, it’s pretty clear what “gun safety” means to him.
The idea of Swalwell running for president is hilarious, so while we don’t always agree with Tomi Lahren, we can excuse her for laughing.

Swalwell didn’t take that well. Do you think gun violence is funny, @TomiLahren ? I invite you to my town hall on Tuesday to explain your ""joke"" to the families of Parkland: https://t.co/vC5594MBHF https://t.co/NRwlhHxQ6E

Again, maybe she never even got past “Eric Swalwell running for White House” before bursting into laughter. But we really appreciate Swalwell’s tough guy act, especially since when he’s president he’ll have the codes for those nukes, and they’re legit. Except @TomiLahren didn't make a joke, @ericswalwell . She just laughed at one. You. https://t.co/gaVzaDcnj9

Britain's Version Of 'Medicare For All' Is Struggling With Long Waits For Care,www.drudge.com,MUSTANG,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.drudge.com/news/230835/britains-version-medicare-all,"Google News | Twitter
Public satisfaction and criticism: A 2016 survey by Ipsos MORI found that the NHS tops the list of ""things that makes us most proud to be British"" at 48%.[147] An independent survey conducted in 2004 found that users of the NHS often expressed very high levels of satisfaction about their personal experience of the medical services. Of hospital inpatients, 92% said they were satisfied with their treatment; 87% of GP users were satisfied with their GP; 87% of hospital outpatients were satisfied with the service they received; and 70% of Accident and Emergency department users reported being satisfied.Despite this some patients complain about being unable to see a GP at once when they feel their condition requires prompt attention. When asked whether they agreed with the question ""My local NHS is providing me with a good service"" 67% of those surveyed agreed with it, and 51% agreed with the statement ""The NHS is providing a good service.""[148] The reason for this disparity between personal experience and overall perceptions is not clear; however, researchers at King's College London found high-profile media spectacles may function as part of a wider 'blame business', in which the media, lawyers and regulators have vested interests.[150][151] It is also apparent from the satisfaction survey that most people believe that the national press is generally critical of the service (64% reporting it as being critical compared to just 13% saying the national press is favourable), and also that the national press is the least reliable source of information (50% rating it not very or not at all reliable, compared to 36% believing the press was reliable) . Newspapers were reported as being less favourable and also less reliable than the broadcast media. The most reliable sources of information were considered leaflets from GPs and information from friends (both 77% reported as reliable) and medical professionals (75% considered reliable)."

Boeing races ahead with 737 Max production,www.providencejournal.com,Julie JohnssonBloomberg,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190406/boeing-races-ahead-with-737-max-production,"By Julie JohnssonBloomberg Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 5:07 PM Apr 6, 2019 at 5:07 PM
Output of the 737 Max has continued at full tilt even though regulators grounded the single-aisle jet following a March 10 crash, the model's second fatal accident in five months.
Boeing will soon learn whether the financial fallout from the global grounding of its best-selling jetliner will be a brief jolt — or a much more painful ordeal that would have repercussions for suppliers and the U.S. economy.
Production of the 737 Max has continued at full tilt even though regulators grounded the single-aisle jet following a March 10 crash, the model's second fatal accident in five months. Subcontractors have even begun to speed up the manufacturing pace for the 600,000 parts that go into each one of the single-aisle workhorses, Boeing's largest source of profit.
For now, the company and its supplier base are sticking to a carefully orchestrated schedule, which predates the disasters, to raise monthly output to 57 jets by midyear. That's about 10-percent higher than the current factory tempo, which is already a record. But if regulators take their time in certifying the Max's return to the skies, Boeing would be forced to stash hundreds of factory-fresh jets in airports across the Western U.S.
""If they can't sell these things for six months, they're going to have 300 or more airplanes parked,"" said Stephen Perry, co-founder of Janes Capital Partners, a boutique investment bank that specializes in aerospace deals. ""The working capital tied up in that is quite mesmerizing.""
About 16 Max jets are already stored at Paine Field, adjacent to a Boeing factory north of Seattle, while another five sit at Boeing Field to the city's south, according to 737 production blogger Chris Edwards. Airports from Moses Lake, Washington, to Victorville, in California's Mojave desert, are preparing to take in the Boeing aircraft.
""We continue to build 737 Max airplanes, while assessing how the situation, including potential capacity constraints, will impact our production system,"" Paul Bergman, a Boeing spokesman, said by email.
Boeing hit a setback on Thursday, when Ethiopian authorities defended the pilots of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, saying the 737 Max 8 plane crashed on March 10 despite the cockpit crew having followed Boeing's safety procedures. During the press briefing in Addis Ababa, Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges also called on Boeing to review its aircraft control system. Still, the officials stopped short of saying the plane has a structural problem.
Boeing has several options as it maps production scenarios for the 737. It could postpone the rate increase and perhaps freeze share repurchases to preserve working capital. If the grounding extends late into the year, the company could slow work at its 737 factory in Renton, Washington, as it did twice following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The worst case would involve temporarily halting production of the largest U.S. export. That would ricochet through the economy from Seattle to Wichita, Kansas, where Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. manufactures 737 fuselages.
The resulting layoffs and lost sales, rippling down to machining shops and other small businesses, would shave 0.15 percent off U.S. gross domestic product this year, according to JPMorgan Chase.
Spirit AeroSystems dropped the most in eight months after Cowen & Co. downgraded the stock, citing the growing risk of disruption to a plane that accounts for nearly half of the supplier's revenue.
Based on past practices, Boeing isn't likely to give its suppliers ""much advance warning of a rate adjustment,"" Cowen's Cai von Rumohr said. A Spirit spokeswoman declined to comment.
A swift return to normal looks increasingly unlikely for the Max. Boeing engineers are still finishing work on a software update for a stall-prevention system linked to a Lion Air crash into the Java Sea off the coast of Indonesia in October, and the fatal dive of an Ethiopian Airlines plane near Addis Ababa last month. The disasters killed a combined 346 people.
Boeing said April 1 that it would be several weeks before the software patch is submitted to regulators. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration vowed a rigorous review, while authorities in Europe, Canada and China plan to do their own analysis.
If U.S. regulators agree that the software upgrade resolves safety concerns, they might lift the grounding while foreign reviews are still underway — relieving some of the pressure on the planemaker and its suppliers. The mini-rally in Boeing shares in the last week suggests that investors view that as the likeliest outcome, with parallels to the speedy turnaround after a three-month grounding of the 787 Dreamliner in 2013.
""My sense of Dennis Muilenburg is that he doesn't want to let this slow Boeing down,"" said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson, referring to the manufacturer's chief executive officer. ""He wants it to be a blip that goes away and by year's end they'll be talking about rate 57 and 900 deliveries.""
But it would be difficult for Boeing to increase 737 output until the grounding is lifted and safety concerns ease, von Rumohr said.
For each month the Max is idled, Boeing faces estimated losses of $1.5 billion to $2.7 billion, said JPMorgan Chase analyst Seth Seifman. With deliveries suspended, airlines may halt advance payments that cover Boeing's manufacturing costs, he said. Airlines typically pay about 40 percent of the purchase price while a jet is being built, and the remaining 60 percent when they sign for the completed aircraft.
Boeing would be able to absorb a three-month delay that consumed about $6 billion of cash, Seifman said, and the company would recoup the money once deliveries resumed. But the longer the grounding drags on, ""the more management will have to consider how much cash they want to forgo in the near term,"" he said.
There's a silver lining if Boeing postpones the accelerated production pace. That would grant a reprieve to suppliers still struggling to meet the 52-jet monthly schedule Boeing adopted last year, Seifman said.
One example is CFM International, which makes the plane's Leap engine. CFM, joint venture between General Electric and Safran, has been working to get back on track and has no plans to alter production schedules, spokeswoman Jamie Jewell said.
While Boeing's market value sank more than $30 billion in the aftermath of the Ethiopian crash, the selloff appears greater than any estimate of the actual cost to the planemaker, or the market share likely to shift to Airbus, said Carter Copeland, an analyst at Melius Research.
While Lion Air has threatened to cancel orders, other prominent buyers such as Southwest Airlines have expressed support. And it's early days for a program that Copeland estimates will generate $86 billion in profit for the Boeing through 2030.
""Boeing has a lot tied up in the 737, but so do its customers,"" said JPMorgan's Seifman. ""They're not going away."""
R.I. camp program helps kids cope with grief for lost loved ones,www.providencejournal.com,Katie Mulvaney,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/news/20190406/ri-camp-program-helps-kids-cope-with-grief-for-lost-loved-ones,"Katie Mulvaney Journal Staff Writer kmulvane Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 5:21 PM Apr 6, 2019 at 6:06 PM
Children built sand trays with mementos of people and pets who had died, a craft project designed to help them share their emotions and support one another, at Saturday's Family Day for Camp BraveHeart at the Save The Bay Center in Providence.
PROVIDENCE — Olivia Peloquin remembers her Pepe as a funny man who told jokes, sang silly songs and loved to explore.
On Saturday, the 9-year-old illustrated her love for her grandfather, who died last year of pancreatic cancer, with a miniature passport for his trip to Italy, seashells for their beach walks, a paintbrush and a tiny casket in a sand tray in a sun-filled room looking out on Narragansett Bay.
""He was the funniest guy I know,"" Olivia recalled at a Family Day at the Save The Bay Center for Camp BraveHeart, a summer camp program that offers a safe and nurturing environment to help children cope with grief.
The family found the camp through HopeHealth Hospice & Palliative Care, which helped care for her Pepe — N. David Bouley — in his final days.
""They were having a hard time,"" said Sue Bouley as she gestured toward her granddaughters, Olivia and her younger sister, Abby.
""It seemed to really help,"" said their mom, Catherine Cardin. And Family Day, a day for the children and families to reconnect, just so happened to fall on what would have been Pepe's 70th birthday.
For 13 years, Camp BraveHeart has provided children like Olivia, who have experienced the death of a loved one, a chance to meet other kids who also have suffered a loss. Amid typical summer camp activities, the children get to bond over losses that some of their classmates have not yet endured.
Claire Cunningham, 12, of East Providence, also lost her grandmother three years ago to pancreatic cancer.
""I wasn't there at the time,"" she said. ""I felt really bad that I wasn't there.""
She selected stones that read ""faith"" and ""courage"" to put in the sand tray honoring her grandmother. ""She gave me faith and courage,"" Claire said.
Claire marvels at the others she's met at Camp BraveHeart, a free bereavement summer camp held in August at Camp Aldersgate in Scituate.
""It's nice to be around other people,"" she said. ""It's really cool, because they are so strong.""
Tom Meade has volunteered with Camp BraveHeart since he wrote a story about it for The Journal eight years ago. He took a vacation week that year to help out and has continued to help since.
Meade, a freelance writer, recalled the camp session kicking off with everyone blowing a bubble for someone who had lost a parent, grandparent, friend or other loved one, including pets. Soon the air was filled with bubbles.
""There is no one who hasn't been touched by death,"" Meade said, flanked by Olivia and another little girl wearing a rainbow unicorn horn.
Each child puts up a photo of the loved one he or she lost, and soon the kids connect over their grief, he said. ""They're walking off sharing their grief in a kids' way, and you know that those children are going to be friends forever.""
Therapists stand by to support the children.
""The kids really, truly lean on each other,"" Meade said. ""The kids do all the heavy lifting.""
""There's not a lot of support out there for children for bereavement,"" said camp coordinator Sarah Cordeiro, a grief counselor. ""Having that opportunity is really important, whether they take it or not.""
Saturday's event was designed to support parents, too. Participants drew outlines of their bodies and filled them with words and images that expressed their emotions. Therapists led a workshop for parents on how to support children while they are grieving themselves.
""I think it's important for kids to see what their parents are going through,"" Cordeiro said.

Introduction to KYCBench identity verification,www.stockmarketsreview.com,KYCbench,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.stockmarketsreview.com/thread/introduction-kycbench-identity-verification-3673/,"75 Introduction to KYCBench identity verification The need of ICO regulation is explained by an attempt to protect projects and their investors from fraud. Thanks to the raising worldwide regulation, many regions will receive the necessary framework at the state level. They will create effective job support, limiting it, in accordance with the law, as well as measures to resolve conflicts in the field of blockchain projects. Know Your Customer (KYC) is the process of a business verifying the identity of its clients and assessing potential risks of illegal intentions for the business relationship. KYC is also used to refer to the bank regulations and anti-money laundering regulations which govern these activities. In most cases KYC procedure for ICO is used to identify token holders and KYCBench is ready for action: All users must provide minimum information, Tier 1 basics  name and email. KYCBench also perform Identity proofing (Tier 2 verification) - the process of collection and verification of the information about a person. This usually include date of birth; nationality; document number and expiry date, ets. Address verification is outlined as Tier 3; All process can be described as following: 1. Acquire  uploading the documents using cutting-edge technologies to get best possible image quality. 2. Extract - data is automatically extracted from the documents to definitively assess their authenticity. 3. Verify - computer vision, machine learning, AI and verification experts are used together to verify the documents in real time. For AML purpose all ICO participants must be screened against a number of sanctions lists (UN/EU consolidated list, OFAC, PEP lists, ets). In order to stay compliant with regulation of any country, this step cannot be avoided. It can be done during the pre-ICO registration or during the ICO, simply to ensure that token holders are not terrorists and not from Iran or North Korea. Working with sensitive personal data, KYCBench has established and follow our core values: Trust We understand the full value of trusting relationships in all areas of society and the economy. We make efforts to achieve and maintain trust with everyone. Transparency All our deals are transparent. Personal information is protected. We expect the same from all our cooperation.

KABUL - The Afghan government summoned a Pakistan diplomat to explain Prime Minister Imran Khan's latest remarks on ongoing Afghan peace talks, as tensions flared between the neighboring countries once again. Afghanistan's ministry of foreign affairs summoned the diplomat to object about remarks that it deemed ""explicit interference"" in Afghan affairs, the ministry's spokesman, Sibghatullah Ahmadi, said on Twitter.It marks the fourth time in about a month and a half that Kabul has demanded an explanation from Islamabad for comments related to peace talks aimed at ending 17 years of war in Afghanistan.In late March, Afghanistan recalled its ambassador from Islamabad for Khan's suggestion that forming an interim Afghan government might smooth peace talks between US and Taliban officials. The ambassador returned shortly after Pakistan clarified Khan's remarks as being reported out of context.But on Friday, Khan addressed the matter again at a rally in Pakistan in which he explained his original comments as ""brotherly advice,"" according to accounts published in Afghan media.""Afghanistan considers recent statements of Imran Khan explicit interference in internal affairs of Afghanistan and deems PM's remarks a return to his previous stance,"" Ahmadi tweeted.US and Taliban officials have held several rounds of talks but the Taliban has refused to talk directly to the Afghan government, which they consider an illegitimate regime.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's mandate officially expires in May. The date for the next presidential election has been postponed twice and is now set for Sept. 28. Ghani has been shut out from the peace talks and is under pressure from rivals to step aside and allow a caretaker government to take over, a suggestion he has rejected.

“I represent the Jesus that saves,” Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan said during a speech he gave at a Nation of Islam Saviour’s Day event in February, according to Fox News. God does not love this world. God never sent Jesus to die for this world. Jesus died because he was 2,000 years too soon to bring about the end of the civilization of the Jews. He never was on no cross. There was no Calvary for that Jesus. — MINISTER FARRAKHAN (@LouisFarrakhan) March 30, 2019 Referencing Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar’s antisemitic comments, Farrakhan claimed that she had “nothing to apologize for.”“Jesus died because he was 2,000 years too soon to bring about the end of the civilization of the Jews,” Farrakhan said.While denouncing the controversy surrounding his past with hateful speech and antisemitism, Farrakhan stated openly “I hate Jewish people, I hate gay people.”Farrakhan then compared himself to Jesus, saying “Here I am in front of you. I represent the Jesus that saves.” I represent the Jesus that saves. pic.twitter.com/iKk0jMGUgL — MINISTER FARRAKHAN (@LouisFarrakhan) March 22, 2019 Colleges “fear what’s in my mouth from my teacher the Honorable Elijah Muhammad,” Farrakhan said, lamenting that college presidents are “punished for allowing me or anyone that represents me to come on the college campus.”“I represent the messiah.” Farrakhan said, again referencing Jesus. “I represent the Jesus and I am that Jesus. If I am not, take my life.”Farrakhan has made many controversial statements in the past. Last November, he reportedly led Iranian students in a chant of “Death to Israel” and “Death to America” during a visit to Iran.

They’re coming for Daylight Saving Time,offthekuff.com,Charles Kuffner,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://offthekuff.com/wp/?p=90209,"Mark me down as opposed . Rep. Lyle Larson
A powerful House committee chief on Monday said he’s building support for a constitutional amendment that would stop twice-yearly clock changes.
Rep. Lyle Larson laid out his legislation that would commit the state to following Daylight Saving Time year-round or exempting the state from it, which would make Standard Time the year-round practice.
On Nov. 5, Texans would choose between the two options. The measure would be on the ballot in an off-year, low-turnout constitutional amendment election.
Larson said in an interview he expects the tourism industry, which mostly supports Daylight Saving Time, “might spend some money to educate folks.” Potential opponents include parent and teacher groups, which are concerned that Daylight Saving endangers children by making them wait in the dark for school buses, he said.
Larson’s constitutional amendment and enabling legislation received a hearing before the House State Affairs Committee. The panel didn’t take a vote. Larson, a San Antonio Republican who is head of the House Natural Resources Committee, said he will press for one next week.
“I haven’t heard of any opposition in [State Affairs] committee,” he said.
Martha S. Habluetzel of Ingleside, with the Campaign to Opt Out of Daylight Saving Time in Texas , testified the bill has a least two big defects.
“Congress hasn’t passed a bill to allow year-round Daylight Saving Time,” she noted. Under current federal law, a state only may opt for year-round Standard Time, she said.
Potentially, Larson’s amendment could lead to a bad outcome, Habluetzel said. On Monday, the sun rose at 7:25 a.m., she noted. On Christmas Day, if Texas somehow managed to get itself on year-round Daylight Saving Time, sunrise would be at 8:25 a.m., she said.
“I don’t want the sun coming up at 8:25,” she said.
There is also a joint resolution in the Senate to abolish Daylight Saving Time, which would also require a public vote to be enacted. I’m one of those people who goes to work at a stupidly early hour. It might be daylight when I arrive in the middle of summer, especially if we abandon DST, but otherwise it’s always dark for me in the morning. As such, I appreciate having as much daytime as possible when I get home, which is when it is best experienced. I hope this effort fails, but I fear that sooner or later someone is going to succeed at killing off the late summer sunsets that I so enjoy. Whatever you think, please note that it’s really not DST that you hate, it’s standard time . Please let us not attempt to fix that which is not broken. Related Posts:"

Not sure that what she is proposing is what the British want. The biggest issues with Brexit are free movement of people with EU countries, immigration quotas and above all the Irish border.
She has discussed none of this. Instead she talks about club med states, which, ironically are themselves unhappy with Brussels. Nati #2982048, posted on April 8, 2019 at 1:08 am

As far as I can gather from whatever Bowen has chosen to release so far, the answer to all your questions appears to be ‘Yes’. Mind you, as Peter Garrett famously said, ‘once we get in, we’ll change everything anyway’. I don’t think much has changed since. Because ‘fair and sustainable’. #2981608, posted on April 7, 2019 at 1:56 pm
I want to know when and where bowen met with trustees of industry super funds to discuss the structure of the policy. Alp trolls in the oz comments deny this but it seems too obvious. Bowen would not have thought out the exemption on his own. Mak Siccar
Good questions. Answer: exemptions only for Labor’s m tes! 2dogs #2981618, posted on April 7, 2019 at 1:24 pm
Listed companies will simply respond to this by creating issuing debt securities that mimic their shares.
Super funds will just buy these instead of shares. There will be no real benefit to government revenue.
The only real change is that such debt securities have no voting rights. Which is what this is all about.
Note that the union controlled industry funds won’t need to buy the mimic debt securities, and can still buy shares, as most of their members are still in the contribution phase, and can therefore get the full deduction. It mainly effects retail funds and SMSFs that are mostly in the pension phase, moving them to the voteless securities instead.
This is all about ensuring union control of corporate boards. There will be no significant benefit to government revenue from this measure. Karabar
Mr. Bonehead is simply unable to contemplate such questions. But they do not address the point.
A shareholder is one of many owners of an enterprise. When the enterprise produces income, it pays tax and some of the remainder is distributed to the owners.
A tax on income has already been paid. It is not necessary that this tax on income be paid a second time. Whether or not the shareholder pays tax on other income is immaterial. That is the point. #2981640, posted on April 7, 2019 at 2:01 pm

Is there a way to create a secondary market reselling shares somehow between SMSF’s in such a way as to distribute the deduction onto someone who can use that? Maybe I can invent an app or something. 2dogs #2981662, posted on April 7, 2019 at 2:41 pm
Is there a way to create a secondary market reselling shares somehow between SMSF’s in such a way as to distribute the deduction onto someone who can use that?
No. The easiest and cheapest way around the financial liability is for companies to issue mimic debt. Any other solutions would underperform relative to such debt.
In general, SMSFs won’t care about losing their voting rights, as they never really had control anyway. The retail funds might be disappointed at losing voting rights, but it will be far more important for them to stay fully deductible, because they will lose return and customers if they don’t. So they will chose to buy the mimics. Jock
Tel, Im afraid dividend stripping or transfering franking is against tax law. Pyrmonter #2981683, posted on April 7, 2019 at 3:01 pm
It’s capricious – which troubles me; but … will it matter?
The effect of full dividend imputation is that returns to capital are taxed at the marginal tax rate of the taxpayer, which, if zero, means they’re untaxed. Removing the payments means we have only partial imputation. However, resident subscribers for interest bearing debentures who disclose a TFN who face a zero marginal tax rate will be untaxed at the company level (interest payments are deductible) and also not taxed at a personal level – so debentures serve as a tax effective means of capital raising by the company. Expect to see more advertisments along the lines of ‘Estate Mortgage – High Returns, Nice and Safe’… and down the road, more work for those in Pyrmonter’s profession (insolvency) … but little if any sustained increase in tax collections. At least until the brainiacs in Bowen’s office light on another group of coalition-voting taxpayers to gouge.
Am I missing something, @ TAFKAS / @ TimNeilson? John Bayley
‘Estate Mortgage – High Returns, Nice and Safe’

One look at the cape Grim data shows immediately that methane isn’t a problem even if a significant greenhouse gas (which it anyway isn’t).
See the second graph here .
The pCH4 level plateaued between 2000 and 2006. That shows methane emissions were exactly matched by methane oxidation in the atmosphere. Then the pCH4 concentration started to rise again – just as the coal seam gas and shale gas industry started to get moving. Gas consumption around the world has massively increased as these new resources feed into industry, and…renewable energy. Every kWh of wind energy needs a backup of a kWh or so of gas turbine generation to rapidly load level and for when there is no wind.
As soon as the CSG and shale gas industries mature pCH4 will again plateau. Thus it cannot possibly be a significant contributor to global warming, even if it was actually seriously happening – which in real world data, outside of the climateer models, it isn’t.

So if you run 100 MC runs, then you set the bins to 100. As was mentioned above, this has nothing to do with the bins of a histogram. It is also not true that if you use Latin HC method you can not run individually the MC run that showed problems. It is possible. As I said initially, I run 100 or 200 MC samples but it really depends on how fast the circuit is simulating. Obviously, if a single simulation takes one week to complete it makes no sense to run 500 MC sims, because it will never finish even if you run it in distributed mode. You can run corners, pick the worst-case corner and then run MC on that. Corner simulations do not cover the statistical variations of the process and circuit components. Corners are like the global variations, in a way the deviation from the typical recipe that the factory uses to cook the chip. This means that if your corner is not typical but say slow-slow, it is slow-slow for all devices in the wafer. But then device to device on the same chip, there are random variations (stress here is on random) which are captured by running MC on that corner. Sigma is the usual quantity one looks at when doing statistics and it is a measure of how much your tested quantity is deviating around the mean value. So +/- 3 sigma captures 99.7% of the variation, so if your spec requires 3 sigma variation, that means that your circuit meets the spec within these limits. Some people may go for +/-6 sigma, a tighter requirement. Last edited by sutapanaki; Yesterday at 22:07 ."

“The Trump administration is planning to grant approximately 96,000 H-2B visas for temporary and short-term workers — 80% of whom come from Mexico and Central America — this fiscal year, the Washington Post reports.
Why it matters: This is the highest amount of H-2B visas given since 2007, per the Post. As the amount of temporary worker visas increase, President Trump has heightened his rhetoric on stopping a “colossal surge” of immigration through the U.S.-Mexico border, saying “the system is full. Can’t take you anymore. … Our country is full.” DHS Secretary Nielsen has described the current situation at the border as a “system-wide breakdown” of the U.S. immigration system. …”

I agree with AOC that automation is more of an opportunity because in the long run the world will be a wealthier place and everyone will have more leisure time. Similarly, I like animals like Adolf Hitler. A reasonable person can agree with someone of another perspective on some things while disagreeing with them on others. The irrational SJW fundamentalist mindset is just the opposite.
Adolf Hitler liked classical music. He liked science and technology. He liked autobahns. He liked the environment and whole foods and strenuous physical exercise. HE LOVED ART . The Nazis also waged war on cancer and were ahead of the Allies in rocket science and other areas . Were any of these things BAD simply because Hitler liked them or is that a retarded way of looking at the world?

""We want Israel themselves to feel that there are no threats to their future,"" Oman's Foreign Minister Yousuf bin Alawi said at the World Economic Forum in Jordan on Saturday, according to Arutz Sheva.""The West has offered Israel political, economic and military support and it now holds all the means of power,"" Alawi said, emphasizing, though, that ""despite that, it fears for its future as a non-Arab country surrounded by 400 million Arabs."" Alawi added that he believes that ""we Arabs must . . . try to ease those fears that Israel has through initiatives and real deals between us and Israel.""Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi dismissed Alawi's comments, stating that it is the ""occupation"" which causes Israel's problems, according to World Israel News.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Alawi during a summit in Warsaw in February. The Omani Foreign Minister has a history of Israel advocacy. In a speech given at the IISS Manama Dialogue security summit in Bahrain, Alawi said that ""Israel is a state present in the region, and we all understand this."" Alawi stressed that ""maybe it is time for Israel to be treated the same [as other states] and to also bear the same obligations.""Last October, Netanyahu visited Oman to discuss regional issues after being invited by the country's leader, Sultan Sayyid Qaboos bin Said Al Said.

Court: State must explain by May 1 why it failed to evacuate Khan al-Ahmar,www.jpost.com,TOVAH LAZAROFF,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Court-state-must-explain-by-May-1-why-it-failed-to-evacuate-Khan-al-Ahmar-585950,"Arial view of Khan al-Ahmar and Route 1. (photo credit: TOVAH LAZAROFF)
The state must explained by May 1 why it hasn’t evacuated the illegal West Bank herding village of Khan al-Ahmar, the High Court of Justice said last week.The court issued its order late Tuesday in response to a petition from the right-wing NGO Regavim, which turned to the court asking that force the state to make good on the demolition orders against the village of huts and tents, which is home to 180 members of the Jahalin tribe. The demolition request also included the elementary school, adjacent to the village. Built with European funds, it is known as the Tyre School. Regavim told the court that its petition was the fifth against the village, which it called an “outpost” and the school in the last decade.In May 2018, the High Court ruled that the village and the school could legally be demolished, but it did not insist that they must be removed. As such, no court mandated date was given for an evacuation.The justices in past remarks have been clear that they do not wish the village to remain at its current location, just off of Route 1, on the outskirts of the Kfar Adumim settlement, in between Jerusalem and Jericho.At the same time, the justices urged both the Bedouin community and the state to find an agreed-upon alternative location. The Khan al-Ahmar community, which has been at that location since the 1970s, has insisted that it wants to remain there, but would be willing to move back a short distance from Route 1. It has also rejected the two alternative sites presented by the state in the same region of Area C outside of Jerusalem where Khan al-Ahmar is located. The first is located next to garbage dump in a new neighborhood of Abu Dis, called Jahalin West. The second site is next to a waste water treatment plant not far from the settlement of Mitzpe Yeriho.Former defense minister Avigdor Liberman had been close to evacuating the community in October, but his efforts were thwarted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At the last minute, Netanyahu halted the proceedings, after Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit said that from a legal perspective he needed to make another attempt to come to an agreement with the Khan al-Ahmar residents who are part of the Jahalin tribe.The decision to delay the demolition also a warning by Fatou Bensouda, the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court at The Hague, that such a move could constitute a war crime.At the time, Netanyahu promised that Khan al-Ahmar would be demolished soon.“Khan al-Ahmar will be evacuated. It a decision of the court. It our policy and it will be executed,” Netanyahu told his faction in October.In its petition to the High Court, Regavim stated that it seems as if Netanyahu and defense officials believed they have fulfilled their obligations to the court simply by making declarative statements.By failing to enforce the land by evacuating Khan al-Ahmar, the state the state is undermining the principle of law and order and eroding the public’s trust in the government and the courts, Regavim stated in its petition.

This means that once activated for a particular workstation, it wouldn't be available elsewhere Of course this has the same issue as any other application requiring activation.

How do you know the request to allow re-activation is legit because the hd was actually changed? It could just be that it's an attempt to install on a different machine. You need more than that to get closer to 100% lock down, which you never will achieve; at least not without raising the ire of IT people. You can only raise the level of protection from zero to something a bit higher. At least that's my take. - ""doesn't work"" is no help. Post err msgs and where. - Use code tags for code/sql.

Herman Cain afraid he might not pass the FBI background check for fed seat,www.politicususa.com,Reuters,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/06/herman-cain-afraid-he-might-not-pass-the-fbi-background-check-for-fed-seat.html,"Herman Cain afraid he might not pass the FBI background check for fed seat 972 Subscribe Print Flipboard
WASHINGTON (Reuters) – Former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain said he will face a “cumbersome” process as he is vetted for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board.
In a video posted on Facebook late Friday, Cain said he must turn over records from 50 years in business, including numerous professional jobs, service on boards, and extensive speeches.
The 73-year-old said it was not clear if he will pass the ongoing FBI background check, a standard practice before a high-ranking nomination.
“Whether or not I make it through this process – Time will tell,” Cain said. “Would I be disappointed if I don’t make it through this process? No. Would I be thrilled and honored if I make it through this process? Yes. That’s the bottom line.”
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he plans to nominate Cain, a former pizza chain executive. “I have recommended him highly for the Fed,” Trump said. “I’ve told my folks that’s the man.”
Cain’s nomination would need to be approved by the U.S. Senate. “They have to collect an inordinate amount of information on you, your background, your family, your friends, your animals, your pets, for the last 50 years,” Cain said.
Cain said people who dislike him are “already digging up all of the negative stuff that’s in storage from eight years ago.” He added, “I will be able to explain it this time.”
Cain led opinion polls for a while during the Republican nominating contests, buoyed by his signature 9-9-9 tax proposal, which would have levied a flat 9 percent corporate, income and sales tax.
But his popularity slipped amid sexual harassment allegations from several women, which he denied as “completely false.”
Cain made his fortune as chief executive of Godfather’s Pizza before launching a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012.
Trump has been a strident critic of the Fed’s rate hikes under Jerome Powell, whom the president picked two years ago to chair the U.S. central bank. Trump’s other Fed appointees have also supported the Powell Fed’s rate hikes, which the president has said hurt the economy.

Posted by Priscilla -23.80pc on April 06, 2019 · Flag
Georgia’s passage of an anti-abortion bill has ignited calls for a film industry boycott of the state – a measure that would could be costly. But never fear, Fox & Friends is giving Georgia a helping hand.
On Wednesday’s Fox & Friends, cohost Steve Doocy opened up the “pro-life” propaganda piece by reporting that Georgia's governor is prepared to sign Georgia’s anti-abortion “heartbeat” bill – a law which would prohibit abortion when a fetal “heartbeat” is detected. He noted that some, in Hollywood, are proposing a boycott of film and TV production in Georgia and introduced the freshman lawmaker who was a sponsor of the bill.
Doocy asked GOP State Rep. Ginny Ehrhart (who is so virulently anti-LGBT she once compared transgender people to moose ) to describe the bill. She claimed that it would “provide protections for unborn children at the point when a human heartbeat is discovered” and pontificated that Georgia recognizes those “unborn babies to be distinct, individual, living human beings worthy of protection.” She happily proclaimed that the bill “recognizes the personhood of that child” and that, in Georgia, “we place great value on human life.” She continued to preach about how Georgia wants to protect “all those unborn children.”
Doocy informed us that this new law shortens the time for a legal abortion, from 20 to 6 weeks, and that’s why celebrities are threatening to boycott Georgia. He didn’t mention that Roe’s viability standard is way more than six weeks or that many women don’t even know they’re pregnant at six weeks.
Ehrhart sounded like she was giving a Chamber of Commerce speech as she bragged about Georgia’s fabulous business climate and how they just love the film industry. She said that she didn’t think the vocal opposition represents the entirety of the film industry. However, she mentioned that she had seen some ""activism” around the capitol.
In attempting to whitewash the drastic aspects of the legislation, Doocy urged Ehrhart to talk about its exceptions. Ehrhart made the ludicrous claim that the bill is a “compromise” because it doesn’t overturn Roe. ( It does , however, effectively ban most abortions in Georgia). She continued the crazy talk with a statement that the bill “balances the rights and interests of the mother with the rights of that unborn child.”
Ehrhart spoke about the exceptions for rape or incest or health of the mother, but didn’t mention that “medical professionals argue that developing tissue of a fetus at six weeks may be mistaken as a heartbeat and that the fetus would not be able to survive outside of the mother’s womb.” She also didn’t tell viewers that the rape exception is only valid with a police report .
Doocy continued to encourage Ehrhart to speak about the awesomeness of this draconian bill by saying that, according to the bill, the six-week benchmark is the beginning of personhood.
Ehrhart argued, “For centuries, the heartbeat has been a discernible and tangible indication of life"" which is, she said, “personhood.” She urged folks to come to Georgia because “it’s a wonderful place to work.” She hoped that Hollywood would respect Georgia’s “political interests and moral direction.”
Despite Ehrhart’s cheerleading, neither Doocy nor Ehrhart mentioned that not all Georgians are happy with this law. A representative from the state Ob-Gyn Society is concerned that the law “would deter obstetricians from practicing in a state that has a shortage of OB-GYNs.” Nobody said anything about how none of the other (red) state “heartbeat bills” are being enforced because of litigation nor that the Georgia ACLU is set to challenge this law as soon as Governor Brian Kemp signs it.
Sure, Fox & Friends cares about fetuses - facts, not so much.

y Roberta Rampton
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he made the controversial decision to recognize Israel’s 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights after getting a quick history lesson during a conversation on a different subject.
Speaking at the Republican Jewish Coalition gathering in Las Vegas, Trump said he made the snap decision during a discussion with his top Middle East peace advisers, including the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, and son-in-law Jared Kushner.
“I said, ‘Fellows, do me a favor. Give me a little history, quick. Want to go fast. I got a lot of things I’m working on: China, North Korea. Give me a quickie,” Trump said to laughter from the Las Vegas crowd.
“‘How do you like the idea of me recognizing exactly what we’re discussing?'” said Trump, recounting the conversation.
Trump, who typically demands short sharp briefings and is known for his colorful retelling of stories, said Friedman was shocked, “like a wonderful, beautiful baby,” and asked the President if he would actually do it.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Trump last month. At their March 25 meeting, Trump signed a proclamation officially granting U.S. recognition of the Golan as Israeli territory, a dramatic departure from decades of U.S. policy. The move, which Trump announced in a tweet days prior, was widely seen as an attempt to boost Netanyahu who is up for re-election on April 9.
Israel captured the Golan in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in 1981 in a move not recognized internationally.
“I went –‘BING!’– it was done,” Trump said on Saturday, describing the swiftness of his decision. “We make fast decisions. And we make good decisions.”
When Trump asked the crowd who will win Israel’s election – there were shouts of “Bibi!” Trump responded “I think it’s going to be close. Two good people.”
Netanyahu is fighting for his political survival against former top general Benny Gantz, a political novice.
Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson, who is reportedly gravely ill, watched the speech in person.
Earlier three protesters stood on their chairs as Trump began to speak, shouting “Jews are here to say – occupation is a plague.” The rest of the crowd quickly drowned them out with chants of “USA! USA!” They were physically removed by security guards.
“He is going back to mommy and he will be reprimanded,” Trump said of the protesters. “She gets it.”

Trump goes ANOTHER round against the Mueller report….,politicaldog101.com,jamesb,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://politicaldog101.com/2019/04/trump-goes-another-round-against-the-mueller-report/,"Trump goes ANOTHER round against the Mueller report…. April 6, 2019
Scratch the crowing done by Donald Trump, after his Attonery General Bill Barr TRIED to play off Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on his investigations into the 2016 Election and the Russians….and other stuff…
With reports that Mueller did NOT actually give Trump a clean bill in his report….
And…
Reports that Mueller’s people feel that Trump WAS nowhere as innocent as Barr was trying to sell….
Donald Trump is BACK on the attack against Mueller & Co…..
Oh, the post Barr sell hasn’t much changed most American’s feeling that they will believe Mueller….
Not Trump….
Mueller and Barr are scheduled to appear before the Democrats in the House also….(and the requests for more Trump info is on-going)
Ouch?
President Donald Trump took to Twitter Saturday to attack the latest barrage of investigations and subpoena threats from his political opponents on Capitol Hill.
In his Saturday tweets, the president repeated claims that the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller was run by “13 Angry Trump hating Dems” who found no wrongdoing on his behalf after spending “$30 million” over the course of the investigation. He added that the 22-month long probe was a “total waste of time.”
His tweets come amid reports that some members of the special counsel’s team have been frustrated by the way U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr cast their findings in the summary he submitted to Congress late last month.
This week, the House Judiciary, Intelligence and Oversight committees have all ramped up probes into different aspects of Trump’s financial history, policy agenda and campaign, and Trump was hit Thursday with a formal request from Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) for his individual tax returns dating back to 2013.
The oversight escalation on Capitol Hill comes as Democrats continue to demand an unredacted copy of Mueller’s approximately 400-page report, which was provided to Attorney General Bill Barr more than two weeks ago. That request shows congressional Democrats “will never be satisfied,” Trump stated Saturday.
But as Barr’s self-imposed deadline to submit a copy of Mueller’s report to Capitol Hill fast approaches, Trump’s confidence in its “complete and total exoneration” of him has waned, according to one Republican close to the White House.
“He wouldn’t be bringing this up still if everything was hunky dory,” this person said, referring to the president’s tweets about Mueller and his team of federal investigators….."

The worries have been brush aside and are gone….
Just bring up anyone’s name, address and shoe size? Any search engine can quickly reveal your phone number, address and family information with a surprising level of detail. It can be instantly culled on the open web from sites like White Pages and Spokeo. Why it matters: This information, combined with social media posts, can be used by anyone to intimidate, harass, or stalk high-visibility people like politicians, business leaders, celebrities and journalists. And it’s getting easier for trolls to find specific information about all of us as we go about our daily lives. The big picture: Finding personal information online is relatively easy; removing all of it is nearly impossible. However, going through smart opt-out processes can reduce your online footprint, making it more difficult for malicious actors to target you. Here’s how: Go to one of the lists of people aggregator sites, like the one provided by IntelTechniques , and go through the opt-out steps. Don’t provide any additional, optional, or new information like a driver’s license or phone number, and consider making a burner email just to receive opt-out confirmations. Opting out of all of them is harder than unsubscribing from an email. So aim for reducing the amount of information available, rather than attempting to go completely off the grid.

Joe Biden’s comforting actions with women shouldn’t effect his Presidential run…Poll,politicaldog101.com,jamesb,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://politicaldog101.com/2019/04/joe-bidens-comforting-actions-with-women-shouldnt-effect-his-presidential-run-poll/,"Joe Biden’s comforting actions with women shouldn’t effect his Presidential run…Poll April 6, 2019
A majority (56%) of tall hose polled are alright with him going on….
For Democrats?
For women alone?
Thew number is @54%…..
A majority of registered voters say allegations that former Vice President Joe Biden inappropriately touched several women should not disqualify him from seeking the White House in 2020, according to a new Hill-HarrisX poll.
The survey, conducted on Thursday and Friday, found that 56 percent of respondents said Biden’s conduct should not be viewed as disqualifying. Twenty-three percent said it should be, and 21 percent said they were unsure.
A majority of women and Democratic respondents said the allegations should not prevent him from running for president.
Biden is widely expected to declare his third White House bid, despite accusations from at least seven women who say he touched them at public events in ways that made them uncomfortable.
In a video posted to Twitter on Wednesday, Biden pledged to be “more mindful about respecting personal space.” He did not directly apologize to his accusers, but he acknowledged that times have changed and that he would adjust his behavior.
President Trump on Friday said he does not view Biden as a threat to his reelection bid.
“I don’t see him as a threat. I think he’s only a threat to himself,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
A day earlier, Trump shared an edited video that poked fun at Biden for the recent controversy. The president posted the video , which features footage from a Biden’s Wednesday statement, on his Twitter feed with the message “WELCOME BACK JOE!”
Biden on Friday made his first public appearance following the allegations, and he joked about the controversy during an address at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers conference.
The Hill-HarrisX survey found that 62 percent of Democratic respondents say the allegations of past behavior should not preclude him from being a 2020 candidate. Eighteen percent of Democrats said he should be disqualified, and 20 percent said they were unsure…."

April 5, 2019
While watching Inside Politics@CNN this afternoon I am struck by the lead-off discussion ….
With John King and the women pundits they are talking about Joe Biden and his ‘hands’ issue…
The situation is actually NOT in the forefront for most Democrats…
Biden HAS been on tape saying he will stop his actions…..
But his numbers will be what counts…
Not the media….
He gave a speech and met with the media…
And made clear he would NOT apologize for trying to be empathic…
Good…
He led off his speech making fun of himself…
Some media people objected…
I li s tened to some of the after speech conversation and I’m fine with it….
My wife listened also…
She’s fine with it also….
Joe Biden IS who he is….
Just like Trump?
And those of out there who like him ?….Are happy with the guy…
Warts and all…
So?
Some media people should take our and other media people’s advice and lay off the Flores thing…Donald Trump has done TONS more and he’s President….The same type of situation didn’t stop a guy from getting on the US Supreme Court….
Democrats will NOT repeat the Al Franken mistake this time of ‘eating their own’ while Republicans stand on the side and shake their heads and laugh….
Ole Joe has to hold back on the touching…
And push forward in trying to put Donald Trump out of a job….
Friday marked Biden’s most extensive comments addressing the issue and his first public appearance since the women came forward.
During his speech to the electrical workers’ union, the former vice president referenced the controversy with a pair of jokes, telling attendees that he had received permission to hug the union leader and put his arm around a child he invited up on stage.
Biden later appeared to address the jokes, telling reporters that he did not intend to “make light of anyone’s discomfort.”
“It was not my intent to make light of anyone’s discomfort,” Biden said after the speech. “I realize my responsibility is to not invade the space of anyone who is uncomfortable.”
Biden had previously addressed the women’s accounts in a video shared Wednesday on social media. He did not apologize in that recorded statement, either, but acknowledged times have changed and that he would adjust his behavior.
While many of Biden’s former colleagues in the Senate and others have attested to his character, President Trump and some Republicans have seized on the allegations.
Trump, who has himself been accused of sexual misconduct by several women, has taunted Biden multiple times in recent days, including when he shared a doctored version of the former vice president’s video remarks….
More…
Biden opened his address to the IBEW conference at the Washington Hilton by joking about his embrace of the man who introduced him, union president Lonnie Stephenson.
“I just want you to know, I had permission to hug Lonnie,” Biden told the crowd, prompting laughter.
Fifteen minutes later, Biden invited a group of children on stage with him, shaking each of their hands. He put his arm around one male child before telling the crowd: “He gave me permission to touch him,” again prompting laughter from the crowd. “I’m sorry to take so long. Everybody knows that I like kids better than people.”
Biden’s speech was his first public appearance since Lucy Flores, a former Nevada state legislator, wrote a week ago that Biden had invaded her personal space during a political event, smelling her hair and kissing the back of her head. Since then, several other women have shared stories of their own unwanted interactions Biden, who has described himself as a “tactile politician” prone to doling out hugs…..
More…..
I hate to say this?
But on the this?
I find Donald Trump might have a point…..
Biden HAS had NUMEROUS women come to his defense….
He has NOT been accused of sexual misconduct…
He IS gonna continue to give hugs to people who want them….
And the media is gonna have to adjust to this ….
Just as they have adjusted to some of Donald Trump’s antic’s…
The day of the perfect political may be gone…
Amen…."
