"Mark Riddell, Who Took Tests for Wealthy High Schoolers in College Scam, Pleads Guilty",www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/test-taking-whiz-mark-riddell-pleads-guilty-in-college-admissions-scam,"ANOTHER ONE DOWN Mark Riddell, Who Took Tests for Wealthy High Schoolers in College Scam, Pleads Guilty Prosecutors allege that while William Singer crafted the college scam, Mark Riddell was the brains behind the operation. Now, both have pleaded guilty in the cheating scandal. 04.12.19 3:02 PM ET Getty
A former Florida prep-school administrator who posed as high-school students to take SAT and ACT tests as part of a nationwide college admissions scam pleaded guilty in Boston federal court Friday afternoon.
Mark Riddell, 36, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering in what investigators have called the “largest college admissions scam” ever prosecuted.
Prosecutors alleged over 50 parents paid admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer upwards of $25 million total to rig test scores, cheat on SAT exams, and bribe college coaches to secure their children spots at several elite universities. Many of the children were not aware of the scam.
While Singer is believed to be the engineer of the operation, prosecutors allege that Riddell was the brains—taking tests in students’ place or correcting answers after their tests were handed in.
“He was just a really smart guy,” Andrew Lelling, U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts said at a March news conference announcing the charges from the FBI’s “Operation Varsity Blues.” “He didn’t have any side information about the correct answers. He was just smart enough to get a near-perfect score on the exam or to calibrate the score.”
Riddell, the former director of the IMG Academy, allegedly was paid $10,000 per test. That money was taken from “donations” parents made to Singer’s fake charity, Key Worldwide Foundation, which were also used to bribe Los Angeles and Houston test administrators to let Riddell pose as high-school students.
“I want to communicate to everyone that I am profoundly sorry for the damage I have done and grief I have caused those as a result of my needless actions. I understand how my actions contributed to a loss of trust in the college admissions process,” Riddell said in a statement last month , after the charges were announced.
According to the indictment, Riddell was not only able to ace the standardized tests, but he also made sure to get an appropriate exam score for each student so as not to raise the suspicion of test companies.
“Singer would discuss with parents what kind of score was impressive—but not too impressive,” Lelling said. “Then he would instruct Riddell to attempt to get that score, and he was just good enough to do it.”
Riddell helped the oldest daughter of Felicity Huffman, who allegedly paid $15,000 to have the 36-year-old correct her kid’s answers, giving her a 400-point bump. Huffman, 56, announced on Monday that she will plead guilty to bribery and fraud for her role in the scam.
“I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community,” Huffman said in a Monday statement. “I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college.”
Riddell, a Harvard graduate and failed tennis pro, has been working with authorities since February and agreed to the terms in a plea deal signed last month in exchange for his cooperation, “in the hope of obtaining leniency when he is sentenced,” the Massachusetts U.S. attorney’s office said.
“I will always regret the choices I made, but I also believe that the more than one thousand students I legitimately counseled, inspired, and helped reach their goals in my career will paint a more complete picture of the person I truly am,” Riddell said in the statement.
He now faces up to two decades in prison and a $250,000 fine, although prosecutors said Friday they are recommending 33 months for his July 18 sentencing hearing. His plea makes him the 18th person to plead guilty in the massive bribery scam."
Trump Wants to Bus Migrants to Sanctuary Cities. The Mayors There Are Fine With It.,www.thedailybeast.com,Scott.Bixby@thedailybeast.com (Scott Bixby) Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey),04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-wants-to-bus-migrants-to-sanctuary-cities-the-mayors-there-are-fine-with-it,"Trump Wants to Bus Migrants to Sanctuary Cities. The Mayors There Are Fine With It. An elaborate attempt to troll liberal politicians seems to have hit a snag. 04.12.19 4:46 PM ET JIM WATSON
President Donald Trump may have assumed that his proposal to release undocumented immigrants into so-called “sanctuary cities” would back Democrats into a corner on the issue of immigration. But the local officials in those cities he’s targeting don’t seem to actually find the prospect all that foreboding.
Instead, when asked about the plan—which would entail busing migrants apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border to be released in cities that do not cooperate with federal law enforcement to arrest undocumented immigrants—mayors of major cities, regional capitals and medium-sized towns told The Daily Beast said that they would welcome those currently being detained.
“The city would be prepared to welcome these immigrants just as we have embraced our immigrant communities for decades,” Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney told The Daily Beast in a statement. “This White House plan demonstrates the utter contempt that the Trump administration has for basic human dignity and the core values on which this nation was founded.”
“As a welcoming city, we would welcome these migrants with open arms, just as we welcomed Syrian refugees, just as we welcomed Puerto Ricans displaced by Hurricane Maria and just as we welcome Rohingya refugees fleeing genocide in Myanmar,” said Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel in a statement.
“I am proud that Cambridge is a sanctuary city,” Mayor Marc McGovern of Cambridge, Massachusetts, told The Daily Beast. “Trump is a schoolyard bully who tries to intimidate and threaten people. I’m not intimidated and if asylum seekers find their way to Cambridge, we’ll welcome them.”
The response to Trump’s proposal is almost certainly not what the president expected and reflects the vast gulf that is growing between the two parties on immigration policy. The president’s idea was presented as a threat meant to scare Democrats into admitting that they wouldn’t be as accommodating of immigrant communities as they have pledged to be.
“We’ll give ’em to the sanctuary cities, maybe, to take care of, if that’s the way they want it,” Trump said during an event originally intended to pitch U.S. companies on the deployment of 5G technology. “We are looking at the possibility, strongly looking at it, to be honest with you.”
“We’ll give them more people,” Trump continued. “We can give them an unlimited supply—let’s see if they have open arms.”
How serious the administration is about pushing the idea remains unclear. The White House originally denied that they were seriously considering busing undocumented immigrants and migrants detained at the border to sanctuary cities, saying it was “just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion.” But the president has since leaned into it, even tweeting that he was giving it “strong consideration.”
That gambit, experts say, is both logistically and legally dubious. And multiple mayors told The Daily Beast that it only makes the Trump administration’s immigration policy look incoherent.
“Like so many issues we are forced to talk about during this presidency, this isn’t a real idea or a real proposal, it’s just another scare tactic,” said San Francisco Mayor London Breed. The city, home to the congressional district currently held by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is specifically mentioned as a potential target of Trump’s policy. “Every time we talk about the president’s latest tweet… we aren’t talking about a path to citizenship for the over 10 million undocumented immigrants in our country.”
Some pointed out that the proposal would only exacerbate what the president has characterized as an immigration crisis.
“Humans are not pawns. This is not a game. These are people’s lives,” said Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler. “Portland will continue to protect its sanctuary status in accordance with Oregon law and the U.S. Constitution. We strongly denounce the cruel efforts of this administration to retaliate against sanctuary cities.”
Previous Trump administration threats to retaliate against sanctuary cities have not materialized into actual policy. Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions had vowed to withhold federal law enforcement grants from jurisdictions that declined to cooperate with ICE. But 29 of 30 municipalities that had received Sessions’ letters still ended up receiving those grants. Federal courts also sided with sanctuary cities after Trump issued an executive order restricting federal funding for such cities.
“It’s a sign of the president’s tremendous weakness as an executive and weakness as a leader, and of the degree to which he pales in comparison to all of his recent predecessors,” Mayor Daniel Drew of Middletown, Connecticut told The Daily Beast. “This threat is hollow and more than anything is a sign of the tremendous weakness of the Trump administration.”
In Coachella, the California desert town famous for its music festival, Mayor Steven Hernandez told The Daily Beast that the city already works with outside organizations to ensure that undocumented immigrants are able to integrate into the community. Were the administration to bus in migrants from the border, Hernandez said, the community would welcome them.
“We have already been working alongside partners to ensure that recently arrived families, women and children get the services they need to make their successful transition into America,” he said.
Democrats in Congress, meanwhile, were exasperated with the president’s latest immigration gambit, and said they stand willing to work on policy if the White House would quit with the posturing.
Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat who represents part of San Jose, a sanctuary jurisdiction, called on Trump to propose “real solutions.”
“Most of the communities he believes people should be going to are ones who would believe in just processing and treating people humanely and having that process,” Khanna told The Daily Beast by phone. “Is he gonna pay for people to be flown in there? Is he going to be paying for judges? It’s just logistically infeasible.”
Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat who represents Maryland’s Montgomery County, a jurisdiction ICE has called consistently not cooperative, said that the political conditions were actually ripe for negotiations with the White House and congressional Republicans.
“It’s unfortunate that the president is in such a dark and vindictive state of mind. I don’t know where he thinks that leads,” added Raskin. “He’s a day trader. He’ll be off on another idea tomorrow.”"

Google Deals New Blow to Alt-Right Social Network Gab,www.thedailybeast.com,William.Sommer@thedailybeast.com (Will Sommer),04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/google-deals-new-blow-to-alt-right-social-network-gab,"ONE STEP AT A TIME Google Deals New Blow to Alt-Right Social Network Gab Google and Mozilla have taken aim at Gab’s ‘Dissenter,’ an internet-wide comment section. 04.12.19 6:29 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast
Google and Mozilla banned a browser extension made by the social network Gab on Thursday, dealing another blow to the racist alt-right’s favorite social platform .
The new bans target Dissenter , a browser extension created by Gab that adds a parallel comment section to any web page on the internet. The decision from the two tech companies makes it harder for people to add Dissenter to their browsers.
The extension allowed Gab commenters to avoid moderation on the website’s usual comment sections, leaving their posts instead on a separate overlay visible to anyone with the Dissenter plug-in installed in Google’s Chrome or Mozilla’s Firefox. As a result, Dissenter comments often featured the same discussions popular with Gab’s far-right user base: fervent support for Trump and Gamergate-style complaints over perceived “social justice warrior” infiltration of various video games and movies by liberals.
In a statement, a Mozilla spokesperson told The Daily Beast that Dissenter had violated Mozilla’s rules against hate speech.
“Mozilla does not endorse hate speech and we do not permit our platforms to be used to promote such content,” the statement reads.
Gab founder Andrew Torba said in a statement that Dissenter had been blocked by tech companies that “want to destroy free expression online.” In response to the bans that make it harder to install Dissenter on mainstream browsers, Torba claims that Gab will now be launching its own browser as well.
Google didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Mozilla and Google reportedly banned Dissenter ahead of a story from the Columbia Journalism Review about the browser extension. The Dissenter comment section on that CJR story quickly filled up with angry users who blamed the story’s authors for the bans.
Torba himself appeared in the Dissenter posts, denouncing one expert quoted in the story as “pure SOY”—a reference to the fringe belief that eating soy makes men feminine.
Gab has already lost the services of PayPal, GoDaddy, and a number of other tech companies after Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers allegedly used the social network to announce his plans. In March, Torba claims, Gab was even kicked off the crowdfunding site that it had used to raise roughly $2 million.
Torba launched Dissenter in February in an attempt to create a “free speech comment section for the internet.” Gab claimed on Thursday that Dissenter has more than 85,000 users—although the platform’s user base figures have been repeatedly questioned by critics .
The bans from Google and Mozilla now put Dissenter’s user growth, whatever the actual figure is, in doubt. While Chrome and Firefox users can still install the extension through the Dissenter site, they have to go through a complicated, lengthy process that requires downloading Dissenter’s code and attempting to set it up themselves.
Before the bans, by contrast, Dissenter users could easily install it through Chrome or Mozilla add-on stores. "

Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Getty
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is approaching an LGBT crossroads.
The faith, commonly known as the Mormon church or LDS church, recently rolled back a November 2015 statement that declared same-sex marriage to be an act of apostasy and placed restrictions on children of same-sex couples who wish to be baptized. (Lest one think this constitutes a full reversal of the LDS church’s anti-LGBT positions, however, a top leader reiterated that same-sex marriage is still seen as “a serious transgression.”)
But a growing number of Mormons are becoming more progressive than their spiritual leaders on issues like same-sex marriage. No one knows that better than Nathan Kitchen , president of the Affirmation support organization for LGBT Mormons, which now serves about 6,000 people at its conferences.
When Kitchen came out as gay to his Mormon family six years ago, he told The Daily Beast, “half of my brothers and sisters were not affirming [and] it was difficult for my parents.” Now, Kitchen is engaged to be married in November—and his whole family will be there.
“If someone would have told me that five, six years ago when I came out, I would not have believed it,” said Kitchen.
There is empirical data to back up Kitchen’s experience: According to surveys conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute , Mormon opposition to same-sex marriage fell from 68 percent to 53 percent from 2013 to 2017.
That may well below the current strong majority support for same-sex marriage in the United States overall—but as The Salt Lake Tribune noted in its analysis of PRRI data , millennial Mormons have now crossed the 50-percent support threshold.
In fact, in a large-scale study she conducted for her book The Next Mormons: How Millennials are Changing the LDS Church , author Jana Riess found that LGBT issues are the third most common reason why millennials leave the faith. (As a transgender ex-Mormon myself, I can certainly relate to that sentiment.)
The LGBT millennial Mormon exodus is understandable. Even though the LDS church rolled back its November 2015 policy two weeks ago, top leaders still teach that same-sex sexual activity is sinful. Transgender members face potential discipline, too . The severity of the Mormon church’s LGBT positions may have been adjusted but it is still far from being an LGBT-affirming faith.
Still, an increasingly vocal contingent of LGBT Mormons are holding out hope that their faith may one day more fully accept them. From his vantage point, Kitchen believes that that LGBT Mormons who stay in the faith can “find themselves being bridge builders and having some really good constructive interactions with church members.”
“But those that go, I salute [them], I understand, I know why that needs to be—there’s no reason to hang around and wait for happiness at some distant point in the future,” he said.
Reached for comment for this story, the LDS church referred to its statement on the rollback of the November 2015 policy , in which leaders stopped short of apologizing for the policy, but said, “We want to reduce the hate and contention so common today.”
“We are optimistic that a majority of people—whatever their beliefs and orientations—long for better understanding and less contentious communications,” said Mormon apostle Dallin H. Oaks. “That is surely our desire, and we seek the help of our members and others to attain it.”
When the 2015 policy was first rolled back earlier this month, Kitchen felt an initial relief that the pain so many in Affirmation felt would now be at least partially allayed.
In practice, the policy had led to familial separation and trauma for LGBT Mormons. But after the surprising announcement had time to sink in, Kitchen’s views shifted.
“We can never go back as a community,” he said, “because this event changed us. We move forward, I think, stronger and more resilient and more aware of ourselves because of what we lived under in the past three and a half years in the church.” “They’re going to do what they’re going to do. But what we’re doing is just saying, ‘See me, hear my story’”
Instead of waiting around for more statements or rollbacks, Kitchen added, he wants to keep building a community of LGBT Mormons and former Mormons who stand strong together—and allow policy announcements to come if and when they may.
“I know that lobbying the church does not work,” he told The Daily Beast. “They’re going to do what they’re going to do. But what we’re doing is just saying, ‘See me, hear my story.’”
“I think that we need to be proud of what we’ve endured and what we’ve been through,” Kitchen continued, “and realize that we can move forward personally regardless of what the church says.”
For those closely watching the LDS church’s positions on LGBT issues, the decade following the faith’s involvement in California’s Proposition 8 has been a rollercoaster. The church, which can have a strong influence on Utah state politics, opposed same-sex marriage but in 2015 supported a successful compromise law that granted crucial non-discrimination protections to LGBT people with some religious exemptions .
The following year, the church issued a statement opposing conversion therapy—but also effectively torpedoed the chances of an LGBT-inclusive hate crimes bill. This year, however the hate crimes bill finally passed thanks to the efforts of advocacy groups like Equality Utah and to the church’s fading opposition to the law . “I’m very optimistic because I really am seeing that parents, especially nowadays, they don’t want to leave their children behind”
LGBT advocates in Utah have been drawing the LDS church’s attention to the unusually high rate of youth suicide in the state, which they believe is driven in large part by the rejection of LGBT youth . At the same time, the support group Encircle has opened centers for LGBT families and youth in both Provo, Utah and Salt Lake City.
This budding support amid all the heartache and turbulence has left Kitchen feeling hopeful: “I’m very optimistic because I really am seeing that parents, especially nowadays, they don’t want to leave their children behind.”
Affirmation, too, has seen growth in its reach, both at its conferences and on Facebook.
“The reach is growing because the interest is growing, both not only in the community but outside of the community,” said Kitchen.
But whether that growing LGBT support leads to substantive policy change remains to be seen. Earlier this year, United Methodist Church leaders arrived at a heartbreaking split on LGBT issues—but ultimately chose to shore up anti-LGBT policies , leading to outrage and sorrow for LGBT-affirming members and congregations.
As support for same-sex marriage and transgender rights grows within the faith, the Mormon church could be headed for a similar moment of reckoning. Even as millennial Mormons pull the membership left, the faith’s top leaders, known as apostles—who are currently an average of 71 years old—belong to either the Silent Generation or the Baby Boomer generation, both of which are much less accepting of LGBT people .
That’s why Kitchen isn’t pinning his hopes to policy change—but rather to the community of LGBT Mormons he wants to keep building.
“I don’t want to just sit around and wait for something like that,” he said of possible future LGBT reforms. “The leaders of the church need to get that answer—and meanwhile I’m going to be me, and I’m going to draw my friends, my family, and my community into my circle of love. That’s where I focus.” READ THIS LIST"

Something horrible happened here, and no one is quite sure what. 04.12.19 9:52 PM ET Benjamin Kemper for The Daily Beast
Dark tourism, the type of sightseeing that revolves around tragedy and death, is more popular than ever—just ask the half a million people who queued up last year to wander Paris’ catacombs. But one of the world’s most bone-chilling destinations, the Anatori Crypts in northern Georgia, has surprisingly flown under the radar of the goosebump-seeking masses.
From afar, it doesn’t look like much: three crumbling stone structures perched on a ridge. An abandoned hamlet, you might think, or an old lookout post (after all, Chechnya is just two miles away). But peek inside a cobwebbed window, and you’ll be met with a scene so macabre it might knock you off your feet: skulls, femurs, vertebrae, and teeth piled so high that you can hardly see the floor. Something horrible happened in Anatori, and no one is quite sure what.
But there are clues. For starters, the original buildings had no doors or windows (the openings you see today are a recent refit), indicating that their tenants were intentionally walled in. Yet there are no signs of struggle, like scratch marks or weapons or bashed-in skulls, ruling out the houses’ use as jails or torture chambers. In fact, a closer look at the skeletal remains reveals relatively peaceful deaths: adult corpses curled around infant ones in a final embrace, others with arms folded meditatively across their chests.
Why would these ancient tribesmen knowingly, willingly lock themselves away to die among dozens of rotting corpses? According to historians and local oral history, they were making a last-ditch effort to save their compatriots from the plague.
Georgia’s location at the crossroads between Asia and Europe on the Silk Road made the country particularly susceptible to exotic infections. It’s unclear whether the specific plague that swept Khevsureti—the mountain region where Anatori is located—came on the backs of Tamerlane’s armies or Silk Road merchants, but local experts agree that it likely arrived in the second half of the 14th century, around the same time that the Black Death was sweeping Europe.
The plague, which locals called zhami , was so brutal, says Tinatin Ididze, licensed trekking guide and founder of Caucasus Adventure Tours, that there came a point when there were too many bodies to bury and too few survivors to bury them. Instead of dying at home and potentially infecting others, “sick villagers would walk to the crypts, lie down inside, and wait for death,” she said, adding that new arrivals were tasked with freeing up real estate on the stone beds by throwing the freshly deceased cadavers onto the floor—hence the skeletal pileup you can still see today.
As you tiptoe around Anatori’s long-forgotten necropolises, it’s hard not to shudder at the fate of these unlucky ancients, who not only knew their death was imminent but spent their final days in pitch darkness, alone or with other sufferers, surrounded by cadavers of people they probably knew. But their story is as inspiring as it is devastating: Those interred here made the ultimate sacrifice so that their tight-knit community would have a shot at survival.
But in the end, the whole village of Anatori perished. The crypts, built to last, are all that remain.
Call it what you will—dark tourism, black tourism, or otherwise—but coming face to face with tragedy is one of the most powerful ways to connect with a place and reflect on your vitality. Anatori is a case in point.
Getting there
The Anatori Crypts are situated in the northeastern region of Khevsureti, midway between the villages of Shatili and Mutso. Both are worth visiting for their splendid mountain countryside and impressive stone citadels, which warded off invaders through the centuries. You’ll need a 4x4 vehicle to access the region, and hiring a Georgian-speaking guide is recommended; InterGeorgia Travel is dependable and affordable ($150/day flat rate for up to four passengers).

The Most Expensive Object Lost on the Titanic,www.thedailybeast.com,Allison McNearney,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-most-expensive-object-lost-on-the-titanic-merry-joseph-blondels-la-circassienne-au-bain,"Lost Masterpieces The Most Expensive Object Lost on the Titanic According to claims filed afterwards, Merry-Joseph Blondel's 'La Circassienne au Bain' was the most expensive object to be lost when the Titanic sank in 1912. 04.12.19 9:47 PM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Alamy/Getty
As the doomed Titanic began its final countdown before disappearing under the sea 107 years ago Monday, there was a last gasp of activity on the deck.
These scenes have become well known thanks to big-screen adaptations of the disaster: the rush to load the few remaining life boats with women and children, the brave musicians who took up their instruments for one last concert, the tilt of the deck as the ship began to tip into the ocean.
Mauritz Håkan Björnström-Steffansson knew these final moments all too well—he experienced them first hand. His life was saved at the last minute by a frantic leap into a nearby lifeboat as the Titanic began to sink, but 1,517 passengers and crew were not so lucky. Nor was his prized possession, an oil painting by the renowned 19th century French painter Merry-Joseph Blondel.
“La Circassienne au Bain,” also known in its early days as “Une Baigneuse,” made its debut at the Paris Salon of 1814 just as Blondel’s career was beginning to take off, though it took a few years before the critics warmed up to his bathing Circassian woman.
But in 1912, it reached its pinnacle of fame when it became the most expensive piece of property buried with the Ship of Dreams, at least according to the claims filed.
Starting in the late 17th century, the annual Paris Salon was the place for artists to exhibit their work in France. The state-sponsored Salons were where new artists were discovered, where established artists solidified their reputations, and where the public was invited to join in the cultural conversation.
Blondel would eventually become one of France’s esteemed neoclassical painters. Throughout his long career, he was the recipient of public art commissions that continue to decorate some of the most important buildings in France including the Louvre and the Palace of Versailles; he was awarded some of the top honors of his day, namely the Prix de Rome in 1803 (courtesy of Louis XVIII) and the Légion d’Honneur two decades later (with thanks to Charles X); and he was named to prestigious academic positions.
But early in his career, in 1814, he was surely delighted when four of his works were accepted for exhibition in the Louvre rooms at the annual Paris Salon. “La Circassienne au Bain” was among them.
Initially, the historical loss of this work on the Titanic was near total. Not only did the actual painting perish at sea, but there was little information left behind as to what it once looked like—few descriptions existed and there were no reproductions or photographs of the original, only one engraving.
But in the early 2010s, an artist working under the pseudonym “John Parker” conductive extensive research on Blondel’s lost work and created a reproduction of “La Circassienne au Bain” that was auctioned off by Plymouth Auction Rooms in 2016 for £2,700. (The artist did not respond to an interview request sent via the auction house, which also declined to comment for this piece.)
Parker’s reproduction shows a classical setting of an open-air bath in which Blondel painted a nude Circassian woman stepping into the water with one foot, the other balanced behind her resulting in a figure arranged in the traditional Greek contrapposto style.
The woman’s emerald green robe is thrown over the short concrete wall behind her. She looks off to the side towards it as her arm extends out, both showing off her figure and in a gesture to remove the remaining transparent silk scarf that provides her with just a touch of modesty.
Despite her nudity, the woman’s hair remains in an elaborately braided updo and her ears are garnished with appropriately dazzling baubles. Lush trees and foliage hover beyond the open walls of the bath. “His design and color lack truth and finesse, and we can say nothing in favor of this work, except that it is executed by a very skillful artist in practice”
When Blondel showed this work in 1814, he had only been back in France for a few years after his stint studying art in Italy. Three years later, he would win a gold medal at the Salon, but in 1814, at least one of the four paintings, the one that was doomed to a watery grave a century later, did not receive overwhelming praise.
“His design and color lack truth and finesse, and we can say nothing in favor of this work, except that it is executed by a very skillful artist in practice,” French artist and art critic François Séraphin Delpech wrote of “La Circassienne au Bain” in his review of works at that year’s Salon.
Delpech’s pronouncement was representative of the critical response to the piece: “meh.” But that allegedly changed a few years later after Blondel’s star had risen higher. When the public took a shine to the nude bather, the critics decided it wasn’t so bad after all. If not his most famous work, “La Circassienne au Bain” became well regarded.
Fast forward nearly a century and hopscotch a few European countries north, and Mauritz Håkan Björnström-Steffansson enters the tragic story of “La Circassienne au Bain.”
In 1912, Björnström-Steffansson was the 28-year-old son of a Swedish pulp baron, and he was preparing to travel to the U.S. to further his studies. As was only natural for a prominent young lad in that year, he had secured passage on the inaugural voyage of the Titanic, the ship being hailed as the largest and grandest to ever sail the seas.
Before he left, Björnström-Steffansson purchased a masterpiece—the famed French painter Merry-Joseph Blondel’s early work “La Circassienne au Bain”—to take with him.
What drew him to this piece, what he paid for it, or why he decided to purchase it before traveling to America to start a new life is unknown. What is known is that when Björnström-Steffansson boarded the Titanic on a first-class ticket, the Blondel was with him.
During the early days of the voyage, Björnström-Steffansson fell in with a group of other first-class passengers including the English businessman Hugh Woolner. It is from the testimony of Woolner during a U.S. congressional inquiry into the disaster that we know the details of what Björnström-Steffansson experienced on that fateful night.
On the evening of April 14, Woolner and Björnström-Steffansson were in the smoking room when the Titanic struck an iceberg. “We felt a sort of stopping, a sort of, not exactly shock, but a sort of slowing down; and then we sort of felt a rip that gave a sort of a slight twist to the whole room,” Woolner testified .
After retrieving life jackets from their respective quarters, Woolner said the two men met up back on deck and began assisting women and children into the lifeboats. They also came to the aid of First Officer Murdoch when a group of men tried to swarm one of the starboard-side boats.
When most of the boats had been filled and dispatched, the two friends decided to go to the A deck one story below to make sure all of the passengers had evacuated to higher quarters. Woolner said it was completely empty of people.
“It was absolutely deserted, and the electric lights along the ceiling of A deck were beginning to turn red, just a glow, a red sort of glow. So I said to Steffanson [sic]: ‘This is getting rather a tight corner. I do not like being inside these closed windows. Let us go out through the door at the end.’ And as we went out through the door the sea came in onto the deck at our feet.” “I jumped too, and hit the gunwale with my chest, which had on this life preserver, of course and I sort of bounced off the gunwale and caught the gunwale with my fingers, and slipped off backwards”
Woolner testified that they then went out onto the gunwale to prepare to dive into the ocean to escape being drowned in the enclosed A deck.
Once outside, they happened to notice that one of the last lifeboats was still being lowered into the water. There was a little bit of room left in the boat, so the men decided to make a jump for it. (The authors of On a Sea of Glass note that the duo probably knew that this boat was still making its way to the sea when they went downstairs, and also that jumping into it from below would be their only shot at survival.)
“[Björnström-Steffansson] jumped out and tumbled in head over heels into the bow, and I jumped too, and hit the gunwale with my chest, which had on this life preserver, of course and I sort of bounced off the gunwale and caught the gunwale with my fingers, and slipped off backwards.”
By the time they were both safely inside, the Titanic was rapidly sinking. The lifeboat was quickly paddled away from the doomed ship, and Woolner estimated they were about 150 yards out when the Titanic disappeared under the water. Both men were saved.
Nearly a year after the Titanic sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912, The New York Times reported that claims for more than $6 million had been filed against the White Star Line for loss of life, personal injury, and loss of property. In the later category, there were claims for jewelry, rare books, cars, a set of bagpipes, and a signed picture of Garibaldi.
But the most expensive claim of all was by Björnström-Steffansson who requested $100,000 (or the equivalent of over $2 million today) in compensation for the drowning of “La Circassienne au Bain.”
It’s unclear how much money Björnström-Steffansson received. In the end, White Star settled all of the claims for a total of only $664,000.
There was one bright spot for the Swedish businessman, who ended up making the U.S. his home.
Five years after the sinking of the Titanic, he married a woman to whom he was introduced by a fellow Titanic passenger, one he and Woolner had helped to save. The Björnström-Steffanssons remained married for the rest of their long lives. READ THIS LIST"
The LGBT Equality Act Began Life in 1974. It's Still Waiting to Be Passed.,www.thedailybeast.com,Nico Lang Kate Sosin,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-lgbt-equality-act-began-life-in-1974-its-still-waiting-to-be-passed,"History Lesson The LGBT Equality Act Began Life in 1974. It's Still Waiting to Be Passed. If passed, the Equality Act would amend the Civil Rights Act to add protections for LGBTQ people in public spaces, employment, housing, and education. But it's not a new idea. 04.12.19 9:46 PM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Getty
When the news broke that Rep. Bella Abzug had introduced a bill to protect lesbian and gay people from discrimination to Congress, David Mixner cut out the article and hid it the top drawer of his dresser. The year was 1974. Mixner, later an adviser to then-President Bill Clinton, wasn’t yet out as gay.
“Most of us hated ourselves and didn’t think we deserved equality,” the nationally renowned activist and author remembers. “That was a symbol of great hope to have someone in the United States [Congress] say these people deserve equality.” The Equality Act of 1974, which never moved out of committee , changed Mixner’s life.
“Two years later, I came out in good part because I thought they were people who believed we will normal and OK and that we deserve protection,” he said.
The original bill stated all people should be free from discrimination “regardless of their race, color, religion, sex, marital status, sexual orientation or national origin.” Gender identity protections, which cover transgender people, weren’t part of the original language.
The bill covered public accommodations, education and other business services.
For the first time in 45 years, a House of Congress could pass an iteration of the bill, which now includes transgender protections.
On March 13, congressional Democrats introduced the Equality Act, an updated version of the 1974 bill. It then had its first ever hearing in the House Judiciary Committee.
If passed, the landmark nondiscrimination bill would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to add protections for LGBTQ people in public spaces, employment, housing, education, federal programs, credit, and jury service.
The Equality Act is well-positioned to make historic advances in 2019. Its reintroduction was greeted with 240 total cosponsors in the U.S. House and Senate, meaning that 45 percent of Congress has already come out in support of the bill.
If signed, it would be the first national nondiscrimination law protecting LGBTQ people.
Few of the bill’s original sponsors in 1974 will be alive to see that victory, however. Abzug, who reintroduced the landmark legislation the following year as the Civil Rights Amendments of 1975, died in 1998.
Elizabeth Holtzman, one of the living sponsors of the 1975 bill, said she was “very proud to be an early supporter of that legislation.”
“I've always fought against discrimination,” the former New York congresswoman said. “I was in the civil rights movement in the south in the early days of the civil rights movement in the early 1960s. I fought for women’s rights when I first got to Congress. This just seemed like part of the effort to fight for justice.”
Of the 23 co-sponsors who signed onto the 1975 bill, just a handful are still alive. The Daily Beast successfully contacted John Burton and Charles Rangel, whose memories of the 44-year-old legislation have faded somewhat over the years. “I don’t recall now anybody ever asking why among all the human and civil rights that I was sent to Washington to support, why would I be supporting gay rights. It never, never was a courageous thing on my part”
When asked what led him to support gay rights decades before the country caught up to equality, Rangel told The Daily Beast it was the “right thing to do.”
“I don’t recall now anybody ever asking why among all the human and civil rights that I was sent to Washington to support, why would I be supporting gay rights,” says the retired California congressman. “It never, never was a courageous thing on my part.”
Burton, whose recollections of the bill were frequently punctuated with expletives and colorful asides, remembers being asked what his mother would think of him supporting gay rights. She was a “pretty devout Catholic,” he recalled. The former California congressman shot back: “She wouldn't give a shit one way or the other.”
While Burton claims what other people did in the bedroom wasn’t a “big deal” to him, he says the issue was bigger than sexual orientation. It was about continuing America’s march toward progress.
“When I grew up, there weren't any African Americans playing basketball in the pro league,” he told The Daily Beast. “I remember when abortion was a crime, and the sentence for marijuana got you 20 years in prison. The country is evolving. It’s not gone as fast as it should have, but it’s gone pretty fast.”
John D’Emilio, the renowned LGBTQ historian, remembers the bill’s reintroduction in 1975 well.
The Civil Rights Amendments of 1975 coincided with a pair of major milestones in the equality movement. Lambda Legal, the advocacy organization which lobbies for LGBTQ equality through the court system, was founded the year prior. So was the National Gay Task Force, which is now known as the National LGBTQ Task Force. “It's not like there was even the slightest chance that any progress would be made on it. It was more of a symbolic action at that point”
D’Emilio says he paid little attention to the legislation at the time.
“It's not like there was even the slightest chance that any progress would be made on it,” D’Emilio told Daily Beast. “It was more of a symbolic action at that point.”
When it was originally introduced in 1974, only Abzug signed onto the bill. Despite the addition of names like Shirley Chisholm and Ed Koch, supporters of the Civil Rights Amendments of 1975 had no illusions about its chances. This was just two years after the American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental illness and three years before Harvey Milk’s assassination.
“No one expected that it would pass or be signed into law,” Task Force Director of Advocacy and Action Stacey Long Simmons said.
As the LGBTQ movement advanced issue after issue, the basic protections introduced in 1974 took a backseat to things like marriage and open military service. While Wisconsin became the first state to ban employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in 1982, 29 states have yet to pass fully inclusive LGBTQ protections.
No state took action against gender identity discrimination until 1993, when Minnesota passed its Human Rights Act. That law still only offered protection in employment, meaning that trans people could still be denied housing because of who they are.
Even that step went farther than the national nondiscrimination bills in 1974 and 1975, which snubbed gender identity entirely.
D’Emilio believes the legislation—which met notable resistance from trans leaders because of its partial solution to LGBTQ inequality—was about taking a first step toward the future. Few of its proponents would have predicted, however, that it would take 45 years for the bill to clear a single chamber.
“You have to start a process at some point,” said D’Emilio.
As was the case four decades ago, even the Equality Act’s most ardent supporters say the legislation faces a tough road to passage. Republicans hold a six-seat majority in the Senate. Meanwhile, President Trump has voiced support for a bill that would legalize discrimination against LGBTQ people by allowing businesses to deny them services if they cite religious convictions.
While the bill will continue to face challenges under an administration that has unilaterally rolled back LGBTQ rights, Holtzman believes its day is coming.
“For people who have been struggling against discrimination and against bigotry, you can't lose heart,” Holtzman claimed. “There's still so much hatred, anger, and ongoing struggle, but enormous progress has been made. We have to recognize that.” READ THIS LIST"
The Aristocratic Spirit Of Goats and Sheep,www.thedailybeast.com,Kelly.Caminero@thedailybeast.com (Kelly Caminero),04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kevin-horan-photographs-the-aristocratic-spirit-of-goats-and-sheep,"© Kevin Horan 1/12
""Goats and sheep have served us from the earliest of times. They have walked the world with us. By paying attention, we honor the musings of the sheep and the jests of the goats. And so these pictures make a kind of meditation on our earthly brother- and sisterhood. When we draw a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of life, we make the world a smaller place—for ourselves. Why on earth would we want to do that?” – Kevin Horan
Goats and Sheep: A Portrait Farm is a beautiful selection of images by American Portraiture photographer Kevin Horan. When Horan moved from Chicago to rural Whidbey Island in the state of Washington, he discovered a local farm full with gregarious goats and sheep. They would often visit his home multiple times a week. He wanted to photograph these animals in a way that captured their individualistic personalities—similar to how we'd capture humans on camera.
So Horan photographed his new neighbors (the goats and sheep) as though they were privileged aristocratic men and women coming for a portrait. He built a small studio on his farm and waited patiently for the sitter to strike a pose. Each animal showcases an unique personality with a variety of gestures and expressions.
This book also features an essay by the writer Elena Passarello in which she asks us to imagine the evolution of the flora and fauna of our earth after it was smashed to pieces by an asteroid 66 million years ago. Regarding the animals pictured in this book and their appeal to humans, she writes: “Sheep and goats are perhaps the first species that you willfully domesticate, as the omnipresent wolf-cum-dogs just started crashing your parties thousands of years beforehand. But from the moment you reconnect onward, in the eleven thousand years that roll toward our present day, you and sheep and goats remain utterly inseparable.”

The Flaming Lips’ Wayne Coyne: ‘I Don’t Even Consider Donald Trump’,www.thedailybeast.com,Jeff Slate,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-flaming-lips-wayne-coyne-i-dont-even-consider-donald-trump,"The Flaming Lips’ Wayne Coyne: ‘I Don’t Even Consider Donald Trump’ Gabriel Olsen/Getty The lovably eccentric frontman of The Flaming Lips opens up about their new concept album ‘King’s Mouth,’ his attitude toward our divisive president, and much, much more. Jeff Slate 04.12.19 9:44 PM ET
T he Flaming Lips have always been one of rock’s most consistently weird and confounding bands . For every album like 1999’s near-perfect The Soft Bulletin or 2002’s Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots , there are projects that many have considered creative follies, like their Pink Floyd homage from 2009, and the 2008 film Christmas On Mars , not to mention their 2015 collaboration with Miley Cyrus .
But taken together, the arch of the Flaming Lips’ creative output has been consistently fresh—especially for a major label, chart-topping band—with the artistically adventurous moments outweighing the misses by a mile, as evidenced on their expanded, deluxe edition of 2018's Greatest Hits, Volume 1 .
Nowhere is the band’s bold vision more evident than on its new album King’s Mouth , out on limited edition vinyl for Record Store Day, with a full release coming later this year. A full-on, old-school concept album, King’s Mouth again breaks new ground—while retaining enough of a sonic connection to the Soft Bulletin and Yoshimi -era Lips music to make it feel immediately familiar to the band’s legion of fans.
Shamanic lead singer Wayne Coyne recently spoke to The Daily Beast about what King’s Mouth is all about, how Donald Trump is irrelevant to him, and why keeping it local is really what it’s all about.
In the run-up to the release of the album, there was a lot of chatter on the internet that given its title— King’s Mouth —it would be a Trump parable, or Brexit parable. So is it allegorical? Because you’ve told me before that you don’t see yourself as a political artist, no matter how outspoken about your beliefs you sometimes are.
Wayne Coyne: The same thing happened when Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots was almost turned into a musical. There was a brief meeting—a doomed meeting, in a sense—with Aaron Sorkin. And he thought it could be about the Bush administration and 9/11. And honestly, it could be, with Aaron Sorkin working on it. But he asked me if I’d like that, and I said, “No.” As much as I don’t like Trump, and as much as I don’t like Brexit, and as much as I didn’t like George W. Bush, I’m just not in that world. My stuff isn’t sarcasm, and it’s not political satire. In hindsight, I’m probably the only person who’s ever said no to Aaron Sorkin in the last 30 years. And I do wish, in a sense, that I would have said yes and let him turn it into something more overtly political, because I think it then could have had two meanings. It could have the meaning I wanted it to, and it could have had the meaning he wanted. But part of me probably would have horribly regretted it, too. So with King’s Mouth , because everybody is pulling their hair out about Trump, people are looking for any story that seems to be political. “We’re going to win here in the end, right?”
And the idea has been around for quite a while, hasn’t it?
That’s right. King’s Mouth started way, way back in 2014 at our gallery . We would have parties at our gallery, and people would be in there 4:00 in the morning—10 people, all laying on each other in this cylinder we’d built, looking at these crazy movies that were all in sync with the sound and lights we’d created for it. And then the curator for the American Visionary Arts Museum from Baltimore—a music critic guy that I’ve known for a while—became interested in us doing the King’s Mouth installation there. He got us to go to the next level. So the album started out initially as music that we made for the installation, as this wordless, abstract story. And for the first year or two, it was just that. But it really compelled us. Because at the end of experiencing the installation, you would kind of walk away feeling like you’d received some biblical message from outer space. People would say, “What is this? What’s the story?” So the curator at the museum said, “You should just make up a story.” And I did. Just willy-nilly, really. Because everything always has to be done in such a hurry. “We need it tomorrow!” But I think sometimes that really helps when you have to just go with your intuition.
You’ve collaborated with Miley Cyrus, and worked with orchestras on live versions of Soft Bulletin and Yoshimi , and you’ve got Mick Jones from The Clash on this album, and now you’re saying this piece was in large part inspired by this gallery owner from Baltimore. There are very few artists who are as open to collaboration as you guys are. It seems you really feed off other people’s ideas and intuition for maybe finding your path forward.
We talk about this within the group a lot. I think artists can be pretty satisfied working on their own, in the sense that if you do a painting in your house, you feel as though it’s great, and when you finish it, it stays in your house, and you’re pretty satisfied. But somewhere along the way, you do wonder, “Is this working? Because I’m not just baking these cookies for myself. I do want people to like them. And I do want this message to be understood.” And so I think there’s plenty of things that I get to do that are absolutely me within the Flaming Lips music. There’s never a day that I think, “There should be more me going on there.” But I want to know that it’s having an impact. I want to know that the bits that are supposed to be funny make people laugh, and the ones that are sad make people sad. So that type of evolution, where it’s not just me, and there are other people involved—where I have to trust their actions and they have to trust mine—if they are really good at what they’re doing, the relationship really is all of it. It’s not resentment and it’s not a competition. It’s love. And King’s Mouth becoming an installation, and then everything that evolved from that was a five-year evolution of work, work, work, that was truly collaborative in the best sense.
The album has such a cinematic feel to it, and such a broad palette sonically. Do you feel as though that long gestation period, when you were working with orchestras, helped expand your horizons creatively, too?
Well, when we started to come up with the sound palette, part of it was that the story is set in—I hate to say it, because we didn’t think of this at the time—but kind of a Game of Thrones scenario. But in the future, and from outer space, although in sort of medieval times. So we would say, “Medieval, from outer space? The Flaming Lips are perfect for that.” So whenever we ran into the question of “what’s this going to sound like?” we would easily go for these big brass horns and big choirs—big, big choirs! We wanted it to be evocative of medieval monks. And so we veered away from being a rock group. And the story, I think, really helped. I know that it’s one of my dilemmas, thinking something needs 100 pieces, when in the end it only really needs five, because when we have time to keep working on something, it easily gets giant and huge and out of control—usually in the first week we work on it—but over three or four years we hone it back to just three or four essential things. And I think that process has really worked well for us. “ Really, I don’t even consider Donald Trump. To me, what he wants is to be considered. He loves being hated. He loves being the dumbass. ” — Wayne Coyne
That’s almost like when Paul McCartney came up with the idea of The Beatles not being The Beatles, but being Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band in the studio, because it freed them to be whatever they wanted to be. Did the medieval/futuristic approach free you from being the Flaming Lips, in a way?
Absolutely! Because now we’re not the Flaming Lips, we’re really telling this other story. The minute I jump into fantasy, I convey more truth than if I was trying to sing like James Taylor. I mean, James Taylor does it amazingly, but I’m not like that. So I never sing about me. I sing about pink robots, which is, on some level that I’m not so aware of, really just me singing about my dumb little life. But I would be utterly embarrassed and not capable of doing it if I didn’t have these characters and these otherworldly things to put it into. And I’m aware of that. I don’t feel like I’m hiding that. I just like it better when it’s not about me, even though it has to be about me. Really, it’s the only way it means anything. And I do love telling a story. I think that’s part of why we love making records so much, we kind of feel like this song can go with that song, and that song, and then it becomes something else.
So it’s not Donald Trump; it’s not Brexit. But you are very vocal about the times we live in. I’ve been to Oklahoma recently, near where you’re from, so I’ve got an idea of where you’re coming from. Tell me your perspective, as a blue guy in a red state, or a psychedelic guy in a red state.
The king in my story, the reason he’s king, is because he serves everybody. He loves everybody. And he’s stronger than everybody, so he helps everybody. Nobody serves him. That’s why the people love him so much. And his head is connected to the universe, and he dies tragically, but even though he’s dead, his giant head is still connected to this piece of the universe. So their way of having this memorial to him is by cutting off his head, because his head is so big, you can climb in through his dead mouth and still see the universe that’s connected to the top of his head. I mean, it’s a fantastical biblical cartoon, but the king in my thing, he’s not a ruler; he’s not an evil king. The reason they cut off his head is because they want to make a statue out of him. The king we had in our gallery, that’s the way I kind of saw it: He was this giant man and they cut his head off because his head happens to be connected to this psychedelic porthole that you can go inside of and you can see through.
He’s beloved and generous, so he’s an anti-Trump character. Is it a reflection of what we’re going through?
Maybe that’s the subconscious parts I was talking about before that I’m putting in there. But really, I don’t even consider Donald Trump. To me, what he wants is to be considered. He loves being hated. He loves being the dumbass. I’ve never really ever thought, “Oh, who’s running the country? Who’s the president? I guess I should care because it’s going to affect my life.” Seven months ago, here in Oklahoma, pot became legal. And Donald Trump is in office going on two years. But the city that I live in, Oklahoma City, is more progressive and freakier than it’s ever been with any president, ever. So I’ve always told people, and I still say this, even now, “It doesn’t matter who’s president.”
I was more glad it was Barack Obama than I’m glad it’s now Donald Trump, but what you do in your own house, in your own neighborhood, in your own little part of the city? You can have an impact on that. Your vote might have an impact on who becomes president, or not, but what you do in your little city trumps that by a thousand percent. That’s a lot more important. Most people don’t want to do anything with their neighbors, but they want to have some say in who’s the president of the United States. And I say, I’m just the opposite. I want to take care of my neighborhood, and my neighborhood to take care of me. I don’t know what the president’s going to do for me, but I know I can do things in my neighborhood and my neighbors can do that for me.
How did you connect with Mick Jones of The Clash, and why did you feel he was the right narrator for King’s Mouth?
I really can’t tell you why we were so insistent that it be Mick Jones. I mean, I fully expected him to not be interested and we would just move on. We had tried some of the narration where each of us in the band did, but it became, “Well, if no one else in the whole world will do it, we’ll do it. But let’s start at the top.” But Mick was the only one that we were trying to get.
It’s like, Stanley Unwin, who did the narration for the Small Faces’ Ogdens’ Nut Gone Flake . It wouldn’t be the same album without him. I can’t imagine anybody else but Mick Jones telling the story.
I was so surprised and pleased. But I’m always self-conscious. I kept thinking, “Until this thing actually comes out, if Mick says he changed his mind, I’ll say I understand.” You know what I mean? People would remind me, as we were finishing up the record, “I can’t believe you got Mick Jones on this.” And I was like, “Oh, fuck, I know.” So I wanted this to happen, and I think it’s great, and now that the record’s getting ready to come out, I’m feeling like it’s real.
It sounds like you didn’t really have a contingency plan, which is kind of the cool thing.
Well, if Mick had not wanted to do it, I would have put one together. After I begged and begged! I would have said, “Don, you’ve got to work on it.” Because my second and third plan would have been to keep trying for Mick. I remember when we did collaborations with Yoko Ono, back in 2011, Sean Lennon saying, “Yoko’s not going to do it.” And I was like, “Come on. I’m sure that we can get her to do it.” And I think she said no seven or eight times, and then I think I just caught her by surprise. Like she didn’t remember that she had said no, and she suddenly said yes. So I was like, “Well, let’s do it!” So it never hurts to ask. And then you ask again until they say yes."

I n an exhibit hall at the Gaillard Center in Charleston—a ballroom sectioned into corridors by folding tables, cheered up by extravagant backdrops—I stood near the giraffe paintings, but I was eyeing the shotguns at Westley Richards .
A beautiful wooden display box held a seductive blued steel barrel with high-polished walnut stock complete with intricate filigree. Even from across the room, I knew it was out of my league (and price range), but I wanted a closer look. I was headed that way, when I heard the fellow manning the booth tell a potenial buyer that one of his shotguns cost $175,000. I’ve looked at houses selling for less than that. I turned on my heel and walked back out into town past the welcome table, with its complimentary dog treats.
Every year 45,000 people descend upon Charleston, South Carolina, for the Southeastern Wildlife Exposition (SEWE), and most of them, it seems, bring their dogs. If you are looking for a weekend getaway that involves socially acceptable day drinking, browsing around a beautiful and historic town, and more or less constantly booping dog noses, this is the place.
There are multiple levels of ticketing—you can go VIP and spend your evenings enjoying oyster roasts and going to things called soirees or you can buy a general admission pass—three days for fifty bucks.
When you get there, you’ll find everything from hacking jackets to hand-made knives on display. There were Clemson-themed fire pits and tables designed specifically for oyster roasts. There were paintings of birds and paintings of bird dogs. There were at least two exhibits of duck decoys, and an auction where prices for antique carvings of waterfowl soared well into the six figures.
If you want a Sherp hunting vehicle (basically an amphibious little tank), an African safari, a beautifully carved landing net, some new deck chairs, a blazer in mossy oak camouflage, a snazzy bow tie, a super absorbent dog bed, a wooden hand-carved replica of a feather, or a t-shirt that says “I just want to drink wine and pet my dog,” SEWE is for you.
A lot of my time wandering around was spent in a state of recognition: “Oh, this is where that comes from.”
At Marion Square there were raptor demonstrations, and there were lectures about turtles and litter. At Brittlebank Park there was a competition where dogs jumped off a dock into a pool after a toy to see which of them could jump the farthest. I saw one dog jump 23-and-a-half feet, and another stop at the end of the platform and look around at all the people while his owner laughed and tried to cajole him to jump—no dice.
There’s a heavy focus, obviously, on South Carolina. Lowcountry Collectibles, Lowcountry Creamery, Lowcountry Marine Mammal Network, Lowcountry Olive Oil, Lowcountry Oyster Company, and Lowcountry Shuckers all had exhibits.
In the middle of all of this was a tent sponsored by the South Carolina Commission of Agriculture, which was run by cookbook authors and brothers Matt Lee and Ted Lee . (The Lees are also Daily Beast columnists and had invited me as their guest to the festival.) I ducked in and found what amounts to a three-day, live-action cooking show.
“Aside from using the cheek meat, what do you do with the head?” came the first question from the audience for apparently unflappable barbecue master Rodney Scott. Some people make souse, he explained, or headcheese, but he doesn’t. He’s working on a recipe for crispy pig ears, but mostly “it’s decoration,” he said with a sly grin. He was having a good day, to say the least: United States Senator Kamala Harris had come to lunch at his place on King Street.
The format for these demonstrations was loose. A chef was joined by a producer or a farmer— Greg Johnson of Geechie Boy Milling, for instance, cooked rice with Chef Jason Stanhope of Fig. Matt and Ted worked the crowd, and the space was intimate and casual enough that people felt good making jokes and asking questions. Trays of samples were passed around—everybody liked the rice. The next day I saw a woman scrunch up her face and exclaim “no, no, no, no, no, no, no” over a ramekin of pickled collard greens. She didn’t like them, but I thought they were so good that when I got home I made them from the recipe that the chef handed out.
Next to the stage, South Carolina foodie treasures were displayed market style. Walking around a tent full of food, tasting Bloody Mary mix and barbecue sauce, and feeling the weight of a new Smithey cast iron pan in your hand is a great way to spend an afternoon. At events like this, as pleasant as they are, I wait for the moment when the lights go out. When I taste something that grabs my attention so hard that everything else in the place disappears for a moment. I had such a moment standing in front of the Burnt and Salty table.
Bob Cook and Cris Miller started the company in 2015, and their flagship product is their Korean mustard, which is solid. Their coconut suka, however, is out of this world. Made of fermented coconut water, ginger, chiles, and fish sauce it is funky and bright at once, with a good hit of heat (but not so much that I couldn’t try it straight out of a cup). I want to eat it in coleslaw; I want to dip slices of pork belly in it; I want to douse fried chicken in the stuff. It’s magic. And they ship. So I promised myself I’d buy a hat (they have a wonderful logo) and some suka, and I walked back over to the stage.
I was just in time for the Lee brothers’ radish showdown…"

A hacker group uploaded the personal information of thousands of federal agents and law enforcement officials onto the web after hacking into “FBI-affiliated websites” and websites connected to at least one company, TechCrunch reports .
The hackers reportedly breached three FBI National Academy Association websites using “public exploits,” downloaded the contents, and uploaded them on their own website. The contents reportedly included “4,000 unique records” of names, email addresses, job titles, phone numbers, and addresses. The group also reportedly hacked into one of manufacturing company Foxconn ’s subdomains and acquired thousands of employee records.
“We hacked more than 1,000 sites,” said one of the over 10 hackers in the group who spoke to TechCrunch. “Now we are structuring all the data, and soon they will be sold. I think something else will publish from the list of hacked government sites.”
When asked if they were concerned that the files they uploaded could risk the lives of law enforcement, the hacker responded, “Probably, yes.”
The hacker also claimed to have “over a million data [sic]” collected from the sites, reportedly including employee information of “several U.S. federal agencies and public service organizations.”
According to the hacker, the group’s end game in the large hack was “experience and money.” READ THIS LIST "

K eeping track of what’s going on in Game of Thrones is enough to turn a normal person into Charlie from It’s Always Sunny , cracked-out insane in front of a conspiracy board. Which is why we’ve compiled this comprehensive guide to literally everything a fan should remember heading into the final six episodes of the series: where each character currently stands on the board, the most relevant theories, prophecies, and in-show foreshadowing of what’s coming next, and every loose plot thread Game of Thrones is either saving for a dramatic last-minute resolution or just kind of... forgot about. Cleganebowl! Baby Snowgaryen! Where art thou, Quaithe? Let’s dive in. Where We Left Off With…
Team Cersei:
The light of my life, Cersei Lannister , has just lost the only person in the world she trusts: her twin and lover, Jaime Lannister . Her brother snaps after she calls him the stupidest Lannister for believing she’d really lend her armies to the effort up north to defeat the Night King—you know, like she said she would in the Dragonpit. Cersei’s latest plan essentially involves sitting back while the Night King decimates Team Snowgaryen, then moving in to wipe out whoever is left with her own armies. This is obviously a terrible plan, but not a surprising one for Cersei. “The lion does not concern himself with the opinions of sheep” is what she told Jaime earlier when she revealed that she is pregnant with their fourth child—a development she intentionally let Tyrion deduce so that he’d believe her when she said she’d help save the world.
While Jaime rides north alone, Cersei does still have the support of a few key allies: the Iron Bank , delighted that Cersei has finally paid back the Lannisters’ sizable wartime debts (with money stolen from Highgarden after Olenna’s death), has agreed to issue her new loans to finance a contract with the most elite mercenary army in the world, the Golden Company. Euron Greyjoy also still hopes to marry Cersei after the war is won and crown himself king, so his fleet is currently on its way to Essos to ferry the Golden Company back to Westeros. (He lied earlier at the Dragonpit and told Cersei’s enemies that he’d be retreating back to the Iron Islands.) The Mountain and Qyburn are also still firmly Team Cersei, of course, while Bronn is nominally so, for now—he just wants a castle.
Team Jon:
After she saved his life north of the Wall, Jon Snow bent the knee to his new queen, his “Dany,” and embarked on his inaugural roll in the hay with her. The two prettiest people in Westeros’ strangely sterile sex scene are complicated by a voiceover from the Three-Eyed Raven, Bran Stark , who with the help of texts that Citadel dropout Samwell Tarly brings from Oldtown, pieces together the real story of Jon’s lineage: his mother was Lyanna Stark, Ned’s sister, and his father was Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, Dany’s older brother, who annulled his previous marriage to Elia Martell before tying the knot with Lyanna. That last tidbit means Jon was not born out of wedlock, which makes him Rhaegar’s only living heir and the person with the strongest claim to the Iron Throne. The bad news: he just had sex with his aunt .
Someone—I’m hoping Bran, who has the bedside manner of a pine cone these days—will have to break the news to Jon, who is currently traveling back to Winterfell with Davos Seaworth and Team Dany. Meanwhile, back home, Sansa and Arya Stark have buried their plot-contrived hatchet and finally murdered Littlefinger—hooray! Sansa will inevitably hate that Jon swore the North’s allegiance to Dany without even sending her a raven first—booo! Expect lots of pointless squabbling.
Gendry and The Hound are also on their way to Winterfell right now, so also expect two dynamic reunions with Arya. (She’ll be happy to see Gendry, but she thought she left the The Hound for dead—the only reason he’s not on her kill list any longer.) Meanwhile, wildling Tormund Giantsbane and flaming sword aficionado Beric Dondarrion , on his last life now that Thoros of Myr is dead, were manning the castle at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea when the Wall came crashing down, but both are safe and will appear in Season 8. Brienne of Tarth was last seen with the rest of Team Jon at the Dragonpit—her words to Jaime, “fuck loyalty,” seem to have weighed heavily on his decision to leave Cersei behind—but is on the way back to Winterfell now with her squire Podrick Payne in tow.
Team Dany:
Daenerys Stormborn suffered a catastrophic loss last season when the Night King killed one of her “children,” Viserion, turned the poor dragon into a blue-eyed, fire-breathing zombie monster, and used it to tear down the Wall. Jon’s guilt over the loss helps bring the two together, though, into a coupling that seems to make everyone around them miserable. Jorah Mormont , now cured of greyscale, feebly suggests to Dany that she ride to Winterfell safely on the back of a dragon, while Jon proposes she ride in with his forces on foot, to better appear like an ally of the North. She sides with Jon and the two are soon doin’ the no pants dance on a boat.
Hand of the Queen Tyrion Lannister haaates this. Why wouldn’t he? His queen already made one costly mistake because of Jon, and can’t afford to be blinded by love in the middle of the apocalypse. But Tyrion’s expression as he watches Jon walk into Dany’s bedroom suggests something else , too. Is it romantic jealousy? The director of this scene once told me it wasn’t so , but there are more than enough hints planted throughout the series to support it should Season 8 go the love triangle route. (It will.)
In less fraught quarters, beacons of light and goodness Grey Worm and Missandei are now enjoying lovely, incest-less sex. The rest of the Unsullied, along with Dany’s Dothraki horde, will presumably head north to throw down at the Battle of Winterfell. Theon Greyjoy meanwhile is sailing south from Dragonstone to King’s Landing to rescue his sister, Yara , who was captured by Euron in the ambush that cost the Sand Snakes their lives. Ellaria Sand , sadly, is still in the dungeons of King’s Landing, watching her daughter succumb to Cersei’s poison.
The Wild Cards:
There are two major characters whose role in the endgame is still surprisingly murky. The former Master of Whispers, Varys , is sailing to White Harbor with the rest of Team Dany, but it’s anyone’s guess how his story will end. Melisandre , another wild card, tells him shortly before she leaves Dragonstone for Volantis that she is destined to die in “this strange country” of Westeros, just like he is. If she’s right, the question is how.
We’ve heard over the years of how Varys’s hatred of magic stems from being sold to a sorcerer who castrated him and tossed his boy bits into a fire. Varys says he then heard a voice answer the sorcerer’s call, and that the voice still haunts him. We still have no idea what the voice said, or who it came from: “Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer’s trick? I don’t know,” he told Tyrion in Season 3 . It came up again in Season 6 when another red priestess named Kinvara taunted Varys , claiming she knows what the voice said. Does that mean all red priestesses including Melisandre know? Is that how she knows how both she and Varys will die?
Whatever the voice was, it and Varys’ loathing of the supernatural seem likely to influence the events of what looks to be a magic-heavy Season 8. Melisandre’s mission to Volantis will probably bring her back into the fold with other R’hllor-worshipping red priests and priestesses, since that city is where the Temple of the Lord of Light is. We know many of them support Daenerys’ claim to the throne; Kinvara told Tyrion she would enlist others to spread the gospel of Dany as the messianic savior Azor Ahai around Essos. So basically, the time for that plot thread to pay off is right about now. Bet on Melisandre rolling up back to Westeros with a cohort of priestesses to help fend off the Night King. Theories, Foreshadowing, and What Might Happen Next...
Azor Ahai, the Prince Who Was Promised
Speaking of Azor Ahai… A number of prophecies are poised to either be proven or disproven in these final six episodes, but the one that matters most is about the Prince Who Was Promised. In a nutshell, this is the person who ended the first Long Night, and whom Lord of Light worshippers believe will be reborn to save the world again. He (or she—as Missandei helpfully points out, the word for “prince” in old Valyrian is not gendered) is often believed to be the same person as Azor Ahai.
This figure will reappear “when the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers,” will be born “amid smoke and salt,” and will “wake dragons out of stone,” and will require a great sacrifice to reforge the flaming sword Lightbringer that helped save the world from darkness. (The first dude did it by plunging it into the heart of his wife, Nissa Nissa.) There’s a part of this prophecy only mentioned in the books which also says the hero will be directly descended from the Mad King, Aerys II, aka Dany’s dad.
Jon and Daenerys are thought to be the most likely candidates, though in some crackpot corners Tyrion is a dark horse contender, too. (This requires taking Tywin’s last words to Tyrion, “You’re no son of mine,” pretty literally.) Whoever it turns out to be, it might mean someone’s gotta get shanked for the chosen one to save the day.
What Maggy the Witch’s prophecy means for Cersei’s new pregnancy
Remember when baby Cersei dragged a friend to see a witch in the middle of a swamp in that weird flashback that kicked off Season 5? That’s going to be important now. Maggy the Witch nailed everything about preteen Cersei’s soon-to-be miserable life: “You will never wed the Prince, you will wed the King…You’ll be Queen, for a time. Then comes another—younger, more beautiful—to cast you down and take all you hold dear.” Cersei never married her betrothed, Prince Rhaegar, and ended up with Robert instead. As for the queen who usurps her, Cersei seemed to think Margaery fit the bill, though it might actually describe Daenerys. Maggy also prophesied that Cersei would only have three children, none fathered by Robert, all of whom would die: “The king will have 20 children and you will have three. Gold will be their crowns, gold their shrouds.”
In Season 7, however, Cersei reveals to Jaime that she is pregnant with their fourth child, which either throws a wrench in Maggy’s crystal ball or spells potential doom for the queen. The only way the prophecy stays in tact after Cersei’s happy news is if she doesn’t live to deliver the child, or if the child doesn’t live to be born—sad news all around. (Alternately, she could be lying about the pregnancy, but I doubt it.)
If she does have the baby, though, is that proof that Maggy’s prophecy is false? And if it is, does that mean that another significant line, omitted in the show but well-known from the books, is also baloney? Maggy foretells that Cersei’s death will come at the hands of a “valonqar”—a little brother, whom Cersei assumes refers to Tyrion, but who could very well be Jaime or, hell, Theon, who’s on his way to free Yara now. Either way, the chances of Cersei making it out of Season 8 alive are slim; Maggy may have known it all along.
Is Daenerys going to get pregnant?
Baby fever broke out at the end of last season , with everyone from Tormund to Tyrion to Jorah wishing for or referencing children and heirs. (Plus Cersei.) It all got real conspicuous with Dany, though, with virtually everyone in her orbit dropping veiled hints about a potential baby with Jon.
Tyrion stresses to Dany the importance of choosing a successor to cement her legacy after she’s gone. Jorah refuses Jon’s offer to return Longclaw to House Mormont with a knowing look and the words, “May it serve you well. And your children after you.” Dany herself mentions to Jon that she can’t bear children because of the curse a vengeful Lhazareen godswife named Mirri Maz Duur cast on her back in Season 1—but Jon doesn’t seem to buy it. “Your family hasn’t seen its end,” he predicts.
He’s probably onto something. In the show, Mirri never explicitly says that Dany is now infertile, though the Khaleesi certainly believes she is. When Dany asks Mirri, who used blood magic to “save” a mortally injured Khal Drogo, when her husband will be as he was, part of Mirri’s answer in the books reads, “When your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not before.” But that line is omitted from the show. The godswife also claims that Dany’s only baby, the one fathered by Khal Drogo, was born a monster as a result of her curse, though again, we’ve never seen proof. Dany takes Mirri at her word, but prophecies are hardly guarantees on Game of Thrones . A baby Snowgaryen may still be in the cards—a twist that I’m sure won’t end in tragedy at all.
Cleganebowl is finally happening, right? Right?!
Last season, The Hound issued a rain check for Cleganebowl by marching right across to his undead older brother at the Dragonpit and promising, “You know who’s coming for you. You’ve always known.” A death match between Sandor Clegane and Gregor aka “The Mountain,” the older brother who scarred him for life, has been on fans’ wish lists for years. This time, it has to happen. His redemption arc since Arya left him for dead would find a naturally cathartic conclusion in taking down his tormentor. He’d need to survive both the Battle of Winterfell and Arya’s grumpy reaction to finding out he’s still alive to make it happen, but have faith. And get hype.

‘Guava Island’: Inside Childish Gambino and Rihanna’s Top-Secret Movie,www.thedailybeast.com,Joseph.Longo@thedailybeast.com (Joseph Longo),04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/guava-island-inside-childish-gambino-and-rihannas-top-secret-movie-that-premiered-at-coachella,"‘Guava Island’: Inside Childish Gambino and Rihanna’s Top-Secret Movie The 55-minute film premiered at Coachella, and is currently streaming for free on Amazon Prime. 04.13.19 11:13 AM ET Screenshot/YouTube/Amazon Prime
The Grammy-winning, enigmatic rapper Childish Gambino released his highly anticipated film Guava Island late Friday night right in the middle of his characteristically unconventional Coachella set .
Though he made no mention of the film while smoking weed with his audience, Guava Island is inextricably linked to the California music festival. It held its world premiere there before premiering on Amazon Prime where it’s available for free until 9 p.m. EST. More importantly, Guava Island is a product of the alter-ego Childish Gambino—not just a film starring the talented, Emmy-winning actor Donald Glover.
The film is directed by Hiro Murai, Glover’s longtime collaborator behind the music video for “This Is America” as well as several episodes of Glover’s hit show Atlanta . It makes sense then that Guava Island , at just 55 minutes, is a hybrid film and visual album.
The film follows Deni (Glover), a local radio DJ organizing a music festival in hopes of uniting the oppressed citizens of the fictional Guava island who live in paradise but never get to rest. All the while, he’s trying to be a good boyfriend to his childhood crush turned longtime partner Kofi (Rihanna). Black Panther ’s Letitia Wright appears briefly as Kofi’s factory co-worker, while Game of Thrones ’ Nonso Anozie brings his knack for villainy as a shady factory boss.
After a photo leaked of Rihanna and Glover together last summer in Havana, Cuba, where the film was shot, expectations soared among fans that Guava Island wouldn’t just be a joyous collaboration but the opening salvo for the two beloved musicians’ long-awaited albums. It’s with a heavy heart when I say Rihanna does not even hum a tune in the film—and unfortunately, that might be its biggest takeaway.
Glover does sing—and repeatedly so—throughout the short film. Guava Island disperses a series of Gambino’s vibey-yet-lesser-known tracks like “Feels like Summertime,” “Die With You” and the still unreleased “Human Sacrifice” through the short, short film. It’s a nice reminder of just how versatile his catalog is. The only person who has effortlessly moved through reggae, rap and pop is, well, his co-star Rihanna. R.I.P once more to what could have been a stellar duet.
While he leaves out his biggest hits like “3005” and “Redbone,” Glover makes up for it with an extended performance of his acclaimed 2018 single “This Is America.” The Guava Island version is closely tied to the original music video , serving more as an explainer than a remake. Both the music video and the film sequence take place in desolate warehouses and utilize similar choreography. But this time around, Gambino isn’t coy. “America is a concept,” he states before the in-scene machinery kicks off his performance. “Anywhere where in order to get rich you have to make someone else richer is America.” Cue the jerky dance moves. The scene is a satisfying answer to the many questions concerning what “This Is America” stood for: a warning call against modern-day imperialism.
However, as the only non-diegetic scene, “This is America” doesn’t flow with the rest of the movie. Instead, it reminds you of how great Gambino is when the focus should be on Deni’s fraught journey. Is Guava Island little more than just extended promo for Childish Gambino, similar to Janelle Monae’s Dirty Computer visual album ?
Probably not, but much of the film is left unresolved. Once again, why doesn’t Rihanna sing? While she and Glover are both endlessly charming in the film, Guava Island underserves the Barbadian icon. Murai gloriously frames her with truly stunning profiles honoring her Caribbean heritage and a reminder of just how youthful she is (Rihanna turned 31 in February). However, more Rihanna is always best, and her musical chops are sorely missed here.
It’s just one of many questions left on the table as the film quickly wraps up. Is there a Guava Island soundtrack on the horizon? What about the rumors Glover only has one album left as Childish Gambino before he retires from music? And if so, when’s it coming out?
While Guava Island doesn’t provide many answers about its two beloved leads, Gambino himself inadvertently outlined how he feels about the film at the beginning of his Coachella set. He offered two rules. First, feel each other: “I’m trying to give you an experience. You feel me? Do you love?” Second, put your phone down: “This is not a concert...This is my church, I feel at home here. So if shit needs to bounce, I need you to motherfucking bounce.” Guava Island ’s story of a happy-go-lucky small-town musician is Childish Gambino at his core. And, maybe, that might just be enough.

Itxu Díaz 04.13.19 11:51 AM ET
M ADRID—Probably you’ve never tried to eat a rat. Every now and then rodents, roasted or raw, turn up as gruesome cuisine in horror films, but they’ve never established themselves on modern menus. Five hundred years ago, however, survivors of the voyage of Fernando Magallanes, as we call him in Spain (Fernão de Magalhães in his native Portugal, Ferdinand Magellan in English) had to resort to eating rats to avoid the greater evil of eating each other, a practice with which they’d grown rather familiar on their travels.
Such was the very bitter end of the first circumnavigation of the globe.
Right now is a good time, with all the acts of quincentennial commemoration that have cropped up in Spain and Portugal, to look back on a what was, in truth, una aventura de locos . It’s also important to realize that Magellan’s expedition was the birth of what we now call “globalization.”
Let's see. April 2019. It took me less than 10 seconds to circle the world on Google Earth . If King Charles I of Spain had had such a tool in the year 1519 it would not have been necessary to charter five ships and subject 239 men to all kinds of misfortunes. But of course it was necessary. Spain needed to discover a way west to the Far East to facilitate its trade routes—if that could be done—and the world needed to know once and for all its true identity as a sphere.
In 1519 that fact still was far from clear. Christopher Columbus had tried to sail west to China 27 years earlier, but he didn’t get there. Not even close. As P.J. O’Rourke once put it, “Columbus discovered Caribbean vacations.""
Magellan knew what the Far East really looked like. He had sailed previously around the tip of Africa on an eastward heading that took him to the Malay Peninsula. Now he intended to come at it from the other side if—a big if—the globe really was a globe. “ They completed the first circumnavigation of the globe. Only fools, fantasists or fanatics would deny it. ”
Of the five ships and 239 men that sailed from Seville in southern Spain in 1519, only one ship and 18 men returned. They were 18 heroes, no doubt, but above all 18 witnesses.
A few months ago, crossing the waters of the Atlantic in a small boat and amazed by the spectacle of the dolphins playing in her wake, I could not stop thinking about the things those first explorers might have seen and experienced.
Once back on land, I gathered all the available direct documentation I could find. There was the detailed account in the diary of the Venetian Antonio Pigafetta , one of the survivors; there was the chronicle of the trip made by another of them, the pilot Francisco Albo; there was the letter to King Carlos from Juan Sebastián Elcano, who completed the voyage after Magellan himself was killed. I read the interview Maximilian Transyvanus conducted with the crew of the Victoria ; the book of Ginés de María about the discovery of what’s now called the Strait of Magellan; and the General Archive of the Indies, which is a hugely valuable source for reconstructing the darker side of that history, because its accounts are hugely human. Death as Destiny
Reading the documents that are preserved, there is only one thing certain: those men were sailing toward death. Most knew it. Most were sure of it. Survival would be a miracle.
In this 21st century, that level of incalculable risk is hard to fathom. Today’s entrepreneurs gamble with their money not their lives. Half a millennium ago, the Spanish Crown played with its money, to be sure, but the heroes of the Magellan expedition gambled with their existence.
It was an expedition financed by the monarchy in Madrid but it was also an international enterprise: the two leaders were a Portuguese (Magellan) and a Spaniard (Juan Sebastián Elcano) while the crews of the five ships were made up of men from 10 different nationalities, including Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians, French, and Greeks.
The vessels that originally set sail were Magelllan’s flagship, the Trinidad ; the slightly larger San Antonio , the Concepción , the Victoria , and the Santiago.
Four months after leaving Spain they touched the Americas, specifically South America, where today we’d find Rio de Janeiro. There the Venetian, Pigafetta wrote in his diary of a place plagued by ""an infinite number of parrots."" The locals were fascinated by the steel axes and knives offered by the Europeans, technology they had never seen, and promised the adventurers ""one and even two of their daughters"" in exchange.
This led to some observations that were both bawdy and bizarre.
""The young women often came on board to offer themselves to the sailors in order to obtain some present: one day one of the prettiest also went up, undoubtedly with the same objective, but having seen a nail the size of a finger and believing that nobody was watching, she took it and very quickly placed it between the two lips of her sexual organs."" The chronicler recalls that an anthropological debate was unleashed among the crew: Did the girl do it to try to hide it and steal it or simply to decorate herself in some fashion?
That would not be the last of Pigafetta’s sexual observations.
The Brazilian chiefs known as caciques allowed the adventurers to celebrate mass on land and many of the locals ended up converting to Christianity, which was as alien to them as the axes and the knives. More importantly, they heard about the the dignity of human life and the concept of mercy, both of which, according to the chroniclers, were scarce in those parts (and subsequently scarce as well under the regimes of the Iberian colonizers).
The first attempt to find entry to the South Sea failed. The passage was not really an open road: it turned out to be the estuary of the Río de la Plata, the silver river, which led to some considerable, and dangerous, frustration among the mariners.
In March 1520, near the southern tip of South America after eight months of navigation, when we now know they only needed a few days to reach Antarctica and pass through the strait there before bad weather would set in, Magellan decided to winter in the Bay of San Julián.
Food was growing scarce. The cold grew severe. Morale was bad and getting worse. Many of the crews in Magellan’s little armada were tired of the voyage, complaining about the distribution of food, but Magellan, who had decided to keep to his westward course or die trying, demanded that they show the courage needed to carry the expedition forward.
This was a delicate moment. Magellan had ordered that food be rationed as much as possible, but he gathered his men and harangued them, telling them they still had plenty on board. They had good fishing and good hunting, firewood, water, as well as supplies of “biscuits and wine.”
They didn’t trust him, didn’t believe him, and his speech did little to calm the mutinous atmosphere. At night, the cabals and conspiracies grew. The captains of all the ships except the Santiago , which was oblivious to what was happening, rose up against Magellan and demanded that he return to Spain.
The Portuguese admiral knew that on the flagship Victoria there were many crewmen on his side and decided to charge that ship, kill its mutinous captain, and recover the obedience of the crew. He condemned to death Quesada, the captain of the Concepción , and banished and abandoned Juan de Cartagena, who was in charge of the San Antonio , the epicenter of the uprising.
Magellan finally settled the matter by judging the mutineers in a court martial and pardoning some 50 of them. This was less a matter of Christian mercy than maritime pragmatism. He needed them to continue the expedition successfully.
Days later, Magellan lost the ship Santiago , wrecked among the rocks at the mouth of what is now known as the Santacruz River near the southern tip of South America. The crew managed to save themselves but they stayed two months at the site of the wreck trying to collect the supplies that floated up.
Two castaways from the Santiago had made it back to the rest of the expedition to deliver news of the ship’s sad end. They walked for a week, eating wild plants and raw seafood and were in rough shape. ""They arrived so disfigured by hunger and their travails that their friends did not recognize them,"" says Ortega. Expeditions were mounted taking food to the survivors of the Santiago, writes Pigafetta, but the trip was exhausting. Even though the distance was only about 100 miles, the path was full of thorns and weeds and they “had nothing to drink but ice.” Giants and Rats
In the middle of winter the Magellan expedition discovered on the coast ""certain Indians” of ""great stature.""
“We saw a giant who was on the shore, quite naked, and who danced, leaped, and sang, and while he sang he threw sand and dust on his head,” writes Pigafetta. “Our captain sent one of his men toward him, charging him to leap and sing like the other in order to reassure him and show him friendship. Which he did. Immediately the man of the ship, dancing, led this giant to a small island where the captain awaited him. And when he was before us, he began to marvel and to be afraid, and he raised one finger upward, believing that we came from heaven. And he was so tall that the tallest of us only came up to his waist.”
The friendship with these Indians allowed the explorers to stock up on firewood and food—including the meat of the llama-like guanacos—and thus alleviate their suffering. These huge Indians were called Patagonians. “ I believe that nevermore will any man undertake to make such a voyage. ” — Antonio Pigafetta, survivor
In October 1520, after wintering, Magellan ordered the ships San Antonio and Concepción to advance along a route ""that looked like an arm of the sea."" They had found the strait but they did not know it. Once again, despair and dissension set in. The San Antonio , the biggest ship in the fleet, left the expedition in secret.
Meanwhile, Magellan had sent a boat through the canal to discover if it had an outlet to the sea. It did. Euphoric, they baptized the point at which they entered the strait the Cape of 11,000 Virgins, after the legend of Saint Ursula and her martyred companions. Her feast day was October 21. The westernmost point of land they called the Cape of Desire. Then they set sail across the vast ocean they called “the peaceful sea,” the Pacific.
Now the true horrors set in. After sailing for ""three months and 20 days without taking on board provisions or any other refreshments,” Pigafetta tells us, they “ate only old biscuit turned to powder, all full of worms and stinking of the urine which the rats had made on it, having eaten the good. And we drank water impure and yellow. We ate also ox hides which were very hard because of the sun, rain, and wind. And we left them four or five days in the sea, then laid them for a short time on embers, and so we ate them. And of the rats, which were sold for half an écu apiece, some of us could not get enough.”
A strange disease–scurvy–was spread among the crew: their gums swelled to the point of overwhelming the teeth in both jaws, preventing them from eating. A score of sailors died of the disease, as did a Patagonian giant who had joined them and was cared for by Pigafetta.
Such was the harshness of that part of the journey that the chronicler wrote, “I believe that nevermore will any man undertake to make such a voyage.” Death of Magellan
In the spring of 1521 the expedition landed on the island of Zubu (now Cebu) and reached an alliance with its king, who converted to Christianity and swore allegiance to the king of Spain. With that, all the inhabitants of the island were baptized, they demolished their idols and put an end to their ""strange ceremonies.""
Among those rituals, the Italian chronicler notes, when a chief died in Zubu, he was watched over at home accompanied by ""the most respected women of the place."" The main wife ""sets her mouth, her hands and her feet to those of the dead man. And while the other woman is cutting off the hair, the latter one weeps. And when she has ceased cutting, the latter one sings.” The ritual lasted five days.
It also surprised the adventurers that the natives of these islands had their foreskins “closed with a small cylinder of gold” and “never remove this ornament, not even during intercourse.” As one of the chroniclers wrote with unusual humor, given the harsh circumstances: ""Despite such a strange device, all women preferred us over their husbands ...""
Later in the voyage, Pigafetta listened to the many tales told by Moro pilots helping steer the Victoria through shallow seas. From them he learned that, “When the young men of Java are in love with any gentlewoman, they bind certain little bells with thread under their foreskin.” That is, between the penis and the foreskin. “They go beneath their loved ones’ window and, making pretense to urinate and shaking the member, they ring the little bells until their loved ones hear the sound. Then they come down immediately, and they take their pleasure, always with those little bells, for their women take great delight in hearing those bells ring within.”
But before they could leave Zubu, a new and devastating tragedy befell them.
Magellan wanted to seal the alliance with the king of Zubu by attacking the neighboring island of Mactan, whose king was an enemy of Zubu and would not convert to Christianity.
Magellan led his men ashore, where they burned some 30 houses belonging to the locals, who vastly outnumbered them and who counter-attacked relentlessly. Forced back into the water, Magellan and his men continued fighting knee-deep in the sea, but the artillery on board their ships was out of range and useless. A poisoned arrow hit Magellan in the leg, then a spear caught him in the arm, then another spear, and he went down surrounded by the enemy, according to Pigafetta. “All at once rushed upon him with lances of iron and of bamboo and with these javelins, so that they slew our mirror, our light, our comfort, and our true guide. While those people were striking him, he several times turned back to see whether we were all at the ships. Then, seeing him dead, as best we could we rescued the wounded men and put them into the boats which were already leaving.” On April 27, 1521, Magellan died at the age of 41, but his body was never recovered.
Afterward several more the men were lost when they were offered a friendly feast only to be betrayed and killed.
Having reduced the number of survivors, those who remained decided to reduce the number of ships to two, setting fire to the Concepción , sailing on aboard the Trinidad and the Victoria . On the way to the Moluccas, they chose Juan Sebastián Elcano as their leader.
In November 1521 they arrived at the spice islands, the Moluccas, which the Portuguese had reached earlier via the Indian Ocean, and which had been Magellan’s goal all along. They had sailed west, halfway around the world on uncharted seas, to reach them, and they received honors from King Almanzor.
The following month, with the ships loaded with cloves, they were preparing to return to Spain but the Trinidad began taking on water, and had to stay behind for repairs, eventually turning back east across the Pacific toward Panama. The Victoria continued west toward Africa and beyond, to Spain.
In the midst of strong winds, it took Victoria seven weeks to get past the Cape of Good Hope. Seven weeks in which a good part of the crew, sick and hungry, demanded Elcano land in Mozambique, where the Portuguese had established themselves. But despited Magellan’s nationality this was not a Portuguese expedition and Elcano was not about to let himself, his men and his hugely valuable cargo fall into their hands. He forced everyone to continue the route to the west.
After two months without seeing land and a score of deaths on board, they were forced to land on one of the Cape Verde islands, another Portuguese outpost, in search of water. Elcano sent 13 men to try to move the Portuguese governor by telling them of his extreme situation. They were arrested and the Portuguese tried to attack the Victoria . Elcano, who was following the negotiations, then ordered the anchor raised, abandoned the 13 men, and sailed on ""with imponderable despair,” according to one of the chroniclers.
On September 6, 1522, emaciated, hungry, sick and exhausted from fatigue, after a voyage of almost three years, the Victoria with Elcano in command arrived back in Spain at the port of Sanlúcar de Barrameda with the 18 survivors on board.
They had completed the first circumnavigation of the globe in history, of that there was now no doubt. Only fools, fantasists or fanatics would deny it.
They did not disembark until the next day when they were towed up the Guadalquivir River to Seville. As crowds gathered to receive them, the 18 walked, ""each carrying a candle in his hand,"" to the chapel of the Virgin in the old Cathedral of Seville to whom they had pledged their faith during the worst moments of the voyage. The Beginning of Globalization
That September of 1522 the world changed forever. The expedition had established the dimensions of Earth, had discovered the Strait of Magellan, had crossed for the first time the largest ocean in the world, which they called Pacific because in its waters they did not suffer storms, had confirmed the spherical nature of the planet and discovered there were different zones of time, had found archipelagos of the Pacific large and small, including the Philippines, and had revealed that all the seas are connected to each other in a global world. They had broken the endurance record on the high seas, had traveled half the planet without stopping, and they had opened the way for communication on a planetary scale.
The fifth centenary of the adventure is a good time to remember the solemnity and transcendence with which Juan Sebastián Elcano wrote the day of his return in a letter addressed to the king who had funded the adventure, and who had become in the meantime Holy Roman Emperor Carlos V, the most powerful sovereign in Europe or, indeed, on Earth:
""Your Majesty will know better than anyone that what we ought most to value and hold on to is that we have discovered and sailed the whole roundness of the world, that going to the West, we have returned from the East.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Saturday blasted President Trump, claiming that the commander-in-chief was threatening the safety of Rep. Ilhan Omar, after he tweeted an edited video of 9/11 footage attacking the Minnesota Democrat.
“The memory of 9/11 is sacred ground, and any discussion of it must be done with reverence. The president shouldn’t use the painful images of 9/11 for a political attack,” tweeted Pelosi. “It is wrong for the president, as commander-in-chief, to fan the flames to make anyone less safe.”
Trump’s tweet included video of Omar, at a March 23 fundraising event, talking about the establishment of the Council on American-Islamic Relations after 9/11—before cutting to footage of the terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
In Omar’s now-frequently-invoked remarks, the Somali-born U.S. citizen said CAIR was “founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.”
“Some people did something?” the video asks . “September 11, 2001. We remember.” In his tweet, Trump added: “WE WILL NEVER FORGET!”
Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) chimed in on Saturday : “For two years, this President has used the most powerful platform in the world to sow hate & division. He's done it again. Putting the safety of a sitting member of Congress @IlhanMN at risk & vilifying a whole religion is beyond the pale. I'll be blunt—we must defeat him.”
On Friday, after Trump’s tweet, several Democrats ran to Omar’s defense, including Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who wrote on Twitter that her colleague’s life had been put “in danger” after the president’s “explicit attack.”
“For our colleagues to be silent is to be complicit in the outright, dangerous targeting of a member of Congress,” she tweeted. “We must speak out.”
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) also tweeted that Trump was “inciting violence” with his video, and that “it’s disgusting” and “shameful.”
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) added : “Ilhan Omar is a leader with strength and courage. She won't back down to Trump's racism and hate, and neither will we. The disgusting and dangerous attacks against her must end.”"
The Most Expensive Object Lost on the Titanic,www.thedailybeast.com,Allison McNearney,04-13-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-most-expensive-object-lost-on-the-titanic-merry-joseph-blondels-la-circassienne-au-bain?source=articles&amp;via=rss,"The Most Expensive Object Lost on the Titanic The Daily Beast 6 hrs ago By Allison McNearney < PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 4 NEXT SLIDE > Loss of White Star Line's Olympic-class RMS Titanic which struck an iceberg on 12 April 1912 on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York. Titanic's lifeboats on their way to the Carpathia. More than 1,500 lives lost. Disaster. As the doomed Titanic began its final countdown before disappearing under the sea 107 years ago Monday, there was a last gasp of activity on the deck.
These scenes have become well known thanks to big screen adaptations of the disaster: the rush to load the few remaining life boats with women and children, the brave musicians who took up their instruments for one last concert, the tilt of the deck as the ship began to tip into the ocean.
Mauritz Håkan Björnström-Steffansson knew these final moments all too well—he experienced them first hand. His life was saved at the last minute by a frantic leap into a nearby lifeboat as the Titanic began to sink, but 1,517 passengers and crew were not so lucky. Nor was his prized possession, an oil painting by the renowned 19th-century French painter Merry-Joseph Blondel.
“La Circassienne au Bain,” also known in its early days as “Une Baigneuse,” made its debut at the Paris Salon of 1814 just as Blondel’s career was beginning to take off, though it took a few years before the critics warmed up to his bathing Circassian woman.
But in 1912, it reached its pinnacle of fame when it became the most expensive piece of property buried with the Ship of Dreams, at least according to the claims filed.
Starting in the late-17th century, the annual Paris Salon was the place for artists to exhibit their work in France. The state-sponsored Salons were where new artists were discovered, where established artists solidified their reputations, and where the public was invited to join in the cultural conversation.
Blondel would eventually become one of France’s esteemed neoclassical painters. Throughout his long career, he was the recipient of public art commissions that continue to decorate some of the most important buildings in France including the Louvre and the Palace of Versailles; he was awarded some of the top honors of his day, namely the Prix de Rome in 1803 (courtesy of Louis XVIII) and the Légion d’Honneur two decades later (with thanks to Charles X); and he was named to prestigious academic positions.
But early in his career in 1814, he was surely delighted when four of his works were accepted for exhibition in the Louvre rooms at the annual Paris Salon. “La Circassienne au Bain” was among them.
Initially, the historical loss of this work on the Titanic was near total. Not only did the actual painting perish at sea, but there was little information left behind as to what it once looked like—few descriptions existed and there were no reproductions or photographs of the original, only one engraving.
But in the early 2010s, an artist working under the pseudonym “John Parker” conductive extensive research on Blondel’s lost work and created a reproduction of “La Circassienne au Bain” that was auctioned off by Plymouth Auction Rooms in 2016 for £2,700. (The artist did not respond to an interview request sent via the auction house, which also declined to comment for this piece.)
Parker’s reproduction shows a classical setting of an open-air bath in which Blondel painted a nude Circassian woman stepping into the water with one foot, the other balanced behind her resulting in a figure arranged in the traditional Greek contrapposto style.
The woman’s emerald green robe is thrown over the short concrete wall behind her. She looks off to the side towards it as her arm extends out, both showing off her figure and in a gesture to remove the remaining transparent silk scarf that provides her with just a touch of modesty.
Despite her nudity, the woman’s hair remains in an elaborately braided updo and her ears are garnished with appropriately dazzling baubles. Lush trees and foliage hover beyond the open walls of the bath.
When Blondel showed this work in 1814, he had only been back in France for a few years after his stint studying art in Italy. Three years later, he would win a gold medal at the Salon, but in 1814, at least one of the four paintings, the one that was doomed to a watery grave a century later, did not receive overwhelming praise.
“His design and color lack truth and finesse, and we can say nothing in favor of this work, except that it is executed by a very skillful artist in practice,” French artist and art critic François Séraphin Delpech wrote of “La Circassienne au Bain” in his review of works at that year’s Salon.
Delpech’s pronouncement was representative of the critical response to the piece: “meh.” But that allegedly changed a few years later after Blondel’s star had risen higher. When the public took a shine to the nude bather, the critics decided it wasn’t so bad after all. If not his most famous work, “La Circassienne au Bain” became well regarded.
Fast forward nearly a century and hopscotch a few European countries north, and Mauritz Håkan Björnström-Steffansson enters the tragic story of “La Circassienne au Bain.”
In 1912, Björnström-Steffansson was the 28-year-old son of a Swedish pulp baron, and he was preparing to travel to the U.S. to further his studies. As was only natural for a prominent young lad in that year, he had secured passage on the inaugural voyage of the Titanic, the ship being hailed as the largest and grandest to ever sail the seas.
Before he left, Björnström-Steffansson purchased a masterpiece—the famed French painter Merry-Joseph Blondel’s early work “La Circassienne au Bain”—to take with him.
What drew him to this piece, what he paid for it, or why he decided to purchase it before traveling to America to start a new life is unknown. What is known is that when Björnström-Steffansson boarded the Titanic on a first-class ticket, the Blondel was with him.
During the early days of the voyage, Björnström-Steffansson fell in with a group of other first-class passengers including the English businessman Hugh Woolner. It is from the testimony of Woolner during a U.S. Congressional inquiry into the disaster that we know the details of what Björnström-Steffansson experienced on that fateful night.
On the evening of April 14, Woolner and Björnström-Steffansson were in the smoking room when the Titanic struck an iceberg. “We felt a sort of stopping, a sort of, not exactly shock, but a sort of slowing down; and then we sort of felt a rip that gave a sort of a slight twist to the whole room,” Woolner testified.
After retrieving life jackets from their respective quarters, Woolner said the two men met up back on deck and began assisting women and children into the lifeboats. They also came to the aid of First Officer Murdoch when a group of men tried to swarm one of the starboard-side boats.
When most of the boats had been filled and dispatched, the two friends decided to go to the A deck one story below to make sure all of the passengers had evacuated to higher quarters. Woolner said it was completely empty of people.
“It was absolutely deserted, and the electric lights along the ceiling of A deck were beginning to turn red, just a glow, a red sort of glow. So I said to Steffanson [sic]: ‘This is getting rather a tight corner. I do not like being inside these closed windows. Let us go out through the door at the end.’ And as we went out through the door the sea came in onto the deck at our feet.”
Woolner testified that they then went out onto the gunwale to prepare to dive into the ocean to escape being drowned in the enclosed A deck.
Once outside, they happened to notice that one of the last lifeboats was still being lowered into the water. There was a little bit of room left in the boat, so the men decided to make a jump for it. (The authors of On a Sea of Glass note that the duo probably knew that this boat was still making its way to the sea when they went downstairs, and also that jumping into it from below would be their only shot at survival.)
“[Björnström-Steffansson] jumped out and tumbled in head over heels into the bow, and I jumped too, and hit the gunwale with my chest, which had on this life preserver, of course and I sort of bounced off the gunwale and caught the gunwale with my fingers, and slipped off backwards.”
By the time they were both safely inside, the Titanic was rapidly sinking. The lifeboat was quickly paddled away from the doomed ship, and Woolner estimated they were about 150 yards out when the Titanic disappeared under the water. Both men were saved.
Nearly a year after the Titanic sank in the early hours of April 15, 1912, the New York Times reported that claims for more than $6 million had been filed against the White Star Line for loss of life, personal injury, and loss of property. In the later category, there were claims for jewelry, rare books, cars, a set of bagpipes, and a signed picture of Garibaldi.
But the most expensive claim of all was by Björnström-Steffansson who requested $100,000 (or the equivalent of over $2 million today) in compensation for the drowning of “La Circassienne au Bain.”
It’s unclear how much money Björnström-Steffansson received. In the end, White Star settled all of the claims for a total of only $664,000.
There was one bright spot for the Swedish businessman, who ended up making the U.S. his home.
Five years after the sinking of the Titanic, he married a woman who he was introduced to by a fellow Titanic passenger, one he and Woolner had helped to save. The Björnström-Steffanssons remained married for the rest of their long lives.

How Much Money Do Porn Stars Actually Make?,www.thedailybeast.com,Aurora Snow,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-much-money-do-porn-stars-actually-make,"How Much Money Do Porn Stars Actually Get Paid for Sex Scenes? It’s not what you think. 04.13.19 10:33 PM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
Ask a porn star about sex and you’ll be inundated with every dirty detail —unless you ask how much it pays. That’s when the conversation becomes awkward. When discussing pay rates, XXX performers are just like everyone else, and equally as private. Earnings are often exaggerated (the few performers willing to speak about rates inevitably claim to be on the higher end of the scale).
Twenty-six-year-old Ariana Marie recalls how little she knew about the pay structure when she first entered the industry, and how heavily she relied on her agent . Marie’s starting rate for a boy/girl scene was $1200, which is the higher end of today’s standard range. However, her booking agent’s 40-percent commission was not. Most XXX agents take a 10-20-percent commission, but a new performer wouldn’t automatically know that. “Anytime I was on set I started asking other girls, ‘How much does your agent take?’ They’d say 10 or 15 percent and then I started asking, ‘Well, why does mine take 40?’”
Marie’s next agent seemed a little better—at first. His cut was standard but it wasn’t long before they were haggling over her rates, which he called “too high.” Apparently, that agent was offering buddy deals. “The agent was friends with some of the companies and he’d lower my rate for them,” says Marie. “His excuse was, ‘You’ll work more,’ but I was already working a lot.”
With over a million combined social media followers, Marie’s elite fan base often justifies a company’s decision to pay more.
Mean Bitches CEO Glenn King doesn’t balk at paying a performer more than his standard company rate if the math makes sense. “It’s a business equation. If I’m going to pay someone $1200 instead of $1000 then I need to be relatively confident that I’m going to make an extra $200 off that scene, but the performer has to be popular. Does she have the fan base and following to justify paying her extra?” says King. “I look at her rankings, Twitter followers, Instagram. It’s not about the extra $200 that one time; if you’re shooting this performer in 8 scenes a month, it’s an extra $1600 a month. You have to come up with a viable rate.”
“What’s important now is social media engagement—a lot of girls get hired or don’t get hired by how many followers they have,” says porn super-agent Mark Spiegler. “Instagram is really big. That’s one of the pitfalls because Instagram has it out for adult performers.”
A number of social media platforms have been known to purge adult-oriented accounts , even if there’s nothing naughty posted. Due to the business impact, many porn stars preemptively create backup accounts. “Some agents or some girls (agents always blame it on the girls) will charge more money for IR [interracial]. We don’t do that unless it’s a first IR but that’s like a first anal or first anything else.”
Spiegler has a reputation for consistently booking his performers at above-average rates, which he was more than willing to specify. “The minimum boy/girl is a thousand dollars, minimum $1200 for anal but most are more than that and for DP [double penetration] our girls start at $1500 and go up,” says Spiegler. “We charge everyone the same. Some agents or some girls [agents always blame it on the girls] will charge more money for IR [interracial]. We don’t do that unless it’s a first IR but that’s like a first anal or first anything else.”
So what do porn stars actually get paid for sex?
According to conversations with various companies, agents and traditional porn stars, rates can be as unique as the performer, however industry standards do exist.
Female Performer Average Rates (one-time flat rate per scene, zero royalties):
Girl/Girl: $700-$800, Girl/Girl Anal: $900-$1100
Boy/Girl: $900-$1000, Boy/Girl Anal: $1100-$1200
Double or triple penetration: $1200-$2500
Threesomes, Foursomes & Orgies: base rate + $100-$200 per additional performer
Male Performer Average Rates (one- time flat rate per scene, zero royalties):
Newbies boy/girl (anal or non): $300-$500
Proven performers boy/girl (anal or non): $500-$1200
Threesomes, Foursomes & Orgies: base rate + $100-$300 (not always per performer)
Women entering the industry command higher rates as their first scenes are in demand. For men, it’s the opposite. Companies get nervous about hiring a new guy; wood problems are costly for the entire set, especially when locations are rented by the hour. So the rate for a reliable male performer has nearly doubled in the last 10 years (women’s rates have seen only a marginal increase).
“Standard rates for male performers are $300-$400, until you find your grounding. You work with the smaller companies to get your foot in the door but you can double that fairly fast within the year if you’re a solid performer,” says Isiah Maxwell, the reigning 2019 Xbiz Male Performer of the Year.
“I’ve been raising my rate consistently every year, but winning the Xbiz award legitimized my rate,” says Maxwell. “I don’t like to talk about my rate; I don’t want to have an ego conflict on set. No one’s going to tell you how much they make and show you their check after a scene, it’s a little ego-driven. You may deserve a certain rate but you gotta earn it as well.”
2018 Xbiz Girl/Girl Performer of the Year Darcie Dolce agrees, you have to earn it. “I put on a good scene. I come to set looking good, my skin looks good, and my nails aren’t all fucked up. I’m professional, on time, easy to work with, so I think I’m worth the money,” says Dolce. “With some girls, it’s like a Louis [Vuitton] bag: you’re just paying for the name not the purse.”
Dolce echoes the sentiments of virtually the entire industry when she says, “I’m not comfortable telling you my rate. Rates are private. It’s nobody’s business—unless they’re the agent or the ones paying.” READ THIS LIST"
Democrats Can Repair Free Enterprise—or Destroy Themselves,www.thedailybeast.com,Will Marshall,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/democrats-can-repair-free-enterpriseor-destroy-themselves,"'LEFT' FOR DEAD? Democrats Can Repair Free Enterprise—or Destroy Themselves What’s hip in Brooklyn won’t play so well in middle America, where even rank-and-file Democrats want a message that’s more about fixing capitalism than ditching it. opinion Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
The U.S. economy is chugging toward a new record for longest expansion, and middle-class families, finally, are seeing decent wage gains. Yet our political leaders, as if stuck in a time warp, keep peddling a bleak narrative of economic victimhood and defeatism.
Populists tell U.S. workers “global capitalism” is rigged against them. Sen. Elizabeth Warren calls for breaking up “big tech” America’s most innovative companies—because they are, well, just too big. Among millennials, socialism’s stock is soaring. Even some prominent libertarians are defecting from the free market camp and learning to love the welfare state.
What a change from the 1990s, when nearly everyone seemed certain that socialism was dead and buried and democratic capitalism reigned supreme around the world.
The economic gloom enveloping the nation’s political, academic and media elites trickles down to the public at large. According to a new Pew survey , Americans today are strikingly pessimistic about the future. They see the United States as declining economically, growing more unequal and becoming even more divided politically. Whatever happened to Americans’ native optimism?
They’ve been sideswiped by three disruptive developments. The first is the advent of a globally connected knowledge economy, which has taken a toll on blue collar America. Second, market democracies in this century got stuck in a slow growth/high inequality rut, while autocratic China surged ahead. The rancid cherry on top of these structural changes was the Great Recession of 2007-2009, intensified by the housing crisis and Wall Street’s near meltdown.
This perfect economic storm has swept away middle-income jobs, slowed productivity and wage gains and undermined the traditional foundations of working- and middle-class security, especially in the Rust Belt and rural communities. It’s also created a ton of new technology and wealth, while delivering lopsided rewards to highly educated and cosmopolitan elites. Mix in the combustible new politics of immigration and identity, and you have a surefire formula for political radicalization, from the Tea Party and Trumpean nationalism on the right to Sen. Bernie Sanders and the neo-socialist left.
Buffeted by these ideological crosscurrents, it’s easy to lose your political bearings. Yet while Donald Trump may hate free trade, and millennials may get a transgressive rush from posturing as “democratic socialists,” most Americans haven’t lost their deep-rooted faith in economic freedom, individual enterprise and market competition. A Gallup poll last year, for example, found that the public overwhelmingly (79 percent) expresses a favorable view of “free enterprise.”
“Capitalism” doesn’t fare so well, especially among young people. Nearly half of millennial and Generation Z respondents in a recent Axios survey said they prefer living in a socialist country. Such attitudes likely are a spasm of protest against the diminished economic prospects facing young Americans, especially the 60 percent who don’t have a college degree. They’ve experienced a shrinking pool of stable, middle-income jobs, stagnant or falling wage growth, escalating student debt and exorbitantly high college and housing costs.
But let’s keep things in perspective. Previous generations endured much harder economic times, yet they didn’t jettison the foundational beliefs in economic liberty, individual initiative and free markets that have made America the world’s wealthiest country.
The Great Depression hit America like an asteroid. After the stock market crashed in 1929, production plunged and the nation’s economic output was cut almost in half. In 1932, nearly 2,300 banks failed; the following year, as Franklin D. Roosevelt took office, the jobless rate hit nearly 25 percent. Legions of hobos roamed the nation desperate for work, and discouraged immigrants steamed back to Europe. It took nearly a decade for the economy to recover, mainly due to America’s entry into World War II.
The recent downturn and financial crisis was no picnic, but it pales in comparison. Nonetheless, both calamities shook public confidence in prevailing economic orthodoxy. The GOP’s laissez faire policies of the 1920s gave way to the New Deal’s prolific federal interventions on behalf of the jobless, farmers, wage earners, depositors, retirees, and poor mothers. Some of FDR’s advisors urged him to replace free market chaos with “planned economy.” Sen. Huey Long and Father Coughlin lead protest movements demanding that Washington “share the wealth” and combat the machinations of “international bankers.”
Roosevelt himself, however, neither succumbed to populist rage nor the collectivist doctrines spreading across Europe. Instead, he radiated a jaunty confidence that prosperity would soon return. And he always insisted his goal was to restore free enterprise, not replace it, by creating a public counterbalance to private economic power.
That’s why FDR is a better model for today’s progressives than Bernie Sanders. Democrats won’t build national majorities by rote business-bashing or prattling about socialism, which has never captured Americans’ political imagination.
Yet the Berniecrats and Demsocs flay the private sector as a squalid den of greed. To redeem capitalism’s moral failings, they propose a stupendous program of top-down redistribution—Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, “free college,” guaranteed government jobs—and they insist that all Democrats walk the plank. Such sectarian purity tests are a real problem, because ideas that may electrify activists in deep blue Brooklyn may repel moderate and independent voters in swing districts in Michigan or Iowa.
The left’s equation of boldness with statism is equally oblivious to another political reality: Most Americans mistrust the federal government. In a recent PPI/Expedition Strategies poll , for example, only 20 percent of voters expressed confidence in Washington’s responsiveness to their concerns or problem-solving abilities.
If they want to deny Trump a second term, Democrats should disabuse themselves of the pernicious myth that “neoliberalism” has destroyed the American dream. The anti-capitalism narrative contains some elements of truth, but vastly understates the role of technologically-driven economic change while overstating the role of policy. All the West’s advanced economies have experienced a decline in manufacturing jobs and union membership, slow productivity and economic growth, and rising inequality. This suggests deep structural forces are at work, not a sinister plot by global elites to plunder the proletariat.
The “neoliberal” trope also mushes together Republican and Democratic presidents whose policies differed in intent and result. If Ronald Reagan, the two Bushes, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama can all be lumped together as capitalist tools, what does calling them “neoliberals” convey beyond a general antipathy to free markets?
The truth is, all U.S. presidents going back to FDR supported trade liberalizing treaties, paid at least lip service to fiscal discipline, tried to strike reasonable balances between economic innovation and regulation, preferred work to the dole, and extolled private enterprise as the mighty engine of U.S. prosperity.
U.S. voters—especially in the key battleground states of the Midwest—are hungry for economic hope. They want to see the middle of the middle class grow again, and don’t want to be forced to choose between growth and equity, vibrant markets and reasonable redistribution.
How can Democrats speak to the public’s economic aspirations? Not by giving up on growth and painting a dreary picture of a future in which robots steal our jobs, workers can’t live on what they earn, America can’t compete with China and politics degenerates into battles over how to carve up a stagnant economic pie. “Demsocs want Democrats to reject free enterprise in favor of a left-wing version of Trump’s splenetic and divisive populism.”
Instead, Democrats in 2020 should present voters with radically pragmatic ideas for helping Americans get ahead. For example, let’s give working people tax relief by eliminating the regressive payroll tax and replacing it with carbon and consumption taxes. Instead of promising free college tuition, create a robust system of career education and upskilling for the 70 percent of young Americans who don’t go to or finish college.
Instead of a fanciful Green New Deal, Democrats should accelerate the mass production of electric cars, which would link carbon production to the creation of high-wage jobs for working people. Instead of breaking up tech companies, we should speed up digitizing the physical industries and create incubators for 3-D enabled manufacturing startups across the Rust Belt.
Democrats, in short, have an opportunity in 2020 to seize the high ground of economic optimism and innovation. Donald Trump has vacated that ground by embracing an odd amalgam of conservative and populist stances, including tariffs that hurt U.S. producers and consumers, closed borders, false promises to “bring back” old factory jobs, tax cuts skewed to the rich and paid for by huge public deficits, not to mention his perverse crusade to strip millions of Americans of health insurance.
On the other side, the Demsocs want Democrats to reject free enterprise in favor of a left-wing version of Trump’s splenetic and divisive populism. Instead, Democrats should channel the spirit of FDR and present voters with a hope-inspiring plan for how a reinvigorated private sector and government can work together to restore shared prosperity.

Why Did Judas Really Betray Jesus?,www.thedailybeast.com,Candida Moss,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-did-judas-really-betray-jesus,"THE ULTIMATE VILLAIN Why Did Judas Really Betray Jesus? As one of Jesus’ closest followers and friends you have to wonder what he was thinking when he betrayed Jesus. What did Judas know that we don’t? 04.13.19 10:32 PM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/Photo Getty
With Easter right around the corner, Christians are thinking about the death and resurrection of Jesus. The events that took place during what is now called “Holy Week” certainly transformed the history of the world, but they also created a new villain: Judas. As one of Jesus’ closest followers and friends you have to wonder what he was thinking when he betrayed Jesus. What did Judas know that we don’t?
For much of history, we have been led to think that Judas betrayed Jesus for a payout. According to the Gospel of Matthew , Judas received 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus. But in modern terms, that’s the equivalent of about six weeks of work for a day laborer: not a huge amount, and certainly not enough money to compensate you for betraying someone you had spent years following. If you were already annoyed and planning on leaving the movement, then perhaps this sweetener could help push you further along the path to betrayal. But the general impression that Judas betrayed Jesus for the money doesn’t make a great deal of sense.
The Gospel of John, which is almost certainly the last of the canonical gospels to be written, doubles down on the idea that Judas was motivated by financial reward. John adds that Judas was a thief who had stolen from the common resources of the group. Some of the gospels introduce the idea of demonic inspiration and possession. According to Luke 22:3 , it was during the final week in Jerusalem that the devil placed the idea of betraying Jesus into Judas’s heart. This isn’t just a literary flourish or theological window-dressing; the demonization of Judas has a long history in influencing how people, medieval Christian in particular, have thought about Jews in general. Add this to ahistorical scenes in which the Jews called for the crucifixion of Jesus and say that the blood of Jesus rests on them and their children, and the Jewish people end up as the villains of the piece. The intertwining of antisemitism, the passion narrative, and violence is one of the reasons that it is important we get the historical pieces of the passion narrative correct.
If it wasn’t about the money then, historically speaking, why did Judas do it? In truth, no one knows. But there are a number of historically and narratively responsible explanations.
In the first place, Judas’s betrayal of Jesus takes place at the tail end of a difficult few days for Jesus’ followers. According to the Gospel of Mark , the first gospel to be written and thus the one closest to the actual events, Jesus and his followers spent an evening at the home of Simon the leper in Bethany two days before Jesus’ arrest and crucifixion. As the group is at dinner, a woman comes in with a jar of extremely expensive perfume and pours it out on Jesus’s head. Mark says that “some” of those who were present were angry at her actions and asked, “Why was the ointment wasted in this way? [It] could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor.” Mark does not say exactly which of the disciples are indignant, but immediately afterwards, we are told , Judas leaves to betray Jesus to the chief priests.
If, as the Gospel of John writes, Judas was the group ‘ treasurer,’ it would make sense that he was angered by this event. During his ministry Jesus and his followers lived close to what we could call the breadline. They received some financial support from his wider group of supporters ( particularly women ), and they could depend on friends and community members for occasional food and lodging, but life was hard. Organizing the group’s limited funds and resources would have been a difficult task. In addition to which, Judas, like the other disciples, had left behind his family (whatever that looked like), home, and hopes of reliable employment when he had decided to follow Jesus. After years of struggling to make ends meet it might be frustrating to watch one’s leader do something so wasteful. Modern readers (who, let’s face it, know the ending when they first read the gospels) can see all the moments at which Jesus seems to be warning the disciples that he will be arrested and executed, and can therefore understand the scene as an anointing before death. But to the disciples none of this was immediately clear.
Moreover, at this particular moment, the disciples had been waiting for something dramatic to happen. Like most first-century Jews living in Roman-occupied Judea and Galilee, they were awaiting the arrival of a messiah to overthrow the shackles of the oppressive Roman government and establish a new regime. While some first-century Jews thought the messiah would be a priestly figure, the assumption that the messiah would help liberate the people was extremely widespread. The disciples had similar expectations. At one point two of the other disciples—James and John, the sons of Zebedee—ask Jesus for positions of authority when that happens. At another moment Peter declares that he will not allow Jesus to die. None of the disciples have an accurate sense of what kind of messiah Jesus actually is; they all misunderstand his message.
The week before Jesus is crucified, at the event we know as Palm Sunday , Jesus enters Jerusalem in triumph on the back of a donkey. The whole scene—with crowds assembled waving branches, a leader riding into the city, and the shouts of the people that Jesus comes in the name of the Lord—is reminiscent of a Roman Triumph , the celebratory ritual in which a great military leader was welcomed into the city in a procession. Everything about this moment suggests that Jesus is a political figure. Then Jesus proceeds to the Jewish Temple, where he overturns tables and throws out the money changers. To many people, but arguably especially the disciples, it seems as if things are about to happen. The revolution is beginning.
But nothing like that actually happens; there’s no rebellion. Jesus does not raise an army, organize troops, or even try to evangelize the pilgrims who were visiting Jerusalem for Passover.
At this juncture, maybe Judas is tired and disappointed and just wants to go home and try to pick up the pieces of his life. Alternatively, perhaps he thinks he can force Jesus’ hand and propel him towards a rebellion. If Jesus is arrested, one might imagine, maybe God will intervene. Perhaps Judas genuinely thinks that his actions will expedite the arrival of the Kingdom of God and is horrified at how things unfold? In either case, almost immediately after having betrayed Jesus, Judas regrets his actions and tries to return the money he was paid. In one version of the story, he commits suicide.
Modern readers aren’t the only ones to wonder about Judas’ thought process and motivations. About 250 years after the death of Jesus, a group of Christians wrote a new history of Judas. The text is known as the Gospel of Judas , and when it was discovered and announced to the world in 2006 it caused something of a media firestorm. In this version of the Easter story, Judas is presented in a much more sympathetic light: he was on a kind of secret mission from Jesus. Jesus asked Judas to do this and even predicted that Judas would be “cursed for generations” as a result, but also promised him that one day he would be vindicated.
The Gospel of Judas tells us absolutely nothing about the historical events that took place on the last few days of Jesus’s life, but it does prompt the question: how did Judas’ actions shape history? According to the Bible, it was the kiss of Judas that led to Jesus’s arrest and execution, and without that Jesus might never have been crucified. In some ways, you might say, Christianity owes a lot to Judas. READ THIS LIST"
"Game of Thrones’ Final Season: The Biggest Burning Questions, From Cersei’s Child to the White Walkers",www.thedailybeast.com,melissa.leon@thedailybeast.com (Melissa Leon),04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/game-of-thrones-final-season-the-biggest-burning-questions-from-cerseis-child-to-the-white-walkers,"WINTER IS HERE Game of Thrones’ Final Season: The Biggest Burning Questions, From Cersei’s Child to the White Walkers There are a lot of loose ends that need to be tied up in the HBO epic’s final six episodes. Here are the ones that are bugging us the most. 04.13.19 10:31 PM ET HBO
In a story as dense as the one Game of Thrones has woven over seven years, there are bound to be a few loose threads. These are questions I have regarding unresolved plot points the show either has completely forgotten about, never cared to answer, or is saving to resolve at the last minute.
The people demand answers!
What was the deal with Cersei’s first child?
Way back in the second episode of Season 1, Cersei told Catelyn Stark about losing her first child, a “ little black-haired beauty ” fathered by Robert. She brings it up again later in episode five, in a private conversation with the husband she’d soon have killed:
CERSEI: I felt something for you once, you know.
ROBERT: I know.
CERSEI: Even after we lost our first boy, for quite a while actually. Was it ever possible for us? Was there ever a time, ever a moment?
ROBERT: No. Does that make you feel better, or worse?
CERSEI: It doesn’t make me feel anything.
This confirms the boy isn’t something Cersei made up to garner sympathy with Catelyn. He really existed, and she really “lost” him; according to what she tells Cat, the boy dies of a fever shortly after birth. Some people think that through some wild, convoluted turn of events, this kid is still alive and (surprise!) named Gendry. I’d just like to know why Cersei ever placed any stock in Maggy’s prophecy if she’d already borne and buried three children (the black-haired baby, Joffrey, and Myrcella) by the time Margaery married Tommen and became queen. Is she just a pessimist, stretching the prophecy to fit her reality? Does she believe in it even now, pregnant with her fourth child? Or did the prophecy just straight-up ignore the lil’ brunette and refer only to Cersei’s blond children? What is the truth?!
Remember these guys? Quaith: This masked woman appeared exactly twice in the show, both times to deliver valuable information to Jorah that helped keep Daenerys safe in Qarth. She seemed to know all about Jorah’s past, including his betrayal, and acted out of a bizarrely uncomplicated desire to help. She knew Pyat Pree would steal Dany’s dragons and warned Jorah; she even knew exactly when Pyat Pree was closing in on Dany. And then... she disappeared. In the books, Quaith delivers prophecies whose shelf lives have since expired on the show, so it’s unlikely we’ll see her again. Still, who was she? How did she know so much? Why did she help Daenerys? Illyn Payne: The mute executioner who lopped off Ned Stark’s head hasn’t been seen since Season 4, though he was (and for all we know, still is) on Arya’s kill list. Illyrio Mopatis: This Magister of Pentos sheltered Dany and her brother Viserys when they were in exile, and brokered the deal with the Dothraki that resulted in Dany marrying Khal Drogo. Like Varys, Illyrio has always schemed for the Targaryens to return to power. (Varys and Tyrion make a pit stop at Illyrio’s place after leaving King’s Landing in Season 5.) He’s also the guy who gave Dany her dragon eggs. Where did he get them? Does he know where to find more? Where the hell is he?
What! Did! Pod! Do! To! Those! Women!
Mild-mannered Pod, sex god of Westeros, once pleasured three prostitutes so out-of-this-world amazingly that they wouldn’t accept his money. I don’t know why anyone ever talks about anything else. Someone pry the goods from him!
How the hell did Arya survive the Waif’s attack?
A guy roughly four times Arya’s size once died of an infection on this show. Arya got stabbed in the gut multiple times, fell into open water, and was fine with only some bed rest and homemade soup. What did Lady Crane put in that soup???
Are we ever finding out what the Faceless Men’s deal is?
There are several elaborate theories about Syrio Forel and his fellow Bravoosi Jaqen H’ghar being the same person, positing that Arya’s “dancing master” survived his one-on-one with Meryn Trant in Season 1 and changed faces to guide Arya on her journey. There’s no way that’s true. But I’d still like to know what the hell the Faceless Men are after. How did Jaqen, a warrior so deadly yet lithe he was able to kill three men in secret at Harrenhal, end up captured in a cage before Arya met him? What role will the Faceless Men play in the war against the Night King? Is their entire order really as simple as serving death?
What’s up with Jon’s real name?
We learn in Season 7 that his name is “Aegon Targaryen,” just like five Targaryens before him—including the eldest brother he never met, Rhaegar’s firstborn son. Giving your newborn son the same first name as your other kid seems... weird? I gotta assume someone will bring this up.
Are there baby White Walkers out there?
There is a scene in Season 6 where Bran sees Craster’s last son being taken to what looks like White Walker Mordor and placed on an ice table in what looks like White Walker Stonehenge. The Night King himself lifts the little boy up and touches his cheek, turning him into a wight. I have only a thousand questions about this. Is that wight staying a baby forever? Or do wights grow and age, somehow? Will we see a wave of undead Craster infants crawling toward the heroes at Winterfell? Who makes the White Walkers’ furniture? For that matter, where did the chains they used to drag Viserion out of the lake come from? We need answers!
Is Howland Reed going to be important or not?
Bran dismissed Meera Reed last season after her years of loyal service to him without so much as a fruit basket, let alone condolences for the brother who died saving him. It was incredibly rude. Meera and Jojen’s father, Howland, meanwhile, has never even appeared in the present day on the show. It’s a major omission since Howland is the one person who was with Ned Stark the day he found Lyanna in the Tower of Joy and brought Jon Snow home. He’s the only person apart from Bran and Sam who knows Jon is a Targaryen.
And yet! He’s sat out every conflict in the North so far. Is he biding his time? And if so, for what? He sent his children to help Bran become the Three-Eyed Raven, which indicates he has some understanding of the bigger picture here. With Meera returning home to break the news to him about the White Walkers and Jojen’s death, the time for Howland to redeem himself is now.

Jon Snow Would Actually Make a Great General,www.thedailybeast.com,P.W. Singer and M.L. Cavanaugh,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/jon-snow-would-actually-make-a-great-general,"EXCERPT Jon Snow Would Actually Make a Great General You don’t often see ‘Jon Snow’ and ‘George Washington’ in the same sentence, but the similarities between the two tell us a lot about great leadership and military history. HBO
“Jon Snow” and “strategic genius” are certainly terms that don’t seem to go together.
While Jon is one of the most beloved of characters in Game of Thrones , Ned Stark’s bastard son is often viewed like his “father”—a hero, but not a very smart or strategic one. Viewers see this in everything from Littlefinger’s sneering appraisal of him to Jon’s performance in the Battle of the Bastards, where he easily fell into Ramsay Bolton’s trap. Indeed, even the first love of his life, Ygritte, a fiery Free Folk, perhaps best sums up how Jon has generally been perceived: “You’re brave. Stupid, but brave.”
But just as the Bastard of Winterfell’s actual birth history turns out to be more than once presumed, it’s time to reevaluate how Jon Snow is viewed as a strategic leader. Far from just having great hair and sword skills, Jon Snow shares many of the attributes that have made the real world’s great supreme military commanders so successful, particularly one of the most revered in U.S. history, George Washington. Jon Snow serves as a reminder that the qualities of just one man can shape the course of an entire war. As the sellsword-turned-knight Bronn once put it, “Men win wars. Not magic tricks.” Ultimately, leaders make decisions, and decisions make history. And Jon Snow’s personal characteristics suggest that he just might be bound for greatness as a strategic leader. The Education of Jon Snow
It may be a cliché, but it is also an entirely valid lesson in both Game of Thrones and the real world: leaders are both made and born. The dynamic relationship between inherent qualities and learned attributes is often what determines a leader’s trajectory in life and conflict.
Jon Snow possesses the personal magnetism with which so many high-performing leaders are born. The often indescribable, but very real, power of persuasion and attraction that gets others to follow has repeatedly shaped history. In the American Revolution, one of the most crucial moments happened not in battle but when the tall, attractive George Washington strode into the Second Continental Congress on May 9, 1775, wearing a tailored military uniform of his own design. The often-disagreeable leaders there unanimously voted in Washington, who looked the part, as the commander of the new American army. Throughout the war, Washington would carry himself in a similar way that captured the imagination of his contemporaries. Historians have also noted the way he used his noble aloofness to strategic advantage in keeping himself above the age’s often-petty personal politics.
We see the same qualities in Jon Snow, as others are naturally drawn toward him and defer to him. Both the newest recruits to the Night’s Watch and its senior commander, Jeor Mormont, quickly recognize that Jon is special, a friend to be made and a future leader to be molded. Indeed, when the Wall is attacked by hordes of Free Folk led by former Night’s Watch brother Mance Rayder, who similarly has been impressed by Jon, the young man takes command of the Wall’s defense, an act that no one questions despite his clearly lesser rank. When Jon then orders his friend Grenn and five others to go down to protect the inner gate because giants are poised to breach the Wall, Grenn’s group knows precisely what this means—their own likely deaths. But they still fight on, for a very simple reason, as Grenn tells the unit, “You heard Jon.” Jon knew what to do, and the brothers of the Night’s Watch trusted him, even when he was not formally in charge of them.
That Jon Snow, like Washington, was born with a quality of personal magnetism doesn’t mean that he was destined for leadership. Joffrey also looked the part, and he was anything but a great leader. Indeed, with the circumstances of his birth clouded in mystery, Jon’s early days were instead defined by hardship that would prove crucial to his development and later leadership success. Jon gained p ersonal resilience through an early life as the outsider Bastard of Winterfell and then suffered his father’s beheading, as well as the loss of his brothers Robb and Rickon. Similarly, George Washington lost his father at age 11 and then his brother Laurence (who had become his “surrogate father”) at 20. Both were forced to take on early responsibilities and develop the mental and emotional toughness that often defines the best leaders. Such difficulties in childhood track with the unfortunate experiences of many other successful American leaders, including Alexander Hamilton, Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama, among others. But a broader study of over four hundred high-performing individuals also found that more than 75 percent had difficult childhoods. As spymaster Lord Varys says, “Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself? That takes work.”
It is this intersection of natural talent and early difficulty that leads Jon to build another important attribute, the ability to move across diverse settings. Early in the series, he laments to Tyrion the twin life of a bastard, knowing the lord’s family but having to eat among the lower born. Yet this dual experience provides Jon the knowledge and skills of a noble as well as an awareness and authenticity that endeared him to his troops and common folk. He understood situations from multiple perspectives, bringing to the game of thrones both the bottom-up and the top-down view that arguably no one else in Westeros could. Being able to move easily among the high and the low born has characterized many real-world leaders as well. Washington both was the equivalent of Virginia nobility and also spent his early years working as a professional surveyor, which he started at age 16 on a farm and revisited later while enduring difficult frontier expeditions (the equivalent of being beyond the Wall). “Amoral or immoral actors don’t work well with others. An apt illustration is provided by Littlefinger, who’s trusted by nobody.”
In constructing these capabilities, Snow and Washington were formed and fashioned by exceptional mentors. Ned Stark raised Jon Snow and taught him not just how to wield a sword but everything from the communication skills a good general would need in battle to the strong moral code a respected leader brings to critical relationships. Despite what Jon’s nemesis Ser Allister Thorne might say (“You have a good heart Jon Snow. It’ll get us all killed”), the reality is that these codes are often the pathway to victory. Leaders who are known to be guided by a code are considered more trustworthy by others and are thus able to build and maintain coalitions and alliances. Amoral or immoral actors don’t work well with others, and when they do, it is at best transactional and short-term.
An apt illustration is provided by Littlefinger, who’s trusted by nobody. As a result, his power is brittle and unreliable. In contrast, Jon continually builds a loyal network of followers, partners, and allies that is both sustainable and ever growing. It is not coincidental that Jon is the series’ only leader to be elected to leadership, twice, of radically different organizations, in much the same way that Washington was voted as both commander of the new American army and then president of the new United States.
It isn’t that Jon Snow or George Washington were men of moral perfection or even always lived up to their codes. We often see Jon fall short. He violated his Night’s Watch oath with Ygritte, and then he lies to Tormund that there were one thousand men at Castle Black, an act of military deception. So too, Washington was a flawed man who accepted slavery around him and who was also devious enough to run a series of spy rings. In a sense, this duality of a moral code, but peppered with pragmatism, is what allows Jon to succeed in a world where an inflexible Ned Stark was unable to survive, just as it allowed Washington to win a war that melded high moralities and low realities.
Jon’s practical education continued after he parted from Ned, when Jon “took the black” and was selected to serve as personal steward to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont. In Mormont’s fate, there is a striking echo to George Washington’s own pre–Revolutionary War mentor. In 1755 Washington served as British general Edward Braddock’s senior American aide and learned how large armies were organized, but he also witnessed the consequences of military operations that fail to understand their foes or operating environment. Like Mormont’s expedition past the Wall, Braddock’s campaign to retake Fort Duquesne from the French would end in disaster and Braddock’s own death. Jon Snow at War
These internal qualities and early years of experience and mentorship prepared Jon well for the Great War, which many sensed was coming.
Jon showed himself to be personally courageous, which would seem to be unstrategic. But influenced by his mentors, Jon knew that such displays had real battlefield benefits. Much is made of Jon’s one-man charge during the Battle of the Bastards, but what is often forgotten is the psychological tactic he employed when he called out Ramsay Bolton before the fight: “Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn’t fight for them?”
In a similar manner, Washington understood that, at some point, the strategic crosses with the personal in wars that hinge on the human element. He led from the fore at key moments—from the famous crossing of the Delaware River to the Battle of Monmouth, where he singlehandedly rallied the troops, with a display of personal courage that turned the battle. Both men’s bravery, though, is not limited to the physical but is also on display in the mental realm through their difficult decisions and hard calls. Jon knew that it would divide the Night’s Watch to bring the Free Folk into an alliance, but he did it anyway. Washington knew that it would be unpopular to evacuate cities like New York and then Philadelphia, but he still made that choice, because it had to be done.
Jon’s bravery is balanced by his grasp of the war’s two crucial strategic insights. The first is a recognition of the most essential elements of the war, the key goals and actions upon which the entire conflict will turn. Prussian general and war theorist Carl von Clausewitz would undoubtedly approve.
In the American Revolution, it was Washington’s realization that to continue fighting and sustain his army was of the utmost importance. The enemy could capture the young nation’s largest cities, but these were empty losses, as long as the Continental Army remained in the fight. Washington’s key objective was to keep the war going. Similarly, Jon recognizes that survival is the essence of victory in his war. In a war for humanity, to outlast is to win.
Jon’s second realization is the crucial importance of alliances. When Jon becomes the lord commander of the Night’s Watch, he recognizes that the White Walker threat is more important than anything else. His core insight is simple and powerful—“Winter is coming. We know what’s coming with it. We can’t face it alone.”
In ruling the North, Jon leaned into alliances. In contrast to Stannis Baratheon and then Ramsay Bolton, Jon understood that even in the most hierarchical system, to follow is still a choice, so he makes a point to draw in and unite instead of command and compel. Even when he has good reason to punish the families that pulled their support from House Stark, Jon chose leniency over punishment, in part due to his moral code but also in the name of building a bigger coalition.
Jon Snow unites disparate groups, families, and banners in a way that mirrors how George Washington realized that his role was about much more than winning battles—his larger responsibility as commander was to bring together those whom he once described as “a mixed multitude of people under very little discipline, order, or government.” Washington ultimately turned this mixture into a professional and then victorious army and then into a nation. In this cause, much like Jon, Washington was willing to look past the petty jealousies from other commanders, like Continental Army generals Henry Lee and Horatio Gates, who thought he shouldn’t lead, as well as the constant swirl of unnecessary infighting and conspiracy.
The payoff for both commanders’ focus on alliance building was the ability to attract and leverage the aid of ever more varied forces from afar, which would prove crucial to victory. The Free Folk and the Knights of the Vale are akin to the disparate coalition of allies like the French, Dutch, and Spanish, who joined the fight against Great Britain. In proving their ability to build and maintain wide-ranging alliances, Washington and Snow benefited from foreign forces in a way that their foes, who repeatedly alienated allies, could not.
In the pursuit of these twin goals, neither Jon Snow nor George Washington showed perfect judgment. Each made mistakes along the way, from Washington’s early attempt to defend New York City to Jon’s hard-charging, headlong rush into battle with Ramsay Bolton. But what they did show is the key attribute of flexibility and an ability to continually learn while still in command. As Washington himself once advised, we should “derive useful lessons from past errors… for the purpose of profiting by dear bought experience.” When Washington realized that his soldiers could not hold key cities, he shifted to a Fabian war of delay, maneuver, and opportunistic counterattack. Then after Valley Forge and the training revolution it provided, followed by the French arrival into the war, he shifted back toward seeking major battle.
Jon Snow’s original instinct is to fight with what he has and to hold the Wall with available resources. When he sees how powerful the White Walkers are, he realizes that this approach will not work against a foe with seemingly infinite resources of (dead) manpower. He then seeks to shift the balance through new alliances (with the Free Folk and Queen Daenerys) and new weapons (dragonglass and dragons).
Compare this with how Stannis Baratheon handled his battles. Despite being, as Ser Davos Seaworth puts it, the “most experienced commander in Westeros,” Stannis was too proud and inflexible to admit that he made a major strategic miscalculation in driving his army to a snowy destruction, in much the same way the once genius but then rigid Napoleon did in Russia. Losing Fights and Battles, Winning Wars (and Thrones?)
History’s great strategic leaders often look better in hindsight. George Washington was continually attacked by contemporary critics for being a “weak general,” a critique with some merit as at the time he was losing battle after battle. Indeed, Washington arguably lost more battles than any other general in American history. Jon Snow similarly seems to pale in strategic genius compared to his contemporaries and has no great victory of his own to claim.
And yet each leader brought to their roles a series of personal qualities and experiences that allowed them to succeed at what matters most, to recognize the key nature of the wars they were in, and to build the necessary alliances to achieve final strategic victory. Just as George Washington is now remembered fondly for the supreme leadership qualities he needed to win the Revolutionary War and to become the father of his country, the once discounted Bastard of Winterfell may well end up being remembered as “first in war” and “first in peace” in all the Seven Kingdoms.

Syphilis Is Spreading Across Rural America,www.thedailybeast.com,Kaiser Health News,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/syphilis-is-spreading-across-rural-america,"COMEBACK Syphilis Is Spreading Across Rural America One Missouri clinic has seen more than six times as many cases in the first few months of 2019 compared with the same period last year. 04.13.19 10:28 PM ET
By Lauren Weber
When Karolyn Schrage first heard about the “dominoes gang” in the health clinic she runs in Joplin, Mo., she assumed it had to do with pizza.
Turns out it was a group of men in their 60s and 70s who held a standing game night — which included sex with one another. They showed up at her clinic infected with syphilis.
That has become Schrage’s new normal. Pregnant women, young men and teens are all part of the rapidly growing number of syphilis patients coming to the Choices Medical Services clinic in the rural southwestern corner of the state. She can barely keep the antibiotic treatment for syphilis, penicillin G benzathine, stocked on her shelves.
Public health officials say rural counties across the Midwest and West are becoming the new battleground. While syphilis is still concentrated in cities such as San Francisco, Atlanta and Las Vegas, its continued spread into places like Missouri, Iowa, Kansas and Oklahoma creates a new set of challenges. Compared with urban hubs, rural populations tend to have less access to public health resources, less experience with syphilis and less willingness to address it because of socially conservative views toward homosexuality and nonmarital sex.
In Missouri, the total number of syphilis patients has more than quadrupled since 2012 — jumping from 425 to 1,896 cases last year — according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of new state health data. Almost half of those are outside the major population centers and typical STD hot spots of Kansas City, St. Louis and its adjacent county. Syphilis cases surged at least eightfold during that period in the rest of the state.
At Choices Medical Services, Schrage has watched the caseload grow from five cases to 32 in the first quarter of 2019 alone compared with the same period last year. “I’ve not seen anything like it in my history of doing sexual health care,” she said.
Back in 1999, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had a plan to eradicate the sexually transmitted disease that totaled over 35,000 cases nationwide that year. While syphilis can cause permanent neurological damage, blindness or even death, it is both treatable and curable. By focusing on the epicenters clustered primarily throughout the South, California and in major urban areas, the plan seemed within reach.
Instead, U.S. cases topped 101,500 in 2017 and are continuing to rise along with other sexually transmitted diseases. Syphilis is back in part because of increasing drug use, but health officials are losing the fight because of a combination of cuts in national and state health funding and crumbling public health infrastructure.
“It really is astounding to me that in the modern Western world we are dealing with the epidemic that was almost eradicated,” said Schrage.
Grappling With The Jump
Craig Highfill, who directs Missouri’s field prevention efforts for the Bureau of HIV, STD and Hepatitis, has horror stories about how syphilis can be misunderstood.
“Oh, no, honey, only hookers get syphilis,” he said one rural doctor told a patient who asked if she had the STD after spotting a lesion.
In small towns, younger patients fear that their local doctor — who may also be their Sunday school teacher or basketball coach — may call their parents. Others don’t want to risk the receptionist at their doctor’s office gossiping about their diagnosis.
Some men haven’t told family members they’re having sex with other men. And still more have no idea their partner may have cheated on them — and their doctors don’t want to ask, according to Highfill.
It’s even hard to expect providers who haven’t seen a case of syphilis in their lifetime to automatically recognize the hallmarks of what is often called the “great imitator,” Highfill said. Syphilis can manifest differently among patients, but frequently shows up for a few weeks as lesions or rashes — often dismissed by doctors who aren’t expecting to see the disease.
Since 2000, the current syphilis epidemic was most prevalent among men having sex with men. Starting in 2013, public health officials began seeing an alarming jump in the number of women contracting syphilis, which is particularly disturbing considering the deadly effects of congenital syphilis — when the disease is passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus. That can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or birth deformities. “It really is astounding to me that in the modern Western world we are dealing with the epidemic that was almost eradicated.” — Karolyn Schrage
Among those rising numbers of women contracting syphilis and the men who were their partners, self-reported use of methamphetamines, heroin or other intravenous drugs continues to grow, according to the CDC. Public health officials suggest that increased drug use — which can result in a pattern of risky sex or trading sex for drugs — worsens the outbreaks.
That perilous trend is playing out particularly in rural Missouri, argues Dr. Hilary Reno, an assistant professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis who is researching syphilis transmission and drug use in the state. Tracking cases from 2015 through June 2018, she found that more than half of patients outside of the major metropolitan areas of Kansas City and St. Louis reported using drugs.
Less Money, More Problems
Federal funding for STD prevention has stayed relatively flat since 2003, with $157.3 million allocated for fiscal year 2018. But that amounts to a nearly 40% decrease in purchasing power over that time, according to the National Coalition of STD Directors.
In Missouri, CDC annual funding has been cut by over $354,000 from 2012 to 2018 — a 17% decrease even as the number of cases quadrupled, Highfill said. “'Oh, no, honey, only hookers get syphilis,' one rural doctor told a patient who asked if she had the STD after spotting a lesion.”
Iowa, too, has seen its STD funding cut by $82,000 over the past decade, according to Iowa Department of Health’s STD program manager George Walton.
“It is very difficult to get ahead of an epidemic when case counts are steadily — sometimes rapidly — increasing and your resources are at best stagnant,” Walton said. “It just becomes overwhelming.”
Highfill bemoaned that legislatures in Texas, Oregon and New York have all allocated state money to raise awareness or provide transportation to local clinics. Missouri has not allocated anything.
A New Playing Field
In the digital age, fighting syphilis is much harder for public health responders, said Rebekah Horowitz, a senior program analyst on HIV, STDs and viral hepatitis at the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
The increased use of anonymous apps gives people greater access to more sexual partners, she said. Tracking down those partners is now much harder than camping out at the local bar in town.
“We can’t get inside of Grindr and do our traditional public health efforts,” she said.
That’s not to say Highfill’s department hasn’t tried. It has engineered a series of educational ads on Instagram, Grindr and Facebook displaying messages such as “Knowledge looks good on you.”
Highfill would love to do more — if Missouri had the money.
Public health clinics nationwide have also had to limit hours, reduce screening and increase fees that can reach $400. And some run by health departments across the country have been forced to close — at least 21 in 2012 alone, according to CDC data.
In Missouri, restrictions on Planned Parenthood’s Medicaid reimbursements that were passed last year in the legislature, and are again under debate, mean the nonprofit organization cannot be reimbursed for STD treatment for some patients.
That is another crack in the already failing public health infrastructure, said Reno, the Washington University professor who also serves as the medical director of the St. Louis County Sexual Health Clinic.
“We have a system that’s not even treading water,” she said. “We are the ship that is listing to the side.”

So You Want to Visit Westeros…
In Westeros, kings and queens come and go, heads are firmly attached one minute and rolling along the floor the next, and your friendly royal rival and potential love interest suddenly is revealed to be your aunt. But while alliances can shift at a moment’s notice, there is one truth that is inescapable: winter is coming.
For the real-world locations that pose as the Seven Kingdoms, “winter” means tourists.
While Game of Thrones may be a fantasy with its lands formed in the imagination of George R.R. Martin, the creators of the show opted early on to prioritize filming in real locations with the real landscapes and elements that they provide rather than relying entirely on post-production and CGI to build the worlds of Westeros and Essos. This has resulted in an even more magical setting for the Seven Kingdoms’ shenanigans and has elevated the real-turned-fictional locations into characters in their own right.
Over the course of the eight seasons of HBO’s wildly popular series, filming has occurred around the world in countries extending from Northern Ireland and Spain to Croatia and Morocco. This range has created something of a cast rivalry. ( Emilia Clarke recently scoffed at Kit Harrington’s complaint that his location in Iceland has the worst climate. Clarke told Stephen Colbert that Harington at least has short filming hours due to the lack of daylight, while she has to shoot “in a quarry in Malta in 100-degree heat passing out every single season.”) It has also introduced a new favorite past-time for devotees of the series: Game of Thrones tourism.
Like the armies of White Walkers, the hordes of GOT pilgrims have descended on many of these locations, which have largely welcomed them and their gold coins with open arms. Because, while traveling to the actual Westeros may not be an option (sorry, superfans), visiting the lands where the Seven Kingdoms were brought to life is. And you may just find that the real places are even more magical than those on the screen. So, pack your bags and queue up the Game of Thrones theme song because your trip across the Narrow Sea is about to begin. Dubrovnik, Croatia (aka King’s Landing)
The Old Town of Dubrovnik on the Adriatic Sea is steeped in a rich history of its own—it was named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979 and it survived a siege during the Balkan wars in the early 1990s. But it’s the city’s role as King’s Landing starting in Season 2 that has brought visitors pouring in. (Both Ned Stark and Malta as the capital city of Westeros were killed off at the end of the show’s first season.)
Avid Game of Thrones fans will recognize the charming red roofs that line the steep city streets and the medieval walls that surround them as iconic markers of King’s Landing, but inside the city gates there are more attractions to behold. Want to recreate Cersei ’s walk of shame? It’s a questionable desire, but one that can be fulfilled starting at St. Ignatius of Loyola Church. Olenna Tyrell plotted regicide and held court in the palace gardens that can be found just north of the historic district at the Trsteno Arboretum. And you should probably watch your dragons while walking the city walls when you reach the Minčeta Tower, which is otherwise known as the House of the Undying.
While the TV tourist boom has brought some much-needed economic support to the city, the flood of visitors has also threatened the area with congestion. In 2017, the city’s mayor announced that the number of tickets to walk the walls would be limited to help create a more enjoyable experience for both residents and visitors. “Want to recreate Cersei’s walk of shame? It’s a questionable desire, but one that can be fulfilled starting at St. Ignatius of Loyola Church.” Vatnajökull National Park, Iceland (aka Beyond the Wall)
Iceland has been experiencing a tourist boom over the last several years thanks to a few colliding forces namely, according to The New York Times , the 2008 financial crash that made it a relatively cheap vacation spot and the eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano that beamed images of the country’s exotic landscapes into homes around the world. Iceland began popping up on all of the travel “where to go lists” just as Game of Thrones became a viral sensation creating, as The New York Times put it , “an invasion on a scale possibly unseen since Vikings raided the island hundreds of years ago.”
While various sites around Iceland have been used to bring the North to life, the country has mainly served as the setting for the Land Beyond the Wall. The glaciers and frozen lakes and piles of snow of Vatnajökull National Park have created a world in which winter is always present.
“We always knew we wanted something really shatteringly beautiful and barren and brutal for this part of Jon’s journey because he’s in the true north now,” David Benioff, executive producer and writer, said of the scenes beyond the wall.
In addition to the national park , there’s the Grjótagjá cave to the north where Jon Snow and Ygritte got it on; Thingvellir National Park to the west near Reykjavik where the cannibalistic Thenns were introduced and where Brienne of Tarth fought the Hound, and the lava field of Dimmuborgir in the north of the country, which the wildlings made their temporary home. Northern Ireland (aka nearly all of Westeros)
Robert Boake, supervising location manager for Game of Thrones , has called Northern Ireland the “mothership of the show.” As the production headquarters, it’s almost easier to list the scenes that weren’t shot in and around Belfast than those that were. As Boake summed it up, basically any location that didn’t require sunny, desert climes was filmed in Northern Ireland.
You may recognize the Dark Hedges in County Antrim as the dramatically beautiful Kingsroad; Dunluce Castle and Ballintoy Harbor on the coast served as the Iron Islands; Tollymore Forest Park doubled as the dark forests of the Old Gods that surround Winterfell; and, in a complete about-face, the Glens of Antrim were sometimes used to film the Dothraki Sea (which also was shot in Bardenas Reales in Spain because only on TV can you be in two places at once.)
It helps that Northern Ireland is all about the influx of visitors. According to John McGrillen , chief executive of Tourism Northern Ireland, one in six visitors to the region is a GOT stan, and the tourism board estimates that £30 million is spent each year by visitors inspired to make the trip because of the show. Just to make Northern Ireland’s location reign official, HBO recently announced that they would be opening something of a fan experience in several filming locations around the region later this year. “You may recognize the Dark Hedges in County Antrim as the dramatically beautiful Kingsroad.” Sevilla, Spain (aka Dorne)
The Martells may not have had quite as much screen time as the Lannisters or the Starks, but they win when it comes to the most colorful and aesthetically pleasing palace in the realm. (OK, the dreary Winterfell isn’t even in the running.)
That’s almost entirely due to the Alcázar of Seville, a castle built by the Moors in the eighth century that doubles as the Winter Palace of Dorne. The geometric ornamentation and Islamic flourishes of the palace help build the coastal aesthetic of the Sand Snakes, which pairs very nicely with their ornate, brightly colored, and often revealing garb.
While Dorne is the crown jewel of the Spanish set, the palaces of Spain played starring roles in the series, particularly in the seventh season. Castillo de Almodóvar del Río near Córdoba might be recognized as Highgarden, the Castle of Zafra as the Tower of Joy, and Castell de Santa Florentina as the family seat of House Tarly. And, of course, the only proper place to stage the fighting pits of Meereen would be in a genuine bullring in southern Spain. Morocco (aka Astapor and Yunkai)
Sure Westeros tends to get all the glory, but let us not forget that a significant portion of Game of Thrones takes place across the Narrow Sea in Essos. In the third season as Daenerys works to free the captives in the cities that make up Slaver’s Bay (which also helps to shore up her political base), two of the slave cities—Astapor and Yunkai—can be found in Morocco. The former of these was filmed in the coastal town of Essaouira and the later in Aït Benhaddou near Marrakech.
While production in Morocco largely dropped off after the third season, this location might help explain all those flowing, flimsy dresses that Khaleesi wears. Long live the desert-chic Mother of Dragons! READ THIS LIST"

My Mother’s Romance With King Kong,www.thedailybeast.com,Victoria Riskin,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/my-mother-fay-wrays-romance-with-king-kong,"IT WASN'T THE AIRPLANES My Mother’s Romance With King Kong For decades after ‘King Kong’ debuted, the actress Fay Wray would be inextricably linked with the great ape. According to her daughter, Wray didn’t mind one bit. 04.13.19 10:26 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty
This month marks the 86th anniversary of the 1933 world premiere of King Kong in New York. Klieg lights swept the skies over Radio City Music Hall and the RKO Roxy across the street, where a combined audience of 9,000 filled every seat, that night and for weeks to come. Two weeks later, the film premiered at Grauman’s Chinese Theater in Hollywood. In both cities the film astounded and delighted the public. Its success saved the RKO studio from bankruptcy and some say it even saved the motion picture industry, reawakening public excitement in movies when the business was struggling to attract audiences in the hard times that had gripped the country.
My mother, Fay Wray, has been inextricably tied to Kong ever since it opened. Playing her signature role, Ann Darrow, the damsel-in-distress who captures King Kong’s heart, is how most people remember her today, even though she starred in over 100 other films with actors like Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, and William Powell—all great, but none, apparently, the equal of the mighty Kong. At times she wished she might be remembered for some of her other roles as well. Yet she grew to appreciate—dare I say love?—Kong, and the role he had played in her life.
“Every time I walk by the Empire State Building,” she once said, “I look up and say a little prayer. A good friend of mine died up there.”
In her 1988 autobiography, written when she was 81, she wrote him a letter:
Dear Kong,
This has to be an open letter because I’ve never had a precise address for you.
A few years ago, a Mr. Auerbach wrote in The New York Times that he had interviewed you at your island home. But I do not want to chance addressing you at just Skull Island; today, without a zip code—who knows?
I wonder if you know how strong a force you have been in my public life.
For more than half a century, to speak of me is to think of you. To speak to me is often a prelude to questions about you…
My mother’s appreciation for the film was cemented by her affection for its creators, Marion C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack, with whom she remained lifelong friends. Coop and Monty, as they were called—Schoedsack was also known as ""Shorty;"" he was 6’9” tall—were remarkable adventurers known for documentaries they made— Grass (1925) and Chang (1927)—filmed at great risk in remote corners of the world. Their motto was, “Make it distant, dangerous, and difficult!”
Four years before filming Kong , my mother had made her final silent film, The Four Feathers , with Coop and Monty. She loved their zest for life and always looked forward to the chance to work with them again.
“Fay,” Marion Cooper said, “I am going to cast you opposite the tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood.” She had just returned to Los Angeles from Broadway where she had starred opposite a wonderful newcomer, Cary Grant , whom she adored. For a moment she dared to imagine that her co-star might be Cary or, if not, maybe Clark Gable. Then Cooper swept open a curtain and revealed his rendering of the giant Kong and the enormous jungle sets. Cooper pounded his chest like Kong, my mother laughed, and that was that.
Cooper and Schoedsack, never ones to miss an opportunity, used the same sets to film The Most Dangerous Game at the same time as Kong and cast her in this one as well, opposite Joel McCrea. She shuttled back and forth between the productions, sometimes throwing on a blonde wig, escaping from Kong on one set and Count Zaroff on the other. She loved every minute.
King Kong spawned two remakes, one produced by Dino de Laurentiis with Jessica Lange as Ann Darrow, the other by Peter Jackson with Naomi Watts. The original movie inspired a mega-ride at Universal Studios, and King Kong T-shirts and Halloween masks, costumes and mugs are sold at the Empire State Building—an entire cottage industry. There was a time when King Kong screened somewhere in the world every day, and it remains on most lists of 100 best pictures. “Fay Wray” is routinely an answer in crossword puzzles, Fay Wray and King Kong are used regularly in jokes and cartoons, and her name was even adopted by a rock band. Wray and Kong are tied together—there’s no getting around it.
It would never have occurred to Merion C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack nor to my mother that the giant ape would still be captivating New York audiences 86 years later. As I walk around the city today there he is, on billboards and posters everywhere in his newest incarnation, having emerged from his long retirement to open in a new $35,000,000 musical on Broadway. There he stands, towering in all his dramatic and gigantic glory, an enormous man-made gorilla brilliantly maneuvering around the stage with the help of athletic puppeteers working with wires and ropes—again, as in 1933, to the astonishment of a rapt, cheering audience. His movements, gestures, facial expressions, emotions—all are uncannily realistic, even human.
This time Ann Darrow is in the hands of an effervescent young woman, Christiani Pitts, who, appropriate to the times, is feistier and more independent than any of her predecessors. When I attended the production and Christiani invited me backstage, I was received with the nicest, warmest greeting from her and the rest of the talented cast and crew. I wished them well and told them I thought my mother would have been very proud of them.

Why Steinbeck’s Masterpiece is Disturbingly Relevant to Trump’s America,www.thedailybeast.com,Nicolaus Mills,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-steinbecks-masterpiece-is-disturbingly-relevant-to-trumps-america,"TIMELESS Why Steinbeck’s Masterpiece is Disturbingly Relevant to Trump’s America ‘The Grapes of Wrath’ turns 80 today, and Nobel-prize winning novelist John Steinbeck’s tale of migrants shunned, harassed, and murdered feels horribly contemporary. 04.13.19 10:25 PM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
It could not be more fitting that the 80th anniversary of John Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath falls on Palm Sunday this year. Steinbeck’s 1939 depiction of the fictional Joad family after they, like thousands of others, have been forced off their failing Oklahoma farm, is as much a religious tale of unearned suffering as a political account of the Great Depression.
What makes the Joads’ migrant story—and by extension the stories of other Dust Bowl families of the ’30s—especially poignant in 2019 is the perspective it casts on the trials so many immigrant families face today trying to start new lives in the United States after fleeing their home countries. Except for the brief time they spend in a government-run camp for migrants, the Joads are constantly made to feel unwelcome once they take to the road.
The Grapes of Wrath begins with Tom Joad, the eldest Joad son, returning to his family after being paroled from the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, where he was sent after being convicted of killing a man in a drunken fight. It is through Tom’s eyes that we first see how his family’s life has been turned upside down.
At the core of the Joads’ ordeal is the shock of being thrown off their own land. The Joads have never made a great living, but tenant farming has given them reliable work. Now they must start all over by hiring themselves out.
Being forced to leave their land against their will and look for new jobs in California unmoors the Joads . The car carrying them, an old Hudson that has been cut in half and turned into a truck, contains Ma and Pa Joad, Uncle John, two grandparents, six children, the husband of the pregnant Rose of Sharon, the eldest of the Joad daughters, plus the ex-preacher, Jim Casy, a family friend.
The Joads’ car, Steinbeck notes, has become their “new hearth, the living center of the family.” The car is way too cramped to offer the comfort of a real hearth. It is a way station at best. What is striking about the Joads at this point in their lives is that they have kept their decency intact. When Ma Joad is asked about taking Jim Casy with them, she replies, “I never heerd tell of no Joads or no Hazletts, neither, ever refusin’ food an’ shelter or a lift on the road to anybody that asked.”
Most important for Ma Joad is keeping her family together. “All we got is the family unbroken,” she says. But on the road, Ma Joad learns that her family cannot survive alone. The Joads are aided by the Wilsons, another migrant family, when Grandpa Joad suffers a stroke, and they realize that when they have food, they cannot eat in front of others who are hungry. “Use’ ta be the family was fust. It ain’t so now. It’s anybody,” Ma Joad concludes before long. ““Okie use’ ta mean you was from Oklahoma,” Tom says. “Now it means you’re a dirty son-of-a-bitch.””
The greatest obstacle to the Joads is not their own poverty. It is those who see them as a threat. In town after town, local police and sheriffs, acting like a ’30s version of today’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), constantly harass the Joads, who, to their dismay, find that their Oklahoma roots have become a liability. “Okie use’ ta mean you was from Oklahoma,” Tom says. “Now it means you’re a dirty son-of-a-bitch.”
When the Joads get to California, they come upon a land filled with vineyards and orchards glowing in the morning sun. But this prosperity is not theirs to share in. Their modern Exodus has not brought them to a promised land. The wages they make when they get work are so low they cannot save any money. And when a group of workers on one of the farms where the Joads stop try to form a union, the workers are beaten back.
Jim Casy is killed by a gang of strikebreakers, and Tom Joad, who will be returned to prison if he is arrested, is forced to leave his family behind after he gets into a fight defending Casy and becomes a wanted man.
Tom’s departing words to his mother are, “Wherever they’s a fight so hungry people can eat, I’ll be there. Wherever they’s a cop beatin up a guy, I’ll be there.” Tom has changed for the better, but his flight diminishes the Joad family. Steinbeck’s novel ends with the remaining Joads taking shelter in an abandoned boxcar during a heavy rainstorm.
In the final scene of the novel, Rose of Sharon, deserted by her husband, feels bereft after losing her baby in childbirth, but when she and Ma Joad come across a starving man, Rose of Sharon feeds him with the milk from her still-full breasts. It is a deeply moving gesture, a sign of how much Rose of Sharon has matured, but it is not a gesture that suggests a solution to the economic problems faced by the Joads and those like them.
In the Great Depression, few saw more clearly the limits of what isolated individuals could accomplish politically than President Franklin Roosevelt. Throughout his time in office, FDR described the goals of his administration in religious terms. “Your government is still on the same side of the street with the Good Samaritan and not those who pass by on the other side,” Roosevelt declared as he campaigned for a second term in office.
Yet, it was World War II, not the economic programs of the New Deal, that finally brought unemployment down into the single digits and allowed families like the Joads to find work in the wartime industries that in the ’40s flourished on the West Coast, particularly in California.
Small wonder, then, that Steinbeck, who in 1939 had no way of foreseeing the changes World War II would bring about, ended The Grapes of Wrath by focusing on Rose of Sharon’s act of kindness rather than on systemic reform. Steinbeck admired Rose of Sharon just as today we both admire and acknowledge the limits of the Sanctuary Movement’s defense of at-risk immigrants and asylum seekers. READ THIS LIST"

Bernie Sanders Is Not Apologizing For His Wealth,www.thedailybeast.com,Audrey.McNamara@thedailybeast.com (Audrey McNamara),04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-fights-back-against-criticism-over-his-newfound-wealth-3,"SORRY NOT SORRY Bernie Sanders Is Not Apologizing For His Wealth “I didn't know that it was a crime to write a good book,” Sanders told supporters.
Bernie Sanders is not apologizing for his newfound wealth .
The presidential candidate told supporters in Gary, Indiana, on Saturday: “I didn't know that it was a crime to write a good book, which turned out to be a best-seller.”
Sanders has come into a new income bracket largely through sales of his 2016 book Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In , where the senator shares stories from his underdog 2016 presidential campaign.
The book details Sanders' “progressive economic, environmental, racial, and social justice agenda,” an agenda that has made the book's success—and Sanders profit off that success—a sticking point.
The criticism started when Sanders admitted that he is now a millionaire earlier this week, while announcing he plans to release a decade of his tax returns before April 15—after dragging his feet over their release. His campaign swiftly emphasized that his policy platform, which is highly critical of billionaires and corporations, has not changed as a result.
“My view has always been that we need a progressive tax system which demands that the wealthiest people in this country finally start paying their fair share of taxes,” Sanders said. “If I make a lot of money, you make a lot of money, that is what I believe.”
Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir defended his candidate, reiterating that the new income has not diminished his commitment to fighting social inequality.
“The fact that he is somebody who has personally benefited from that opportunity is something that he feels should be a shared opportunity with everyone else,” Shakir told CNN. “He's made some money off a book. And I think that the opportunity that he has had is evaporating for so many others. He feels that strongly ... There's nothing about any of these tax returns or the money or anything that'll come out that'll change that fundamental fact one bit.”
This week, ThinkProgress, a progressive news website, alleged in a video that Sanders had recently started aiming his wealth criticism higher. The video argued that the senator was now directing his ire at billionaires— instead of his fellow millionaires.
Sanders' high-wire act of fighting for the underclasses while profiting off of that fight is nothing new to popular politicians. But the senator has nonetheless taken heat from many who otherwise support his cause.
“I don't apologize for writing a book that was number three on the New York Times best seller, translated into five or six languages and that's that,” Sanders said. READ THIS LIST"
Trump Duels With Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf Over Migrants,www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-duels-with-oakland-mayor-libby-schaaf-over-migrants,"11 hours ago Oakland Mayor Duels With Trump Over Migrants: ‘Oakland Welcomes All’
Days after the Washington Post revealed that the president had hatched a plan to release detained immigrants in sanctuary cities to punish his political rivals—a plan which he confirmed is still under ""strong consideration""—Trump attacked the Mayor of Oakland and ""other Sanctuary Cities"" in an escalating Twitter battle on Saturday night. ""So interesting to see the Mayor of Oakland and other Sanctuary Cities NOT WANT our currently 'detained immigrants' after release due to the ridiculous court ordered 20-day rule,"" Trump tweeted, in a series of posts apparently triggered by a New York Times article on his immigration policy. (In the tweets, he also claimed that he'd never ordered officials to close the Southern Border, nor offered pardons to Homeland Security Officials; and huffed that he was ""not 'frustrated'."") The city's mayor, Libby Schaaf, soon fired back: ""I’ve been consistent and clear: #Oakland welcomes all, no matter where you came from or how you got here."" She also told the president to ""stop fanning hate and division.""
Shortly after Schaaf's reply, Trump fired off another volley, tweeting, ""Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities. We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level, especially by the State of California, which is well known or its poor management & high taxes!""
Schaaf is just the latest mayor to speak out about Trump's plan, with the mayors of Seattle, Chicago, and Philadelphia, among others, saying they'd welcome the immigrants to their cities. “I am proud that Cambridge is a sanctuary city,” Mayor Marc McGovern of Cambridge, Massachusetts, told The Daily Beast on Friday. “Trump is a schoolyard bully who tries to intimidate and threaten people. I’m not intimidated and if asylum seekers find their way to Cambridge, we’ll welcome them.”"

NBC
Just in time for the release of the new tell-all book Ladies Who Punch , Saturday Night Live went in on The View hard this week.
“You’re watching The View ,” an announcer said at the top of the sketch. “Let’s get ready to rumble!”
Introducing herself as Whoopi Goldberg, Leslie Jones began by saying, “I’m as surprised as you that this show is a fit for me.” She went on to introduce the day’s “hot topic” as President Trump’s firing of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and asked Cecily Strong’s Abby Huntsman for her thoughts.
“You want to start with me?” a surprised Huntsman asked before struggling to balance her “human mother” and “conservative daughter” sides. “Did I talk too long, Whoopi?” she asked when she was done.
But the sketch saved the most scathing portrayal for Aidy Bryant’s Meghan McCain, who, as in real life , immediately started a shouting match with Kate McKinnon’s Joy Behar, forcing Goldberg to intervene by squirting a water bottle at them.
“Can I just say something as the princess of Arizona?” McCain asked. “There is a crisis at the border, and the border is right up in my Arizona, which was founded on sunburnt women selling turquoise jewelry, not rando Mexicans. And that’s not racist because my makeup artist is gay.”
As Behar tried to weigh in, McCain shot back, “Can you let me talk because it’s actually your job to listen to me!”
“OK, stop it. We’re not going to do this,” Goldberg said. “This is The View . We’re five best friends with nothing in common.”
Later, they welcomed host Emma Stone as “vixen of anti-vax” and former View co-host Jenny McCarthy. “My doctor is Google,” she said. “My science is Twitter, and my religion is Donnie Wahlberg.”
“What the left fails to understand is that vaccinations are a personal liberty issue,” McCain chimed in, launching another fight.
“Can I punch you in the face?” Behar asked, removing her earrings as Goldberg spritzed her in the face once more. It was just barely crazier than the real thing."

NBC
“You’re watching MSNBC,” Saturday Night Live began this week. “Now that the Mueller report turned out to be a big fat zero, we’re back to prison shows.” What followed was a truly bizarre Lockup sketch that found a series of recently arrested celebrities sharing a cell.
First there was Kate McKinnon as Lori Loughlin , who threatened to shank one of her fellow prisoners for calling her Aunt Becky before revealing that she had already joined the Nation of Islam. “That’s right, I bought my way in for 100 grand,” she said. “Plus another hundred for them to stop calling me the white devil.”
“You think prison is hard?” she asked. “I have done 68 Hallmark movies. I have seen hell, man. And in half those Hallmark movies, I marry Santa’s son, so I have lost all sense of reality.”
Next up was Pete Davidson as Michael Avenatti . “Bitch, I’m accused of crimes you can’t even conceive of,” he said. “Like blackmailing a sneaker company and stealing taxes from a coffee shop to fund a racecar team. And I’m so shady that a porn star once said that she needed to distance herself from me.”
“And you know what the worst part is?” he asked. “I might still run for president. Avenatti/Baldwin 2020!”
Then, just like that, Michael Keaton emerged as a bearded and completely unhinged Julian Assange .
“That’s right, it’s me,” he said. “I’m the architect of anarchy. I’m the king of chaos. I’m the scourge of the cleaning staff at the Ecuadorian embassy.”
“Now you sons of bitches want to hear how crazy I am?” Assange continued. “Here’s how crazy I am. I’m wanted in the U.S. and Sweden. I’m from Australia. I live in London, in Ecuador—you try figuring that one out! Yeah, you cheat your schools and, you know, you rob your companies, that’s cute. I’ve attacked the U.S. military, bitches, because I’m an actual James Bond supervillain and I’m one step away from destroying the goddamn moon.”
“So you want to get nuts?” he asked, quoting his own iconic Batman performance. “Come on, let’s get nuts!”"

Newly released surveillance video shows two Chicago police officers dragging a 16-year-old girl down stairs, while punching her and using a stun gun on her. The video is now being used in a lawsuit against the city, the two officers, and the school district's Board of Education. The incident occurred when the officers were called to escort the girl out of her high school for having her phone out in class. The girl was initially charged with “aggravated assault against a peace officer,” but the charges were dropped a week later. “Thank God for that video,” said the girl’s attorney, Andrew M. Stroth. The video appears to contradict the account officers gave of the incident.
The girl’s father, Laurentio Howard, witnessed the end of the altercation when he arrived at the school to pick his daughter. “I couldn't believe I seen two sworn police officers of Chicago abusing my daughter like this,” Howard said. “And I'm standing right there watching them do this and can't do anything about it.” The upsetting video shows the girl laying on the ground at the base of the stairs as one officer steps on her and the other appears to punch her, then one officer stuns her.

Bernie Sanders Blasts Liberal Think Tank CAP In Scathing Letter: ‘This Counterproductive Negative Campaigning Needs to Stop’,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-blasts-liberal-think-tank-cap-in-scathing-letter-this-counterproductive-negative-campaigning-needs-to-stop,"DISMAYED Bernie Sanders Blasts Liberal Think Tank CAP in Scathing Letter The letter was sent after the news organ that is a project of the progressive think tank Center for American Progress published a video criticizing Sanders' wealth. 04.14.19 1:05 PM ET Mike Blake/Reuters
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) wrote a harshly-worded letter to a liberal think tank this weekend, accusing the organization of ""using its resources to smear"" him and two of his Senate colleagues currently running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
The letter , obtained and first reported by The New York Times , was delivered on Saturday to the board of the Center for American Progress and the Center for American Progress Action Fund. This comes after ThinkProgress, a news outfit that is editorially independent of CAP though a project of the think tank, published a video suggesting the Independent from Vermont had altered his language about wealth inequality in the United States after he had become a millionaire himself, due to the success of his recent book. In the video, they showed clips of Sanders at times denouncing just ""billionaires"" as opposed to ""millionaires and billionaires,"" after his book his published.
“This counterproductive negative campaigning needs to stop,” Sanders wrote in the letter. “The Democratic primary must be a campaign of ideas, not of bad-faith smears. Please help play a constructive role in the effort to defeat Donald Trump.”
As The Daily Beast reported, ThinkProgress did not view their work as being explicitly adversarial.
“ThinkProgress did not try to ‘go after’ Sen. Sanders—to use your words—and we will not ‘go after’ any other candidate,” Jodi Enda, the editor of ThinkProgress said. “We strive to be fair and to allow our readers and viewers to interpret the news for themselves. We are no different from other media in that regard.”
In a statement on Sunday, she said: ""Political leaders should not be able to muzzle or stop critical coverage.""
Sanders also expressed concern in his letter about corporate contributions tilting CAP's role in the broader resistance movement against President Trump.
“Center for American Progress leader Neera Tanden repeatedly calls for unity while simultaneously maligning my staff and supporters and belittling progressive ideas,” he wrote. “I worry that the corporate money CAP is receiving is inordinately and inappropriately influencing the role it is playing in the progressive movement.”
CAP was founded by John Podesta, an ally of the Clintons who served as 2016 chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign. Its current president, Tanden, as well as Podesta, were previously critical of Faiz Shakir , when he was advising Sanders' 2016 bid. Shakir, who now serves as Sanders' 2020 campaign manager, had previously worked at CAP and helped launch ThinkProgress .
Sanders was also critical of previous pieces the websites published about two fellow Senators he is close with and currently running against in the Democratic primary.
“I and other Democratic candidates are running campaigns based on principles and ideas and not engaging in mudslinging or personal attacks on each other,” he wrote. “Meanwhile, the Center for American Progress is using its resources to smear Senator Booker, Senator Warren and myself, among others. This is hardly the way to build unity, or to win the general election.”
According to the Times , Tanden told Shakir that “we share the goals of unity"" and offered to meet and discuss the ""unfortunate"" situation. Shakir did not immediately respond to a question from The Daily Beast about whether the meeting would take place."

Artist Cj Hendry “Loves a LOL”,www.thedailybeast.com,elizabeth.brockway@thedailybeast.com (Elizabeth Hunt Brockway),04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/meet-cj-hendry-the-photorealism-artist-drawing-her-own-path-to-success,"Artist Cj Hendry “Loves a LOL” Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast She rose to fame on Instagram, but now the Brizzy-born Brooklyn transplant has found her place as a bonafide fixture in the art world with her humorous take on luxury and realism. Elizabeth Hunt Brockway 04.14.19 11:47 AM ET
S itting in a sizable (though relatively modest by her own accord) artist studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, surrounded by an Hermes throw, a Chanel surfboard, and hundreds of thousands of dollars of her original drawings, Cj Hendry mentioned the quarter life crisis that took her from a struggling Brizzy college student to a New York artist currently celebrating her sixth solo exhibit.
Now 31, Hendry is a successful hyperrealistic artist who has collaborated with brands like Christian Louboutin and counts Kanye West and Pharrell Williams amongst some of her most famous fans. She began her career with black and white pen drawings of luxury goods but has progressed toward colored pencils and abstract subject matter in more recent years. Her finished products look so freakishly real, a double-take is almost needed to confirm they are, in fact, drawings.
Her latest show , which opened last week and runs through April 21, is no exception. An extension of a prior series exploring swatches of paint drawn with colored pencil, Rorschach is a break from Hendry's hyper literal aesthetic and has a level of psychology injected into her photorealistic art while maintaining her brand's iconic level of kitsch and kook appeal.
But while Hendry has achieved relative success (""I'm not one of the big dogs,"" she insists) in the traditional art world, like many people of a certain age, she once found herself meandering along the well traveled and stable — if not predictable — path of school, to university, to job, to family, to a life well-lived. Yet, she felt unfulfilled.
“I spent seven years at university and I have no degree,” she laughed of her foray into traditional higher education. “I chose architecture because I thought it would be really lovely and creative. But then I found myself designing a toilet block while an intern at an architecture firm and just thought to myself, ‘this isn’t for me.’”
After spending two years studying the subject, she thought, “Hhmmm, I suck at this,” and gave finance a try.
“I sucked even more at that,” she said, smiling.
“It seemed secure. I knew you could make moneys out of that. But I was just chasing the moneys life. Or what I thought would be the moneys life. And it was just hopeless.”
Then came her life-changing epiphany. “I had a shitty job, was shitty at university, and just knew, ‘This is not how my life is supposed to play out.’ I’m better than this.” And like any true millennial would, she recited an inspiring mantra to propel herself forward: “I’m Beyonce. I’m Beyonce. I’m Beyonce.”
So with the confidence no one other than Queen Bey can inspire, Hendry dropped out of university, quit her job as a retail assistant at Chanel, and gave herself a year to pursue art full time. “If I was still at uni and still working and just drew three hours a week, it was just never going to happen.”
Luckily, she had limited overhead; she still lived with her parents at her childhood home in Brisbane, Australia, and primarily needed money only for her phone bill, snacks, and “petrol” (Aussie for gas). To supplement little money she had saved from her job, she gathered her entire wardrobe and sold it on eBay; with that money, she was able to afford the best materials and framing to make her art shine. “I just thought, ‘Let me give myself the best opportunity I can to make this the best it can be.’”
Four months later, she had her first sale. “I hate to say it, but it all came down to money. I wouldn’t still be drawing because I love drawing. But after that first sale, it kind of went from there.”
Hendry has been branded an “Instagram artist,” a moniker for those who owe much of their outward success to the social media app. The title is nothing short of accurate, but at times can seemingly carry a pejorative undertone, as if to suggest there needs to be a qualifier in front of the title of artist. There is no shortage of the creatives to be found on the platform. The genre has inspired several further subgenres — lettering artists , iPad cartoonists , fluid painters , just to name a few — of innovative individuals who have seized the opportunity to show their art and grow their community with effectively zero budget.
“It seems obvious now,” Hendry explained, but her plan never included embracing the transformative platform. “Instagram wasn’t a given when I started. But then it was like, ‘This thing is here, let me just try it.’”
As a photorealistic artist, however, her art, by definition, is supposed to look like a photograph. So a platform made to post photos would seemingly detract the very thing that made her art special. “I knew people weren’t going to believe the finished products were drawings.” She needed to find a way to demonstrate that her art was done by hand. This was before Instagram supported video; before Insta-stories; both now-easy ways to show process. So she started posting the quarter mark or halfway mark of her drawings before posting the finished product.
“People were like, ‘OMG!’” she said, laughing. “At the time, it was super impressive.”
With the platform still in its relative infancy, Hendry was able to snag some early on perks those today may not be able to obtain, like being featured on a recommended follow page, which gave her an immediate boost of numbers. “I got on at the right time,” she said.
Now, her page acts as a digital retrospective. Those interested in the progression of her art need only access to a web browser and a few swipes of your finger (or scrolls of a mouse) to explore her seven-year career. Still, she makes sure not to take it too seriously.
“Everybody whines about it because it’s so competitive and it’s not fun anymore. It’s just a thing you have to do. So now I just take stupid photos and it doesn’t suit this luxury brand that I’ve got, but people really froth over it. I think people are like, ‘Oh, there’s a real person behind this elegant thing.’”
It’s this juxtaposition that makes her brand thrive. She makes the unattainable seem approachable. She gives her fans a peak behind the gilded proverbial curtain. All with a snicker and a hint of irony that makes much of contemporary art successful. Just ask Damien Hirst .
“I’m here for fucking laughs. I love a lol,” she says, saying the once-abbreviation as the full word it's become.
This modern laissez faire humor of hers comes across in her art. Sure, there is the technical accomplishment — and it certainly is an impressive one at that — but rather, it’s in the way she utilizes her technical prowess that makes it clear she’s in on the joke.
Take her newest show, Rorschach , for example. Instead of drawing actual Rorschach tests used in psychological assessment, Hendry inserts her brand of humor by turning them into child's play, both literally and figuratively.
To find a room containing her latest series, guests must first take off their shoes, climb into, and then navigate a 3,000 square foot bouncy house resembling the padded walls of insane asylums of a bygone era. The stark white and padded 14-foot walls give way to a submerged gallery space showcasing the new series of colorful drawings of squishes of paint.
Remember in elementary school, when you had a piece of paper and put blobs of paint on one side, folded it in half, and then unfolded it to reveal a colorful abstract form? That’s the subject matter of Rorschach . “A psychological mashup of naive and sinister,” is how she describes the show in its press release.
Unlike her previous work that focused on the a hyper realistic representation of a real object (prior series include crumpled Pantone color cards and lipstick covered cigarette butts), this show instead harnesses her penchant for realism for the abstract.
“For a long time I had been bored with realism, its painfully obvious and rigid, the viewer is given no room of interpretation.” So she went literal with the ambiguity, again finding a way to subvert the expected.
Hendry is a delightful mix of self-deprecation and self-confidence. She’s honest about her clear talent in draftsmanship, but it’s not her skill that she counts as her key to success.
“Talent is this much of it,” she said, as she held her fingers barely an inch apart. “People think of artists as pot smokers. But I’m like, 'No, motherfucker.’ That’s not how this works.” Hendry points to discipline, structure, and her natural intensity as how she’s built her successful practice. “That’s what I owe it all to. Talent a bit, but I think it’s more than that, to be honest.”
She subscribes to a version of Malcolm Gladwell’s 1993 theory that it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill. “You can manufacture talent if you practice something enough,” she said. “I’m really not that creative. I’m a great copier of a photo. There’s about two percent creativity in that bitch. The rest is just draftsmanship.”
“Just draftsmanship,” however, involves sometimes hundreds of hours for a single drawing. Her process, though not complicated, is time consuming. Once she settles on her subject matter, she’ll begin with taking some photographs to figure out framing and lighting. Then she’ll edit the image a bit. Next she’ll project that final image onto paper and quickly sketch a rough outline of the subject in order to ensure more accurate proportions. “It’ll take maybe two minutes for a small drawing,” Hendry said. And then she starts scribbling. And scribbling… And scribbling. It can take anywhere between a week and a month to finish a single drawing, depending on the size of the canvas.
“I don’t do studies. I don’t know about that shit,” Hendry said. “I just sit down and crank it out. It’s like, if the photo says do black, I’ll do black. If it says go light, I’ll go light. It’s hard to explain to people. But I just say, ‘Bro, the photograph is sitting right fucking there.’ I just copy what I see. It’s like reading. I just put down the color that the photo says.” It's a modern (and much more difficult) take on Paint By Numbers.
Her subject matter depends on what she’s “vibing at the time.” Where she was once drawn to luxury, she now is drawn more to the abstract. The inspiration for her first foray into using color two years ago came from perhaps the most obvious resource for modern inspiration. “I was trolling fucking Pinterest.” She pointed to seeing makeup photography on the site as the jumping off point for the series she did for Christian Louboutin. “They wipe liquid foundation in this swash, and I just thought, ‘OMG, that’s it.’ So that’s what I did, but using colorful oil paints” in place of the makeup.
“I’m not into luxury as much as I used to be because once you’ve got the money to buy the things, you don’t want them as much. I still have them, but my focus is on being a better boss, not on all the handbags.”
Being a boss is a complication to life as a successful working artist that Hendry, now a boss of a team of five, did not expect. “I never intended to come out and be a boss of a thing. I thought I would just draw! Sitting down and drawing on my own very much suits my personality. Just sitting down and cranking it out. Because I’m an introvert by nature. But now a lot of my time is just thinking about things that need to be done. I’m learning how to manage people.”
Despite her clear success in her field with a dedicated following and a bevy of collectors and collector-hopefuls eager to snag any of her work, the intensely focused Hendry still doesn’t feel comfortable saying that she’s “arrived.”
“I’ve never had that moment where I’m like, ‘I’ve made it as a working artist!’ I’m always fucking scrambling. Because there’s so much that I need to do. I’m at the very early stages. I never sit back. I’m always looking to do something a bit bigger.”
Cj Hendry’s new show, Rorschach , will run through Sunday, April 21 from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. at 202 Plymouth Street in Dumbo."
‘They Call Me Mayor Pete’: Buttigieg Launches 2020 Campaign,www.thedailybeast.com,Scott.Bixby@thedailybeast.com (Scott Bixby) gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),04-14-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/pete-buttigieg-officially-launches-his-2020-campaign-its-time-to-walk-away-from-the-politics-of-the-past,"04.14.19 3:57 PM ET Scott Olson/Getty
When he first announced his exploratory committee in January, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was the relatively little-known mayor of Indiana’s fourth-largest city, with a sterling résumé, an unpronounceable name, and, as a gay millennial in the most crowded primary field in history, the longest of long shots at the Democratic presidential nomination.
Now, Buttigieg’s name—pronounced BOOT-edge-edge—is everywhere. After exploding out of the gate with a CNN town hall appearance in which he derided fellow Hoosier and Vice President Mike Pence as “ cheerleader for the porn-star presidency ,” the candidate has expertly ridden a tsunami of press coverage, surging from barely registering in polls of early-voting states to third place in both Iowa and New Hampshire.
The accompanying flood of donor dollars, massive crowds, and the first hints of concern from the Trump administration that the vice president’s harshest critic wasn’t just a flash in the pan, have turned a former near-impossibility into a reality: Buttigieg is officially running for president.
On Sunday, in a kickoff event in South Bend winkingly teased by the campaign as a “ special announcement ,” Buttigieg launched his historic campaign for the White House, becoming the 19th Democrat to join the race, the youngest candidate in the field, and the first out gay person to seek the party’s nomination in history.
“My name is Pete Buttigieg. They call me Mayor Pete. I am a proud son of South Bend, Indiana. And I am running for president of the United States.” Buttigieg said to an assembled crowd of some 4,500 inside Studebaker Building 84, a former car assembly plant. An additional 1,500 plus were out in the rain, according to the campaign.
“I recognize the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor,” he said. “More than a little bold—at age 37—to seek the highest office in the land. Up until recently, this was not exactly what I had in mind either, for how to spend my eighth year as mayor and my thirty-eighth year in this world. But the moment we live in compels us to act.”
In the address, given in his trademark-to-the-point-of-parody rolled-up sleeves, Buttigieg recounted some of the impressive biography that precedes nearly every profile of the 37-year-old mayor: son of two Notre Dame professors, with a Harvard degree and a Rhodes scholarship to his name, who left the lucrative world of corporate consulting to run for mayor of his hometown, then left his hometown to serve his country in Afghanistan.
He also confronted the “Make America Great Again” promise that helped earn Donald Trump key victories in the Midwest which propelled him to the White House, arguing that the posturing was based on fantasy.
“There’s a long way for us to go,” he said of South Bend. “Life here is far from perfect. But we’ve changed our trajectory, and shown a path forward for communities like ours. And that’s why I’m here today. To tell a different story than “Make America Great Again.” Because there is a myth being sold to industrial and rural communities: the myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back.”
Although Buttigieg’s event was light on policy, he did mention issues that have begun to form the core of his stump speech: generational justice, fighting economic inequality, and bringing small-town solutions to some of America’s greatest problems.
He also spoke candidly about his marriage to his husband Chasten, saying: “Our marriage exists by the grace of a single vote on the U.S. Supreme Court. Nine men and women sat down in a room and took a vote and they brought me the most important freedom in my life.”
The intensity of the crowd indicated that the Buttigieg campaign’s decision to wait longer than any other Democrat to announce his campaign— well, almost —paid off.
“We set up the committee in January trying to find out the answers to questions that you can only answer by getting out there: how’s the fundraising going to look, how’s it going to land in the early states, how’re people gonna feel about it, what kind of team can we build, and all of the indicators that we’ve seen are pointing in the same direction,” Buttigieg told The Daily Beast at a Chelsea fundraiser in late March. “You only get to launch once, though, and so we want to make sure that we do it right.” READ THIS LIST"
"Trump Gets Revenge on the ‘Most Liberal Court,’ Helped by McConnell’s Dirty Tricks",www.thedailybeast.com,Jay Michaelson,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-gets-revenge-on-ninth-circuit-with-mcconnells-dirty-tricks,"opinion Bill Clark/Getty
Donald Trump hates the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and now he’s getting his revenge: with Mitch McConnell having trashed 100 years of Senate practice on judicial confirmations, Trump is now ramming through hyperpartisan nominees to shift the (supposedly) liberal court far to the right.
The Ninth Circuit has long been a target of conservative ire; Newt Gingrich called it “anti-American.” And while the data on its actual liberalism is mixed (a 2007 study found its rulings to be more liberal than average, but a 2014 study found it less liberal than the First and Third Circuits) it does have notable liberal jurists on it, such as Judge Stephen Reinhardt, who wrote an opinion striking down California’s ban on gay marriage, and Judge Alfred Goodwin, who wrote that the pledge of allegiance’s phrase “under God” (added in 1954) violates the First Amendment.
All that is about to change.
There are 29 judgeships on the court. When Trump took office, 18 were filled by the nominees of Democratic presidents, seven by Republicans’ and three seats were vacant. Four Trump nominees now sit on the bench , and three more nominees—Daniel Collins, Kenneth Lee, and Daniel Bress—are awaiting Senate votes. Assuming they are confirmed, the court will have 16 Democrat nominees and 12 Republican ones.
So far, there’s nothing unusual here; this is how the system works. Except, Trump and McConnell have broken the system in three ways to push through extreme candidates.
First, for over 100 years, the approval of both home-state senators—called “ blue slips ”—was required for a judicial nomination to proceed. Back in 2009, McConnell sent President Obama a formal letter , signed by 41 Republicans, alternately praising the “shared constitutional responsibility” of staffing the federal bench and warning that “if we are not consulted on, and approve of, a nominee from our states, the Republican Conference will be unable to support moving forward on that nominee.”
And indeed, with the assent of Senator Patrick Leahy, then the chair of the judiciary committee, Republican senators blocked 18 Obama nominees by refusing to submit blue slips.
To no one’s surprise, McConnell has reversed himself on that sacred principle now that he is majority leader and a Republican is in the White House: the blue-slip is history. The GOP chairmen of the judiciary committee have simply junked the century-old practice, at least as applied to appellate court. As a result, to take one example, Judge David Stras of Minnesota is now a judge with life tenure on the Eighth Circuit, despite then-Senator Al Franken refusing to submit a blue slip amid widespread condemnation from liberals.
Second, now that a formal requirement for bipartisanship has been eliminated, the Trump administration has abandoned any pretense of nominating mainstream individuals to these life-tenure positions.
Lee and Collins are good examples. Both were specifically opposed by Sens. Harris and Feinstein, who provided the White House with conservative candidates they would find acceptable. (The senators didn’t blue-slip him.)
Lee had concealed incendiary articles he’d written as a college student, among many examples: essays decrying “phony feminist statistics on rape, anorexia; and discriminatory treatment of girls;” calling multiculturalism a “malodorous sickness;” and claiming that “homosexual groups hurl epithets whenever one refused to swallow their hook, line and sinker. And charges of sexism often amount to nothing but irrelevant pouting.” Lee claims it’s mere coincidence that these extreme writings were omitted from his submission to the judiciary committee—a claim that, itself, casts doubt on his character.
Collins, meanwhile, was one of the leading architects of federal mass incarceration when he worked for Attorney General John Ashcroft, and has argued that the Miranda case (“you have the right to remain silent”) should be “jettisoned.”
Now, neither candidate has an obvious scandal marring their record, or even a recent controversial quote—Lee’s are from two decades ago. But both, especially Collins, tilt hard to the right, and avow ideologies that, until the last five years at least, have been well outside the judicial and legal mainstreams . They are exactly the kinds of nominees who would never make it through a process in which “advice and consent” still had its traditional meaning.
Finally, unsatisfied with stacking nomination hearings on top of each other , Republicans have advanced a proposal to slash floor debate on nominees from 30 hours to two. That’s right: a judge may sit on the federal bench for 50 years, but in a rubber-stamp Senate, they’ll only be debated for less than time than it takes to watch Star Wars .
Remarkably, Republicans have even proposed “going nuclear” to push this proposal through. Normally, changes to Senate rules require 60 votes to pass, but to ram this one through, they are considering changing that rule to require only a majority.
Democrats, of course, are outraged.
“We are unilaterally disarming the Senate Judiciary Committee in a way that will have collateral damage well beyond the immediate goal of packing the courts with these nominees in a great rush,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.
Yet ironically, these changes will almost certainly come back to haunt the GOP even more.
The Senate stayed Republican in 2018 largely because of luck: it just so happened that relatively few vulnerable Republican incumbents were up for reelection in that year. 2020 is different, and if the Democratic nominee for president has even moderately long coattails, it’s easy to envision the Senate flipping at the same time as the White House.
That will put Democrats in control of the turbo-charged confirmation racecar that Republicans have built.
None other than Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the judiciary committee, noted this concern at a recent event of the Federalist Society, the hard-right legal network which represents only 4 percent of American lawyers but 80 percent of Trump’s judicial picks.
“If you don’t have to reach across the aisle to get any votes, judges are going to be just more ideological than they would be otherwise,” Graham said, noting that he worries “a lot about what’s coming” should control of the senate switch hands.
Or as Senator Feinstein put it , “you know what comes up, comes down.”
Before that happens, though, Trump, or more precisely the Federalist Society’s Svengalis who are choosing these nominees, will have placed at least seven men [sic] on the Ninth Circuit, exacting sweet revenge on a court he believes has wronged him. And most of them will still be there long after Trump is gone. READ THIS LIST"
John Oliver Defends Julian Assange: Extradition ‘Worrying for a Number of Reasons’,www.thedailybeast.com,marlow.stern@thedailybeast.com (Marlow Stern),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-oliver-defends-wikileaks-julian-assange-extradition-worrying-for-a-number-of-reasons,"INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY John Oliver Defends Julian Assange: Extradition ‘Worrying for a Number of Reasons’ The late-night host reluctantly came to the defense of Assange over the DOJ’s attempts to extradite him to the U.S. 04.14.19 11:42 PM ET HBO
On Sunday night, John Oliver dedicated much of the opening to his post- Game of Thrones final season premiere episode to the expulsion and arrest of WikiLeaks’ founder Julian Assange.
Yes, the Last Week Tonight host tackled Assange’s expulsion from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he’s spent the last six-plus years, and subsequent arrest by British authorities, jokingly branding the hacker-turned-publisher “the most controversial Australian export since Vegemite.”
After running a montage of cable-news coverage of Assange being hauled out of the embassy, much of which focused on Assange’s bearded, disheveled appearance, he remarked, “That’s a weird tone to take on a story that’s this important. Yes, his arrest sparks a difficult debate about the efficacy of journalistic protections in the age of cyberespionage, but look how bad he looks!”
“But look,” Oliver continued, “this is a big deal.”
Oliver then went over some of the reasons Ecuadorian officials gave for booting Assange from their embassy, including causing damage by skateboarding through the halls, stealing WiFi, hosting soccer matches, and bad hygiene—including (allegedly) smearing feces on walls.
“It is easy to dislike Julian Assange,” offered Oliver. “He first fled to the embassy to escape extradition to Sweden on rape charges—charges he denied. Alongside the valuable information that WikiLeaks has helped release, they’ve also recklessly published the sensitive personal data of hundreds of ordinary people, potentially putting lives at risk. And that’s not even getting into the fact that WikiLeaks’ publication of hacked emails in 2016 helped elect Trump president.”
He added: “You are allowed not to like him, but America’s current attempts to extradite him hang on a specific charge that many press advocates find unsettling.”
The U.S. Department of Justice is trying to extradite Assange on charges of conspiracy for allegedly helping Chelsea Manning crack a password in order to gain access to the Pentagon’s computer network. “The charge relates to Assange’s alleged role in one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States,” the DOJ said in a press release .
This worries Oliver. “On its face, it currently seems more than a little flimsy—prompting the Committee to Protect Journalists to call it ‘troubling for press freedom,’ because the indictment’s language seems to criminalize a broad range of legally protected and common journalistic activity,” the HBO host explained.
“And while it is still early at this point, and we don’t know what else Assange might be charged with—or even if the U.K. might extradite him at all—this story is worrying for a number of reasons,” he argued. “One, because journalistic freedoms may be under threat; and two, unfortunately, in order to protect them, we may be forced to utter the one phrase in the English language scarier than ‘Halloween Brexit,’ and that’s: ‘I’m really sorry, everyone, but it might actually be time to defend Julian Assange.’”"
Rep. Ilhan Omar Says Trump 9/11 Video Sparked New Death Threats,www.thedailybeast.com,Tracy.Connor@thedailybeast.com (Tracy Connor),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/rep-ilhan-omar-says-trump-911-video-sparked-new-death-threats,"Rep. Ilhan Omar Says Trump 9/11 Video Sparked New Death Threats ‘This is endangering lives. It has to stop,’ she said. 04.14.19 11:21 PM ET Brendan Smialowski/Getty
Rep. Ilhan Omar says she has received threats on her life referencing the video President Trump posted of 9/11 scenes intercut with footage of the congresswoman’s remarks about the terrorist attacks.
“Violent crimes and other acts of hate by right-wing extremists and white nationalists are on the rise in this country and around the world,” the Minnesota Democrat said in a statement Sunday night.
“We can no longer ignore that they are being encouraged by the occupant of the highest office in our land.”
In a recent speech on Islamophobia, Omar said the Council on American-Islamic Relations had been founded after Sept. 11, 2001, “because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.”
Her critics seized on the phrase “some people did something,” and Trump on Friday tweeted a video that used that line over and over, along with scenes of planes hitting the Twin Towers and the Pentagon on fire.
The video drew swift condemnation from Democrats, who said it could incite attacks on Omar, the first member of Congress to wear a hijab. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted that Trump should not be using 9/11 footage for a political attack.
“It is wrong for the president, as commander-in-chief, to fan the flames to make anyone less safe,” Pelosi added.
Pelosi called for Trump to take down the tweet. But White House press secretary Sarah Sanders praised her boss for the post.
“That was one of the most horrific moments in American history, and for her to talk about it in such a dismissive way is frankly disgusting and abhorrent,” she said of Omar on Fox News Sunday . “And I’m glad the president is calling her out and holding her accountable for it.”
In Omar’s statement, she thanked the FBI, the House sergeant at arms, and the Capitol Police for responding to the “direct threats on my life—many directly referencing or replying to the President’s video.”
“We are all Americans. This is endangering lives. It has to stop,” she wrote."
Inside Veep’s Outrageously Dark Abortion Scene,www.thedailybeast.com,kevin.fallon@thedailybeast.com (Kevin Fallon),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-hbo-veeps-outrageously-dark-abortion-scene,"WHOA Inside Veep’s Outrageously Dark Abortion Scene Anna Chlumsky and Reid Scott break down Amy and Dan’s trip to an Iowa abortion clinic, featuring some of the most obscenely dark dialogue ‘Veep’ has had yet. 04.14.19 11:00 PM ET HBO
When we talked to the cast and showrunner of Veep last month, they all preached one resounding sentiment about the HBO comedy’s final season: It was going to go down like Veep . That’s to say, in the words of showrunner David Mandel , “fucking funny,” and, as star Julia Louis-Dreyfus warned, “crazy dark.”
“Full Game of Thrones ,” joked Tony Hale , who plays Gary Walsh. “There’s a Red Wedding.” It’s a fitting comparison, given the fact that Veep shares billing with the much anticipated premiere of the final season of Game of Thrones Sunday night. And it wasn’t about to cede all the shocking twistedness to the Lannister clan.
The comedy’s third episode, “Pledge,” contains some of the most outrageous jokes about abortion that have ever aired in a TV comedy, the kind of writing that only Veep could get away with—and yet another sign that the show is determined to crack its lacerating whip at everything on its way out the door.
In the episode, Amy ( Anna Chlumsky ) decides to abort the baby she conceived during a one-night stand with Dan (Reid Scott). If you thought Dan’s offer to “go Dutch” on the abortion—”just hit me up on Venmo!”—was ribald, you’re not prepared for the dialogue when they make the trip to actually have the procedure.
“It’s heartwarming,” jokes Scott. “We were going to make it a Christmas special.”
The saga begins with Dan waking up after having a one-night stand with Amy’s sister, who was supposed to be taking her to the appointment. Because her sister is still passed out in Dan’s bed, she asks him to accompany her.
They arrive, perhaps unsurprisingly for the world of Veep , to a crowd of pro-life protesters, heckling them with signs as they try to break through and enter the clinic. One of them tells Amy to “think of the children,” and that’s the last straw.
“You want me to think about the children, you hog-fingering fucks?” she says. “I did think about this. I considered it and I cried and, yeah, suck my cock I even prayed a little. And here I am. So you can back the fuck off, you hypocritical cunts, before I show up to the piss-puddle that is your house and protest your husband wacking it to your daughter’s seventh grade yearbook.”
Suffice it to say, it’s language that has not been used before in a sitcom to talk about abortion.
Chlumsky worked hard writing and refining the speech with Mandel and writer Rachel Axler. “You want to say everything and you want to really get to the heart of stuff, but at the same time you don’t want this to be the writers saying something,” she says. “[It] just scratches the surface of what possibly—I don’t want to speak for every single woman—most women in that predicament feel.”
After venting everything they could imagine someone in Amy’s position—a fully informed (on both sides), independent career woman whose job is to politicize this very issue—saying, they edited it all down to an uproarious outburst that, Chlumsky says, “just scratches the surface of what possibly—I don’t want to speak for every single woman—most women in that predicament feel.”
She loved that, even while going through something so personal and possibly destabilizing, Amy was all business. And that perfect button on the speech, in which Amy points out to one protester that their sign is misspelled before breezing into the clinic in triumph, was actually supposed to play out differently.
It was written as Scott’s line as Dan, but then everyone on set agreed it played better from her. Instead, Dan leaves the crowd with the parting words: “Selina Now.”
Later, the duo is in the clinic getting ready for the procedure and Dan marvels over the quality of the “vadge vac” that will be used on Amy.
“When we were shooting that scene, David Mandel came to me and was like, ‘I just want to take you off the leash. Go nuts,” Scott says. “It’s so over the top, but it’s so just id for Dan that it felt right. You can’t really get mad at it, because we’ve already established he’s a horrible piece of shit. We’re tripling down on that. I don’t think it’s offensive because it’s being spewed out of the mouth of someone who is already offensive. I love that Veep has always had the bravery to run at topics in that way.”
As Louis-Dreyfus was quick to point out when I brought the episode up with her, this isn’t the first time the show has tackled the abortion issue. In the season three episode “The Choice,” Selina is forced to reevaluate and construct her political stance on abortion amid evolving cultural attitudes. Unsurprisingly, she and her team don’t arrive at it delicately.
“It’s one thing for the politician in the show, how do they broach the subject,” Scott says. “And then what is organic to the show is what are they doing behind the scenes when the cameras and the public aren’t there for a consideration.”
Still, the show has had to build up—and build the trust of its audience—to this point. As Matt Walsh, who plays Mike McClintock, says, “We couldn’t come out in season two with Dan there at that machine.” Scott starts laughing, before summarizing, in a way, how the entire series has gone on: “We had to pitch Dan to that... depth.”"

CrossFit co-founder Lauren Jenai plans to wed accused murderer Franklin Tyrone Tucker while he sits in a Florida jail, and she’s not making him sign a prenup, Page Six reports. Jenai—the ex-wife and former business partner of CrossFit co-founder and CEO Greg Glassman—reconnected with her former high school classmate on Facebook. But Tucker and two others were arrested in December 2017 on first-degree murder charges for allegedly stabbing a man to death in the Florida Keys . Tucker maintains his innocence. Jenai, who reportedly sold her CrossFit shares for up to $20 million as part of her 2013 divorce from Glassman, said she’s been fighting for Tucker’s freedom ever since.“We hadn’t seen each other in 30 years,” she said. “We started having feelings for each other... We’re going to get married.” She said they planned to tie the knot when he got out on bond, but his bail was denied in January. She now says they’ll say “I do” at the detention center where he’s been locked up since his arrest. “We would be allowed to have a wedding in jail,” she added. “[We] would get to be together for the first time in the same room” since they began seeing each other. She also said she won’t make Tucker sign a prenup. “Our relationship is very open and we are a team,” she said. “I trust him. I love him. My house is his house. A prenup feels a little inappropriate.” Jenai has been barred from video visitation with Tucker for 100 years, after an incident in February. “I got a little risqué,” she said. “I was touching my boobs.” CrossFit Co-Founder Says She’s Marrying an Accused Murderer Cheat Sheet ® "

A deranged man threatened to blow up the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a series of emails sent to British government officials and to the office of Prince Andrew.
Mohammad Jibra-Eel Saleh was tracked down and detained by cops almost immediately, after using a gmail account to send the messages from a local McDonald’s.
Despite suspected mental health problems, Saleh is now facing the possibility of jail time after being found guilty of malicious communications with his posts to Andrew in which he appeared to threaten bombing the royal wedding at Windsor Castle in May last year, saying the event would be ‘a blast’, according to a report in The Daily Telegraph .
Saleh, claiming to be the “Muslim Prince of Spain,” sent the emails to the Queen’s son as well as officials at the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Defence, Leicester Crown Court heard.
In one message the 37-year-old said: “You fucking stupid British royal family. I am the Muslim Prince of Spain married to the illegitimate daughter of the former King of Spain, Juan Carlos’s daughter called Marguerita.
“All you British royal family are going to die for having me arrested and tortured in prison in Netherlands. We’re at war, bitch. Your grandson’s wedding is going to be a blast.”
Despite the rambling tone of the emails, police were so concerned by the threats that they tracked Saleh down and arrested him two days before the May 19 wedding.
Saleh sent three threatening emails of similar content using two different mobile phones to the Duke of York, the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Defence and all purporting to be from the Muslim Prince of Spain, The Telegraph reports.

Lake Bell on Creating a TV Show Skewering Coastal Elitism,www.thedailybeast.com,Joseph.Longo@thedailybeast.com (Joseph Longo),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bless-this-mess-lake-bell-on-creating-a-tv-show-that-skewers-coastal-elitism,"Ed Herrera
Lake Bell did it. She got “Pam—motherfucking—Grier.”
About a year ago, the actress was shopping around her upcoming TV show Bless This Mess , a fish-out-of-water comedy about New York newlyweds who leave behind kombucha and ashwagandha hot teas for actual wellness as Nebraskan farmers. As co-creator, Bell knew she needed the legendary actress Pam Grier on board.
Over her 50 years in the industry, Grier, 69, often retreats from Hollywood to a farm in rural Colorado . No one knows the inner workings of both Hollywood and hay barrels like Grier. But she was skeptical when her agent Harry Gold called, saying Bell and her co-creator Liz Meriwether ( of New Girl fame) wanted her for their new series. They didn’t have a script, and Grier doesn’t do projects without one—especially if it’s about her beloved community of farmers.
“I don’t know if they will reach the level of truth, beauty and purity that I know from where I live and the people I know from the heartland,” Grier told The Daily Beast about her early reservations. “People go to the heartland to find their heart.”
Bell grew up in Manhattan and now lives in Los Angeles. She thinks of herself as street smart, but “maybe that won’t help in the apocalypse.” Still, she was determined to tell a story about savvy farmers. So when Grier walked into their meeting with her signature leather gloves tucked into her back pocket, Bell cast her strongest bait. Meriwether had a proven success in creating New Girl and grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Grier timidly bit. The overwhelming majority of the Bless This Mess writers’ room hailed from heartland states Ohio, Illinois, and Wisconsin. That reeled Grier a bit farther in. And, finally, Bell noted her already proven chops in the independent film world—a soft spot for Grier. She had her hooked.
“Liz and Lake are two juju women, and I’ve been spied on by these witches,” Grier said with a laugh. She praised the duo for successfully depicting every anecdote she had about farm life, from how to work with cows (don’t be afraid) to what Nebraskan farmers would actually plant (alfalfa). “I could see pieces of it in each episode,” Grier said.
She’s played iconic characters like Coffy and Jackie Brown and dated the likes of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Freddie Prinze and Richard Pryor, but few roles in Grier’s life have quite compared to her character in Bless This Mess : a black woman living in a small town farm community— the original yeehaw queen . “I’m an adventurist,” Grier said. “This is one of the greatest adventures in my lifetime.”
Bless This Mess , which premieres Tuesday on ABC, boasts quite the cast. Bell as Rio spars perfectly alongside Dax Shepard as Mike, her sweet yet bumbling husband. Mary Lynn Rajskub ( 24 ), Madison Curry (who recently played the younger version of Lupita Nyong’o’s character in Us ) and Ed Begley Jr. (also putting in work on Hulu’s Future Man ) round out the supporting players.
Everyone douses their humor in earnestness, from Bell and Shepard skewering their coastal elitism to Grier and Begley courting ranchers. “There’s always sort of fiery rhetoric between blue states and red states,” Bell said. “This is a show by no means can heal everything, but certainly it is very keen to illuminate what’s great about a small town community and what we might lack in the city sometimes.” “People go to the heartland to find their heart.” — Pam Grier
If Bless This Mess succeeds, it’ll be because of Bell. The actress is best known to mainstream audiences for her sidekick work in films like What Happens In Vegas— she saves the entire film— No Strings Attached and It’s Complicated . But she’s kicked down doors and reinvented herself, too. As studio rom-coms faded in the early 2010s, she swapped out the sassy best friend roles for starring roles in indie films like Black Rock and Man Up .
Her biggest success came when she did the damn thing herself. In 2013, Bell wrote, directed and starred in In a World , an under-seen indie comedy about a vocal coach determined to become the first woman to utter the phrase “in a world” in the male-dominated voiceover industry. Time’s Up would sweep Hollywood four years later in part to acknowledge the work of women behind the screen. By then, Bell was already breaking norms.
In the first year that the Sundance Film Festival saw women make up half of the dramatic films entries, Bell’s In A World premiered. At the time, then-director of programming Trevor Goth told USA Today that Bell is “just one of those really exciting discoveries of this triple-threat talent.” In A World went on to win Best Original Screenplay.
Like her close friends Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Gwyneth Paltrow, Bell’s interests also go beyond the movie business. Her husband Scott Campbell (They met on the criminally underrated HBO series How To Make It in America ) co-owns the high-end cannabis label Beboe . Bell has fronted the company’s PR campaign, from a Paper magazine cover story to moderating a cannabis panel at Paltrow’s Summer 2018 Goop Summit .
While Paltrow and Diaz retreated from the entertainment industry, Bell doubled down. She parlayed her success with In a World to a seat on non-profit Women in Film ’s board of directors. For the past five years, she’s mentored aspiring female directors and spoken out in support of gender parity. “She stands behind her commitment to gender equity in her own work, giving opportunities to women whenever possible,” Kirsten Schaffer, executive director of Women in Film, said in a statement.
Before Bless This Mess , Bell had never spearheaded a long-term project before, especially one where she’d have to answer to a studio. It proved difficult at first to write, direct, produce and star in the series. It’s partly why Bell only directed the pilot. And for the first time, she came up against “the list.”
Given the high-wire act of creating a network TV show, studios often offer a list of go-to hires from to cinematographers to writers. The problem is these lists are often dominated by men, so Bell issued her own unofficial version of an inclusion rider , meeting three women qualified for every position on the list. “Oh God, we’re gonna have to schedule three more meetings,” she says sarcastically, mimicking anyone who might be annoyed at the extra effort. “Oh well, that’s what we’re gonna do.”
“It is not the kind of thing where lives are on the line,” she said. “The thing that is on the line is our responsibility to inform, help influence and nurture genuine gender parity from the inside out. We’re just chipping away.”
It’s people like Bell that inspire Pam Grier to say that she has seen a change in the treatment of women—not just in Hollywood but throughout all industries.
“You hold a rod, you cast and you catch a fish, but there shouldn’t be any gender issues,” Grier says. “It’s about the intellectual capacity to be successful, and Lake has it.” READ THIS LIST"
‘Oklahoma!’ on Broadway: Creator and Cast Reveal How to Reimagine a Classic,www.thedailybeast.com,tim.teeman@thedailybeast.com (Tim Teeman),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/oklahoma-on-broadway-creator-and-cast-reveal-how-to-reimagine-a-classic,"MADE ANEW ‘Oklahoma!’ on Broadway: Creator and Cast Reveal How to Reimagine a Classic Director Daniel Fish and cast members Rebecca Naomi Jones, Patrick Vaill, and Mary Testa reveal how ‘Oklahoma!’ on Broadway comes with a dark meditation on violence and justice. 04.15.19 4:30 AM ET Little Fang
The actor Mary Testa is always surprised to look up at the end of Oklahoma! and see the audience at Broadway's Circle in the Square (booking to Sept. 1) enthusiastically clapping along with the reprise of that musical’s title song.
At this point of Daniel Fish’s reimagined Oklahoma! in which Testa plays an exceedingly spiky Aunt Eller, the show’s antagonist Jud Fry (Patrick Vaill) has died, but it is the manner of his death and what it says about this community that makes cheery clapping really not the audience reaction you would expect.
If you have come for them, Rodgers and Hammerstein ’s songs are intact and beautifully played and sung in this Oklahoma! But Fish’s critically acclaimed production is entirely not in keeping with tradition.
Jud is not a simple villain and more a repository of loneliness and disconnection, a shocking dream ballet halfway through highlights themes around race and gender, and the audience sits in the round, an uneasily complicit character in and of itself. If you’re sitting in the front row, a pair of actors’ boots may just thud down right next to you.
There is a lot of carousing, fun, and dancing amid the darker material: Ado Annie’s (the fabulous Ali Stroker) love triangle with Will Parker (James Davis) and Ali Hakim (Will Brill) includes Stroker’s hilarious showstopper, ‘I Cain't Say No.’
And there’s chili and cornbread at intermission.
Fish told The Daily Beast that he hoped the production had deepened since being mounted at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn last year . “People say I’ve subverted Oklahoma! I never set out with that intention. I prefer to see it, as I do with any play, as being in conversation with the script, with what is already there. When I read it in 2007, when I first directed it [as a student production at Bard College], I saw that there’s a violence there, a story about an outsider, and the role of the outsider that the community can create.”
Fish read the last scene, and the quick dispensation of justice (“he can’t go to jail, it’s his wedding night, let’s have a quick trial and deliver our own justice”) and realized there was another Oklahoma! there beneath the received text. “I’m wary of saying anything, because I’m always surprised by what people say that the show means to them.”
However, Fish is resistant to saying what, for him, the larger messages of this are. “I want the audience to supply those answers. I’m wary of saying anything, because I’m always surprised by what people say that the show means to them.”
The only conversations that Fish had with the Rodgers and Hammerstein estate were around the dream ballet and the contentious ending. He won’t go into detail as to what those conversations were, but the outcome was agreeable to all, “without me thinking I had made a compromise.”
Fish grew up in the New York suburbs, his parents taking him to see all kinds of theater from a young age including productions by Peter Brook and the Royal Shakespeare Company . There was a “moment” when he thought he might become a sculptor, but a career in theater directing was always his ambition.
“I couldn’t have been an actor,” Fish said laughing. “I couldn’t bear myself night after night in front of a group of strangers. I’m in awe of this company who do it for our show.”
He thinks the first production he helmed was an Our Town at college, then a Sam Shepard play; his first professional production was The Misanthrope . Next year in New York City, he will mount a production of Michael Gordon’s opera, Acquanetta , and an adaptation of Don DeLillo’s White Noise , last seen in Germany.
Of his actors, Fish said he demands a lot of “courage,” which is immediately obvious watching Oklahoma! feeling as clenched as Fish intends in its tensest moments. Even when they’re not involved in the scene, the other actors stay on stage. With all the lights on in the theatre (for much of the show), we watch each other watching them watching each other. For Fish, the technique means we feel “alone and together,” a heightened version of what it is to be an audience.
Jud isn’t the simple villain, Fish said. The production highlights the community’s brutality and self-interest as much, if not more, than his menace which really seems to be a filter for painful isolation.
Vaill, who plays Jud, has been with the production since it was first produced at Bard in 2007. “In Jud’s song, ‘Lonely Room,’ I imagine him being wanted to be loved, touched, and accepted. The root of his loneliness is anguish at being unloved. He does morally questionable things, but at the root of it all he wants to be accepted and seen.”
Fish has made every member of the ensemble integral, said Vaill, and the show itself “feels like less musical, and more one long epic poem. Knowing that someone is going to die imbues every performance with, for us all, stakes and a vitality. He hopes audiences see that the reimagining “is done with utmost respect. Oklahoma! on Broadway is an institution, and to be part of that legacy is an incredible privilege and not lost on me.”
Testa told The Daily Beast that she was “trying to get to the truth” of her character, to create a backstory that makes sense of every verbal and non-verbal response Aunt Eller has. “In real life I am quite no-nonsense, so that helps with her,” Testa said laughing. Aunt Eller is the town’s moral (perhaps amoral or immoral) fulcrum, and maternal presence. Testa has never seen any version of Oklahoma! , including the famous 1955 movie starring Gordon MacRae, Shirley Jones, and Rod Steiger, which has been “freeing.” “This musical shows how we, how America, treats the outsider. It is warning about that. I really don’t hold out much hope for human beings. We don’t seem to be doing a great job of evolving.”
How is she different to Eller? “Well she’s racist, and I am most definitely not,” Testa said, laughing. “She’s stuck in a way of doing and seeing things, and I am not.”
It was strange, Testa said, “to see people clapping along just after someone gets shot point blank. Others look horrified. It’s a real mixed bag. It’s almost as if they don’t want to see what is happening in front of them—for me, a bit like what is going on in this country right now; the racism, separatism, and prejudice. This musical shows how we, how America, treats the outsider. It is warning about that. I really don’t hold out much hope for human beings. We don’t seem to be doing a great job of evolving.” “I wasn’t used back then to the Daniel Fish ‘je ne sais quoi.’ It’s very specific but not defined by words. He knows what he wants but sometimes can’t articulate it, so you work together to whittle it down to the juice of what you’re trying to get at.”
Rebecca Naomi Jones, who plays Laurey, told The Daily Beast that performing the show was “exacting and exhausting, and satisfying. Most of us have never had to have the kind of focus that this show demands. It was an intense, confusing audition. I wasn’t used back then to the Daniel Fish je ne sais quoi . It’s very specific but not defined by words. He knows what he wants but sometimes can’t articulate it, so you work together to whittle it down to the juice of what you’re trying to get at.”
Laurey has agency, and while her and Curly’s love story is a major part of the show still, there is an air of independence and impatience Jones’ Laurey has, a resolute refusal to be thought of anybody's possession. “As an actress of color, I’m not pretending not to be in any other skin than the one that I am in,” said Jones, which adds layers to other scenes, such as when the men bid for the women’s lunch boxes—and, by extension, to spend time with the women themselves.
Jones loves the scenes when the stage is suddenly bathed in green when Laurey and Curly share their first intimate scene, and ‘The Farmer and The Cowman’ dance sequence, which acts a great tension reliever at the start of act two.
She has heard “so many” different responses to the show: “intense,” “interesting,” “a reinvestigation of what has always been there,” and, when it comes to Jud, “a really important look at mental health.”
Jones added, “Another friend was struck by how quickly the community rallies behind the person whose life they judge as more valuable than another.”
The musical doesn’t simply have Curly as a good guy (as evidenced in his charged scene with Jud), and for Jones Jud and Laurey share a connection beyind him simply being a creepy stalker. At these key moments, Fish shrouds the stage in darkness.
With the audience in well-lit view for much of the performance, the room can feel like a community center, albeit with groups of menacing, and revealing, guns on the walls.
“The audience feels like members of the community,” said Jones. “The lights can make some people sit up and pay more attention. Some people are uncomfortable. Some get up for random stretching. Others check their phones. I really don’t understand the people who look at their programs. I mean fine, but why don’t you just watch and look at those later?”
Something that unites all the actors is the costuming; while Jud is garbed mostly in moody hoodie and jeans, the others are in plaid shirts, jeans, and (extremely sexy, for the men) chaps. Said Jones, “The second you put the boots on, you think, ‘Oh, this is happening.’”"
Kill-Joy Principal’s Promposal Ban Crosses a Legal Line,www.thedailybeast.com,David C. Bloomfield,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kill-joy-principals-promposal-ban-crosses-a-legal-line,"opinion Stockbyte/Getty
Promposals aren't yet in the Oxford English Dictionary yet, but that hasn't stopped teenagers in love from prom-inently posting these romantic overtures by the hundreds of thousands on social media and classmates' cellphones.
But these ""Bachelor”-like playlets are tying school officials in knots. The extravagant skits are prom-pted by a school-sponsored event yet evade disciplinary rules, especially when held off-campus. Parents complain about expense and the hurt feelings of those left out but what’s a harried principal to do when kids just wanna have fun?
Recent action by one New York City principal, as reported by Susan Edelman in the New York Post , shows the limits of school officials' power to contain Prom-eos’ and Juliets’ high spirits. Queens Gateway for the Health Sciences Principal Judy Henry ordered that ""there is [sic] absolutely no promposals to be conducted anywhere in the school or even around the school and that includes anywhere on your way to school or on your way home from school."" The city Department of Education backed her up, because ""some students felt uncomfortable and left out.""
The Supreme Court has famously stated that students don't ""shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate."" The same goes for freedom of association, another important personal right schools should model rather than scorn.
While schools can bar activity that substantially disrupts or threatens their mission, the long arm of the principal doesn't extend to off-campus behavior unless it has the same effect. Henry's removal of one promposal participant from her Student Council vice-presidency thus went too far—and was ultimately withdrawn—as did threats of other disciplinary action that could hurt chances for future opportunities like college acceptances, an important liberty interest worthy of constitutional protection according to the court.
The better course would be for Henry and school officials across the country to ask, don't tell.
When fund-raising ""I ♥ Boobies"" bracelets for breast cancer awareness were worn by pubescent boys for other than scientific reasons, leading to school bans, the prohibitions were struck down since, like off-campus promposals, the speech was protected and insufficiently disruptive. On the other hand, a recurring middle school fad—wearing color-coded jelly bracelets that supposedly indicated what sexual activities the wearer would engage in—was met in 2009 with a request from a Colorado principal for parents not to allow their children to wear them to school. The request was widely interpreted as a ban, but fell within legal bounds.
Hurt feelings are similar. We would like to live in a world where there are no popularity contests. Middle and high schools are cauldrons of social anxiety, often tied to sex. But trying to control one stressor—promposals—out of infinite opportunities for offense distracts from the real solution: better social and emotional education.
Promposals are cute. Viewing them generally brings sympathetic tears, not anger. Principals should take a moment to celebrate their students' exuberance instead of clamping down on self-expression. Handled appropriately, they are an opportunities to teach legal and social boundaries rather than to restrict behavior that is developmentally appropriate, even when institutionally problematic. Teaching kids to consider peers' feelings and parents' pocketbooks are important life lessons, better addressed with an outstretched hand than a smack down. READ THIS LIST"

"Cory Booker Hasn’t Taken Off Yet, but His Campaign Doesn’t Mind",www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/cory-booker-hasnt-taken-off-yet-but-his-2020-presidential-campaign-doesnt-mind,"IN DUE TIME Cory Booker Hasn’t Taken Off Yet, but His Campaign Doesn’t Mind In an unpredictable Democratic primary, Team Booker is playing the long game and hoping it pays off. 04.15.19 4:29 AM ET Bloomberg/Getty
NEWARK, New Jersey—His position in the polls is solidly middle of the pack. His fundraising is fine but not impressive. He hasn’t had a singular breakout viral moment despite his early use of and comfort with social media.
But Sen. Cory Booker’s (D-NJ) campaign and allies don’t view his first 72 days as a candidate for president of the United States as a disappointment. They’ve been happy to quietly toil and work on the less flashy parts of building a lasting campaign, even if its beneficiary is a man known for seeking and being in the spotlight .
They are betting that it’s too early for much of this to matter and that Booker’s workmanlike, focused approach in intimate town halls, his early state campaign infrastructure, and a retooled national tour will provide some momentum and will keep him competitive for a very long primary.
As Addisu Demissie, Booker’s campaign manager, put it on a strategy call with reporters last Thursday: “We’re not building this campaign to win a poll in April of 2019. We’re trying to win a primary in February of 2020.”
But the slow grind of winning local endorsements and building out staff is not the kind of story that pulls the center of the media’s gravity toward a candidate. And when Booker entered the race on Feb. 1 with the promise of an uplifting, unifying campaign, he was one of six who had formally entered or formed an exploratory committee. By Saturday, when the New Jersey Democrat launched his new “Justice for All Tour” on an unseasonably warm afternoon in Newark’s Military Park, across from a Whole Foods that he helped bring to the city as mayor, that number had ballooned to 19.
Introduced by a who’s who of important New Jersey Democrats including his fellow Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), the current Newark mayor and former critic of Booker, Ras Baraka, and Gov. Phil Murphy, Booker delivered an urgent message about social and economic justice that reflected themes in Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “Letter from Birmingham Jail.”
“We can’t wait when powerful forces are turning their prejudice into policy and rolling back the rights that generations of Americans fought for and heroes died for,” Booker said, on the same day that Dr. King began writing the famous letter in 1963. “We can’t wait when this administration is throwing children fleeing violence into cages, banning Muslims from entering the nation founded on religious liberty, and preventing brave transgender Americans from serving the country they love. And we can’t wait because many of our most serious challenges as a nation were with us long before Donald Trump entered the White House.”
The event, meant to have the feel of a block party complete with bubbles, face-painting, a marching band, and food trucks, steadily saw its start time creep back as a sparse crowd left patches of drying grass noticeably visible before the senator took the stage.
By the time Booker ended his remarks with Chance the Rapper’s “No Problem” blasting from the speakers, and spent nearly as much if not more time on a selfie line dabbing the beading sweat from his head as he greeted supporters, a campaign aide said over 4,100 people had turned out, citing the head of security for the event.
Booker will now head back to Iowa, then visit Georgia, California, Texas, Florida, and Wisconsin for the first time on this tour, where he is expected to hold more conversational events about signature policies like his “baby bonds” proposal , which would provide a savings account for American children in an effort to close the massive racial wealth gap.
It’s in these settings that his supporters think Booker thrives the best, particularly in early voting states like New Hampshire, where residents often decide late and want to see candidates face-to-face. In short, they think that not only can voters wait but that they will.
“The voters here, and I think in other places too, are not ready to make any final decisions,” Jim Demers , the New Hampshire co-chair of Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, told The Daily Beast. “When I hear somebody say, ‘I’ve kind of winnowed this down to three or four people’ and everyone I talk to has Cory Booker in their three or four, that makes me feel comfortable because I think that’s kind of where the voters’ minds are right now.”
Demers, an early Booker supporter, cited the fact that he earned the support of New Hampshire state Sen. Jon Morgan , who backed the New Jersey Democrat after meeting with numerous other 2020 candidates. Booker and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have the most built-out operations in the Granite State, Demers said, and Booker is among the most frequent visitors . He contributed more money to the New Hampshire Democratic Party during the 2018 cycle than any other 2020 candidate, and the state party chairman, Ray Buckley, referred to him as a “best friend” to the state’s Democrats.
In South Carolina, another crucial early voting state where Booker has also spent a ton of his time and resources, he earned the first 2020 endorsement from a state lawmaker.
It’s the same story in Iowa, where Booker similarly hasn’t reached the upper echelon of polling but secured the first endorsement of the cycle from an Iowa state lawmaker . He has 16 staffers in the state and is going to add more than two dozen more in the next few weeks.
“I know the team that he’s put together and they are very organizationally focused, and so I would imagine they are as well organized as any other campaign on the ground right now,” Jeff Link, an Iowa-based Democratic strategist, told The Daily Beast.
Link said that since Booker wowed an Iowa crowd at last year’s Fall Gala event, he’s mostly had to work on the “nuts and bolts” of the campaign, as everyone who entered early has had to in the last few months. But Link is waiting on this year’s gala to get more of a sense of how everyone will stack up and carry momentum through the last few months of the year.
“In 2008, that was really when you could kind of feel that Obama was really in a position to beat Hillary Clinton,” Link said of the caucus that launched him to the Democratic nomination. “It was at that night.”
The other reason Booker might not be catching on yet nationally at the moment is media fixation on some of the newer faces in the race. Right now, media coverage is influencing polling and vice versa, experts argued, creating a feedback loop that is not necessarily predictive of future outcomes by the start of 2019.
“The problem with the polling and the media coverage is that they drive each other and then impact the fundraising ability,” Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, told The Daily Beast. “Because money is going to go towards the candidates that people think are going to do well.”
How voters determine viability in the most crowded primary in history is the main unanswered question in these early months, before candidates have gotten to face off in the first of a dozen debates this summer and before more voters start to really tune in. Even some in attendance at Booker’s Newark launch were asking themselves the same thing.
“I’m still thinking through a lot of options,” Kitty Hunter-Little, 58, from Union Township in New Jersey, told The Daily Beast. “I like Kamala Harris. I like Beto [O’Rourke]. A lot of them I’m not even aware of. They’re just jumping in there.”
A Clinton supporter in 2016, Hunter-Little said she’s quite concerned about health care and is on two types of medication, and is worried about how “ugly” the race against President Trump will turn.
As for Booker, he’s occupying a spot he hopes to be in with more voters across the country in the coming months: on the radar.
“I think he’s high on my list of people,” she said."
U.S. Nuclear Firms’ New Plan to Cash In on Saudi Deal,www.thedailybeast.com,Erin.Banco@thedailybeast.com (Erin Banco),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/us-nuclear-firms-new-plan-to-cash-in-on-saudi-deal,"GLOW U.S. Nuclear Firms’ New Plan to Cash In on Saudi Deal American companies have to deal with all kinds of cumbersome regulations if they want to sell nuclear gear to the Saudis. So they’re eyeing a new partner to help out.
In the race to supply nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia , U.S. companies are playing catch-up.
Executives in the industry and American officials told The Daily Beast that despite the Trump administration pushing for a deal with Riyadh , the U.S. nuclear energy sector is behind its competitors, notably Russia and China, when it comes to developing and exporting technology for major international projects.
To get ahead, U.S. companies are mulling over whether to turn a consortium of companies—which some have dubbed “Team USA”—into one that includes foreigners, namely state-run energy firms from South Korea, in an attempt to strengthen its bid in Saudi Arabia.
If the plan comes to fruition, experts say it could offer U.S. companies a greater chance of securing contracts in Saudi Arabia and beating out Russia and China—one of the administration's main economic goals. But the possibility of such a deal has raised concerns among officials in the Trump administration that it may also limit the U.S. government’s ability to ensure Saudi Arabia adheres to certain nuclear safeguards.
The Trump administration, whose officials have publicly said they are pushing Saudi Arabia to commit to the highest standards of inspection and verification—also known as the “gold standard”—have raised the question of whether the partnership with South Korea might help American companies clinch a deal without the U.S. signing a formal cooperation deal with Saudi known as a “123 Agreement.”
The U.S. Atomic Energy Act requires the U.S. sign the 123 Agreement with countries it plans to cooperate with on nuclear energy and sets forth conditions and controls to govern nuclear commercial transactions.
“Engaging in nuclear cooperation with a country, such as Saudi Arabia, that has threatened to leave the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to build nuclear weapons, carries extreme risks,” said Daryl Kimball, executive director at the Arms Control Association. “If U.S. companies are considering a business partnership with Korean nuclear companies, such an arrangement increases the burden on the administration to ensure that the Saudis accept rigorous inspections and a commitment never to acquire or seek to acquire… nuclear weapons.”
There is no indication that American companies have followed through with such a plan, but two officials in the Department of Energy told The Daily Beast the Saudis and the South Koreans have offered it up as a winning strategy.
The argument from the Saudi and South Koreans, experts say, is that the nuclear technology that would eventually find its way to Riyadh would be of South Korean origin, not American. Therefore, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia would not need a 123 Agreement. The U.S. companies would only provide other services such as technical expertise, security and staffing.
But there is considerable pushback against that argument in the Department of Energy, current and former officials say.
Combustion Engineering, a company that was absorbed by Westinghouse in 2010, transferred its technology to Seoul to aid in the joint development of a reactor that South Korea then sold across the globe. Since then, South Korea has developed its own technology to manufacture reactors.
But some officials in the Trump administration told The Daily Beast they believe that the South Korean reactors, even if newly developed, are still based on American technology and would therefore require the U.S. and Saudi to sign a 123 Agreement for an American-South Korean consortium to work.
Others, including executives at American companies involved in the Saudi bid, say a U.S.-South Korea partnership without a 123 Agreement could be a winning strategy not only for the U.S., but for Seoul and Riyadh as well. The deal would satisfy Saudi Arabia’s wish for regulatory independence to build up its nuclear sector, it would allow U.S. companies to regain their footing on the international stage and win lucrative contracts, and it would solidify an increasingly close relationship between Washington and South Korea.
American companies—along with companies from Russia, China, and South Korea—are already involved in extensive conversations with Saudi Arabia about the possibility of working to transfer nuclear technology to the kingdom for its plan to reduce their dependence on oil, known as “Vision 2030.”
“Everything to do with Saudi Arabia right now in Congress is seen in light of the [ Washington Post ’s Jamal] Khashoggi murder and that’s problematic for achieving a sound understanding on civilian nuclear energy,” said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute. “But this isn’t a weapons technology proliferation issue. For the Saudis, civilian nuclear energy makes a ton of sense, economically and technologically. They’d be crazy not to do this.”
The Department of Energy has doled out seven authorizations to U.S. companies seeking to conduct nuclear-related work in Saudi Arabia. The authorizations, known as part 810s, allow for the transfer of U.S. nuclear technology to the country, though a separate authorization is needed for companies to actually export that technology.
But experts say some of the companies involved in conversations about a U.S. consortium bidding in Saudi Arabia are behind in developing the technology Riyadh would look for in a bid.
Enter South Korea.
Seoul relies heavily on nuclear energy to power not only its economy but also provide much of the country’s electricity. South Korea currently has 24 reactors that provide about one-third of its electricity. And industry experts say South Korea’s state-run energy companies are some of the best in the business, offering clients top-rate reactors at a fixed rate. The country is currently building four nuclear reactors in the United Arab Emirates under a $20 billion contract. It also has a $173 million contract to construct a nuclear research reactor in Jordan.
Officials from South Korea and Saudi Arabia have met over the past two years in an attempt to broker a relationship that fosters cooperation on nuclear energy. And in January, an executive from one of the country’s energy firms, Kepco, said he believed the company “ left a good impression ” in Saudi Arabia after it had detailed its plans for Riyadh’s nuclear bid.
South Korea could be an attractive option for Saudi Arabia, experts say, because it does not demand the same rigorous standards for inspection and verification as other countries such as the U.S. South Korea does not require that a bilateral cooperation agreement be approved by parliament. It also does not require its clients sign on to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s additional protocol—a safeguard agreement that allows the IAEA to conduct rigorous inspections to ensure countries are using nuclear material for peaceful means. “If the U.S. encourages the IAEA to take a dive, or if the IAEA allows Saudi Arabia to sign a watered down additional protocol, all four parties benefit.” — Robert Kelley, former director of the IAEA
The signing of a protocol is not a requirement; however, most countries around the world have signed on to it, even countries that do not have nuclear power. The protocol is a safeguard agreement that in particular allows the IAEA to conduct rigorous inspections to ensure countries are using nuclear material for peaceful means.
“I have heard Saudi Arabia thinks [the U.S. partnering with South Korea] is a loophole,” said Robert Kelley, the former director of the IAEA. “If the U.S. encourages the IAEA to take a dive, or if the IAEA allows Saudi Arabia to sign a watered down additional protocol, all four parties benefit.”
Officials in the Trump administration, particularly in the Department of Energy, are trying to persuade South Korea to uphold the “gold standard” of inspections and the IAEA additional protocol with Saudi Arabia, according to one official with direct knowledge of those conversations. The IAEA, too, has asked Saudi to agree to the additional protocol.
“Whether South Korea partners with U.S. firms or not, the Korea Electric Power Corporation [KEPCO] uses U.S.-origin content and therefore cannot sell reactors to Saudi Arabia until Riyadh signs a 123 agreement with the United States,” said Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA). “If the Saudis go forward with a nuclear program without a 123 Agreement with the United States, if they want to imitate Iran, then they should no longer be regarded as an ally of the United States.”"
Boeing’s Disaster Could Turn China Into Aviation Superpower,www.thedailybeast.com,Clive Irving,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/boeings-737-max-8-disaster-could-turn-china-into-aviation-superpower,"THE BIG LEAP UPWARD Boeing’s Disaster Could Turn China Into Aviation Superpower For decades Boeing and Airbus have operated the world’s largest duopoly, dominating commercial aviation. The Chinese will end that. 04.15.19 4:28 AM ET Getty
Boeing’s mishandling of the MAX-8 crisis could well end up giving the Chinese a chance to do something that no other nation has successfully achieved: break the global duopoly in commercial airplanes of Boeing and Airbus.
Boeing is desperately trying to limit the damage to its reputation caused by two catastrophic MAX-8 crashes in five months. As it turns out, the greatest long-term harm to the company’s business is likely to be in China.
The Chinese were the first to ground the MAX-8 after the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March and soon afterward the Chinese placed a massive $35 billion order for 300 jets from Airbus.
For more than a decade Boeing and Airbus have been competing to meet China’s seemingly insatiable appetite for commercial airplanes. It is estimated that air travel in China is growing so fast that in the next 20 years the nation’s airlines will need at least 7,400 new airplanes.
Long before the grounding of the MAX-8, Airbus was clearly ahead of Boeing in China. Nearly a quarter of Airbus sales are in China, compared to 14 percent for Boeing.
Boeing and Airbus have built the most powerful duopoly the world has ever seen. Between them the two companies have virtually locked up the market for commercial jets of every size.
Any country or company taking them on faces a daunting price of entry. To develop a modern jet from scratch can cost up to $25 billion, even for Airbus or Boeing with generations of expertise to build on. “Those who claim to understand Chinese strategic thinking seem to agree on one thing: they always play the long game. So unlike Trump.”
A newcomer has to learn how to design and build the most complex machine in public use to the highest standards of safety. It involves an amalgam of some of the most advanced technologies in the world.
But that is not enough. A new jet also has to be supported by a global chain to service and maintain the fleet of jets in a timely way to exacting standards set by the airlines.
Attempts by other countries to do this have not turned out well.
The Russians are selling the Sukhoi Superjet, a small single-aisle design that suffered a severe blow in 2012 when it was being demonstrated in Indonesia to prospective buyers and crashed, killing 37 aviation industry executives. The few airlines now using it have complained about its unreliability.
The Japanese are flight-testing the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, a project that has been delayed five times since being launched in 2013. This entirely conventional design should have been relatively easy to execute but has been dogged by technical glitches that reveal that the Japanese are still on a steep learning curve in aviation.
Many analysts doubted that the Chinese could fare better. They had nothing like the scientific experience of the Russians, who were once world leaders in advanced aerodynamics. If the Russians could screw up so spectacularly surely the Chinese would truly flunk the same test.
But from the beginning the Chinese were cautious in their ambitions; the temptations of hubris—of making too big a leap—were avoided. How they finally made the decision reveals a lot about their philosophy of how to break into a field where their knowledge was thin and experience non-existent.
Those who claim to understand Chinese strategic thinking seem to agree on one thing: they always play the long game. So unlike Donald Trump.
To begin with, they targeted the most profitable market, for the basic airline workhorse, single-aisle jets carrying between 160 and 200 passengers on domestic routes. China alone will need around 9,000 new airplanes in the next 20 years and most of them will be single-aisle.
This meant that there were two Western designs for them to learn from, the Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320. The 737 was the most venerable, originating in the 1960s and, as the MAX-8 crisis has shown, its age is evident . The A320 was designed in the 1980s and was the first commercial jet to use fly-by-wire flight controls and a far higher degree of cockpit automation.
On the face of it the Chinese were choosing between one design that remained in many respects 60 years old and one that was 30 years old.
They chose to make a clone of the A320 that they named the C919 (C for Comac, the government-financed company tasked with the mission.)
When the program was launched in 2011 many of the technologies that were novel when Airbus created the A320 were by then commonplace.
And in one key respect the A320 was outdated: It was built mainly of metal while both Airbus and Boeing had since adopted non-metal composites for large parts of the airframe of their latest jets because composites are as strong as metal but lighter in weight and more easily molded into more efficient aerodynamic surfaces.
The Chinese stuck with metal and in opting for the clone Comac produced an airplane that was outwardly virtually indistinguishable from the A320.
That was the easy bit. Most jets that sit at an airport gate look the same but under their skin it’s a different story. Each planemaker’s proprietorial knowledge lies deep in thousands of details, much of it in technology and intellectual property controlled by western companies.
To proceed Comac had to set up partnerships with many of those companies, including one of the largest, UTC Aerospace Systems, part of America’s United Technologies, Rockwell Collins, Honeywell and the French technology colossus, Thales. The engines also come from the Franco-American alliance of Safran and General Electric.
This dependency has now been overshadowed by Trump’s trade war with China. Last October Vice President Mike Pence warned: “We will continue to stand strong until Beijing stops the predatory practice of forced technology transfer.”
Just how “forced technology transfer” is defined was unclear. Most aerospace projects involve international partnerships. Some of the technology used in building an airliner also crosses over into military applications but none of it would qualify as a state secret and certainly none of that required for the C919 is classified.
Airbus has, however, accelerated China’s learning curve in producing commercial jets by establishing an assembly plant for the A320 in China, now 10 years old.
This plant does not build a jet from the ground up. It follows a model that Airbus uses in Europe. Major sections of the airplane are built in plants dispersed throughout Europe and then shipped to final assembly lines in France and Germany.
The same major sections—fuselage, wings, engines, landing gear—are flown to China to be mated on the final production line there. The internal cabin fittings are also carried out as custom-ordered by an airline.
This has enabled the Chinese to have hands-on experience of some of the most exacting stages of building an airliner, like joining the wings to the fuselage, channeling the complex wiring (a detail that the Japanese mishandled on their regional jet) and attaching the engines and fuel systems.
Boeing was slow to appreciate how much Airbus’s success in China was due to its willingness to let the Chinese learn at first hand all the secrets of a production process that can produce in Europe more than 50 airplanes a month—a rate that China will not reach for years to come. Last December Boeing finally opened a similar assembly plant in China for the 737 MAX series.
And the 737 MAX series will fly again. Thousands more will probably be sold. But the lethal mistakes made in giving the design yet another upgrade have exposed the limitations imposed by the age of its airframe.
China will be able to exploit this opportunity to establish the C919 as an Asian-built airplane that will be supported by the world’s largest domestic airline market. The conservatism of its design will be seen as a virtue if it proves to be competitive and reliable.
As Airbus have done with the A320, Comac will be able to keep the C919 competitive with new generations of engines. Most of the improvements in an airliner’s efficiency—lower emissions, less gas guzzling, greatly reduced sound—come from rapidly advancing jet engine technology. Along with some relatively easy aerodynamic tweaking the C919 should be around for decades to come.
And the Chinese designers have already moved on. They are developing a larger widebody jet to compete with the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350 to be ready by 2025, this time partnering with the Russians. There will no doubt be setbacks on the way, but the Boeing-Airbus duopoly will for sure eventually lose its dominance of the skies. Got a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here . READ THIS LIST"
Thom Solo Has Put Lady Gaga and Britney Spears in 10-Inch Heels.

Next: Your Feet The shoe designer has dressed the feet of pop stars like Britney Spears, Lady Gaga, and Lana del Rey. But he swears you will be able to walk in his platform boots, too. 04.15.19 4:28 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Photo Courtesy Thom Solo
Thom Solo put on his first pair of heels in 1995. He was a 5-year-old boy growing up in Newton, Massachusetts. Solo cannot remember the exact brand—“it probably doesn’t even exist anymore”—but he is sure they were a pair of suede fuchsia pumps.
Suddenly a few inches taller, Solo sprinted out of his mother’s closet, running down the stairs and all around the house. “Well, it was more of a Clydesdale run,” Solo told The Daily Beast. A clunky stride, for sure, but he does not remember falling.
Solo had graduated to his mother's pumps after first obsessing over jelly sandals at age 2. “My mom knew how badly I wanted them, so I think we spent 11 hours of journeying around trying to find a pair,” he recalled. Once they managed to scoop the jellies, “I don’t think I took those shoes off until my feet exploded out of them.”
Now 29, but still boyish with a swooping quiff of brown hair, Solo has managed to turn his shoe fetish into a label filled with structurally bonkers, but undeniably fabulous heels worn by the likes of Britney Spears, Lana del Rey, and Lady Gaga.
If Solo were 20 years younger, maybe he would be one of the many kids on field trips to Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts exhibit, Gender Bending Fashion . Instead, three pairs of his shoes are on display, alongside relics like Marlene Dietrich’s tuxedo and David Bowie ’s Peacock Revolution-era suit.
One of Solo’s black leather boots is paired with a deconstructed tux for women made by the master Japanese tailor Yohji Yamamoto. But Solo’s pièce de résistance are most definitely the stacked platforms designed in 2017 for Lady Gaga ’s Grammy after-party. Those hold a place of honor right by the exhibit’s exit. (Though a placard accompanying the boots erroneously lists Solo’s birth year as 1986, aging the designer by four years.)
The 10-inch boots were accurately described by WBUR’s Andrea Shea as “sleek, sexy, and kind of scary-looking.” Staring at the sculpturally insane shoes might make you want to slip into a pair of moccasins and write Gaga’s podiatrist a letter of sympathy.
However, Solo is quick to point out that his creations, often made for pop stars who have to sing, dance, and pose for cameras, come with orthopedic padding inside.
Indeed, this writer tried on a pair of Solo’s latest—crocodile embossed leather boots with five-inch heels and shafts that rose up to the tippy-tops of her thighs. After a few cursory stumbles, she found her balance in the soft insoles. Sure, they’re not New Balance. But unlike other stilettos, Solo’s are easy to get a hang of with a few minutes of focus and practice.
“Some people see a man making a really tall heel as this whole gender conversation of wanting to cripple [women],” Solo said. “But a woman, Lady Gaga, asked me produce those. And she can do more than a lot of us can do in a pair of sneakers.”
The designer also insists that he tries on each pair before sending them off to clients. “If I don’t find them comfortable, why the hell would I ask them to try and perform in this?” he asked.
“My goal is not to help these women—they don’t need help because they’re goddesses. But I want to support, embellish on the power that they have. I think of the shoes as armor. A thigh-high alligator look says, ‘Try to mess with me.’”
Raised by a single mother, Solo has always been both enamored and somewhat mystified by women. “I identify as male, but I have always had this real kindred connection with female archetypes,” he said.
While most boys in school were watching Batman, Solo binged on Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Catwoman, and Poison Ivy cartoons. He found inspiration in Garbage’s Shirley Manson , with her signature snarl and shocking red hair. “I loved how real she was and how she says, this is me, and if you don’t like it then you can fuck off.”
Solo described himself as “rebellious black sheep,” and would dress in the color to punctuate it. At 13, Solo’s friends started having crushes on girls. He felt nothing but a tiny tinge of jealousy. “I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t jiving the way everyone else was,” he said. One day, it clicked. He was gay.
Solo describes his mother as “hyper aware” and supportive of his sexuality, and within a few years, he was accompanying her on work trips to gay havens in the the West Village, and spent a summer working at a Marc Jacobs boutique in Provincetown, Massachusetts.
One day, a British man strolled through the boutique’s navy blue doors and asked Solo to pull some polos off of a mannequin. While he obliged, Solo knew he had seen the goateed shopper before, but could not place him. “He looked so familiar,” Solo remembered. “He’s British—maybe he’s an actor?” At checkout, the man handed Solo a black business card that read, Lee Alexander McQueen .
“My jaw hit the floor, and I wanted to gush, but I didn’t want to seem crazy,” Solo said. “I just told him I was a huge admirer of his work and that I hoped he enjoyed P-town. Then I was screaming like a schoolgirl for the rest of the day. It wasn’t a deep, intimate, one-on-one, but it was a brief moment I’ll hold on to forever.”
By the age of 17, he had his mom’s permission to go solo in New York, and began frequenting the then-extremely fashionable Beatrice Inn, packed with celebrities (“Lindsay Lohan at her prime—she was a super-sweet girl”), editors, and stylists. “I felt the glamour of New York, but there was also this in between. I was still figuring out who I was.”
Maybe more importantly, Solo cozied up to assistants, never afraid to friend them on Facebook or exchange BlackBerry pins in an attempt to build a virtual Rolodex. But while he knew could gel with the cooler-than-you kids in downtown Manhattan, but struggled to find footing as an art student back in Boston.
“I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to convey about myself through art,” Solo said. “I felt the glamour of New York, but there was also this in between. I was still figuring out who I was. It was a huge point of ambiguity.”
Once again, McQueen popped into Solo’s life, injecting some much-needed direction. While studying wearable art in an introductory sculpting class, Solo flipped open Time to see a black-and-white image of McQueen’s 11-inch, bulbous “armadillo boots.”
“It blew my mind,” Solo said. “It emoted so much. It was this functional object but also a sculpture at the same time. I thought to myself: man, this is it.”
With no background in shoemaking, Solo went home and bought as many footwear books as he could. He asked his professor, Dan Wills, for help with crafting shoes—sourcing materials, building foot forms. The process quickly became his go-to way of self expression. “I loved creating a woman character who had something to say and was a kindred spirit to me, an expression of some feminine energy that maybe I have.”
“They weren’t just shoes for me, they were catalysts for conversations,” Solo said. “I loved creating a woman character who had something to say and was a kindred spirit to me, an expression of some feminine energy that maybe I have.”
By the end of college, Solo had a few collections under his belt. One thing Solo didn’t have, as graduation loomed, was a steady income. With nothing to lose, he friended B. Akerlund, the Swedish stylist known for dressing Beyoncé, Madonna , and Fergie in sexed-up styles, on Facebook.
The cold call took some chutzpah, sure, but Solo assumed the worst Akerlund could do was say no. He had already sent samples to the English singer Neon Hitch, and she had given him some minor publicity. “I don’t think I would have obtained half of the career moments in my life if I had not put feelers out there, just asking if I could do custom for them,” Solo said.
It worked. Akerlund agreed to look at Solo’s thesis, zeroing in on a pair of spiked, McQueen-esque 10-inch platforms. Months later, Solo was drinking in an outdoor bar with friends when he saw Britney Spears’ “Work Bitch” music video. In the BDSM-lite extravaganza, a faceless extra crawls across the screen wearing Solo’s shoes, while Britney cracks a whip.
The placement was enough to earn Solo his own publicist, who booked him some editorials and got his work on the feet of Demi Lovato, Kelly Clarkson, and Lana del Rey.
After liking “about 10,000 of Brandon Maxwell’s assistant’s Instagram photos,” the stylist to Lady Gaga emailed Solo asking for samples. Artpop-era Gaga wore his looks on tour, posing in a limo wearing a pair of ivory pumps with a huge floral-appliqué on the heel.
“We had really amazing moments and I am so grateful for the elevation that she’s given my career, but I have worked with other amazing, incredible women, and right now I want the conversation to be about the actual work,” he said.
Beyoncé, of course, is a “No. 1 goal,” dream client, along with the less-obvious Diane Keaton . He does not subscribe to the belief that women of a certain vintage should be cast off to a life of flats: “That woman has got more style than half of the twentysomethings I encounter in a daily basis.”
With his performance-ready creations, courting famous clientele was easy. The harder part for Solo has been bringing his designs to a mass audience. Though he has private, non-famous shoppers who buy his custom pieces, his work has yet to go fully mainstream. Think: eight-inch, hook-heeled platforms on the shelves of your local department store.
“The small arena right now is working for women in music,” Solo said. “The bigger arena is to have my vision be accessible to every woman.”
While it might be tough to convince women en masse to walk around in ass-grazing thigh-highs all day, Solo has a democratic vision for his designs.
“When I say I’m designing for a woman who wants to have a moment, it can be that she’s going to a gala,” he said. “But she could also be going to get bagels, going to Starbucks, it doesn’t matter what the context is. These are ‘fuck you’ thigh-highs, and if you want to wear them to church, wear them to church .”
Solo has eschewed the traditional shoe design rites of passage. He does not work within the confines of the traditional fashion calendar seasons, and has no plans to leave Boston, his home.
“It is a smaller hub than New York or L.A., and I’m fully aware of that, but Boston has been really conducive to my creativity and my brain works at a higher speed here,” he said. “My studio is wherever I am with my cell phone and computer.”
A year and a half ago, on a night he wanted to stay in, Solo let a friend drag him out for drinks. It was a good call—that night he met his current boyfriend. Today, the two are proud owners of a 7-month-old golden retriever named Avo, named after the toast the pair would eat at brunch while getting to know each other.
“Avo is the most perfect shade of platinum blonde,” a perhaps-biased Solo said. “So many girls come up to me asking, 'Oh my God, can I get a picture for my colorist?'” “When I say I’m designing for a woman who wants to have a moment, it can be that she’s going to a gala. But she could also be going to get bagels, going to Starbucks, it doesn’t matter what the context is.”
Solo no longer has to raid his mother's closet for high heels, which is good—these days, she favors flats. But he still relies on his first supporter for advice, guidance, and a foot to put sample on.
“She’s not really a high heel person anymore, but I’ve definitely made her try mine on,” Solo said.
Gender Bending Fashion is at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston until August 26, 2019."

Women Harassed by Uber and Lyft Drivers Want Answers—Not a $5 Credit,www.thedailybeast.com,Emily.Shugerman@thedailybeast.com (Emily Shugerman),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/women-harassed-by-uber-and-lyft-drivers-want-answersnot-a-dollar5-credit,"Women Harassed by Uber and Lyft Drivers Want Answers—Not a $5 Credit An actress’ tweet about a disturbing ride has brought new attention to the issue. 04.15.19 4:27 AM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Getty
Rachael Maier knew there was a problem when her Uber driver wouldn’t stop staring at her.
On her way to an apartment showing in San Francisco, the 35-year-old media executive said she noticed him turn to look at her at every stop sign. As the ride progressed, he started asking if she had a boyfriend and telling her she was beautiful. Maier said she dodged his advances until she made it to her destination and rushed inside, hoping that would be the end of it.
But when she left the showing 30 minutes later, Maier saw her driver in the same spot where he had dropped her off. He beckoned her over and offered her a free ride, telling her he had to see her again. When she tried to walk away, she said, he started following her down the street. She eventually broke into a sprint, running to the nearest coffee shop and hiding in the back until she could call a Lyft.
Terrified, Maier submitted a report to Uber as soon as she got home, writing that she’d “never felt so weirded out by a driver,” according to emails she provided to The Daily Beast. Uber offered to give her a refund and told her they would be re-evaluating this driver’s access to the platform. That was almost two years ago, and it was the last she heard from the company.
“I don’t think they really care,” Maier told The Daily Beast. “I think they try to minimize things like this to keep you coming back, and maybe they think a $5 credit is enough… They clearly did not feel this had the same level of urgency or danger that I thought it did.” “They clearly did not feel this had the same level of urgency or danger that I thought it did.” — Uber rider Rachael Maier
No one knows exactly how many people are assaulted or harassed in rideshares . Police departments don’t categorize these violations by location, and rideshare companies are notoriously bad at reporting them. Both Uber and Lyft said they made major changes to their safety procedures last year, following a spate of stories on drivers kidnapping, killing and assaulting their passengers . But the number of women harassed—and what exactly happens to the drivers who harass them—remains largely a mystery.
The issue flooded back into the spotlight last week after a viral Twitter thread from actress and comedian Anna Gillcrist. The Los Angeles performer described how her driver had pestered her for personal information—including her relationship status—on the way back from a bachelor party last weekend. When the driver slowed down outside her house to ask if her boyfriend was home, Gillcrist said, she was forced to pry open the lock and run out of the car. Lyft responded by offering a $5 credit toward her ride.
“I want more than a stupid $5 credit,” Gillcrist wrote in a tweet that garnered more than 16,000 likes. “Your driver put me in a scenario in which I thought I might be kidnapped, raped, or even killed. That pathetic attempt to mask a serious issue is insulting to me and women everywhere who have to deal with this shit on a regular basis.”
Shortly after her posts went viral, a Lyft representative reached out to Gillcrist and informed her that the driver had been terminated. In a statement to The Daily Beast, Lyft called the behavior “deeply concerning.”
“Safety is Lyft’s top priority and there is no place for harassment of any sort in our community,” the company said. “As soon as we were made aware of this incident, we deactivated the driver from the Lyft platform. We have also reached out to the rider to offer our support.”
But that isn’t the typical experience for riders with smaller social media followings. Stanford University student Emily Lake told The Daily Beast she tried to ask Lyft about its sexual harassment policy two years ago, after two different drivers asked for her phone number in the span of one week. She felt uncomfortable with the advances but didn’t know how to refuse while trapped in a stranger's car, she said—especially after the second driver thrust his phone into her hand and badgered her into adding him on LinkedIn.
Lake emailed Lyft after the second interaction, asking explicitly for the company’s policy on sexual harassment. After several email exchanges, a Lyft representative apologized to Lake for what it called her “less than stellar experiences.” The representative told her she had “followed up and taken the necessary actions with the two individual drivers,” but did not provide any information about the sexual harassment policy.
“They used a few buzz words. They said ‘We’re hearing you,’ and it didn’t feel at the time at all like they actually cared,” Lake said. “ I would still like an answer to what training or what explicit information is given to new drivers who sign up.” “They used a few buzz words. They said ‘We’re hearing you,’ and it didn’t feel at the time at all like they actually cared.” — Lyft rider Emily Lake
Searching for “sexual harassment” on the Uber help page turns up an anti-discrimination policy and, oddly, a policy on service animals. The community guidelines page urges users to “respect each other” and “give riders and drivers some personal space.” Lyft’s website provides a similar non-discrimination policy and tells drivers not to force conversation or ask riders for their contact information. There is no publicly available information on either website about how sexual harassment claims are handled.
In response to an email from The Daily Beast, a Lyft spokesperson said riders can report safety concerns to its Critical Response Line at any time. Drivers found to be in violation of company policies may receive a warning, temporary deactivation of their account, or a permanent ban from the platform. An Uber spokesperson outlined similar procedures. Both companies said they temporarily suspend accounts while investigating complaints. Neither responded to specific questions about what the investigation process looks like, or if customers are informed of the outcome.
This week, after seeing the response to Gillcrist’s tweets, Maier decided to follow up again on the report she’d made in 2017. She messaged Uber via the app, asking whether the man she says stalked her had been removed or suspended from the platform. A representative responded with a single sentence stating that “appropriate steps were taken,” but that Uber could not divulge those steps due to their privacy policy.
Curious, Maier looked up her driver’s profile on her own. It was still active, with a 4.94-star rating.
“Where is the transparency?” Maier asked incredulously. “They’ll tell you how many late-night trips [a driver] has taken or if he has a clean car, but they won’t tell you how many people felt creeped out by him.”
She added, “You’re putting your safety in someone else’s hands and you don't have the data to make that assessment.”
Rick Rossein, an employment law professor at the City University of New York, said Uber and Lyft may avoid telling riders about the outcome of these investigations for fear of being sued. If a customer found out that their driver was fired for sexual harassment and shared that information, he said, the company could be liable for damaging the driver’s reputation.
But rideshare drivers say the lack of transparency goes both ways. One driver, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, told The Daily Beast she regularly endured male riders offering to her pay for sex during her four years on the job. In one instance, she said a man stayed in her car even after they reached his destination, motioning toward his genitals and telling her what she would “miss out on” if she didn’t go home with him. The driver said she reported every such interaction on the Uber app, but never received any follow-up from the company.
Even drivers who are accused of sexual harassment say they are kept in the dark. Drivers accused of a variety of violations told the Daily Beast that Uber had temporarily disabled their accounts over a single customer complaint, without telling them who the customer was or when the incident occurred. The drivers said they were given the opportunity to send an email contesting the allegation, but that Uber never called them for their version of events or collected evidence.
“They give you the opportunity to send an email saying ‘I didn’t do this,’ but they don’t talk to you,” said Jason Reed, a driver in Las Vegas who was temporarily deactivated for allegedly driving while intoxicated. He was reinstated less than a day later.
“They just deactivate you for however long it takes the to get through whatever process they have,” he added. “But honestly I don't know what they do in those 28 hours, because they didn’t talk to me.”
Rideshare Drivers United—one of several groups that have formed to represent rideshare drivers in recent years—lists “transparency” as one of its top demands for companies like Uber and Lyft. Their four-pronged “Drivers Bill of Rights” asks specifically for a “transparent, speedy, independent de-activation appeals process, with all discipline held to ‘just cause’ standard.” Drivers from the Alliance for Independent Workers are also organizing for a more transparent investigation process.
Nicole Moore, a Lyft driver and organizer with RDU, said this is to protect both drivers and riders.
“If a driver's out there messing with passengers, that's not good for any of us because we're all seen as suspect,” she said. “And if there's not really reliable ways to follow up on those things, then we're all hurting.”
“If you're going to be a rideshare company, safety has to be a concern—and not just on paper,” she added. “There has to be a real way to follow up on those things.”
Uber has recently made steps to better report sexual harassment and assault on its platform, releasing a “taxonomy” of sexual offenses in partnership with the National Sexual Violence Resource Center to help track the problem. They plan to release the data this year. Both Uber and Lyft agreed last year to stop forcing riders and drivers to settle sexual harassment claims via forced arbitration, rather than in open court.
But the companies so far have failed to set up a process of information-sharing within the industry to keep bad drivers from simply switching to another platform. Reed said he counsels his fellow drivers to set up accounts with Uber, Lyft, Postmates and other services to insure a “backup” source of income if they are deactivated from one service. Katie Wells, a postdoctoral fellow at Georgetown University who is studying Uber’s emergence in Washington, D.C., said she’d heard of people simply driving under a friend or family member’s profile while their account was deactivated.
“I hope that increasingly these stories contribute to some kind of public reckoning to say, ‘Wait a second, we should not trust these companies,’” Wells said. “They may be good at making an app, but are they good at making decisions about public safety? I don't know.”"
‘Game of Thrones’ Season 8 Premiere: Jon Snow’s World Is Turned Upside Down,www.thedailybeast.com,melissa.leon@thedailybeast.com (Melissa Leon),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-1-jon-snows-world-is-turned-upside-down,"‘Game of Thrones’ Season 8 Premiere: Jon Snow’s World Is Turned Upside Down HBO The premiere episode of the HBO epic’s eighth and final season gave us many reunions, a new rivalry, and some uncomfortable truths. [Warning: Spoilers] Melissa Leon 04.15.19 3:11 AM ET
T he final season of Game of Thrones begins by mirroring its past. The Season 8 premiere, “Winterfell,” deliberately parallels moments from the show’s pilot, underlining what a different world Westeros is now from what it was just under a decade ago. Eight seasons ago, it was Arya running through the crowd, eagerly trying to glimpse the extravagant royal procession of a king and queen marching into Winterfell; now she’s grown and watches as a little boy squeezes past her to see her brother, Jon Snow, and his queen Daenerys Targaryen file in with the Unsullied and Dothraki forces.
Dany’s march into Winterfell represents a clashing of worlds that the episode at times handles by giving in to its most tedious instincts. More pointless squabbling between women who should know better? Must there really be so much Euron Greyjoy ?? Still, in its most emotional moments, the episode is a satisfying beginning of the end, even if it doesn’t always feel like the show we’ve come to love and—just as importantly—fear. Sansa vs. Daenerys Is the New Worst Part of Game of Thrones
The most baffling part of Season 7 without doubt was the artificial wedge driven between Sansa and Arya , for no justifiable reason other than giving them something to do at Winterfell while Jon courted Dany. It paid off in the end with Littlefinger’s groveling demise but left a sour taste in fans’ mouths for how contrived and easily avoided it was as a means to an end. Now that Arya has come to her senses and trusts that her sister only wants the best for their family, the dynamic seems to have transferred to Sansa and Dany.
Look, Sansa does have reason to hesitate in trusting the total stranger her brother just gave away Northern loyalties to. She’s focused on pragmatic issues ever since Jon left her in charge, counting bushels of wheat and devising better ways for the Northern forces to stay warm, fed, and therefore keep them all alive—10,000 foreign soldiers and two dragons waltzing in throws a wrench in her calculations. Plus, it’s already cost her one house’s loyalty: House Glover decides to sit out the war because of Jon’s new alliance.
It’s not like she doesn’t know how to work with enemies. This is the girl who turned to Littlefinger for the Knights of the Vale at a moment when Jon refused to consider it. There was no choice if they wanted to take back the North. Sansa knew that, and acted on it, despite having more reason than anyone to hate the person she was forced to work with. She gets it! And with the Night King coming to Winterfell, she knows the stakes are higher now than they ever were, even at the Battle of the Bastards .
Still, Jon interprets Sansa’s good sense, somehow, as an annoyance— again . He’s light-years behind Arya in this regard, and she tells him so: “Sansa is the smartest person I’ve ever met,” Arya says after Jon jokes that Sansa “thinks she’s smarter than everyone.” Sansa, meanwhile, is reduced to snark and side-eye, but she does voice a valid concern: “Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?” (She and Tyrion would agree that two leaders blinded by love in the middle of an apocalyptic war is bad news for everyone.)
For her part, Dany returns Sansa’s coldness with what sounds ludicrously like a threat in conversation with Jon Snow: “Your sister doesn’t like me…She doesn’t need to be my friend. But I am her queen. If she can’t respect me…” She doesn’t finish the sentence. But we (and now Samwell Tarly, sadly) know too well how Dany reacts when she feels slighted.
It’s all disappointing because of how little screen time we have left with these characters and how dramatic the stakes are now. Daenerys and Sansa have two of the hardest-won positions in the endgame. Rather than building momentum in their scenes together, we get moments like the one in this episode when each glares at the other from across a table at an important meeting like they're in a high-school cafeteria. Be more interesting, guys! Is Cersei No Longer Pregnant? Was She Ever?
Sansa and Dany aside, though, the episode’s toughest moments—as they have been since his arrival—are Euron-centric. The swaggering pirate goon returns to King’s Landing with the Golden Company, the most elite army in Essos, ready to crush whatever decimated remnant of the North survives the showdown with the Night King. His theatricality dims in comparison, though, to the bombshell revelation that there could have been elephants in this episode. Where are the elephants?! Someone mutters something about how hard it is to get elephants on boats which, what? People can teleport on this show now. Like Cersei, “I wanted those elephants.”
Speaking of potential bombshells, Cersei may have let one slip in an otherwise low-key scene with Euron. The ever more austere queen of Westeros—the throne room looks uncomfortably warm these days, with six bonfires going at once and everyone newly outfitted in head-to-toe black, including the Queensguard—allows herself a moment of release when she invites Euron into her room for a rebound quickie. (Jaime broke up with her last season to join the forces up north; Cersei, exactly the kind of ex-girlfriend you’d expect her to be, responds in this episode by enlisting his buddy Bronn to kill him and Tyrion.)
Last season, Cersei revealed to Jaime that she was pregnant with their fourth child, and deliberately let Tyrion infer as much. It’s why Tyrion (naively) thinks Cersei will join the fight for humankind. Curiously, however, she’s drinking wine again in this episode; it was the unprecedented sight of his alcoholic sister turning down a glass that tipped Tyrion off in the first place. Lena Headey works a tantalizing yet inscrutable emotion into Cersei’s face as Euron touches her belly and promises he’ll put a prince in her soon. (Gross.) Did she lose the child? Was she actually pregnant at all?
Cersei’s pregnancy had always seemed to contradict a prophecy the show took special care to make sure we’re aware of. Maggy the Witch foretold in a Season 5 flashback that Cersei would only have three children of her own: “gold their crowns, gold their shrouds.” (There’s a complication with that , too, when you take Cersei’s first child, a “little black-haired beauty” fathered by Robert, into account but time will tell if we’ll ever straighten that loose end out .) If Maggy was right, it would have meant that either Cersei or the child would not live to see the other. But with tonight’s boozy development, the better question to ask may be why the show is hiding what happened.
Tyrion still believes Cersei is pregnant and therefore has “something to live for,” though Peter Dinklage’s delivery of that line leaves a bit open to interpretation. We know brother and sister brokered some kind of backdoor deal after Cersei initially refused to cooperate at the Dragonpit pow-wow—somehow, he was able to convince her to commit the Lannister forces to the cause. She double-crossed him anyway, but what did Tyrion agree to give up in return, if anything? What isn’t the show telling us? Jon Snow Rides a Dragon, and Nobody Seems to Know What That Means
The show-stopper of the episode, though, comes with Jon and Dany’s version of the magic carpet scene from Aladdin. The queen goads her unwitting nephew-boyfriend into trying to hitch a ride on Rhaegal, the green dragon named after her brother (his dad). Jon gets uncharacteristically neurotic about the whole thing—“What if he doesn’t want me to?” “What do I hold on to?”—but eventually gives in, hops on, and has the closest thing to childish fun he’s had since dunking on Bran’s archery skills in the pilot.
Their soaring (tumbling, freewheeling) ride together on the backs of dragons through the land Jon grew up in feels like a moment from a different show. It’s romantic, it’s sappy, it’s awkward—it’s fun, even cheesy. “It’s cold up here for a southern girl,” Jon ventures flirtatiously. “So keep your queen warm,” Dany says, as each tries to out-smolder the other. It’s one crowd-pleasing moment in an episode full of them.
Jon’s ride aboard Rhaegal, of course, means more than just a pet taking a liking to its mom’s new boyfriend. The show hinted at Jon eventually riding a dragon back when Drogon didn’t flambé him alive in their first face-to-face last season. That Rhaegal actually lets Jon ride him in this episode is presumably because of his Targaryen blood. Dragons are drawn to members of the family and most dragon-riders in Westerosi history were Dany’s ancestors. (Arya recounted to Tywin the story of the first Aegon Targaryen and his sister-wives Visenya and Rhaenys, all of whom rode dragons, in Season 2.) Plus, we’ve seen what happens when non-Targaryens, like slave-master Kraznys mo Nakloz, try taking the reins. That guy lasted twelve seconds before being burnt to ash.
Curiously, neither Jon nor Dany put two and two together here—after Jon survives his joyride, they’re too horny and giddy to notice much of anything. But Drogon shoots Jon a lingering look, which seems to imply that both dragons can sense what these two can’t. You see why people are worried about them in a war like this.
Jon’s new dragon-driving license doesn’t do much to confirm a long-gestating fan theory about the Prince Who Was Promised and three dragon riders. In the books’ version of the visions that Daenerys had while visiting the House of the Undying, her older brother Rhaegar appeared to tell her about the Prince Who Was Promised: “His is the song of ice and fire.” He mentions that “the dragon has three heads,” which many took to refer to Dany’s three dragons.
The theory predicts that there will be a rider for each of them, though we’re one dragon short now that the Night King has killed and transformed Viserion into a fire-breathing zombie monster. Even if the show did, at some point, entertain the idea of sending three heroes riding into battle together on the backs of dragons, that outcome seems less likely now. Sorry, Tyrion . Jon Snow Learns More About Dany Than He Ever Wanted
While Dany’s dragons probably had a good laugh over what these silly humans don’t know, Bran absolutely cannot wait to tell them. He and Sam Tarly have known since last season that Jon is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Ned’s sister Lyanna Stark; that Rhaegar annulled his previous marriage to Elia Martell before wedding Lyanna; and that as their son, Jon therefore has the strongest claim to the Iron Throne. Bran’s not about to do the thing himself, though.
He pushes Sam to do it, only minutes after the poor guy meets Dany and learns that she’s murdered his father and brother for treason. Learning about his emotionally abusive father’s death elicits a mix of shock, dismay, and relief—but it’s the news of his brother Dickon Tarly’s honorable death at his father’s side that crushes Sam into tears. It’s a hard thing to watch. (No one tell Sam that the Lannister who led his brother into battle couldn’t even get his name right.)
Still, the emotion of the scene lends Sam’s talk with Jon an edge it might not have had otherwise. Sam is still reeling when he unloads the truth on Jon in the crypts of Winterfell—a fitting place, considering this is where we first heard the story of Lyanna’s death from Robert back in the pilot. The fact that he’s had sex with his aunt doesn’t seem to occur to Jon just yet; instead, he reacts with immediate, understandable pain at the discovery that everything he knows is a lie. And perhaps a bit of fear of his new girlfriend’s wrath. “That’s treason” is the next thing he blurts.
We know something has to come between Jon and Dany beyond his stronger claim to the throne. (If Jon can get past the whole incest thing, a marriage would not only solve his problem, but prove politically advantageous as well.) Maybe it will be the most obvious thing: Dany’s innate ruthlessness, which Sam just made personal. Or maybe it’s hinted at in Tyrion’s face as he watches the young, happy couple from afar. Last season ended with a hint of envy as Tyrion watched Jon enter Dany’s bedroom. And he does sound just a little bitter in this episode as he concedes they make a “handsome couple.” Reunions: The Good, The Awkward, and the Ugly
Other reunions in this episode end on a sweeter note than Jon and Sam’s, though. Theon and his band of Iron Islanders break onto Euron’s ship and rescue Yara. The rightful owner of the salt throne vows to return home and retake the Islands in case Daenerys comes to need them—they’re one of few places in Westeros safe from the dead, since wights and White Walkers can’t swim. Theon, meanwhile, vows to redeem himself for the home and family he betrayed time and again: the Starks. He will return to Winterfell to fight alongside Jon in the war to come.
Bran’s reunion with Jon is perfectly off-putting, as Jon gushes and Bran acts like a robot. Arya and Jon’s first face-to-face in eight seasons, meanwhile, is more emotive. Jon was one of few adults to acknowledge and even encourage Arya’s desire to train to fight as a girl. And it was his gift to her, the little Valyrian sword she called “Needle,” that became a totem for her to hang onto in moments when she nearly forgot who she is. There is one faintly sad moment of disconnect, as Jon earnestly asks if she’s ever had a chance to use the blade. “Once or twice,” she says quietly.
The Hound and Arya is the reunion I’d anticipated the most, though—and dreaded a bit, since Arya did want him dead and might have added him back to her kill list upon seeing him again. Instead, there’s almost a sweetness in their welcome, as the two size each other up and leave a lot unsaid. “You’re a cold little bitch, aren’t you?” The Hound says, trying to save face. But by then we’ve already seen a small smile on his face.
Arya once resolved to kill Melisandre for taking away Gendry, and here we’re reminded of why she liked him so much. As the gifted blacksmith forges new weapons out of dragonglass, he teases her then whips out that swoony, Princess Bride -y line, “As you wish, milady,” that Arya seems to love. Even better, he takes her design for a new custom weapon and promises to make it reality. In the drawing she hands him, it looks like a dragonglass spear with a detachable handle, like a spear-staff-knife thing. Get you a man who can do both. The Night King Cometh
After all this relative calm and quiet, we’re reminded of why this can’t last: the Night King and his army have progressed to the ancestral home of House Umber, Last Hearth (the only locale spotlighted in the revamped opening credits besides Winterfell and the Red Keep). Tormund Giantsbane and Beric Dondarrion, who survived the calamity of the Wall’s crumble at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, stumble into Dolorous Edd (now Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch) as they search the castle. There are no bodies, only ominous splashes of blood on the floor—until we see that the Night King has claimed the life of the little Umber lord. Worse, he did it for bad art.
The young boy’s body parts splayed in a grisly swirling pattern is yet one more image that recalls the pilot; we saw horse body parts arranged the same way in the opening minutes of the show. We now know that the Children of the Forest, who created White Walkers, used similar patterns in their magic. (The Night King was created when they plunged a dragonglass dagger in his chest by a heart tree in the center of one of these patterns.) With a dead kid in the center, it’s a far more disturbing image.
But it’s also a welcome reminder of what we’re here to face, despite a suspiciously blissful start to this final season. Winter is here, remember? And as Varys reminds us: “Nothing lasts.”"

Timothy Burke 04.15.19 10:41 AM ET
We’re almost sympathetic to the many, many sports mavens who predicted Tiger Woods’ career was over. After all, before he claimed Masters gold in Augusta on Sunday, he’d gone 11 years without a major title. Furthermore, the sports-media status quo demands hot takes and privileges, somehow, those who are the most wrong, the most often .
We can still hold a few of them accountable, though. Here, then, is a brief collection of people paid to talk on television claiming that what happened Sunday at the Masters would never come to pass.
It’s comforting, in a way, to find Fox Business Network's Stuart Varney— who consistently delivers wrongheaded punditry with a unwavering self-assurance —to also be so adamant about Tiger’s inability to win another major. He is, in so many ways, the Stephen A. Smith of conservative media. READ THIS LIST"
Elizabeth Warren: I’d End Offshore Drilling on Day One of My Presidency,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elizabeth-warren-id-end-offshore-drilling-on-day-one-of-my-presidency,"GOING BIG Elizabeth Warren: I’d End Offshore Drilling on Day One of My Presidency She called for a ‘total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases including for drilling offshore and on public lands.’ 04.15.19 10:04 AM ET Karen Pulfer Focht
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is promising to sign an executive order on her first day in the White House that would place a “total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases including for drilling offshore and on public lands.”
The proposal is part of a public-lands policy rollout the 2020 Democrat unveiled before a trip to South Carolina, Colorado, and Utah—a plan she hopes will address “lands under threat” by President Trump’s administration.
“We must not allow corporations to pillage our public lands and leave taxpayers to clean up the mess,” the Massachusetts Democrat wrote in a Medium post . “All of us—local communities and tribes, hunters and anglers, ranchers and weekend backpackers—must work together to manage and protect our shared heritage.”
Earlier this year, House Democrats introduced a set of bills to place a moratorium on the Trump administration’s proposal to expand offshore drilling around the country.
Warren’s promise comes days after the Senate confirmed former oil and gas lobbyist David Bernhardt as the new interior secretary as that department reportedly considers an extension of drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans.
In addition ending offshore drilling, Warren on Monday outlined a set of public-land proposals with a goal of achieving 10-percent electricity generation from renewable sources offshore or on public lands. Citing a 2017 executive order from the Trump administration that dramatically scaled back the size of two national monuments in Utah, Warren said she will “use my authorities under the Antiquities Act to restore protections to both monuments and any other national monuments targeted by this Administration.”
Warren also called for increased funding for a “21st century Civilian Conservation Corps,” which she said would put 10,000 young people and veterans at work on public lands. The title of the corps refers to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal-era work-relief program that disbanded in 1942.
The Democratic hopeful also suggested making entry to U.S. national parks free.
“There’s no better illustration of how backwards our public lands strategy is than the fact that today, we hand over drilling rights to fossil fuel companies for practically no money at all—and then turn around and charge families who make the minimum wage more than a day’s pay to access our parks,” she wrote.
The senator also called for increased involvement of U.S. tribal nations in conversations about public-use protection.
“The administration of public lands should incorporate tribes’ traditional ecological knowledge, making provisions for tribal culture and customs on public lands, and exploring co-management and the return of resources to indigenous protection wherever possible,” Warren writes."

Measles Cases Up 43 Percent in Just Two Weeks,www.thedailybeast.com,tanya.basu@thedailybeast.com (Tanya Basu),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/measles-cases-up-43-percent-in-just-two-weeks-cdc-says,"Measles Cases Skyrocket 43% as Anti-Vaxxers Head to Court The disease has now been reported in 20 states. 04.15.19 12:02 PM ET Reuters
Measles cases across the United States have surged 43% in just two weeks, underscoring just how contagious the disease can be even as anti-vaxxers wage legal battles against emergency measures to stem the spread of the virus.
The Centers for Disease Control reported Monday that between Jan. 1 and April 11, there have been 555 confirmed cases in 20 states. A week ago, that number was 465, and the week before that it was 387.
“This is the highest number of cases reported in any week in 2019,” Amanda Cohn, senior advisor for vaccines at the CDC, told The Daily Beast on Monday. “It’s hard to anticipate over the next several weeks [what’s next]. It depends on how many susceptibles are in the communities.”
The figure announced Monday is the second-highest number of cases in a decade and on pace to exceed the previous record, set in 2014, since endemic measles was eradicated almost 20 years ago.
Health officials have said the rise in measles is being fueled by travel to and from countries like Israel and Ukraine, which have huge outbreaks, and a growing anti-vaxxer movement that falsely claims the shots cause autism and other medical problems.
Most of this year’s cases can be linked to a handful of serious outbreaks, including nearly 300 in New York City, where the mayor has decreed everyone in the affected communities must be vaccinated—sparking a new lawsuit on Monday.
“There is insufficient evidence of a measles epidemic or dangerous outbreak to justify the respondents’ extraordinary measures, including forced vaccination,” a suit Monday claimed.
The suit was filed in Brooklyn, where measles has spread in the Orthodox Jewish community, on behalf of five families.
Their lawyer, Robert Krakow, who handles “vaccine injury cases,” said the mayor’s order was “inappropriate.”
Krakow said that the plaintiffs were seeking to have the city recognize that he families had filed for religious exemptions under New York law and that they had gone through proper procedures for their families. “Our goal is to allow people to choose whether or not to vaccinate,” he said.
“The city needs to stop exaggerating the problem,” Krakow said. “I don’t think for a second measles is not a concern—it is—but it’s been overblown, and the city has overreacted and overreached here.”
City officials have said at least 21 people have been hospitalized since the Brooklyn outbreak began in October when an unvaccinated child returned from a visit to Israel.
Krakow said he believes measles creates “de facto quarantines,” reasoning that when someone is infected, “they’re not in public, they’re not in school—they’re home sick.”
“We don’t think the city has to come in and remove everybody with measles,” he said.
But Walter Orenstein, the associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center, noted that an infected person can spread the virus for several days before they develop symptoms like rashes, coughing, and fevers.
Public health experts worry the number of those infected might increase even more in upcoming weeks.
“With spring breaks occurring these last few weeks, and with Easter, Passover, and other holidays (like the Jewish festival Purim), there has been both a significant amount of family domestic and international travel, and large, close knit gatherings of people who may be vulnerable to picking up and spreading measles if exposed to the virus, so I wouldn't be stunned if we saw another wave arising out of these events,” said Ross David Silverman, professor of health policy and management at Indiana University’s Fairbanks School of Public Health.
From New York to Michigan to Washington State, officials have offered free vaccine clinics and banned the unvaccinated from schools or even public places to bring the crisis under control.
Still, the CDC’s Cohn said, “we don’t have a great handle on how much longer this will last.”
Cohn said the CDC is also focused on getting accurate information to those who might fear vaccinations.
“The important thing to understand from a national perspective that the number of cases in the U.S. is driven by the outbreak in New York and New York City,” she added. “We know that every parent wants to make the best decision for their child. We need to make sure they have accurate information and are not confused.” READ THIS LIST "
‘Fox & Friends’ Worries Pete Buttigieg Might Be the Next Obama,www.thedailybeast.com,matt.wilstein@thedailybeast.com (Matt Wilstein),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-and-friends-worries-pete-buttigieg-might-be-the-next-obama,"‘PAY ATTENTION’ ‘Fox & Friends’ Worries Pete Buttigieg Might Be the Next Obama The hosts warned Mayor Pete Buttigieg might sound ‘moderate’ but is actually a ‘hard left guy’ who ‘just phrases that in a way that’s much more palatable.’ Fox News
Fox & Friends is getting awfully worried about Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
The Monday morning after his big 2020 announcement from South Bend, Indiana, the hosts lashed out at the mayor for “running against” President Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” message.
“There is a myth being sold to industrial and rural communities: the myth that we can stop the clock and turn it back,” Buttigieg told potential voters in his speech over the weekend. It comes from people who think the only way to reach communities like ours is through resentment and nostalgia, selling an impossible promise of returning to a bygone era that was never as great as advertised to begin with.”
After dismissing Buttigieg as a small-town mayor who “essentially wants to be America’s mayor,” Steve Doocy expressed shock that he is now in the “top tier” of Democratic candidates according to polls and fundraising numbers.
Brian Kilmeade noted that Buttigieg seems to be getting a lot of the attention that Beto O’Rourke “thought he would get” before saying that despite a “well-written” and “well-delivered” speech, he thinks the candidate is “missing the point” on MAGA.
“‘Make America Great Again’ is not let’s go back,” Kilmeade insisted. “It’s looked at, we’re going to give attention to blue collar workers and farmers. It doesn’t mean we want to go back to a different day before there was cable television.”
“He speaks beautifully, he’s very nuanced people need to look beyond that and actually look at the policies he supports,” Jedediah Bila added. “Because everyone’s saying, ‘Oh, maybe he’s a little more moderate.’ He’s actually not. He is a hard left guy. He is a Medicare for All, Paris Climate Agreement, Green New Deal guy.”
“He just phrases that in a way that’s much more palatable, and be careful,” she continued, “because I know somebody else who did that and his name was President Barack Obama. So pay attention.”
“But he won twice,” Kilmeade warned of Obama."
House Chairmen Demand White House Documents on Trump’s ‘Alarming’ Sanctuary City Plan,www.thedailybeast.com,Scott.Bixby@thedailybeast.com (Scott Bixby),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/house-chairmen-demand-white-house-documents-on-trumps-alarming-sanctuary-city-plan,"RETRIBUTION House Chairmen Demand White House Documents on Trump’s ‘Alarming’ Sanctuary City Plan The trio said Trump lacks both the legal authority and the ethical justification for manipulating detainee releases in service of scoring political points. 04.15.19 11:43 AM ET REUTERS
Three powerful House Democrats are requesting the White House release all documents relating to President Trump’s plan to conduct a targeted release of undocumented immigrants in so-called “sanctuary cities,” a policy intended to serve as retribution for Democrats for failing to sign on with the president’s immigration agenda.
In a letter sent on Monday morning, Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) and Bennie Thompson (D-MS)—chairs of the House Oversight, Judiciary and Homeland Security committees, respectively—told acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan that they are “deeply troubled” by the Trump administration’s proposal.
The plan to release immigrants currently in government detention into cities and congressional districts represented by Democrats, they wrote, is “a bizarre and unlawful attempt to score political points.” Such communities, as a matter of local law or policy, do not cooperate with federal immigration officials in arresting and detaining undocumented people unless they have been accused of committing another criminal offense.
Calling the plan “alarming,” the letter adds that the administration lacks both the legal authority and the ethical justification for manipulating detainee releases in service of scoring political points; and requests a host of documents relating to the plan, including any communications relating to conversations between the White House and immigration agencies regarding the release of migrants into specific areas, as well as all documents within the Department of Homeland Security “discussing policy or legal justifications or implications” for the policy.
The letter asks for the documents “by no later than May 3, 2019.”
Trump’s plan—which was first reported by the Washington Post before the president confirmed it via Twitter on Friday—is an apparent attempt to bait local Democratic lawmakers in sanctuary cities into protesting the release of immigrants into their communities, although mayors of numerous such cities told The Daily Beast that they would welcome any former detainees with open arms.
“I am proud that Cambridge is a sanctuary city,” Mayor Marc McGovern told The Daily Beast. “Trump is a schoolyard bully who tries to intimidate and threaten people. I’m not intimidated and if asylum seekers find their way to Cambridge, we’ll welcome them.”
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
Lori Loughlin Pleads Not Guilty in College Admissions Scandal,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/lori-loughlin-pleads-not-guilty-in-college-admissions-scandal,"BATTLE READY Lori Loughlin Pleads Not Guilty in College Admissions Scandal Nearly 20 people charged in the massive admissions scandal have pleaded guilty, but that’s not stopping Lori Loughlin and her husband from fighting back. 04.15.19 11:40 AM ET Joseph Prezioso/Getty
Actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband are pleading not guilty in the college admissions bribery scam , the U.S. Attorney’s Office confirmed Monday.
The celebrity couple, along with eight other parents, filed documents in U.S. District Court in Boston on Monday to waive their right to appear for an arraignment, and asked the court to enter the not guilty plea on their behalf. It is not immediately clear whether the judge will accept their request or force the parents to appear in court.
Loughlin, the 54-year-old actress best known for playing Aunt Becky on Full House, and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, have been accused of paying William Singer $500,000 to get their two daughters admitted to USC as crew recruits, even though neither teen had participated in the sport. The alleged payment was made out to Key Worldwide Foundation, a non-profit organization run by Singer.
The not guilty plea comes just days after Loughlin and more than a dozen other parents were slapped with additional fraud and money laundering charges by a federal grand jury for their alleged roles in what has been described as the “largest college admissions scam prosecuted by the Justice Department.”
The 16 parents charged in a second superseding indictment last Tuesday now face several charges, including conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, honest services mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. According to the documents filed Monday, Lori and Giannulli also waived their right to appear in court for their arraignment on charges in the superseding indictment arraignment.
Prosecutors allege the parents charged paid admissions consultant William “Rick” Singer, 58, more than $25 million total to rig test scores, cheat on standardized tests, and bribe college coaches —all with the goal of getting their children into elite universities. Among the charged was fellow actress Felicity Huffman, who pleaded guilty to her role in the scam last week.
“I have some concerns and want to fully understand that game plan to make sure we have a roadmap for success as it relates to [our older daughter] and getting her into a school other than ASU!” Giannulli allegedly wrote in an email to Singer, according to Tuesday’s indictment .
Both daughters, YouTube star Olivia Jade and Bella, have left the school since the scandal erupted, and several beauty brands have dropped the elder daughter from advertisement deals. The Hallmark Channel also cut ties with Loughlin .
According to People magazine, Loughlin and her husband are reportedly reluctant to plead guilty because of how it would affect their relationship with their two daughters.
“She is very concerned about what a guilty plea would do to her daughters, who may not have grasped everything that was going on,” an unnamed source told the publication on Saturday. “Yes, she can think about the public perception of her, but that’s nothing compared to what her daughters think of her. So that is something that has understandably made her less likely to enter a plea.”
Representatives for Loughlin and Giannulli did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment."

At the end of a fairly mundane Fox News interview on Monday morning, Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez tore into the network’s leadership and editorial policies after Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer asked him if the DNC would reconsider banning the network from hosting a 2020 Democratic presidential primary debate.
With Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders scheduled to appear Monday on Fox for a town-hall event, Hemmer took the opportunity to appeal directly to Perez. Earlier this year, Perez announced the DNC would not allow Fox News to host a debate, citing a New Yorker expose revealing the tight relationship between the network and the Trump administration.
“Will you reconsider your decision of having debates on the Fox News channel?” Hemmer asked.
“Here is why we won’t do that,” Perez replied. “I don’t have faith in your leadership at Fox News at the senior levels.”
“I have great respect for Bret [Baier] and for Chris [Wallace] and for you,” the DNC chair noted, “but you’ve demonstrated that, above your pay grade, they don’t trust your own listeners and so they feel like they have to put the thumb on the scale.”
Perez went on to clarify to Hemmer that he was specifically pointing to Fox News brass, adding that they’ve “pierced that line between editorial and your Sean Hannity shows.” That last point prompted Hemmer to defend the network’s so-called “hard news” shows.
“You know there is a line between what we do at 9:00 and what happens in the prime time,” Hemmer declared before parroting a line often heard on Hannity’s program : “It's like reading a newspaper, Tom. And it has been the same way for a long time. I really hope you come back. I really hope you reconsider.”
“I hope you have a good conversation with the people at the top to say, ‘Don’t do that,’” Perez shot back."
Border Patrol Holds Hundreds of Migrants in Growing Tent City Away From Prying Eyes,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Glawe Justin Hamel,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/border-patrol-holds-migrants-in-el-paso-tent-city-away-from-prying-eyes,"04.15.19 11:18 AM ET Justin Hamel
EL PASO, Texas—Hundreds of migrants are being held for days in an emerging tent city at a Border Patrol station in a preview of what the Trump administration is reportedly considering to absorb a surge on the border.
Five U.S. Army tents meant for battlefield hospitals have been repurposed to hold men, women, and children, including infants. Two of the tents were erected over the past week, expanding the facility’s capacity by several hundred people. The tents are tightly surrounded by fences topped with barbed wire, leaving virtually no space for people to roam outside. Inside the tents, according to a congresswoman who was granted access, hundreds languish in fetid conditions.
Rep. Nanette Barragán (D-CA) visited the facility in early April with a congressional delegation.
“One woman had a baby, a five-month-old baby and said she’d been there for five days. The baby had filthy clothes,” Barragán said. “The situation is unhealthy. People are in a confined space, they’re not getting showers, their clothes are dirty, babies are not getting Pampers like they should be. These ladies were crying and telling us their stories and it was just heartbreaking.”
Barragán was banned from taking photos of migrants, but she described a desperate scene inside. The tents contained no cots and migrants slept on a temporary floor that covered the asphalt parking lot beneath, with babies sometimes sleeping on their parents’ legs to avoid the hard floor.
“We were stepping over people to walk around in the tent,” she said. “And the food is… We’re talking ramen and Cup of Noodles, Capri Suns and juice boxes, maybe a frozen burrito if you’re lucky.
“I was really taken aback by the smell. I was in there for five minutes and I just became nauseous, I hate to say it. It’s just too many people for that size area and people hadn’t had a shower for many days. Border Patrol told us it was their goal to get people a shower every three days, but the mother I spoke to there hadn’t had one and she’d been there for five.”
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to detailed questions regarding conditions and capacity in the tents.
Reporters are forbidden from the facility, leaving The Daily Beast to observe the operation through a telephoto lens from nearly a quarter-mile away.
Outside the tents last week, buses dropped off as many as 60 migrants at a time. After receiving mylar blankets and paperwork, the migrants were led by agents into the tents, which are approximately 75 feet long and 20 feet wide. The tents have with a cot capacity of 148 people, according to the Army. Some are tattered, with sections of fabric flapping in the wind. Surge with no end in sight
The practice of keeping migrants in tents appears to be part of the Trump administration’s plan for dealing with the surge of Central American asylum-seekers who have overwhelmed the U.S. government at the border in recent months.
Apprehensions across the border are at a 12-year high, with nearly 100,000 migrants apprehended in March, according to DHS. Most are Central American families seeking asylum, and many are crossing in the El Paso sector, where apprehensions over the last several months are up more than 1,000 percent compared to the same period last year.
Last Tuesday, officials from the Defense Department and Homeland Security met at the White House to discuss using military resources to construct and staff new tent cities in El Paso and Donna, Texas, NBC News reported . It’s a favorite idea of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.
“Basically, people are packed into these tents,” Barragán said. “They haven’t fixed the problem; they just moved it.”
Many migrants walk into U.S. territory and approach Border Patrol agents to turn themselves in and request asylum. From there, they are usually taken to rooms at border crossings known as “processing centers” for initial asylum interviews. After they’re processed, migrants are either released by Customs and Border Protection or transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention. But there isn’t enough space in the rooms for the hundreds arriving daily in El Paso, so they are being held for processing at the tent city and under bridges spanning El Paso and Juárez. (ICE facilities in the area are also supposedly full.)
Advocates and attorneys question why the tent city is needed at all, considering the Trump administration and DHS have said for months that the number of migrants arriving at the border was skyrocketing. Following her visit to El Paso, Barragán drove an hour and a half north to Alamogordo, New Mexico to visit an empty Border Patrol station there. “Why can’t the migrants go there?” she said.
Additionally, Barragán and others want to know why it is taking so long for migrants to be processed and released.
Lourdes Ortiz, a member of El Paso’s Detained Migrant Solidarity Committee, said she has little faith that conditions will improve and questioned why asylum-seekers were being held in processing centers like the new tent city for so long.
“There’s no need for them to taking this much time to process people,” Ortiz said. “Even if the excuse is that there’s no capacity to house people to process, that to me is a result of refusing to acknowledge the change in the numbers of people who have been coming to the border.” Exacerbating the crisis?
Despite pulling agents from inland border checkpoints to process migrants at the border, CBP and Border Patrol have been unable to reduce the bottleneck. The Trump administration has requested $192 million from Congress to hire nearly 300 more officers to work the border.
“One of my concerns is they’re slowing down the process almost intentionally and they’re helping create the appearance of this backlog,” Barragán said. “I don’t know this for sure, and I have nothing to point to other than our history of not getting truthful information from this administration and these agencies.”
In fact, Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General did find evidence that officials were intentionally causing a bottleneck by “metering” asylum-seekers at ports of entry . Then came an executive order that required asylum-seekers to apply only at ports of entry or forfeit their asylum case. The government’s own lawyers admitted that the order would result in even more backups at ports, but that it was “ preferable to the status quo .” (The order has been put on hold by a judge.) DHS statistics suggest that metering continues , despite some of the highest numbers of border apprehensions in years.
“If you look at the patterns you’ll see apprehensions between ports of entries skyrocketing but the number of people taken in at ports stays roughly the same,” said Stephanie Leutert, Director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin. “Metering is absolutely still happening just as it has been for some time now.”
Limited efforts to bring more accountability to the asylum process got underway last week when Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-TX) introduced a bill that would require DHS to provide Congress with regular reports about staffing at ports of entry.
Despite all of the administration’s efforts to deter migrants from coming to the border to seek asylum—family separations, metering, the now-failed change to asylum law, and Trump’s promised wall—they have continued to arrive in greater numbers than ever before. It is possible, advocates say, that undesirable conditions in processing centers themselves could be seen as a deterrent by the administration. Still, no amount of deterrence can overcome the desperation of migrants fleeing crushing poverty and violence in their home countries, said Erika Andiola of RAICES Texas, a migrant advocacy organization.
“The fact is that none of this has worked.” said Andiola. “Conditions in Central America are terrible and people are willing to make the sacrifice to give their families a better future. It is up to us whether we welcome them in a humane way, or we torture them for no good reason.”
If conditions at facilities where migrants are being held are meant to be a deterrent, the growing tent city in El Paso could be a test case for how bad conditions could be. READ THIS LIST"

"Fire Destroys Notre Dame Cathedral; ‘Nothing Will Remain From the Frame,’ Spokesman Says",www.thedailybeast.com,Dana Kennedy Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau) Victoria.Albert@thedailybeast.com (Victoria Albert),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/paris-notre-dame-cathedral-is-on-fire,"04.15.19 2:39 PM ET Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt/AFP/Getty
PARIS—A sudden fire engulfed Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday, destroying centuries of history in minutes as the world looked on in helpless horror.
Flames pulled down the church’s towering spire in front of gasping onlookers nearby. The inferno burst through iconic stained-glass windows and charred the 800-year-old stone façade, apparently incinerating everything but the church’s skeleton. “Everything is burning,” a Notre Dame spokesperson put it bluntly.
French officials said the cathedral’s external stone structure will survive and that emergency responders salvaged its most precious art. The fire is now under control, according to officials, but firefighters are expected to work through the night.
Watching it all were thousands of people gathered along the banks of the Seine, barely moving or speaking as they watched a symbol of France burn to the ground. A large crowd gathered at the Place St. Michel and a group of about 20 people sang a Catholic hymn, evoking a funeral.
“She’s dead!” a disheveled-looked man in his fifties holding an open beer can yelled at the assembled crowd. “There is no use standing there looking, she is dead!”
Pascal Cambournac, a sales manager from Paris, jumped on his scooter and rushed to the river when he first heard the news. “This is the very heart of Paris and this is entire history of our country,” Cambournac, 53, said. “So many people came here to be in communion with this symbol of Christianity, of France. But whether you believe [in God] or not, this goes beyond faith,” he said.
Only three days ago, Rev. Yves Clochard Bossuet stopped at Notre Dame to say a prayer, as was his custom each time he passed the cathedral where he was ordained 20 years ago. “I always come. I love this church. It’s beautiful,” he said, overwhelmed by sadness. “I am so sorry. Notre Dame isn’t just a cathedral. It’s a symbol of all the history of France.”
Boussuet’s home parish is Notre-Dame de Foyers, which from its home in the working class 19th arrondissement lies about as far as you can get from its storied namesake in the heart of Paris.
“It’s not just a Parisian monument. It’s not just Christian. It’s not just French,” Bossuet said, as a group of people gathered around the priest hear him speak, many shaking their heads and overcome with emotion. “The entire world visits Notre Dame—every day.”
Lorenzo Fanti, a film student from Bologna, Italy, hadn’t had a chance to see Notre Dame during his eight months in Paris. “I think it’s finished now. There won’t be anything left. It’s very sad.”
Police shut two metro stations, roads, and bridges near the cathedral as firefighters battled the blaze. Even from a distance, there was an intense odor of acrid smoke coming from Notre Dame where jagged orange flames were still shooting skyward almost four hours after the fire began.
By 9 p.m. one of the iconic rectangular towers had also caught fire and the crowd let out an audible gasp. By then night had fallen, and an eerie orange glow could still be seen from the cathedral.
“My God, it’s still burning,” a man said.
The first reports of fire came shortly before 7 p.m., reportedly near the site of a multi-million dollar renovation. Paris prosecutors said they have launched an investigation into the fire which is tentatively being viewed as an accident. Flames were first seen near scaffolding close to the spire. About an hour after the fire started, the burning spire toppled over into the cathedral.
“Firemen are having a lot of trouble getting at the fire because of all the construction,” Emmanuel Gregoire, a spokesman for the Paris mayor’s office told French media. “They are doing their best but it’s not easy.”
The virtual destruction of France’s most historic building felt like a blow to the country itself, with President Emmanuel Macron postponing a national address to to Notre Dame. “Thinking of all Catholics and all French people. Like all my countrymen, I am so sad tonight to see a part of us burn,” he tweeted.
“It’s the worst image of Paris I’ve ever seen and I was here for the [2015] terrorist attacks,” Joanne Patton, an American and 21-year resident of Paris told The Daily Beast.
Maya Watson, 20, who born and raised in Paris, was watching the flames that engulfed the cathedral while speaking on the phone with The Daily Beast. “It’s apocalyptic. I don’t even have words,” she said.
She added: “The whole sky was bright orange and yellow. Fire trucks were everywhere. We were watching from our window and we saw the steeple fall. We saw it collapse. It’s so hard to put into words.”
French historian Camille Pascal sounded almost in tears when he recounted on French television what the iconic Catholic church means to France and the world.
“The cathedral of Notre Dame is impossible to separate from that of France and French national identity,” he said. “It means so much, it is fundamental to France and French values. It has endured. We have never seen it like this. Never.”
Later Monday, the first images from inside the church itself after the fire were released. The church’s walls were still intact, but the roof was burnt open and the remnants of the blaze looked like it they were still spreading smoke inside. Several fixtures, including a gold cross at the front of the church, looked to be intact.
Firefighters and municipal policeman were able to establish a “formidable human chain” to save many of the religious relics and art within the cathedral—including the Crown of Thorns and the tunic of Saint Louis—according to Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo . By late Monday and early Tuesday morning, Agence France-Presse reported that officials said the fire “""under control” and “partially extinguished.”
According to figures from Paris’ tourism office, Notre Dame is the city’s most popular monument with more than 12 million visitors a year, double the number of visitors to the Eiffel Tower.
The iconic cathedral was first commissioned in 1163 by King Louis VII and completed in 1345, nearly 200 years later. It is on the Île de la Cité island in the Seine and was one of the largest buildings of its time to use what would come to be defined as Medieval Gothic architecture.
Notre Dame was one of the first major cathedrals to utilize “flying buttresses,” an architectural shortcut used to support and balance pressure in ancient building which were put in place when the stone walls started to fissure about 80 years into construction. The flying buttresses also allowed sunlight through decorative stained glass windows before electricity. Napoleon, who was crowned inside the cathedral in 1804, saved it from being demolished.
The treasures of Notre Dame go beyond its architecture. It’s also home to one of the most famous organs in the world, with 8,000 pipes; a spectacular stained glass rose windows dating from the 13th century; a treasury that contains sacred objects including crowns, chalices and robes worn by Napoleon. Paris’ emergency services are now reportedly trying to save the artwork stored in the cathedral.
“So much of the culture and history and identity of France are embodied by Notre Dame,” historian Bernard Lecomte told French media. “We are looking at the heart of Paris burn.”
The cathedral has faced destruction before. During the French Revolution many different parts of the cathedral were destroyed, including all of the bells except for the Emmanuel bell, all 28 statues from the Gallery of Kings, and all of the portal statues save for the Virgin in the Cloister.
An 1801 Concordat by Napoleon legitimized the Roman Catholic Church in France and led to restorations. In 1844, King Lous Philippe I started a renovation that many say is still underway today. The famous stained glass windows that adorned the building in the 12th century were recreated and put in place in 1965. The Great Organ was restored in 1992.
Sonya Georgieva and her friend Annabelle had come to the river when the news broke and they too saw the steeple fall. “It’s not possible,” she said, her voice trembling as she texted photos to her parents, who were out of the country on vacation.
“There are no words,” said her friend, Annabelle, as the two women slipped into the crowd on their way home, the fire still raging behind them.

The Powerful LGBT Message of Pete Buttigieg and Lori Lightfoot Kissing Their Partners On Stage,www.thedailybeast.com,samantha.allen@thedailybeast.com (Samantha Allen),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/pete-and-chasten-buttigieg-lori-lightfoot-and-amy-eshleman-the-powerful-lgbt-message-of-a-hug-and-a-kiss,"Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty
The image of Pete Buttigieg hugging his husband Chasten is a powerful one.
Whether you align with his more moderate politics or not, whether you have caught the Buttigieg fever or you’re left wondering what all the fuss is about, there can at least be one point of agreement: If you care about LGBT people, you should be heartened to see a gay presidential contender embracing another man on a national stage. Displays of affection between people of the same sex are still acts of courage in 2019.
The Butti-hug—as I am dubbing it—marks the second time this month that I have been moved by an LGBT politician displaying public affection for a same-sex partner.
The first was when Lori Lightfoot , who will become Chicago’s first black female—and first lesbian —mayor, kissed her wife Amy Eshleman on the mouth at her victory party. As CNN’s John Blake noted , that act of PDA “once would have been considered obscene”—and in some quarters still would be.
In 2018, advocacy group GLAAD found that over a third of respondents to a large survey of non-LGBT Americans said they would be “very” or “somewhat” uncomfortable seeing a same-sex couple holding hands.
So imagine how that third feels when they see a same-sex couple locking lips like Lightfoot and Eshleman—or tenderly hugging each other, like Pete and Chasten Buttigieg did on Sunday. At best, publicity displaying affection for a same-sex partner makes you stick out like a sore thumb—at worst, you risk abuse.
That’s why I still scan my surroundings to see if anyone is watching whenever my wife kisses me in public—and why I sometimes don’t grab her hand when she reaches out for mine across the table at a restaurant. Often, the romance isn’t worth the anxiety.
In politics, where optics are now king, one might think that LGBT candidates would be reticent to kiss and hug their partners. After all, there are plenty of people who say they support LGBT people on paper but still get squicked out by same-sex affection when they see it happen in front of them. The temptation candidates with same-sex partners to keep it cordial in front of straight people must still be strong.
But just as many people were surprised to learn that almost 70 percent of Americans would be cool with a gay president , I have been surprised to see how casually the LGBT politicians of 2019 show their love for each other. Maybe people are starting to react more positively to such displays—or maybe LGBT politicians are just sick of hiding.
Either way, there is something quietly monumental about witnessing a simple but beautiful hug between two men, one of whom has a long-shot chance at becoming the president of a country that has long denied equal rights to its LGBT citizens.
And for a man who disclosed in a recent Victory Fund speech that, at age 25, “if you had shown me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife,” Buttigieg being so publicly and visibly affectionate toward his husband barely a decade later—and with so many eyes watching—must be a landmark in his personal journey as well.
Many in the LGBT community took similar stock of the brief moment, like author Garth Greenwell who wrote on Twitter, “It feels like a very big day for America to have a man embrace his husband as he declares his candidacy.”
Others, like reporter Benjamin Butterworth, noticed a picture of Pete and Chasten Buttigieg holding hands on the former’s campaign website, calling it a “message to every gay kid in America that they can be anything they want to be.”
That might seem like a lot to extrapolate from a single campaign image of two clasped hands —but consider that LGBT people have long edited our lives in public to avoid harassment and violence—and that we often still have to. Meanwhile, people with partners of the opposite sex don’t have to think twice about that peck on the cheek in the back of a cab or about holding hands in the movies.
Those displays of affection, for most people, can feel uncontrollable: Something simply wells up inside of you and you have to show your significant other how much you care.
But LGBT people have been conditioned a homophobic society to control them, to make an unconscious process conscious in order to avoid threatening the heterosexual people around us. And when we push back down feelings that well up naturally inside of us, we end up internalizing the idea that there is something wrong or shameful about same-sex love. We know we are gay, for example, but we don’t want to look gay. “It’s easy to imagine a time when certain right-wing media outlets would have gone into hyperdrive if a serious gay contender for president had embraced his partner so firmly on stage—but now it seems to barely register”
So to see high-profile LGBT public figures doing things in public that I am afraid of doing—and especially to see them doing it with so little backlash—gives me hope for our culture, setting mere politics aside.
As Blake noted for CNN, “nobody raised an eyebrow” when Lightfoot and Eshleman kissed each other. And it’s easy to imagine a time when certain right-wing media outlets would have gone into hyperdrive if a serious gay contender for president had embraced his partner so firmly on stage—but now it seems to barely register.
And yet surely politicians like Buttigieg and Lightfoot must be aware that they are part of the first “rainbow wave” of LGBT candidates to run in such an image-saturated social media environment, and that they will be among the first in the community whose public interactions with their spouses have the potential to spread widely.
I would bet money that Pete and Chasten Buttigieg had a huddle before the speech on Sunday to decide what they would do on stage—Hug? Kiss? Lift up each other’s hands like a boxer and a referee?—in a much higher-stakes version of the same conversation that many same-sex couples have before visiting family members or going out in public somewhere unfamiliar. (“Can we hold hands in front of your parents?” is not an uncommon question for a grown woman to ask her wife.)
It is significant, then, that candidates like Buttigieg and Lightfoot are making the public choices that they are when it comes to publicly acknowledging their partners. Whatever results of their candidacies or their tenures in office, the ripple effects of seemingly little things like hugs and kisses will be large indeed. READ THIS LIST "

"Ilhan Omar’s the Latest Muslim To Endure Trump’s Violent Words, and Hear From the People Inspired By Them",www.thedailybeast.com,Dean Obeidallah,04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/ilhan-omars-the-latest-muslim-to-endure-trumps-violent-words-and-hear-from-the-people-inspired-by-them,"Travel ‘UNGRATEFUL U.S. HATE’ Ilhan Omar’s the Latest Muslim to Endure Trump’s Violent Words, and Hear From the People Inspired by Them Combine Trump’s calls for violence with his demonization of Muslims—from declaring “Islam hates us” to calling for a total ban on Muslims entering America—and it’s a perfect storm. opinion Brendan Smialowski/Getty
As a legion of Democratic leaders thankfully denounced Donald Trump’s use of a video intercutting imagery of the 9/11 attack with a speech of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN, Senator Liz Warren put it perfectly with her tweet Saturday that Trump was, “inciting violence against a sitting Congresswoman—and an entire group of Americans based on their religion.”
Predictably, “since the President’s tweet Friday, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life—many directly referencing or replying to the President’s video,” Omar confirmed Sunday night. That didn’t stop Trump from encouraging more threats Monday, with a disgusting tweet accusing a lawmaker and a black Muslim woman of making “ungrateful U.S. HATE statements.”
It’s not speculation to say that Trump wants violence. He literally called for it during his 2016 campaign, when he told really supporters, ""If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you?” He doubled down then, too, when asked about the violence his supporters gave him: “The audience hit back. That’s what we need a little bit more of.” As president, he praised the Republican Congressman who’d body slamming a reporter during his campaign: “he’s my guy.”
Combine Trump’s calls for violence with his demonization of Muslims—from declaring “Islam hates us” to retweeting anti-Muslim videos to calling for a total ban on Muslims entering America—and it’s a perfect storm.
For real world proof of this, look what happened the week before Trump attacked Omar, when self-professed MAGA supporter Patrick W. Carlineo was arrested for calling her office and telling the staff person who answered the phone that he was planning to kill the Congresswoman “I’ll put a bullet in her fu**ing skull."" When authorities questioned him, Carlineo told them he “loved” Trump and viewed himself as a “patriot.”
He’s hardly from the first Trump lover talking, or more, about killing Muslims. In January, a white supremacist Trump fan plotted with three other young angry men to kill Muslim Americans living in Islamberg, New York, a community that is Muslim and primarily African American. As the police chief explained after the arrest, “If they had carried out this plot, which every indication is that they were going to, people would have died.”
That same month, attorneys representing three white supremacists on trial for plotting to kill Muslims living in Kansas in a primarily Somali community argued that Trump had in essence radicalized their clients with his inflammatory rhetoric. In fact, one of the defendants who was described as an “early and avid supporter” of Trump had been recorded by the FBI speaking of dipping bullets in pig’s blood before shooting the Muslims, parroting the debunked story Trump told on the campaign trail of American general John Pershing. These three white supremacist terrorists were recently sentenced to at least 25 years in prison.
In August of 2017, the Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minnesota—which serves the Somali Muslim community--was firebombed by three men. The police noted that the mastermind of the attack was Michael B. Hari, another self-professed Trump supporter and white supremacist. As the criminal complaint detailed , the message of the mosque bombing was to scare Muslims “out of the country” and make it clear: “hey, you’re not welcome here and get the f*ck out.”
And during the time of Trump there has been a spike in anti-Muslim hate crimes , randing from various mosques defaced with the word “Trump” to horrific attacks such as in January 2017 where a young white man who was reportedly obsessed with Trump walked into a mosque in Quebec and killed six Muslims praying. I have even been subject to death threats by self-professed Trump loving white supremacist for daring to criticize him in the media.
Of course, Trump isn’t giving his supporters detailed plans for committing terrorist attacks. He’s just using the bully pulpit to demonize Muslims, knowing that will bring some supporters to the doorstop of violence so his supporters can protest that he didn’t personally open it. Some difference.
No wonder a 2018 study did find a strong correlation between Trump’s tweets demonizing Muslims and anti-Muslim hate crimes that followed. As the U.K. researchers found, “Trump’s tweets themselves contribute to a climate that enables hate crimes.”
Given the mongering we are seeing now from Trump as he shifts into campaign mode for his reelection bid, I fear more Trump supporters will step through the door of violence terribly soon. READ THIS LIST"

Wisconsin Teen Killed Grandparents, Wanted to ‘Harm’ High School, Cops Say A high-school junior was arrested Sunday morning after police found him inside a home with two dead bodies. Authorities now allege the teen had plans to “harm” his school. 04.15.19 1:27 PM ET Grand Chute Police Department
Authorities believe a Wisconsin teen arrested Sunday morning in connection with the murder of his grandparents had a bigger plan: to “harm” his high school.
Neenah High School junior Alexander Kraus was arrested for the double murder after Grand Chute police officers performed a welfare check at a home located about two hours outside of Milwaukee. Inside, officers discovered the 17-year-old and two bodies, who police confirmed Monday were Dennis and Letha Kraus, his grandparents.
“The teenager was still at the scene when police arrived and was brought back to the station for questioning, he was cooperative,” Grand Chute police officer Travis Waas said Monday. “This was a terrible situation but he is being cooperative in this investigation.”
Waas also confirmed police recovered a “long gun” at the scene on Sunday, which authorities now believe was used in the crime.
Kraus was taken into custody just after noon on Sunday on two counts of first-degree intentional homicide and was booked into Outagamie County Jail. According to the Associated Press , the teen allegedly admitted to shooting his grandparents. He is expected to have an initial court appearance on Tuesday afternoon, Grand Chute police said.
Authorities also confirmed Monday that an early investigation yielded “substantial” information, which includes written documentation, that Kraus planned to “cause harm” at his high school, but declined to comment further.
Neenah High School remained open on Monday, citing police insistence that this was an “isolated incident.”
“Grand Chute police informed the Neenah Joint School District that the student arrested on two counts of first degree intentional homicide on Sunday also had a plan to cause harm at Neenah High School,” the district said in a Monday statement obtained by The Daily Beast. “Police have indicated that there is no danger to students and staff at the high school and the school day on Monday will proceed as normal.”"
Trump Lawyer Invokes Civil Rights Struggle to Keep Tax Returns Secret,www.thedailybeast.com,asawin.suebsaeng@thedailybeast.com (Asawin Suebsaeng),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-taxes-presidents-lawyer-invokes-black-civil-rights-leaders-to-keep-tax-returns-secret,"Trump Lawyer Invokes Civil Rights Struggle to Keep Tax Returns Secret The political battle over the president’s financial records continues to escalate. 04.15.19 1:11 PM ET Nicholas Kamm/Getty
In a letter to the Treasury Department on Monday, Donald Trump ’s attorney compared the pursuit of Democratic lawmakers gunning for the president’s long-hidden tax returns to the government targeting civil-rights leaders during the height of segregation.
“Congress’s motives do matter under the Constitution. Take the Constitution’s ban on intentional racial discrimination, for example. What if, during the height of the civil-rights movement, the Democrat-controlled House tried to intimidate African-American leaders by requesting their tax returns?” William Consovoy, who also reps the president in a separate emoluments case, said in the signed, three-page letter, which cc’s Trump’s Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin.
The letter, which is the latest in a robust attempt to keep Trump’s financial records concealed , paints Democratic lawmakers as being driven by impure, legally sketchy motivations, even as numerous legal scholars say Congress is within its rights to request and obtain such information.
“Surely,” Consovoy writes, “no one would agree with [Rep. Richard Neal (D-MA), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee] that the other branches could not ‘question or second guess the motivations’ of Congress….The same is true for the First Amendment’s ban on political retaliation.”
Jay Sekulow , another personal attorney of Trump’s who is overseeing the ongoing legal fight over the tax returns, told The Daily Beast on Monday afternoon, “We have once again reiterated our objections to the unconstitutional demand for the President’s tax returns.”
Consovoy’s letter, addressed to Treasury’s general counsel Brent McIntosh, was written in response to Chairman Neal reiterating his demand for years of Trump’s tax returns over the weekend. Neal issued a deadline to the IRS to produce those records by April 23. In his original request early this month, Neal had also asked for returns for the president’s trust and seven entities in the Trump business empire. He and other Democrats on the committee contend that Congress has the legal authority to review the documents under existing law.
Trump had promised multiple times on the campaign trail to make his tax returns public. But he never did, insisting that he was under audit and was advised, as such, to keep that information private—though no law exists that prevents someone under audit from releasing their tax returns. After winning election, he and his team have said the issue has been effectively adjudicated since voters did not punish him at the ballot box over not releasing the returns.
Democrats didn’t see it that way. And as they began to compile the case of the IRS to turn over the tax returns, the president assembled an outside legal team to fight them. The likely outcome appears, at this juncture, to be a vicious court battle. READ THIS LIST"
Notre Dame Fire: Treasures Now at Risk From the Flames,www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),04-15-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/notre-dame-fire-the-paris-treasures-now-at-risk-from-the-flames,"UP IN FLAMES Notre Dame Fire: The Treasures Inside the Cathedral The horrific fire at Notre Dame risked reducing a thousand years of history to ruin. Here are some of the most famous artworks and relics inside the great cathedral. 04.15.19 4:16 PM ET Alamy
As a fire raged at the great cathedral of Notre Dam e in Paris, France was mourning the destruction of one of the most prominent symbols of its national heritage—and Christians and art buffs the world over were lamenting the potential loss of a thousand years of history and faith. Fire officials have said many precious works of art were saved, but the structure was full of masterpieces, some of which were likely too large to be removed. High Altar
Among the treasures inside the famous Cathedral, where every day Parisians celebrate weddings, funerals and baptisms, is the high altar with a Nicolas Coustou sculpture of the Descent from the Cross from 1723. Treasure Room
Many of the religious relics, from communion chalices to vials of saintly blood, are kept in small Treasure Room that visitors could pay around $5 to see. Easter Trilogy
While they are not authenticated, and many Catholic churches around the world have similar relics, Notre Dame takes pride in its three Easter relics. Part of the cross on which Jesus was crucified, some nails that were used to affix him to the cross and part of the crown of thorns he wore are kept inside the Cathedral and used for Easter celebrations. The relics likely would have likely been out for Holy Week, which began on Palm Sunday, the day before the fire broke out. The only day visitors are allowed to see the crown of thorns is on Good Friday. Reliquary that Houses Crown of Thorns
The ornate reliquary commissioned by Napoleon that houses the crown of thorns is, in itself, a work of art but is only brought out on Fridays during Lent and on Good Friday. Gargoyles
The hundreds of grotesque gargoyles of Notre Dame may well survive the fire. They are there as both rain spouts to channel the water from the roof and as symbolism used by the Catholic Church to depict evil and keep evil spirits away with equally evil creations. They were added in the 13th century. Flying Buttresses
About 80 years into construction, builders noted fissures on the high stone walls and incorporated flying buttresses to balance the pressure and let light into the dark cathedral. Rose Window
The massive rose-shaped stained glass window was removed from the facade of Notre Dame during World War II when the French feared the Germans would target it. It was replaced in the 1960s. Grand Organ
The cathedral’s first organ was installed in 1403 by Friedrich Schambantz and replaced 300 years later by 1738 by François Thierry. It was renovated and parts of it replaced every 300 or so years until the present time. The latest restoration in the 1990s brought it to its current state, with more than 8,000 pipes. Twelve Apostle Statues Around Spire
During the first restoration of the cathedral, some 450 years after it was built, Eugene-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc sculpted the 12 apostles in copper looking out over the city of Paris circling the 300-foot spire. These statues were rarely seen up close, but were postcard staples and now lay at the bottom of the cathedral with the collapsed spire."
"Bernie Sanders Donated 2.26% to Charity, Tax Returns Show",www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-donated-226-to-charity-tax-returns-show,"Bernie Sanders Donated 2.26% to Charity, Tax Returns Show The most he gave to charity was $36,000 in 2017; the lowest was $1,900 in 2010. 04.15.19 7:00 PM ET Carlos Barria/Reuters
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) released a decade’s worth of tax returns on Monday, detailing millions in income—2.26 percent of which he donated to charity.
The documents show that over the years, Sanders’ income ranged from $205,617 to $1.1 million, while his charitable giving ranged from less than 1 percent to just over 4 percent depending on the year.
Last year, Sanders’ total income was $566, 421 and he donated $18,950 or 3.35 percent. In 2017, his income was $1.1 million and he gave away $36,300 or 3.15 percent. The year before that he also made more than $1 million but donated $10,600 or less than 1 percent.
His income peaked in 2016 and 2017 due to sales of his book, Our Revolution .
Based on IRS data, Sanders’ rate of giving was below the average for his income bracket in some years and or at or above in other years.
Sanders had resisted releasing his tax returns during his last run for office, sparking speculation as to what would be in the records that could prove political problematic.
The top line number shows that the Senator is among the millionaire class that he often bemoans. But the charitable giving also presents its own set of political vulnerabilities, which Sanders’ team appeared to acknowledge in a statement on its website explaining that the tax returns do not include proceeds from one of his books, The Speech , “which are donated directly to charity.”
“The Sanders do not take a tax deduction for those contributions, so they do not show up on their tax returns,” the statement read. “The Sanders’ donations have gone primarily to senior centers, low-income organizations, educational entities, and environmental and housing advocacy groups,” the statement said.
Reached for additional comment, Sanders’ campaign spokeswoman Arianna Jones noted that the senator’s policy platform calls for a greater government footprint in areas that are currently struggling to survive on charitable largesse.
“Over the last decade, Bernie and Jane Sanders have donated more than $100,000 to charity. Their overall charitable giving rates have been roughly in line with the average rates in America as a whole,” the statement read.
“In some years, they gave more than 3 or 4 percent of their income to charity. They have given to senior centers, low-income organizations, educational entities, and environmental and housing advocacy groups. They also believe that while voluntary charitable donations are commendable, they can never replace ongoing public investments in major social programs and services that improve people’s lives.” READ THIS LIST"
"Notre Dame Fire: Fox News’ Shep Smith, Neil Cavuto Shut Down Conspiracy Theories",www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-shep-smith-neil-cavuto-shut-down-notre-dame-fire-conspiracy-theories,"SHUT IT DOWN Fox News Anchors Shut Down Conspiracy Theories About Notre Dame Fire Neil Cavuto hung up on a guest mid-conversation while Shepard Smith openly scolded one who echoed baseless speculation about the horrific fire. Justin Baragona 04.15.19 6:07 PM ET
During two separate occasions on Monday afternoon, Fox News anchors Shepard Smith and Neil Cavuto had to dump out of interviews after their guests wildly speculated and parroted conspiracy theories that the blaze that suddenly destroyed much of the historic Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris was an intentionally malicious act.
While anchoring breaking-news coverage of the fire, Smith interviewed witness Philippe Karsenty, the deputy mayor of Neuilly-sur-Seine and a controversial right-wing media figure. Early in the call, Karsenty suggested that the Notre Dame blaze—which is currently being investigated as an accident—was a terrorist attack.
“It’s like a 9/11, a French 9/11,” Karsenty declared. “It’s a big shock. This church was there for more than 850 years. You need to know that for the past years, we’ve had churches desecrated each and every week all over France. Of course, you will hear the story of the politically—the political correctness, which will tell you it’s probably an accident.”
Smith interrupted, informing Karsenty, who was once convicted of defamation for accusing a French media outlet of staging a Palestinian boy’s death, that he would not allow such speculation on-air. Smith noted that if his guest had any concrete information, however, “we would love to hear it.”
Karsenty, meanwhile, continued to try to raise the possibility—without evidence—that the fire was intentional, prompting Smith to cut off the interview for good.
“No, sir, we’re not doing that here, not now, not on my watch,” Smith exclaimed. “The man on the phone with us has absolutely no information of any kind about the origin of this fire and neither do I.”
The Fox News anchor concluded: “The fire investigators will at some point come to a determination about what caused this and conspiracy theories about anything are worthless and in many cases counterproductive and injurious to society. And those who entertain them are not acting in the best interests of the people of this planet.”
Several hours later, Cavuto had a similar experience with Catholic League president Bill Donohue , who immediately raised the notion that this inferno was tied to other church burnings.
“Well, Neil, if it is an accident, it’s a monumental tragedy,” Donohoe said. “But forgive me for being suspicious.”
He added: “Just last month, a 17th-century church was set on fire in Paris. We have seen Tabernacles knocked down, crosses have been torn down, statues have been smashed.”
Cavuto went on to request that Donohue avoid bringing up his suspicions as no connections have been made by officials. The Catholic League leader, however, was unable to help himself, eventually asserting: “I’m sorry, when I find out that the Eucharist is being destroyed and excrement is being smeared on crosses, this is what’s going on now.”
The Fox News anchor interjected, letting Donohue that while he appreciates his time, “we cannot make conjectures about this.” Cavuto then dropped the call.
“I do want to let people know, and again we’re not trying to be rude to our guests here, there is so much we do not know about what happened here,” Cavuto concluded.
“We do know four hours ago, something started here. There are incidents that have been raised against the Catholic Church on popular tourist sites in and around Paris, no stranger to attacks, but another leap to take views like that when we don’t know.”"
Notre Dame Fire: The Agonizing Moment the Paris Firefighters Had to ‘Surround and Drown’ the Blaze,www.thedailybeast.com,michael.daly@thedailybeast.com (Michael Daly),04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/notre-dame-de-paris-fire-fdny-captain-grieves-with-paris-brethren,"HARD TO WATCH Notre Dame Fire: The Agonizing Moment the Paris Firefighters Had to ‘Surround and Drown’ the Blaze After 9/11, FDNY Captain Liam Flaherty and other firefighters visited Paris and gazed upon Notre Dame Cathedral. Watching it burn today made him feel for his counterparts. 04.15.19 8:23 PM ET Pierre Suu
Back in the aftermath of 9/11, FDNY Captain Liam Flaherty was among the New York City firefighters who visited Paris as guests of their French counterparts and he had stood in wonder inside Notre Dame Cathedral.
“Magical,” he later said.
But as the modern marvel Twitter brought images of the fire in the centuries-old structure on Monday, Flaherty knew that it was not so different from the numerous church fires he had fought in Brooklyn.
“Fires in churches, they’re very difficult fires once they get a hold on,” Flaherty said. “High ceilings, lot of tough little crawl spaces. Once the wood structure is involved... Once they start cooking, it’s very hard to root out. They are very challenging.”
He said of the fire in the cathedral, “The French firefighters were definitely up against it... It looks like by the time they got there it was already too advanced to make an impact.”
FDNY companies have often found themselves in the same situation. A church in Sheepshead Bay burned down twice in 11 years. A big church in Manhattan was gutted last year.
Flaherty himself has always been lucky enough to have arrived with his company in time to save the church in question. He has never experienced a moment in a burning house of worship when it became a losing battle and there was nothing to do but retreat and apply water from the outside.
“Surround and drown,” firefighters call it.
He tried to imagine how agonizing it must have been for the French firefighters when the church was Notre Dame. They had been forced just to stand on the sidewalk and watch it burn as a lone tower ladder applied water that turned some of the roiling smoke white but otherwise had little effect.
“I couldn’t even think,” Flaherty said. “That’s got to weigh very heavy on those guys. I don’t want to call it defeat, but that’s how I would take it. To watch it burn like that, like a candle.”
He added, “A firefighter who is worth his salt would take it personal. We take it to heart.”
He had a hard enough time watching Notre Dame burn on his Twitter feed from Brooklyn.
“It’s kind of an emotional thing,” he said. “I'm thankful I did get to see it in its glory.”
He and the other FDNY visitors had almost missed seeing Notre Dame when their hosts insisted on a prolonged lunch, complete with cheese and wine.
“Hey, brother, can we just grab a slice of pizza and keep moving?” Flaherty recalls asking one of the French firefighters.
“Liam, no, we sit and eat,” the French firefighter replied.
The end of the day was nearing when the final course was done, but Flaherty and his FDNY pals were still able to get to Notre Dame before closing time.
“Just to actually see it and to be able to reach out and touch it,” he said on Monday.
He returned with cause to be glad he had taken French in high school. He had become one more bit of a bond between France and America that dates back to our revolution and is on constant display in New York.
“Look at the harbor, Lady Liberty,” Flaherty later said.
Other bits of the bond came as French fighters continued to visit his Brooklyn firehouse each year on the anniversary of 9/11.
On Monday, he thought of his comrades in Paris as the flames consumed that magical cathedral. The aged wood he had seen inside was now fueling unstoppable destruction.
President Trump suggested on Twitter that the French could use airplanes to drop water on the fire. Liam took the same view as he had when his New York comrades used an aerial ladder to train a hose on a burning structure from above
“You’re hitting a roof that repels water,” Flaherty said,
Nothing was going to stop that fire. And be it Notre Dame or a Brooklyn church, a burning spire presented the same danger.
“The steeples are definitely a watch-out situation for a collapse hazard,” Flaherty said.
Sure enough, he saw the Notre Dame steeple go over. The flames eventually subsided, but the danger was not over.
Then began what is known as the overhaul phase, when firefighters venture in to search for pockets of fire amid walls that had largely lost their wooden buttressing.
”That’s a very dangerous part,” Flaherty said. “Lot of times that's when collapses occur.”
As night fell, casualties had been limited to one injured firefighter and there was hope the stone core for the cathedral had survived.
“Obviously it's a building and a building is not a life, but that building is a special building,” Flaherty said. “I guess you could call it God's house.” READ THIS LIST"

Seth Meyers Sounds Off on Sarah Huckabee Sanders for Calling Congress Dumb: ‘She’s Trolling’,www.thedailybeast.com,matt.wilstein@thedailybeast.com (Matt Wilstein),04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/seth-meyers-sounds-off-on-sarah-huckabee-sanders-for-calling-congress-dumb-shes-trolling,"‘NOT SMART ENOUGH’ Seth Meyers Sounds Off on Sarah Huckabee Sanders for Calling Congress Dumb: ‘She’s Trolling Us’ The ‘Late Night’ host aired a montage of all the ‘dumb shit the president has said and done’ to disprove the press secretary’s argument against releasing Trump’s tax returns. 'Late Night' host Seth Meyers sounds off on Sarah Huckabee Sanders for calling Congress dumb. NBC
When President Trump isn’t refusing to release his tax returns because of “a fake audit that definitely does not exist,” as Seth Meyers put it Monday night, he has started to suggest that they will simply be too complicated for members of Congress to comprehend.
Now, the Late Night host added, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders has taken that argument “one step further,” telling Fox News host Chris Wallace over the weekend that “this group of congressmen and women” are not “smart enough to look through the thousands of pages that I would assume that President Trump’s taxes will be.”
“OK, now this is what she wants. She’s trolling us,” Meyers said. “She wants us to get all mad and riled up and point out all the ways that Trump is actually the idiot, because that’s their only move, to just take whatever we say about Trump and turn it back on us. And we’re just too dignified for that, we will not stoop to her level, and I’m just kidding, here’s a bunch of dumb shit the president has said and done.”
After an extended montage of the president struggling to read his teleprompter and bragging about his “very, very large a-brain,” Meyers said, “Yeah, but we’re too stupid to understand the tax returns of someone who is clearly suffering from what’s known in the medical community as Degenerative Italian Stereotype Disease.”
Later in the segment, the host moved on to Trump’s recent threats to transport undocumented immigrants to “sanctuary cities,” calling it “one of the dumbest attempted trolls” he has ever heard.
“We’ve all been actively volunteering to take in more refugees,” he said, “and Trump is like, ‘Oh, I know, I’ll let them take in more refugees, that’ll show them!’”"
North Koreas Kim Jong Un Is Getting Ready to Test Missilesand Donald Trump,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-16-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-is-getting-ready-to-test-missiles-and-donald-trump,"NUCLEAR NUANCE Kim Jong Un’s Getting Ready to Test Missiles—and Trump The difference between a rocket launching a satellite and a missile with a warhead? Not so much. But North Korea has played with that distinction before and may do so again. 03.07.19 2:32 PM ET Saul Loeb/Getty
“I’m not in a rush. I don’t want to rush anybody,” President Donald Trump said as he got ready to meet North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in Hanoi. Complete verifiable irreversible denuclearization had been the goal. But for now, “I just don’t want testing,” Trump said. “As long as there’s no testing, we’re happy.”
Kim took that view to heart and had a message of his own for Trump: new tests might well be in the offing, but with a tricky nuance or two that could leave POTUS off balance.
Satellite imagery by two independent groups of analysts—one at the Center for Strategic and International Studies ’ Beyond Parallel program and the other at 38 North —shows that in the weeks leading up to the Kim-Trump summit in Hanoi, North Korea began putting back together at least two structures it had dismantled in 2018.
It’s unclear if there was a specific moment in U.S.-North Korea diplomacy that sparked Kim’s decision, but it appears to have occurred in early February after the first round of working-level talks between U.S. Special Representative for North Korea Stephen E. Biegun and his North Korean counterpart Kim Hyok Chol.
Both the structures are at a site known variously as Tongchang-ri, Sohae, or Yunsong. One structure that has been put back together is the static test stand where North Korea tested its most advanced liquid propellant engines in 2016 and 2017—the ones that found themselves powering its largest intercontinental-range ballistic missiles in July and November 2017.
Not far from that test stand is the Sohae Satellite Launch Facility—Pyongyang’s main satellite launch vehicle preparation and launch site since 2012. There, North Korea put back together a rail-mounted processing building. Basically, this is where North Korea would assemble a satellite launcher before it would be moved to the nearby gantry for a launch.
None of this is great news.
These facilities are ones that North Korea promised to dismantle under the September 19, 2018, inter-Korean Pyongyang Declaration in a process supposed to be under the observation of “experts.”
Kim Jong Un signed that document, and the reversal puts that agreement under stress.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in, already distressed by the negative outcome in Hanoi, will be more eager now than ever to help Washington agree to the terms for a deal that Pyongyang had offered in Hanoi—perhaps the point of this whole exercise.
But despite some reports that framed this activity as preparation for a “missile” launch, nothing could be further from the truth. North Korea has never launched a ballistic missile from Sohae; only satellite launch vehicles.
And despite U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s exhortations after Iran’s recent satellite launches that these tests can help develop technologies seen in ICBMs, with North Korea that concern is less apparent.
Pyongyang already has conducted three tests of two separate ICBM designs, but its satellite designs in the past, too, would have made lousy missiles—capable of carrying just a tiny payload.
North Korea’s satellite launches work quite a bit differently than its missile launches, so it’s unlikely Trump will be interrupted by a sudden “North Korea launches missile” push-alert on his phone during “executive time.”
Pyongyang would provide a notification of a launch window: a period of time in which a launch might take place. That would be accompanied by a “notice to airmen” outlining the coordinates where a satellite’s spent stages would drop.
In 2012, the Obama administration’s February 29 “Leap Day Agreement” with North Korea quickly fell apart after precisely such a North Korean notification of a plan to launch a satellite.
At the time, the U.S. and North Korean sides had left negotiations without an agreed statement—much like Hanoi—but each side noted its understanding of what had been agreed between them. It turned out that the U.S. side saw satellite launch vehicles as being covered under the missile-testing moratorium North Korea had agreed to. Pyongyang didn’t share that view and the whole thing collapsed.
Similarly, in Hanoi, Trump confirmed at a press conference that Kim had told him there’d be no missile or nuclear tests. But did the president ask his “friend” Kim if that meant space launches were also out of the question?
We’re not at the point yet where, based on the evidence, we ought to worry about an imminent North Korean satellite launch—or any other provocative activity. But the possibility shouldn’t be written off.
Toward the end of 2017, some evidence emerged that North Korea’s National Aerospace Development Administration (NADA) , its civilian space agency, had been working on new satellite launch vehicle designs. Additionally, while the September 2018 military parade in Pyongyang excluded all ballistic missiles as diplomacy was ongoing with South Korea and the United States, it did feature a float prominently underscoring space exploration. (The float did not show an actual satellite launch vehicle, however.)
North Korean state media’s positive coverage of the Hanoi summit suggests that for now Pyongyang is content to work toward a third summit at some point in the future, but it wants Washington to take its negotiating positions seriously in the interim.
Trump—always so concerned about testing and launches in North Korea—perhaps missed a similar signal last year.
In November 2018, Kim oversaw the test of what the country’s state media called an “ultramodern tactical weapon.” The weapon wasn’t shown and coverage of the event was modest in the United States. By all accounts, it did little to shift the administration’s thinking on what might happen if diplomacy were to hit a wall.
This time, the signs are more apparent. Cable news—the president’s intelligence source of choice—has been all over recent reports about the reconstitution of these facilities. President Trump has set aside concern for now, noting that he would be “very disappointed” if the reports were true. Given that all this was well underway before the meeting in Hanoi, it’s more likely than not that the president knew about this from his pre-summit briefing.
In the end, the new activity at Sohae serves as a warning to Trump and reminder of what stands to be lost if this process were to collapse. Kim Jong Un warned during his New Year’s Day address that Washington should not test his “patience” and demand North Korea’s unilateral disarmament—which is exactly what happened in Hanoi.
Consider the work at Sohae a way for Kim to convert that same warning from words to satellite images. Before a third summit, Trump might finally get what North Korea is trying to say."

Kim Jong Un has threatened to deliver a “telling blow” against the U.S. if it continues to impose sanctions on North Korea. The leader's statement was a return to the more aggressive language he used to use before he and Donald Trump befriended each other at their two meetings. In his first public comments stating North Korea’s position on the second U.S.-North Korea summit that collapsed without any agreement in February, Kim said he wants to create a self-supporting economy “so as to deal a telling blow to the hostile forces who go with bloodshot eyes miscalculating that sanctions can bring [North Korea] to its knees.” Shin Beom-chul from the Asian Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul interpreted the comments for Reuters, explaining: “He’s saying North Korea would take an independent course unless the U.S. offered to lift sanctions. You maintain sanctions, you’re a hostile force; if you ease sanctions, you’re not.” Kim Jong Un Threatens to Deliver ‘Blow’ to the United States Cheat Sheet ®"

Duncan Hunter. 04.16.19 12:09 AM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Reuters
Just weeks after Rep. Steve King (R-IA) appeared to publicly defend the idea of white supremacy, he received a four-figure donation by a political group run by a controversial one-time colleague, disgraced former Rep. Todd Akin (R-MO).
Akin’s leadership PAC, Takin Back America PAC, donated $2,000 to King’s campaign on Feb. 2, according to a newly filed financial disclosure statement. That was less than a month after King, in an interview with The New York Times , asked, “White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization—how did that language become offensive?”
King also got a $2,000 contribution from the campaign of former Rep. Lamar Smith, who retired in January, about a week before King’s interview with the Times .
King’s comments in that interview drew swift condemnation from both sides of the aisle, and House Republican leaders quickly stripped King of his committee assignments.
Akin himself is no stranger to controversial remarks. His 2012 Senate bid fizzled after he was caught on tape in a bizarre anti-abortion rant questioning whether women could be impregnated through rape.
Takin Back America PAC appears to have focused its support of late on some of the GOP’s most contentious elected officials and office-seekers. In September 2017, Akin’s leadership PAC donated $2,700 to the Senate campaign of former Alabama supreme court justice Roy Moore, who lost a special election to Democrat Doug Jones after several woman accused him of sexual misconduct.
Akin’s group also donated $2,500 in October 2018 to the campaign of Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA), who was reelected in spite of federal criminal charges against him for allegedly misusing campaign funds.
That donation was disclosed in a Federal Election Commission filing by Hunter’s campaign . Takin Back America, on the other hand, failed to mention it in its own filing with the FEC, despite a letter from the commission noting the apparent oversight.
Takin Back America PAC hasn’t reported any income since Akin himself donated $5,000 to the group in 2014. That money, plus some cash on hand from his time in office, has financed the few contributions it’s made since then."

Billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein may have stopped trumpeting his million-dollar donations to charities in light of accusations he molested dozens of underage girls . But he continues to quietly distribute his wealth—including to the nonprofits of Deepak Chopra, Elton John and a doctor linked to President Trump—through a shadowy private foundation called “Gratitude America, Ltd.,” The Daily Beast has learned.
Gratitude America, Ltd. was launched in 2012 to back “organizations around the world that seek to celebrate the United States of America and the American Ideals,” the group stated in its application for tax-exempt status. Those ideals, the nonprofit added, include “liberty, equality, democracy, individualism, unity, and diversity.” At the time, Epstein was three years out of jail, but disturbing allegations from his alleged victims, including one who claimed Epstein kept her as a “sex slave” for his famous friends , continued to hound him.
Epstein apparently needed some favorable news to change the narrative and embarked on a public relations crusade that depicted him as a renowned “science philanthropist,” rather than a convicted sex offender.
Not to be confused with GratitudeAmerica, Inc. , a Florida nonprofit for veterans, Epstein’s latest private foundation doesn’t appear to have a website or online presence. The only traces of the group lie in tax returns, a fundraising site for multiple sclerosis, and a book of abstracts from a 2017 academic conference in California.
In 2016 and 2017, Gratitude America Ltd. funded an all-girls school in Manhattan, a youth tennis program, cancer charities, Harvard’s famous theater troupe, posh New York arts societies at Lincoln Center and the Met, and a nonprofit linked to the wife of a former Harvard president who flew on Epstein’s private jet, dubbed the “Lolita Express” by the press.
Indeed, a review of tax returns reveals Epstein’s foundation donated at least $1.84 million to host of causes, including $15,000 to the Hewitt School, the elite private girls school on the Upper East Side; $30,000 to the O’Gorman Garden, a Harlem preschool; and $25,000 to the Junior Tennis Champions Center in College Park, Maryland.
Gratitude America’s biggest donations included a $375,000 payout to the International Peace Institute Inc., a New York think tank staffed by former United Nations officials and run by Norwegian diplomat Terje Rød-Larsen, and $225,000 to the Melanoma Research Alliance— both of which Epstein boasted of supporting financially in years past.
As The Daily Beast previously reported , Epstein once cultivated a web presence that portrayed a multi-hyphenate superhero: an “armistice activist” with the peace institute; one of the largest funders of scientists around the world” who helped to curb ivory poaching; and an “education activist” who delivered the Virgin Islands its first Head Start program .
Yet the 66-year-old financier’s philanthropy has failed to repair his reputation.
In the early Aughts, Epstein was known to rub elbows with the likes of Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Woody Allen and Kevin Spacey. His enigmatic rise from Dalton physics teacher to “international moneyman of mystery” who palled around with Prince Andrew and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was chronicled by the tabloids and New York magazine and Vanity Fair , which in 2003 reported, “Epstein is known about town as a man who loves women—lots of them, mostly young.”
“He’s reckless, and he’s gotten more so,” one former business associate told Vanity Fair of Epstein, who owns mansions in Palm Beach, Florida and Manhattan’s Upper East Side, along with a ranch in New Mexico. “Money does that to you. He’s breaking the oath he made to himself—that he would never do anything that would expose him in the media.”
Trump, too, once alluded to Epstein’s penchant for younger women. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York in 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it—Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”
Four years later, Epstein was arrested after this “social life” became the subject of a 13-month investigation by Palm Beach detectives.
Police say Epstein was sexually abusing girls as young as 13, many of them from poor families and broken homes. And, according to lawsuits filed by victims , Epstein loaned them out to his famous friends. Epstein also allegedly paid girls to recruit other teen victims, telling one recruiter, “The younger, the better.” (The money manager denied trafficking girls to his friends , saying in one court filing that he and his pals were “the subject of the most outlandish and offensive attacks, allegations, and plain inventions.”)
Authorities had enough evidence to send Epstein to prison for life. But under a suspiciously sweet plea deal inked with former U.S. Attorney and current Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, Epstein served only 13 months of an 18-month sentence inside a private wing of the county stockade, mostly on “work release” for 16 hours a day, six days a week.
Epstein pleaded guilty to two state charges: solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for prostitution. Now the Department of Justice is investigating that secret plea agreement, which a federal judge ruled violated the law , and whether Acosta and other prosecutors “committed professional misconduct.”
In the #MeToo era , calls for justice for Epstein’s alleged victims are growing louder. The Miami Herald and Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims Epstein forced her to have sex with Prince Andrew and Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz (allegations all three men vehemently deny), are fighting to unseal court records in a defamation lawsuit Giuffre filed against Epstein’s friend, Ghislaine Maxwell. Lawyers for Epstein’s alleged victims say records will show Epstein and Maxwell trafficked girls for the benefit of their high-flying friends. Maxwell, who has denied Giuffre’s claims, settled the case on the eve of trial in 2017.
Last week, the New York Post revealed that the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office had “graphic and detailed evidence” of Epstein’s assault of minor girls before it argued for leniency during a 2011 sex-offender registration hearing. At the time, a judge balked at the DA’s request to register Epstein as a “low risk” offender, saying, “I have to tell you, I’m a little overwhelmed because I have never seen the prosecutor’s office do anything like this.”
The constant trickle of bad press has resulted in some charities and political candidates keeping their distance from the perverted hedge-funder.
In 2006, former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said he’d distribute Epstein’s $50,000 campaign donation to charities throughout the state, while New York’s gubernatorial candidate Eliot Spitzer and attorney general hopeful Mark Green returned donations of $50,000 and $10,000, respectively, from the billionaire.
In 2015, nonprofits including Florida’s Ballet Palm Beach told Reuters they’d no longer accept Epstein’s money following Giuffre’s headline-grabbing allegations. “The further I can keep myself from anything like that the better,” the ballet’s founder said.
When Epstein tried donating to House Democrats last October, they quickly returned a $10,000 offering from the political pariah. One spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee told The Daily Beast, “Without second thought, the DCCC immediately refunded this unsolicited donation.”
Still, othershave quietly welcomed Epstein’s cash. His former charity, the C.O.U.Q. Foundation, donated $25,000 to Bill and Hillary Clinton’s charity, according to C.O.U.Q.’s 2006 tax return. The group is listed among past and present donors on the Clinton Foundation’s website .
Harvard also kept a $6.5-million check from Epstein to fund the university’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics, the Harvard Crimson reported in 2006.
In March of this year, The Daily Beast revealed Epstein had funded the nonprofit of a Russian model who advocates for women entrepreneurs.
And Harvard’s Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, which includes the university’s historic theater troupe, noted Epstein among its top donors in 2018, under the category “The Guardians of the Sphinx.” Dirty Money
In the year leading up to Gratitude America’s creation, Epstein’s connections with his prominent friends were under scrutiny. One of his alleged victims, Virginia Roberts, came forward to the Daily Mail in February 2011, to say she was only 15 when Epstein recruited her “to be a prostitute for him and his friends,” including Prince Andrew.
The same month, Epstein downplayed his Florida conviction, telling the New York Post , “I’m not a sexual predator, I’m an ‘offender’. It’s the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.” These comments followed a New York judge’s ruling that Epstein must register as a Level 3 sex offender , which meant he’s at “high risk of repeat offense and a threat to public safety exists.”
The shocking allegations didn’t stop Epstein, however, from issuing a flurry of press releases heralding his support of the sciences. In January 2012, “The Jeffrey Epstein Foundation” announced its sponsorship of a conference organized by MIT’s Marvin Minsky, under the headline, “Top Scientists Meet to Discuss Greatest Threats to the Earth.”
In March 2012, another announcement declared , “Science Philanthropist, Jeffrey Epstein, Convenes a Conference of Nobel Laureates to Define Gravity.” It was followed days later with a different bulletin : “Jeffrey Epstein, Science Philanthropist, Organizes a Global Doomsday Conference.”
One month later, Gratitude America Ltd. was formed in the Virgin Islands “to support the expression of gratitude for the ideals of America,” according to a tax-exempt application filed with the Internal Revenue Service. (Epstein has specified the Virgin Islands, where he owns a private isle, as his permanent address in annual sex-offender registrations.)
“Fundraising, if any, will take place via personal solicitation by the Members of the Board,” the group’s IRS application stated. “The initial contribution to the organization will be from the primary donor, Mr. Epstein.”
The group said it would “carry out its purpose through the direct funding of celebrations and other planned events, including symposiums, lectures, and galas, both within the United States and abroad planned by third parties and other non-profit organizations and governmental entities,” via “private donations from individuals.”
The disgraced financier’s group, however, didn’t list any revenues until 2015 or any contributions to charities until the 2016 and 2017 tax years.
Gratitude America Ltd. donated $150,000 each in 2017 to MIT and the Kuhn Foundation, run by writer Robert Lawrence Kuhn, who hosts a TV program called “Closer to Truth.” ( One biography on the Chopra Foundation’s site says Kuhn is “an international corporate strategist, investment banker and expert on China” and has “a doctorate in brain research.”)
Rather than listing Gratitude America Ltd. as a donor in its own 990 tax form in 2017, Kuhn recorded a $150,000 donation from the “Jeffrey Epstein Foundation” in care of “Richard Kahn KBRK Associates 57,” which appears to be a misspelling of Kahn’s business, HBRK. Kahn, who served on Epstein’s previous nonprofit ventures, is the president of Gratitude America, according to tax returns. He runs a corporation called HBRK Associates, Inc., New York state corporation filings show.
Epstein also funded a nonprofit that produces a TV show hosted by the wife of Larry Summers, a Harvard economist and Treasury secretary under former President Clinton.
In 2016, Gratitude America Ltd. shelled out $110,000 to Verse Video Education. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based nonprofit produces the PBS show Poetry in America , whose creator and host is Harvard professor Elisa New. Verse’s 2016 tax return named New as the group’s president but doesn’t include specific donors for its $1.38 million in total contributions.
New is married to Summers, Harvard University’s former president, who hobnobbed with Epstein in elite international relations groups and, like Bill Clinton, flew on Epstein’s private jet . Vanity Fair ’s 2003 feature mentions Epstein proudly displaying Summers’ letter of commitment to “the Epstein Program for Mathematical Biology and Evolutionary Dynamics” at Harvard. Epstein “says he was reluctant to have his name attached to the program, but Summers persuaded him,” the article said.
Summers came up again during an October 2015 deposition of Alan Dershowitz, who faced a now-settled defamation suit from two attorneys for Epstein’s victims. Dershowitz testified that Epstein’s former assistant, Sarah Kellen, worked “at the Harvard office” where Epstein held meetings with university brass including Summers.
Asked about the women in Epstein’s entourage, Dershowitz said they served coffee or took notes during academic meetings. “And these people were seen not only by me. They were seen by Larry Summers, they were seen by [genetics professor George] Church, they were seen by Marvin Minsky, they were seen by some of the most eminent academics and scholars in the world. There was no hint or suggestion of anything sexual or improper in the presence of these people.”
Epstein’s largesse has likewise extended to Harvard’s storied theater troupe. The Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770, one of Epstein’s past beneficiaries , received $50,000 from Gratitude America Ltd. in 2016. The Institute includes the Hasty Pudding Club, the country’s oldest social club, and Hasty Pudding Theatricals, the oldest theatrical organization in the U.S., and the Harvard Krokodiloes a capella group.
On The Hasty Pudding Institute’s website, Epstein’s name tops a roster of 2018 donors called “the Guardians of the Sphinx” for their donations of $50,000 or more, while Kahn’s business, HBRK Associates, is listed under a “sponsors” page for a $50,000-plus donation.
Meanwhile, Gratitude America Ltd. has also supported one of President Trump’s allies for two straight years, a review of tax returns shows.
The Bruce and Marsha Moskowitz Foundation received $100,000 in 2016 and $50,000 in 2017, Gratitude America Ltd.’s filings state. Bruce Moskowitz, a Palm Beach doctor, was revealed by ProPublica as one of President Trump's Mar-a-Lago cronies secretly influencing policies within the Department of Veterans Affairs.
But in its own 990 tax returns, Moskowitz’s nonprofit says it received money from Jeffrey Epstein, not Gratitude America.
Moskowitz—whose name was found in Epstein’s “little black book” alongside other doctors, under the category “medical”—listed two donations worth $50,000 in 2016 and 2017 from “Jeffrey Epstein/HBRK Assoc., Inc.”
It’s unclear why Gratitude America Ltd. registered a $100,000 donation in its tax filings for 2017, while Moskowitz recorded a donation for half that amount.
The Crohn’s Colitis Foundation of America, which Epstein has repeatedly funded since at least 2012 , received a total of $20,000 in 2016 and 2017.
Epstein also donated $10,000 in 2016 to the Women Global Cancer Initiative Inc., a nonprofit run by Next modeling agency founder Faith Kates. And he gave $10,000 to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai and $5,000 to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.
In 2017, Epstein gave $75,000 to the Cancer Research Wellness Institute, a California nonprofit created by a grandson of alternative-cancer treatment doctor Max Gerson, and $25,000 to Nautilus Think, a New York nonprofit that publishes a science magazine. Epstein additionally contributed $50,000 to the University of Arizona Foundation, and the Tucson research university listed Gratitude America Ltd. as a sponsor of its 2017 Science of Consciousness conference inside a book of abstracts.
He donated more money in 2017, with $15,000 going to “Friends of Elton John,” which appears to be the the Elton John AIDS Foundation, a charity Epstein announced funding for years before.
Gratitude America listed a donation of $50,000 to the Chopra Foundation; $60,000 to a group labeled as “Association Mind Education” in Rome, Italy; and $50,000 to the United Jewish Appeal (UJA) Federation of New York.
Epstein appears to have provided all of the funding for the International Police & Fire Chaplains Association in 2017 with a $50,000 donation. The group, based in Taylor, Michigan, reported gross receipts of $50,000 or less in 2017, and for the last several years, IRS records show.
The billionaire has supported a slew of New York nonprofits dedicated to the arts, too.
He gave $25,000 to the Film Society of Lincoln Center and $50,000 to MET Orchestra Musicians in 2017. He also donated $10,000 to a Brooklyn-based group, the Independent Filmmaker Project (Gratitude America appears to have miscalled them “Independent Feature Project” in its tax return but used IFP’s same address).
Gratitude America said it donated $50,000 to the New York Concert Artists Association in 2016, but the Association denied receiving any funds from Epstein or his foundation.
This year, Gratitude America Ltd. apparently donated to prominent litigator Stephen Susman’s fundraising page for Bike MS, a cycling event that raises money for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Epstein’s donation of $10,000 was the highest contribution on the website, next to another $10,000 from Susman’s wife, Ellen. (In 2017, Gratitude America noted a $5,000 donation to “Walk MS” in New Jersey that appears to be unrelated to Susman’s payout.)
Epstein and Susman were acquainted as early as 2010, when Epstein was on probation for his Florida sex crimes. Epstein traveled to New York several times to meet Susman, who, according to a letter in Epstein’s probation file, said their meetings were to discuss “potential claims against D.B. Zwirn,” a hedge fund that collapsed in 2008 and reportedly cost Epstein millions, according to the Palm Beach Post .
The Daily Beast left messages for all the schools and charities that Epstein’s group listed as beneficiaries. Some representatives said they didn’t know who operated Gratitude America Ltd. Others said they never received any such donations.
In an email, Howard Straus, president of the Cancer Research Wellness Institute, said his group has “NEVER received a donation of that magnitude from ANYONE.”
“I would know,” Straus continued. “We are perennially short of funds, and would love to be the recipient of such largesse, but not from sexual predators.”
Jennifer Park of New York Concert Artists said her group never received a donation from Gratitude America. “I am sorry but you have completely wrong information,” she said in an email, adding that her nonprofit was perhaps confused with another group.
After reviewing Gratitude America’s tax return, Park again stated her group shouldn’t be listed among the foundation’s recipients. “This is false, and whoever put our organization name must be responsible for any consequences,” Park added. “We have never received any donation from what you describe.”
Lisa Thomas, director of publicity for the Film Society of Lincoln Center, said Gratitude America’s $25,000 donation “was an anonymous gift for our 44th Chaplin Award Gala,” which honored actor Robert De Niro in May 2017.
“Mr. Epstein did not attend the event and has not been a patron of ours before or since,” Thomas said in an email.
Epstein’s $50,000 donation to the University of Arizona’s Center for Consciousness Studies in 2017 “was a one-time anonymous gift,” said Chris Sigurdson, the university’s vice president for communications.
John Steele, the publisher of Nautilus Think, told The Daily Beast he met Epstein in 2017 but he couldn’t recall under what circumstances. Steele said Epstein, who’s supported many scientific causes, liked his magazine.
“He made a one-time donation and that was the extent of it,” Steele said. The Same Players
Gratitude America, Ltd. is run by a trio of Epstein operatives who were also involved in his previous nonprofits. Indeed, they were the only officers of the following now-shuttered groups: the C.O.U.Q. Foundation; J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation; and Epstein Interests.
Darren K. Indyke—a longtime Epstein lawyer—is vice president of Gratitude America, per the 2017 tax return. In the years prior, he was treasurer.
Indyke was active in all three of Epstein’s former foundations, as a trustee of Epstein Interests and vice president of both the C.O.U.Q. Foundation (also known as the Florida Science Foundation) and J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation (which went by Enhanced Education).
It was Indyke whom New York authorities contacted in March 2015 for information on why one of Epstein’s charities, the Virgin Islands-based Jeffrey Epstein VI Foundation, should be exempt from state law, Reuters reported . Months later, Indyke was present for the deposition of Dershowitz, and is currently representing Lana Pozhidaeva , the model whose nonprofit Epstein bankrolled in 2017, in a trademark application for her company.
Erika Kellerhals, a Virgin Islands tax attorney, is Gratitude America's secretary and treasurer. She was also secretary, treasurer and trustee of the J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation, according to a 2015 registration statement filed with the New York State Attorney General’s Charities Bureau.
Kellerhals declined to comment when reached by The Daily Beast. Indyke and Kahn, reached by phone before hanging up, did not return further messages.
Epstein was president of Gratitude America, Ltd. from 2012 until 2015, when one of his associates, Richard D. Kahn, assumed the role. That year, Gratitude America, Ltd. recorded revenues for the first time, with a single $10 million donation from a mysterious company called BV70 LLC, according to a review of tax returns.
Once a licensed CPA and former treasurer of the C.O.U.Q. Foundation, Kahn wasn’t mentioned as a Gratitude America officer until 2015. The 2015 registration statement for Gratitude America lists Richard Kahn as president and Jeffrey Epstein as director.
In the document, the group said it wouldn’t solicit donations in Florida, New York and the Virgin Islands as initially planned.
The C.O.U.Q Foundation filed tax returns in New York as early as 1999 and disbanded in 2012, according to records filed with the state Charities Bureau.
Epstein Interests was active from 1992 to 2012, tax returns reveal, while the J. Epstein Virgin Islands Foundation appears to have been largely inactive. The latter was incorporated in 2000, but The Daily Beast could only find a tax return for 2002, despite the group filing a registration statement in New York for 2015.
Some of Epstein’s groups appeared to shuffle money to each other. In 2008, Epstein Interests noted a $100,000 grant to the C.O.U.Q. Foundation. During the 2009 tax year, C.O.U.Q. listed Epstein’s charity, “Enhanced Education,” as a contributor of $200,000.
Aside from participating in Epstein’s charities, the trio of nonprofit operatives also made donations to political candidates backed by Epstein, according to a review of state and federal election records.
On July 23, 2018, Epstein, Indyke and Kahn each donated $2,700—the federal limit for individual donations—to the primary campaign of Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett of the U.S. Virgin Islands. (Kellerhals and partners at her law firm have been frequent donors to Plaskett, records show.)
In an itemized receipt of one donation, Kahn listed his occupation as “attorney” and the name of his employer as “self.” But according to New York’s Office of Court Administration, the 46-year-old Kahn was never registered as a lawyer in the state.
The trio of Epstein, Indyke and Kahn also donated to Plaskett on Aug. 4, 2016, each for a total of $5,400 toward her general and primary campaigns. On July 25, 2016, Kellerhals sent Plaskett $2,200 for the primaries and $1,350 for the general election.
On July 3, 2014, both Kahn and Indyke donated $2,600 to Plaskett's primary campaign, while Kellerhals donated a total of $1,000 in July 2013 and January 2014.
Meanwhile, Indyke, listing his occupation as “attorney,” donated $5,200 to New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Gary King's campaign on June 17, 2014. Six days later, Kahn’s business, HBRK Associates Inc., gave King $5,200.
In the weeks that followed, businesses connected to Epstein’s St. Thomas, Virgin Islands address donated more than $35,000 to King’s campaign.
JEGE, LLC, which appears to own Epstein’s private jet , donated $5,200 in September 2014, while “JEGE, Inc” donated $5,000 in July 2014. Companies called “FT RealEstate,” “Laurel, Inc.,” and “Nautilus, Inc.” each contributed $5,000, and “Maple, Inc.” and “Neptune LLC” gave $5,200 apiece.
King told the Santa Fe New Mexican he would return the money, saying, “My campaign has had an ongoing rule that I would not accept any contributions directly from Mr. Epstein and upon further review, we have learned that he has an interest in the companies in question.”
Epstein had also donated to King’s 2006 run for attorney general. At the time, King said he would return a $15,000 donation from Epstein “to avoid any appearance of impropriety,” the Santa Fe New Mexican reported.
“I don’t think I’ve ever met him personally. He knows other members of my family better,” said King, whose father, former Gov. Bruce King, sold Epstein his 10,000-acre Zorro Ranch in Stanley, New Mexico.
Bruce King and former Gov. Bill Richardson were listed side by side in Epstein’s little black book , which was snatched by Epstein’s former house manager, Alfredo Rodriguez, who worked for the financier in 2004 and 2005.
The address book, obtained by Gawker in 2015 , contained the names of suspected Epstein victims, as well as boldfaced names including Courtney Love, David Blaine, Alec Baldwin and Donald, Ivana and Ivanka Trump.
Records show that in 2007, a year after Richardson returned Epstein's money for his gubernatorial run, Kahn and his wife each donated $2,300 to Richardson’s presidential campaign. Indyke and his wife each donated $2,300 days later. "
