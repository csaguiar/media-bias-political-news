Brand-name prescription drugs were, on average, more than 18 times as expensive as generics in 2017, according to a new report from the AARP Public Policy Institute.
The report finds that retail prices for 390 widely used generics fell by an average of 9.3 percent from 2016 to 2017. The average annual cost for a generic drug taken on a regular basis was $365, down dramatically from $751 in 2013. Brand-name drugs, meanwhile, saw retail prices rise by an average of 8.4 percent in 2017, based on 267 medications widely used by older adults. The average annual price for those drugs was $6,798.
The report also says that, of the 390 generic drugs it looked at, 297 went down in cost in 2017, while 90 saw a price increase. Six widely used generics had price increases of more than 70 percent, including an antidepressant called sertraline that rose in price by nearly 200 percent.

Pelosi Says She’s ‘Agnostic’ on Whether Medicare for All Is Better Than Obamacare,www.thefiscaltimes.com,yrosenberg,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2019/04/05/Pelosi-Says-She-s-Agnostic-Whether-Medicare-All-Better-Obamacare,"Pelosi Says She’s ‘Agnostic’ on Whether Medicare for All Is Better Than Obamacare Reuters April 5, 2019 MOST POPULAR
In an interview with The Washington Post , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi questioned whether Medicare for All would be better than the Affordable Care Act and suggested that Democrats should focus on building on the Obama health care reform.
“I’m agnostic. Show me how you think you can get there,” Pelosi told the Post. “We all share the value of health care for all Americans — quality, affordable health care for all Americans. What is the path to that? I think it’s the Affordable Care Act, and if that leads to Medicare-for-all, that may be the path.”
Pelosi, who was instrumental in passing the Affordable Care Act in 2010, also said she thinks that when most people say they want Medicare for All, they really mean health care for all and that many Americans like their employer-based coverage and the better benefits that the ACA delivered.
“So we’ll have hearings, again, let’s see what it is. Right now it’s a $30 trillion price tag. What do people get for that in terms of care, and what do they pay for that along the way?” Pelosi said of the Medicare for All proposals.
“Medicare is not as good a health benefit as the Affordable Care Act,” she added. “So, if you are to do Medicare for All you have to improve the package — and when you improve the package, you have to have more money.”
The Post also quoted Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a liberal House leader and ally of Medicare-for-All champion Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), saying that Pelosi is “just being pragmatic” and is “absolutely right” when she says Medicare needs to be improved to include things like dental and vision insurance and long-term care.
“I believe we will meet the high bar that Nancy Pelosi has set,” he said. “We can make the case.” TOP READS FROM THE FISCAL TIMES"
How Soaring Insulin Prices Are Costing Medicare Billions,www.thefiscaltimes.com,yrosenberg,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2019/04/05/How-Soaring-Insulin-Prices-Are-Costing-Medicare-Billions,"How Soaring Insulin Prices Are Costing Medicare Billions Lucy Nicholson/Reuters April 5, 2019 MOST POPULAR
Insulin prices have sparked outrage in recent months, with Congress holding hearings on the issue and launching bipartisan investigations into why the cost of the hormone used to treat diabetes — discovered nearly a century ago — has soared over the past two decades.
The House Energy and Commerce oversight subcommittee held a hearing on insulin prices this week and will hold another next week . Executives from the three companies that dominate the global insulin market — Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi — are expected to testify at the upcoming hearing.
“We want to know why the cost of this life-saving drug has skyrocketed in recent years, and why they’re not offering more lower-cost alternatives to patients,” Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO), who chairs the subcommittee, said this week.
Amid the increased pressure from lawmakers, Eli Lilly last month said it would begin selling a generic version of its insulin Humalog at half the retail price . And health insurer Cigna’s Express Scripts pharmacy benefit manager announced this week that it would cap the out-of-pocket copay for patients on insulin at $25 a month. ""What we're hoping is that we're going to see more diabetics taking more insulin, [fewer] complications for those patients, and hopefully lower health care costs,"" Steve Miller, Cigna's chief clinical officer, told NPR .
Why it matters: The human toll of rising insulin prices — and diabetics rationing the drug as a result, sometimes with deadly consequences — makes this a crisis that desperately needs to be addressed. But there’s a fiscal element to the story, too: Total Medicare Part D spending on insulin grew from $1.4 billion in 2007 to $13.3 billion in 2017, an 840% increase, according to a report published this week by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Is the Tax System Fair? Democrats and Republicans Disagree More They Have in Decades,www.thefiscaltimes.com,mrainey,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2019/04/05/Tax-System-Fair-Democrats-and-Republicans-Disagree-More-They-Have-Decades,"Is the Tax System Fair? Democrats and Republicans Disagree More They Have in Decades iStockphoto/ James Group Studios, Inc. By Michael Rainey April 5, 2019 MOST POPULAR
Partisan differences over the perceived fairness of the tax code have become far more pronounced since the passage of the 2017 tax law, which was signed into law by President Trump with no support from Democratic lawmakers.
While public opinions about taxes have changed only modestly overall since 2017, a new analysis from Pew Research finds that Republicans and Democrats now have sharply divided views on the issue.
“Two years ago, Republicans and Democrats had similar views of the fairness of the tax system,” Pew said. “Today, 64% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the present tax system is very or moderately fair; just half as many Democrats and Democratic leaners (32%) view the tax system as fair.”
The divergence is most pronounced at higher income levels. More than two-thirds (68%) of Republicans with incomes over $75,000 now say the tax system is very or moderately fair — a big jump from 37% in 2017. Only 21% of Democrats with incomes over $75,000 agree, down from 40% two years ago.
The partisan divide can also be seen in questions about the fairness of the U.S. economy. “Currently, 63% of Americans say the ‘economic system unfairly favors powerful interests,’ while just 34% say it is ‘generally fair to most Americans.’ About twice as many Democrats (81%) as Republicans (40%) say the country’s economic system is unfair,” Pew said.

Hedge Fund Billionaire Calls for Reform of American Capitalism,www.thefiscaltimes.com,mrainey,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2019/04/05/Hedge-Fund-Billionaire-Calls-Reform-American-Capitalism,"Hedge Fund Billionaire Calls for Reform of American Capitalism Brian Snyder April 5, 2019 MOST POPULAR
Billionaire Ray Dalio, the founder of hedge fund firm Bridgewater Associates, said Thursday that capitalism isn’t working for most Americans and warned that the growing gap between the haves and have-nots is producing heightened conflict that could lead to revolutionary violence.
Dalio also critiqued both fiscal conservatives and spend-and-borrow liberals, saying that both sides fail to focus on the return on investments that the country needs.
Here are a few quotes from Dalio’s lengthy analysis of the American political and economic system, which he published as a blog post on LinkedIn :
* “I believe that all good things taken to an extreme become self-destructive and everything must evolve or die, and that these principles now apply to capitalism. … the system is producing self-reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have-nots, which are leading to harmful excesses at the top and harmful deprivations at the bottom.”
* “We are now seeing conflicts between populists of the left and populists of the right increasing around the world in much the same way as they did in the 1930s when the income and wealth gaps were comparably large.”
* “It doesn’t take a genius to know that when a system is producing outcomes that are so inconsistent with its goals, it needs to be reformed.”
* ""I think that most capitalists don’t know how to divide the economic pie well and most socialists don’t know how to grow it well, yet we are now at a juncture in which either a) people of different ideological inclinations will work together to skillfully re-engineer the system so that the pie is both divided and grown well or b) we will have great conflict and some form of revolution that will hurt most everyone and will shrink the pie.""
* “Policy makers pay too much attention to budgets relative to returns on investments. For example, not spending money on educating our children well might be good from a budget perspective, but it’s really stupid from an investment perspective. Looking at the funding through a budget lens doesn’t lead one to take into consideration the all-in economic picture—e.g., it doesn’t take into consideration the all-in costs to the society of having poorly educated people. While focusing on the budget is what fiscal conservatives typically do, fiscal liberals have typically shown themselves to borrow too much money and fail to spend it wisely to produce the economic returns that are required to service the debts they have taken on, so they often end up with debt crises. The budget hawk conservatives and the pro-spending/borrowing liberals have trouble focusing on, working together for, and achieving good ‘double bottom line’ return on investments (i.e., investments that produce both good social returns and good economic returns).” TOP READS FROM THE FISCAL TIMES"

What a Decades-Old Grand Jury Probe Just Revealed About the Mueller Report Magazine,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/04/05/grand-jury-probe-mueller-report-226577,"On Friday, a federal court decision about a decades-old grand jury investigation clarified one of the biggest fights in Washington: how the complete special counsel report on Russian election meddling can get to Congress. A divided panel of the D.C. federal appeals court in McKeever v. Barr denied a scholar’s request for material from a 1957 grand jury investigation into the disappearance of a Columbia University professor and political activist, Jesús Galíndez. While not addressing the Mueller investigation directly, McKeever may have foreclosed public access to secret grand jury material in the report, for now. But Congress still has a path forward in the ensuing fight to obtain a complete, unredacted version.
Story Continued Below
At the crux of the issue is the age-old tradition of grand jury secrecy. That tradition, which has been codified into a federal rule known as Rule 6(e) , prohibits government attorneys from disclosing any information obtained through the D.C.-based grand jury that Special Counsel Robert Mueller used in his investigation.
The question in McKeever was whether a court has “inherent authority” to release grand jury material under special circumstances. Breaking with established law in other federal courts of appeal, two out of three judges on the panel decided that no such inherent authority exists. The court’s authority to release grand jury information, it held, is limited to specific exceptions listed in Rule 6(e) — including one that allows the court to release grand jury information “preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.”
The “judicial proceedings” exception came into play the two times in the 20th century a sitting president was subject to independent investigation. The first time was in the 1970s, when Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski sent his “Road Map” of President Richard Nixon’s involvement in Watergate to Congress. We at Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan, nonprofit dedicated to preserving and strengthening democratic institutions, helped bring the Road Map into the world last October.
The second time was in the 1990s, when Independent Counsel Ken Starr delivered his report on President Bill Clinton’s misconduct to Congress.
It could come into play again soon, if the House Judiciary Committee petitions Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the D.C. federal court for access to Mueller’s grand jury material. (Judge Howell has been presiding over all legal matters arising from Mueller’s grand jury.)
In 1974, Jaworski’s team argued that the disclosure was permissible under Rule 6(e) because the Judiciary Committee’s impeachment inquiry was equivalent to a judicial proceeding. Chief Judge John Sirica, Howell’s predecessor, allowed the disclosure, but his decision left some uncertainty as to whether he relied on the court’s inherent disclosure authority or the judicial proceedings exception. The D.C. federal appeals court affirmed Judge Sirica’s opinion in Haldeman v. Sirica .

The court’s McKeever decision on Friday clarified that in Haldeman the Watergate Road Map was released to the House Judiciary Committee pursuant to the judicial proceedings exception, not the court’s inherent authority.
Some might argue that for Congress to access grand jury material under the judicial proceedings exception, it must have a formal impeachment inquiry underway. But that argument overlooks another key historical precedent: the Starr Report. Starr got judicial approval, using the judicial proceedings exception, to send his report to the House Judiciary Committee before the committee had done any investigation of its own into Clinton’s alleged wrongdoing. In fact, it was the Starr Report itself that eventually prompted impeachment proceedings for Clinton.
Even more telling, the judicial proceedings exception allowed the final report on the Iran-Contra investigation to reach the public in 1994. Obviously, the court of public opinion is not a “judicial proceeding,” but the D.C. federal appeals court didn’t let that stand in the way of the enormous public interest in the investigation’s findings. The court concluded that its own adjudication of whether to release the report constituted the “judicial proceeding” required by the rule.
Here, the House Judiciary Committee is exercising its constitutional authority to investigate allegations of the Trump administration’s obstruction of justice and other abuses of power. It launched its investigation on March 4, and authorized a subpoena for the full Mueller report on April 3. The full House of Representatives, moreover, has passed a resolution 420-0 calling on the Justice Department to make Mueller’s complete report available to Congress. The constitutional imperatives are clear.
Attorney General William Barr should support transparency and join Chairman Nadler in seeking an order from Chief Judge Howell granting Congress access to grand jury material in the Mueller report. But even if Nadler is forced to petition the court without the DOJ’s backing, Howell will have the discretion to craft an order allowing disclosure to Congress with whatever limitations on, or allowance for, further disclosure she deems appropriate.
Howell’s analysis will require a balancing of Congress’s need for the information against the justifications for grand jury secrecy. What could be weightier than Congress’s constitutional obligation to determine whether the president abused his power and obstructed the special counsel’s investigation of Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election, and whether legislation is needed to prevent such acts in the future?
Like her predecessor facing “a matter of the most critical moment to the nation” in 1974, Howell should find it “difficult to conceive of a more compelling need than that of this country for an unswervingly fair inquiry based on all the pertinent information.” The health of our democracy should, as it has in the past, tilt the scales in favor of disclosure to Congress."

What a Decades-Old Grand Jury Probe Just Revealed About the Mueller Report,seriouslypolitics.com,Deana K.

On Friday, a federal court decision about a decades-old grand jury investigation clarified one of the biggest fights in Washington: how the complete special counsel report on Russian election meddling can get to Congress.
A divided panel of the D.C. federal appeals court in McKeever v. Barr denied a scholar’s request for material from a 1957 grand jury investigation into the disappearance of a Columbia University professor and political activist, Jesús Galíndez. While not addressing the Mueller investigation directly, McKeever may have foreclosed public access to secret grand jury material in the report, for now. But Congress still has a path forward in the ensuing fight to obtain a complete, unredacted version.
At the crux of the issue is the age-old tradition of grand jury secrecy. That tradition, which has been codified into a federal rule known as Rule 6(e) , prohibits government attorneys from disclosing any information obtained the D.C.-based grand jury that Special Counsel Robert Mueller used in his investigation.
The question in McKeever was whether a court has “inherent authority” to release grand jury material under special circumstances. Breaking with established law in other federal courts of appeal, two out of three judges on the panel decided that no such inherent authority exists. The court’s authority to release grand jury information, it held, is limited to specific exceptions listed in Rule 6(e) — including one that allows the court to release grand jury information “preliminarily to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.”
The “judicial proceedings” exception came into play the two times in the 20th century a sitting president was subject to independent investigation. The first time was in the 1970s, when Watergate Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski sent his “Road Map” of President Richard Nixon’s involvement in Watergate to Congress. We at Protect Democracy, a nonpartisan, nonprofit dedicated to preserving and strengthening democratic institutions, helped bring the Road Map into the world last October.
The second time was in the 1990s, when Independent Counsel Ken Starr delivered his report on President Bill Clinton’s misconduct to Congress.
It could come into play again soon, if the House Judiciary Committee petitions Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the D.C. federal court for access to Mueller’s grand jury material. (Judge Howell has been presiding over all legal matters arising from Mueller’s grand jury.)
In 1974, Jaworski’s team argued that the disclosure was permissible under Rule 6(e) because the Judiciary Committee’s impeachment inquiry was equivalent to a judicial proceeding. Chief Judge John Sirica, Howell’s predecessor, allowed the disclosure, but his decision left some uncertainty as to whether he relied on the court’s inherent disclosure authority or the judicial proceedings exception. The D.C. federal appeals court affirmed Judge Sirica’s opinion in Haldeman v. Sirica .
The court’s McKeever decision on Friday clarified that in Haldeman the Watergate Road Map was released to the House Judiciary Committee pursuant to the judicial proceedings exception, not the court’s inherent authority.
Some might argue that for Congress to access grand jury material under the judicial proceedings exception, it must have a formal impeachment inquiry underway. But that argument overlooks another key historical precedent: the Starr Report. Starr got judicial approval, using the judicial proceedings exception, to send his report to the House Judiciary Committee before the committee had done any investigation of its own into Clinton’s alleged wrongdoing. In fact, it was the Starr Report itself that eventually prompted impeachment proceedings for Clinton.
Even more telling, the judicial proceedings exception allowed the final report on the Iran-Contra investigation to reach the public in 1994. Obviously, the court of public opinion is not a “judicial proceeding,” but the D.C. federal appeals court didn’t let that stand in the way of the enormous public interest in the investigation’s findings. The court concluded that its own adjudication of whether to release the report constituted the “judicial proceeding” required by the rule.
Here, the House Judiciary Committee is exercising its constitutional authority to investigate allegations of the Trump administration’s obstruction of justice and other abuses of power. It launched its investigation on March 4, and authorized a subpoena for the full Mueller report on April 3. The full House of Representatives, moreover, has passed a resolution 420-0 calling on the Justice Department to make Mueller’s complete report available to Congress. The constitutional imperatives are clear.
Attorney General William Barr should support transparency and join Chairman Nadler in seeking an order from Chief Judge Howell granting Congress access to grand jury material in the Mueller report. But even if Nadler is forced to petition the court without the DOJ’s backing, Howell will have the discretion to craft an order allowing disclosure to Congress with whatever limitations on, or allowance for, further disclosure she deems appropriate.
Howell’s analysis will require a balancing of Congress’s need for the information against the justifications for grand jury secrecy. What could be weightier than Congress’s constitutional obligation to determine whether the president abused his power and obstructed the special counsel’s investigation of Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election, and whether legislation is needed to prevent such acts in the future?
Like her predecessor facing “a matter of the most critical moment to the nation” in 1974, Howell should find it “difficult to conceive of a more compelling need than that of this country for an unswervingly fair inquiry based on all the pertinent information.” The health of our democracy should, as it has in the past, tilt the scales in favor of disclosure to Congress.

Fisher-Price Rock ’n Play Sleeper: Feds Issue Warning About Baby Deaths,www.thedailybeast.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/fisher-price-rock-n-play-sleeper-feds-issue-warning-about-baby-deaths,"22 minutes ago 10 Babies Have Died in Fisher-Price Rock ’n Play Sleeper
Federal regulators warned parents on Friday that a popular infant seat can be deadly. At least 10 infants have died since 2015 when they rolled from their back to their stomach or side while unrestrained in the Fisher-Price Rock ‘n Play, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission . As a result, the agency is recommending that the sleeper not be used as soon as a baby can roll over or after 3 months of age. Parents have already been told not to use the seat without the three-point harness, but the CPSC said the deaths show that not everyone is heeding the advice. Fisher-Price joined in the warning but noted that the Rock ‘n Play meets safety standards. "

Democrats face minefield if they get Trump’s tax returns,seriouslypolitics.com,Brian Faler,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/05/15/28/38/democrats-face-minefield-if-they-get-trumps-tax-returns/,"This post is by Brian Faler from Politics, Policy, Political News Top Stories

Democrats’ bid to seize President Donald Trump’s tax returns will come with some serious legal risk to themselves.
Lawmakers are concerned that, even if they get the president’s filings, his returns will still be protected by strict confidentiality laws — it is a felony, punishable by up to five years, to improperly disclose private tax information.
There are ways around the dilemma, and Democrats intend to make at least some information about Trump’s taxes public — that is much of the point of their entire effort. But that probably won’t happen right away. Lawmakers say they will likely take some time to examine his filings behind closed doors before making anything publicly available.
That means there will be a period, possibly lasting months, when Democrats will have finally seen the president’s long-hidden taxes — and they will be inundated with questions about what’s in them — but they won’t be to talk about them. If they let anything slip, Republicans will surely jump, demanding an investigation by the Justice Department.
“We’re going to have to be circumspect in terms of the way we handle this,” said Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.), a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. “That’s the responsibility of every member.”
It’s a risk that’s been barely acknowledged in the battle over Trump’s returns, though it is one reason why Democrats have taken so long to formally request them.
Of course, Democrats have to get the returns first, and they’re a long way from that. Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) demanded this week that the administration turn over six years’ worth of Trump’s individual and business tax returns, giving them a deadline of April 10.
The administration has indicated it plans to fight the demand in court.
""From what I understand, the law is 100 percent on my side,"" Trump said Friday.
That Democrats may have to keep Trump’s taxes secret for a time has been largely overlooked in the debate over the returns, probably because of a misconception of how the law Democrats are tapping works.
They are relying on a statute that allows the heads of Congress’s tax committees to examine anyone’s confidential taxes. Advocates of the effort emphasize that the law says the Treasury Secretary “shall” hand over any requested returns.
But that’s just the question of whether the administration must give up the documents — even if Trump’s returns are handed over, they will still be protected by privacy laws. Making them public will be a separate matter.
Experts say lawmakers can do that by essentially having the Ways and Means Committee vote in a closed session to release them.
Though Democrats haven’t worked out exactly how they’ll proceed, there’s likely to be some time between when they receive the returns and when they consider divulging them.
There seems to be a “false presumption” that lawmakers will simply release the returns the moment they get them, said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas), another Democratic tax writer who has helped lead the push to get the president’s returns.
“There is a need for a thorough review of them to see if there’s anything in them that justifies releasing them and that’s something that could take awhile to do because they are, according to the president, very complex,” he said. “I hope it’s not months, but I don’t think it will be days.”
“Until such time as that review is complete and a vote is taken to forward them to congress and the public, they will be protected.”
Democrats may want to redact certain information from the returns. Trump’s filings could reveal private information about other people he’s in business with who are of little interest to lawmakers, for example.
Tax veterans say the period between when Democrats get Trump’s returns and if and when they release something will be stressful for lawmakers, given the criminal penalties for even inadvertent disclosure. Democrats won’t be able to discuss even basic things about Trump’s returns, like how much he paid in taxes, what he reported earning or if he gave to charity.
“When we’ve had members in these situations before, we frequently have members say, ‘I don’t know if I want you to tell me or not, because I don’t know if I can trust myself not to say anything,’” said Rick Grafmeyer, a former deputy head of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation and expert on taxpayer privacy laws.
Tax writers typically use their power to examine private tax returns to help inform the policymaking process. If they are trying to write legislation outlawing a corporate tax shelter, for example, they might look at an individual company’s tax documents to better understand how the dodge works.
Some say Democrats’ situation will be tougher than what most lawmakers deal with when it comes to taxpayer secrecy rules. Everyone will likely know Democrats have Trump’s returns and lawmakers would be besieged with questions from reporters, constituents and other lawmakers. That’s a lot different than when lawmakers quietly examine an oil company’s tax return.
Also, the Ways and Means Committee is loaded with new members who aren’t steeped in the intricacies of the tax secrecy rules — the closest analogue many say is when lawmakers received classified intelligence briefings.
“I’m sure that there will be briefings about all the ethical issues that surround this,” said Larson.
Many of the details of how exactly Democrats would handle the returns have not been worked out.
Neal could keep Trump’s documents to himself and a few close aides — and not even let other members of his panel see them. He has already said he won’t share the returns with any other committees, including the Judiciary and Oversight panels, which have been conducting their own high-profile investigations of the administration.
That would keep the circle of people who’ve seen Trump’s taxes tight — and the more people who see the returns, the more likely there will be leaks.
But many of his colleagues have been clamoring for the president’s returns for months, and will surely be unhappy to learn they won’t be able to examine them.
Another option: Lawmakers turn the filings over to the JCT and ask its staff of tax experts to analyze Trump’s returns and report back on what they find.
“They’re going to have to think carefully about how they’re going to want to do this,” said Dean Zerbe, a former Senate tax aide. “The penalties are certainly quite real.”

Trump’s border threats jam up Pence’s trade tour,seriouslypolitics.com,Gabby Orr,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/05/15/22/41/trumps-border-threats-jam-up-pences-trade-tour/,"This post is by Gabby Orr from Politics, Policy, Political News Top Stories

President Donald Trump’s announcement Thursday that he would be willing to sideline a new trilateral trade pact with Canada and Mexico — a move that would allow him to impose the auto tariffs he has been threatening to unveil — couldn’t have come at a worse time for Mike Pence.
As Trump sat in the Oval Office, telling reporters that border security “is more important to me than the USMCA,” the administration’s proposed replacement for NAFTA, his vice president was hours away from kicking off a multistate tour to promote the renegotiated trade deal.
The tour, which targets states that will be crucial to the president’s reelection bid, would begin in Pence’s home state of Indiana at Lamb Farms Inc., a family-run business producing a trio of crops — corn, wheat and soybeans — that have been swept up in Trump’s trade wars.
In the coming weeks, Pence will all over to swing districts selling [the president’s] trade message,” a senior White House official told POLITICO, outlining a schedule of stops in farm towns and agricultural regions across Ohio, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and other 2020 battlegrounds.
“It’s a legislative effort in that he’s trying to garner support in moderate Democrat districts — ones that [Trump] won — but also political, in that he’ll be touting what Republicans have accomplished” during the president’s first two years in office, the official said.
The same official said Pence was “not at all” bothered by the president’s comments because the White House believes Mexican officials are “showing good faith so far and will continue to work with us so further action won’t be necessary.”
But Trump’s remarks on Thursday raised fresh questions about the status of his trade deal with Mexico and Canada, a revised version of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement that is expected to encounter major roadblocks as the administration attempts to muscle it through Congress by summer. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has refused to consider the USMCA until Mexico has implemented a major labor law overhaul. And lawmakers from both parties are worried about moving forward without first lifting the steel and aluminum tariffs that Trump imposed last May.
Some House Democrats have raised concerns about whether the deal’s labor and environmental standards are enforceable. Other lawmakers worry that provisions in the deal could lock in high prescription drug prices. Democrats also want the deal altered to ensure that disputes between countries can be fully enforced through tariff retaliation.
The updated trade deal also includes agreements that have already taken effect that effectively bar the U.S. from imposing new auto tariffs on its North American neighbors, meaning Trump would run afoul of the agreed-upon guidelines if he moved to slap import taxes on vehicles from Mexico a year from now — something he has vowed to do instead of closing the southern border if the country fails to curb the “massive amounts of drugs” flowing across the border into the United States.
“We’re going to give them a one-year warning, and if the drugs don’t stop … we’re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products, in particular, the cars … and if that doesn’t stop the drugs, we close the border,” Trump said Thursday, teasing a “massive” auto tariff of 25 percent.
Trump’s threat to back out of the auto deal with Mexico could give the country reason to be reluctant about ratifying the overall agreement. Some experts say Trump’s cavalier attitude might also make it harder for China to reach a deal if Beijing is unsure the president will keep his word.
Amid the growing uncertainty surrounding the USMCA, Pence has turned to talking up the prospect of an imminent and historic trade deal with China, as well as with other major U.S. trading partners.
“What I heard today here, consistently, is real urgency — that the farmers who always are land-rich and cash-poor have been feeling the weight of low commodity prices. They’ve been burning through capital, burning through equity, so it’s imperative that Congress act … to ratify the USMCA, so that they know and have certainty about access to the Canadian market, to the Mexican market,” Pence told reporters following his event at Lamb Farms.
American farmers have been grappling with sinking commodity prices, in part, because of the ongoing trade disputes Trump is entangled in with China and other countries. Soybean farmers faced an especially tough year in 2018 after being blocked from foreign markets, according to statistics released last month by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which found that 80 percent of the industry’s annual harvest was sitting in storage last December. The problem became so bad that the Trump administration created a $12 billion program last September to bail out farmers being affected by the president’s trade policies.
“We are making progress on renegotiating our entire trading relationship with China, and I want to promise you it’s going to put American agriculture and American workers first,” Pence told the farmers in Lebanon, Ind., according to a transcript provided the White House. Pence also mentioned trade negotiations with Japan and the European Union that will begin soon.
Meanwhile, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has said he plans to approve new labor legislation by the end of this month that could boost some congressional Democrats’ willingness to seriously consider what they’ve repeatedly dubbed “NAFTA 2.0.”
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has also been holding meetings with key Democrats on Capitol Hill to talk through the new trade deal and address lingering concerns, one of which includes ratifying the deal while stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports remain in place — something Republicans also have spoken out against.
“It’s very, very important that the White House get on board on doing away with these tariffs so we can get this thing not only before the Congress of the United States, but before the Senate in Mexico and the Parliament, House of Commons, in Canada,” Senate Finance Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said on a conference call with reporters in February.
On Thursday, Pence said he and the president are pushing for the USCMA to be approved by Congress “this spring,” an aggressive timeline that would allow Trump to tout the agreement out on the trail later this summer, when White House aides say he’s expected to step up his campaign schedule with weekly rallies. Trump threatened to withdraw from NAFTA in late December in an attempt to light a fire beneath Congress on the renegotiated version, though he has yet to follow through.
By Friday morning, however, Trump was back to tweeting about prioritizing security at the border over finalizing his trade deal with Canada and Mexico.
“This will supersede USMCA,” he wrote of ending the flow of unauthorized immigrants and illicit drugs into the U.S before hopping on a plane to a border town in California.
Sabrina Rodriguez contributed to this report.

A lawyer for President Donald Trump is urging the Treasury Department to reject House Democrats’ demands for Trump’s tax returns.
In a letter released Friday, William Consovoy said the administration should deny the request because lawmakers do not have a legislative reason for seeking the returns. Democrats merely want the president’s confidential filings so they can search for things to embarrass him, he said.
“Requests for tax returns and return information must have a legitimate legislative purpose,” he wrote to Brent McIntosh, general counsel at the Treasury Department.
The Democrats’ bid “is a transparent effort by one political party to harass an official from the other party because they dislike his politics.”
“It would be a gross abuse of power for the majority party to use tax returns as a weapon to attack, harass, and intimidate their political opponent,” he said.
The letter comes on the heels of Democrats’ request this week for six years’ worth of Trump’s individual and business returns, running from 2013 through 2018. Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) is demanding the administration turn over the documents by April 10.
Democrats are citing a nearly century-old law that allows the heads of Congress’s tax committees to examine anyone’s returns. Some experts say Democrats don’t need a legislative reason to demand Trump’s returns, noting the law simply says the Treasury secretary “shall” provide the tax committees with requested documents.
Anticipating the administration’s arguments, Democrats contend they do have a legislative reason for seeking the returns, saying they want to vet the IRS’s audit of the president’s returns.
Consovoy rejected that contention, suggesting it is little more than a fig leaf.
“If Chairman Neal genuinely wants to review how the IRS audits presidents, why is he seeking tax returns and return information covering the four years before President Trump took office?” he said. “Why is he not requesting information about the audits of previous presidents? And why can he not simply ask the IRS to explain its policy?”
The agency should not hand over the documents until it gets a legal opinion from the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, Consovoy added.
A Treasury Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Neal declined comment.
The IRS has automatically audited every president’s returns since the 1970s, both to instill confidence that the president is paying his or her share and to help the agency avoid having to decide which chief executive to scrutinize. Those audits are a matter of the IRS’s internal policy, and not required by law.
Democrats say they don’t know how rigorous those audits are or if they really happen. Calling it a matter of oversight of the IRS, they point to an episode during the Nixon administration when the agency initially blessed that president’s returns before backpedaling when a subsequent audit by Congress’s independent Joint Committee on Taxation found Nixon actually owed almost $500,000.

Lack of security clearances hampers federal election panel,seriouslypolitics.com,Eric Geller,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/05/14/19/33/lack-of-security-clearances-hampers-federal-election-panel/,"This post is by Eric Geller from Politics, Policy, Political News Top Stories

Only half the members of a federal commission advising states on election threats have security clearances, raising questions about whether it can effectively help local and state officials defend against adversaries such as Russian hackers.
And no members of the four-person Election Assistance Commission had clearances during the past two election cycles, including the period when Kremlin-linked hackers are suspected of mounting a range of cyberattacks against state election offices, the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton’s campaign in 2016.
The delay in issuing security clearances for commission members is part of a massive backlog of application approvals throughout the entire federal government. But it’s a particularly acute problem for the EAC, one of the key agencies offering guidance to state and local officials about how to protect themselves from security risks.
“The people entrusted with securing our elections need to know what threats they’re supposed to address,” Sen. Ron Wyden .), one of the lawmakers who has focused the most on election security, told POLITICO in a statement. “An Election Assistance [Commission member] without a security clearance is like making a baseball player hit without a bat.”
Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos, who previously led a national group of secretaries that works closely with the EAC, called it “imperative” that the commissioners receive their clearances “so that we can all be rowing in the same direction to defend our democracy against our foreign adversaries.”
“Ensuring the integrity of our elections and protecting them from undue foreign influence takes a whole team,” he said.
The situation may be on the verge of improving. Commission members Thomas Hicks and Donald Palmer, who lack clearances, hope to receive interim ones “in the near future,” EAC spokeswoman Brenda Soder said, adding that they have “completed the necessary paperwork and fingerprints.”
“In public comments, private meetings, official letters and testimony before Congress, the commissioners have clearly and consistently stated their desire to obtain security clearances,” Soder said. “The EAC is pleased the commissioners are now on track to gain their security clearances and believes this development will help the commission enhance its ability to assist election officials and voters.”
Hicks, who chaired the commission in 2016 and 2018, first revealed he lacked a security clearance in an interview with a Baltimore television station in July. “We’re working on correcting that problem,” he said at the time.
Hicks has actually been waiting since August 2016, Soder told POLITICO. Palmer joined the agency in February.
Christy McCormick, the agency’s current chairwoman, has an interim clearance. Only Benjamin Hovland, who joined the EAC in February, has a full clearance, which he received in his previous job as a Senate staffer.
In addition, Hicks, McCormick and then-Commissioner Matthew Masterson all lacked security clearances during the 2016 election, and Hicks and McCormick still didn’t have them in 2018 — both periods when intelligence officials warned of Russian hackers probing vulnerable election systems and state officials frantically sought more information about the threat.
Without clearances, Hicks and Palmer have limited access to classified intelligence, potentially restricting their awareness of specific threats and vulnerabilities.
The government provides one-day “read-ins” so that people without clearances can attend specific events, and all four EAC commissioners were invited to a classified briefing in February under that arrangement, according to a U.S. official who requested anonymity to discuss internal processes. (Condos noted that the commissioners “have always had access and invitation to the briefings” for state officials.) But these temporary read-ins do not cover ongoing access to classified files.
Ben Buchanan, a cyber-conflict researcher at Georgetown University who has written about election security, said a security clearance “almost always seems to be a necessary condition for meaningful understanding and policymaking in government cyber operations.”
“It’s possible that a lot of the commissioners’ work is state-focused and doesn’t require one,” Buchanan said, “but a clearance and appropriate briefings seem necessary to understand and help counteract foreign threats.”
The clearance issue also appears to undermine one of the core missions of the EAC, which is to serve as an emissary between local officials and federal bodies such as the Department of Homeland Security.
Even though relationships between DHS and states have improved, many state and local election officials contact the EAC more regularly than they do other federal agencies. But because Hicks and Palmer lack security clearances, they can’t fully serve as intermediaries or brokers on many sensitive security topics.
Many secretaries of state already have their security clearances, meaning there might be rooms that the secretaries can enter but the two EAC commissioners can’t, unless they received prior approval.
“I hope that the lack of clearances doesn’t prevent the commissioners from receiving threat and incident information and working with elections officials across the country to secure our democracy,” California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in a statement.
The interim clearance that McCormick has — and that Hicks and Palmer may soon receive — is functionally identical to a permanent clearance, according to an official at the DHS Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, who requested anonymity to discuss security matters. Agencies award interim clearances to people who are expected to pass their background checks to let them review classified material while that process continues.
Hicks and Palmer aren’t alone in waiting. DHS has acknowledged that the backlog in security clearances is particularly acute for state and local election officials. In advance of the 2018 midterms, the department began making it a priority to approve clearances for election supervisors ahead of other applicants. But that priority evidently did not extend to the leaders of the EAC, ostensibly one of the closest partners of DHS on election security.
The clearance issue has probably compounded existing bureaucratic struggles for the EAC, a tiny agency that many lawmakers have treated as a backwater of the federal government ever since its creation in 2002.
President Barack Obama nominated Hicks to fill a vacant spot in April 2010. But the Senate was slow to act, and in December 2011, after the other EAC commissioners’ terms expired, the EAC went dormant for three years, with no leaders to vote on policy decisions. In December 2014, the Senate finally confirmed Hicks, along with Masterson and McCormick, whom Obama had nominated that July.
But the fourth commission spot remained open for several more years, and when Masterson left the EAC in March 2018, the commission again lost its quorum, preventing major decisions. President Donald Trump restored the EAC to full membership by nominating Palmer and Hovland, who were confirmed in January.

Mnuchin losing two senior Treasury aides,seriouslypolitics.com,Nancy Cook,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://seriouslypolitics.com/2019/04/05/13/53/45/mnuchin-losing-two-senior-treasury-aides/,"This post is by Nancy Cook from Politics, Policy, Political News Top Stories

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is about to lose two of his most trusted aides, just as House Democrats ramp up pressure on his department to release President Donald Trump’s tax returns.
Eli Miller, chief of staff at Treasury and a former Trump campaign official, will leave the department next week, according to a staffwide email sent Friday afternoon. Close Treasury observers say Miller is expected to join the private sector.
In a statement, Mnuchin called Miller an instrumental leader “who has been constantly at my side, and he will be very difficult to replace.”
Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Public Affairs Tony Sayegh has also planned for months to leave by the end of May and is interviewing candidates for his replacement as the agency’s top communications official.
Among them is Monica Crowley, a Fox News commentator who was spotted in the building Thursday afternoon. Before Trump’s inauguration, was tapped for a senior position on the National Security Council but withdrew herself from consideration after news reports surfaced about instances of plagiarism.
Miller served as a key trusted aide to Mnuchin, always accompanying him to high-level meetings and briefings and acting as a conduit to lobbyists and business groups. Inside the Treasury building, he was viewed by staff as more interested in maintaining a close relationship with the boss than he was in managing the building, policy process or career professionals.
Before joining Treasury, Miller worked as chief operating officer of finance for the Trump campaign, where he worked alongside Mnuchin. Earlier in his career, he was an aide to John Boehner when he was House speaker, and for the Koch brothers-backed group, Americans for Prosperity.
Sayegh, also a close Mnuchin ally, worked closely with the White House on promoting the GOP’s sweeping tax reform legislation in 2017.
The departures come as Treasury faces increasing pressure from congressional Democrats who want greater oversight of the department and on Wednesday requested six years of the president’s tax returns.

Two months after its first game, the Alliance of American Football suspended football operations earlier this week, essentially a death knell to the fledgling league intent on keeping America's favorite sport active and viable through the spring.Now the finger pointing begins with Dallas billionaire Tom Dundon painted as the bad guy by many indoctrinated to assume the worst of those with hefty bank accounts.Ironically, the class warfare here isn't between the haves and have-nots, however, it's between the successful and the entitled, pitting Dundon against the snake-oil salesman he bailed out in February, league co-founder Charlie Ebersol, television royalty who essentially told tall tales at every turn when discussing the funding of his ill-conceived startup.The son of long-time NBC Sports heavyweight Dick Ebersol, the man who once partnered with wrestling impresario Vince McMahon on the ill-fated original XFL, it was the younger Ebersol's ESPN's documentary on the XFL, set to be rebooted in 2020, which fueled his desire to start a new league by racing to the starting blocks with claims of rock-solid funding in order to beat his dad's old partner to the punch of burning money. Dundon, the owner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes, poured $70 million in the league since buying it on Feb. 19 before tapping out, ostensibly because he couldn't work out a talent-trading deal with the NFL and its players' union to serve as a developmental entity. Ebersol's camp ""believes"" Dundon may have bought the company for its intellectual property and stripped it with the idea that a much-ballyhooed App was the magic bullet when it came to professional sports and tapping into the fast-moving, sports-betting market. There's the cynicism necessary to be a capable reporter and there's common sense.A startup football league with no money has the advantage when it comes to in-game betting technology over Silicon Valley? Meanwhile, from Dundon's side even if you forget the NFL has a cost-free feeder system in college football and has never shown the appetite for running its own affiliate system even when it has wedded it to more important goals -- best evidenced by the old World League of American Football/NFL Europe -- the negotiation to use back of the roster or practice-squad players with the NFL/NFLPA is a complicated one involving a binding CBA which would take months under the best of circumstances.Dundon was either promised or assumed things which couldn't be delivered by desperate people for what was publicized as a $250 million investment.The fact he delivered only $70M for this money pit has been painted as heartless and unfair to many even though it's clear if Dundon didn't ride in on his white horse made of cash, the AAF would have been toe-tagged after Week 1 because the initial investor, reported by former ESPN business analyst Darren Rovell as Reggie Fowler, promised funds that never existed.Fowler has his own shady history. Back in 2005, he made a splash by entering into an agreement to purchase the Minnesota Vikings, even scraping up $20 million to put down a minimal down payment on a $600M deal. As the due diligence started, however, it quickly became evident that Fowler just didn't have the wealth to handle such a purchase and ultimately New Jersey billionaire Zygi Wilf stepped in to buy the Vikings and keep them in Minneapolis.Fowler was allowed to stay on as a very limited partner but quietly excited in October of 2014 when news surfaced that U.S. Bank filed suit and he had amassed over $60M in debts, stemming from a holding company in Arizona, Spiral Inc., which listed dozens of subsidies, essentially shells for deals that never materialized. Despite discussing solid funding in multiple media outlets Ebersol built his house of cards on the back of one man with that resume but the rich guy refusing to provide a plane ticket home for so many hard-working young men just trying to earn a second chance at their dreams was as easy as it comes for an often-lazy media narrative especially when the ""promise"" to the entitled was for a quarter-billion not 28 percent of that.It certainly would have been prudent for Dundon to send everyone home free of charge as a makeup for the sins of others because it would have served as a rounding error and provided value by erasing bad publicity. Logically, though, if Dundon never existed to try to clean up the mess others created those players wouldn't have $57,000 [AAF players were ultimately paid for their last game] to buy that ticket to get home.When framed that way -- nearly $60K in the players' pockets versus a plane ticket home at no cost after toiling in one game which they weren't paid for -- perhaps those upset by the AAF's denouement would turn their angst in the right direction.Dundon shouldn't have taken on this headache in the first place but painting him as the villain because of his bank account is a very entitled thing to do. And if you're in that camp, Charlie Ebersol is waiting at the bar with an investment opportunity. -John McMullen is a long-time syndicated sports columnist for The Sports Network and an on-air personality for ESPN South Jersey.

Amy Schumer's Identity Crisis Culminates In 'Growing',thefederalist.com,Emily Jashinsky,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://thefederalist.com/2019/04/05/amy-schumers-identity-crisis-culminates-growing/,"April 5, 2019 By Emily Jashinsky
“Growing,” as it’s used by Amy Schumer in the title of her new Netflix special, is not meant to be entirely ironic. Like her eponymous character in “Trainwreck,” Schumer stumbled suddenly into love and marriage, further accelerating the shift in her comedy that was already underway. Very pregnant, the special finds her in the process of “growing” physically—but also in the process of growing from the dirtbag persona that fueled her rise to success. The second journey isn’t unfolding quite as well as the first.
“Growing,” of course, also plays on Schumer’s sense of arrested development. She’s protesting Brett Kavanaugh, but stuffing snacks into her mouth before getting arrested. The special’s identity, then, is half-joking and half-serious. Unlike Hannah Gadsby, who literally divided “Nanette” along those lines, Schumer isn’t giving up on comedy at all. That’s exactly why her earnest political interludes induce cringes. Schumer’s claim to the moral high ground is dubious, which was initially the entire basis of her comedy—and it still lingers.
The comedienne’s dirtbag persona, a schtick that launched her to fame, was promiscuous and narcissistic and raunchy and racist. Like Sarah Silverman, Schumer used that persona to satirize ignorance. It was often very funny. Unfortunately she’s since found her purpose in using comedy as a platform for politics, but through party-line lectures rather than smart satire.
Nobody can do both. Evolving from a dirtbag libertine to a dirtbag wife doesn’t make you a more credible moralizer. Warmed over fourth-wave bluster about “Lindsey Mammo-Graham” doesn’t land after you’ve spent an hour using your own irresponsibility and broken moral compass as a punchline. For all her growth, the underpinning of Schumer’s jokes about wanting the cars of happily pregnant women to “Chappaquiddick into a lake” or going to a protest because D.C. “has the best cocaine” is still that she’s a bad person. Now she’s just a bad person who also wants us to believe in the moral superiority of her politics. She slips in and out of her persona like a bathrobe.
To be fair, the special is spotted with several interesting bits, much like “Inside Amy Schumer” produced some memorable sketches. In a 2011 set on Conan, Schumer, then in her early 30s, joked about asking “What are you going to do?!” of friends “living normal adult lives” who happily announced their pregnancies to her. “I’ll drive you!” she joked about reacting. In “Growing,” Schumer jokes about pretending she wanted an abortion to her husband. “He went, ‘ Really ?'” she says. “I was like, ‘No! What?’ I’m going to announce it on Instagram, and then I’m going to be like, ‘Actually, forget it. I don’t like it. I’m tired. I don’t like it.'”
“Thank God that was his response, you know?” says Schumer. “What if he’d been like, ‘Cool. I’ll warm up the car!”
“Growing” provides some genuinely funny moments. But its better function is making clear what has seemed increasingly to be the problem with Schumer’s comedy for years now: an identity crisis. She wants to be a woke comedian, to deliver punchlines with purpose, but her persona was built on ignorance and questionable morals. If she’s growing into the moral high ground, she’ll have to grow out of the persona that made her famous. So far, there’s little evidence to suggest she’s figured out how to do that, or even identified that it needs to be done. Emily Jashinsky is culture editor at The Federalist.

5 myths about the US-Mexico border exposed,www.providencejournal.com,Tribune News Service,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/zz/news/20190405/5-myths-about-us-mexico-border-exposed?rssfeed=true,"Apr 5, 2019 at 8:55 PM We separate misconception from fact
Is President Donald Trump able to shut down the southern border with Mexico? Will building a wall stop the flow of drugs? Is there an actual crisis at the border?
We separate misconception from fact.
___
1) Claim: Trump says he is going to shut down the border
Fact: It would be nearly impossible to shut down the entire border
Trump has more than once threatened to close the border with Mexico, with the most recent threat aimed at showing his displeasure over Central American asylum-seekers trying to cross into the United States.
But Thursday, a day before traveling to California, Trump said he would give Mexico ""a one-year warning"" before imposing tariffs on Mexican goods. ""If that doesn't work, we're going to close the border,"" the president said.
""I will do it,"" Trump said. ""I don't play games.""
But the border is roughly 2,000 miles long, with some type of barrier covering about 650 miles of it. Physically closing the entire border would be logistically impossible.
What Trump is probably referring to are the 47 official ports of entry along the southern border.
Closing every port of entry would require more staffing at the border. The Department of Homeland Security has been facing personnel shortages in the thousands, but the administration is reassigning Customs and Border Protection officers from ports of entry to help Border Patrol agents operating primarily between those points.
And there are economic concerns. Each day, more than 1 million people and about $1.7 billion in commerce are processed through official ports of entry. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has warned that a shutdown would hurt farmers and manufacturers across the nation, as well as workers and consumers.
Two-way trade in goods between Mexico and the United States has increased from $81.4 billion in 1993 — the year before the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect — to $557.6 billion in 2017. Mexico has remained the United States' second-largest export market since 1995, with exports totaling $242 billion in 2017.
The San Diego customs district — which includes the San Ysidro Port of Entry — accounts for 12.1 percent of all U.S. imports from Mexico, including components for the aerospace industry and avocados.
When the San Ysidro crossing — where some 95,000 people enter in cars and on foot each day — was closed in November for five hours, people were prevented from crossing to shop, work or attend school. San Ysidro shop owners lost an estimated $5.3 million in revenue, according to local officials.
If the ports are shut down, the economic impact will have a ripple effect, starting at towns along the border, said Shannon K. O'Neil, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""There's a really direct local effect there.""
___
2) Claim: Building more wall will prevent drug trafficking
Fact: Most drugs from Mexico come through official ports of entry
The consensus among security and drug trafficking experts is that building a wall itself will have little effect on the illicit drug trade along the southwest border. Most illegal drugs smuggled from Mexico come through legal ports of entry, often disguised as commerce, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
Some lawmakers from states hit hard by opioid abuse say they believe a wall will keep drugs out, said Adam Isacson, director of defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America.
""They want more fencing 'cause they believe it's going to keep out things like fentanyl,"" he said. ""But that's just not how it's arriving.""
Experts and other lawmakers are concerned that pulling Customs and Border Protection officers from ports of entry could potentially create more opportunities for drug traffickers to get through.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen last week acknowledged that traffickers use official crossings and suggested closing the border would stop the flow.
""A lot of the drugs do come through the ports of entry,"" Nielsen said. ""If the lane isn't open, then, you know, in some senses the drugs cannot get through in a mass way, because the vehicles won't be getting through.""
___
3) Claim: More immigrants are illegally crossing the border
Fact: The number of illegal crossings is down — and has been down
The Trump administration is portraying a crisis at the border, but numbers show fewer people have been illegally crossing the southern border compared with longer-term data. Customs and Border Protection data show apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped sharply since a 2000 peak:
In February, Customs and Border Protection arrested 66,450 migrants crossing the border illegally, the largest one-month total in the last decade. The numbers will probably continue to rise because warmer weather brings a seasonal uptick in migration; the agency estimates that number will top 90,000 in March.
In February, Trump declared a national emergency pointing to the border. He later used the figures from that month as justification. But experts point to the long-term decline in border crossings.
""Everyone keeps on focusing on the numbers from a year ago and the numbers from last month,"" said Nora Demleitner, a law professor at Washington and Lee University who specializes in crime and immigration. ""When you compare it over a longer time frame, the number is really not that high.""
___
4) Claim: Most illegal immigration is coming from the Mexico border
Fact: More illegal immigration occurs through people overstaying their visas
For the last 10 years, most illegal immigration has occurred by people overstaying their visas rather than by illegally crossing the border, according to a study published in January by the Center for Migration Studies.
In 2016, an estimated 320,000 visitors to the U.S. — 62 percent of total arrivals — who had temporary visas overstayed them. Over a seven-year period, most of the arrivals who lacked legal status came to the U.S. by air travel.
""It is clear from our research that persons who overstay their visas add to the U.S. undocumented population at a higher rate than border crossers,"" Donald Kerwin, executive director of the center, said in a statement. ""This is not a blip, but a trend which has become the norm.""
The Department of Homeland Security does not provide comprehensive data for immigrants who legally entered the U.S. then overstayed their visas.
The department's most recent and reliable figure, according to the Government Accountability Office, is that 702,000 visitors who came to the U.S. by air or sea in 2017 overstayed. The Homeland Security report did not have overstay estimates for those who traveled by land or information on overstays from prior years who may still be in the U.S., according to the GAO.
""Not only is a wall expensive,"" Kerwin said, ""it fails to address the issue at hand.""
___
5) Claim: Trump has been securing our border by building more walls
Fact: Not one new linear mile of border wall has been completed under Trump
So far, Trump has been unsuccessful in securing from lawmakers the $5.7 billion he has demanded to finance more than 230 miles of a border wall.
Instead, the spending bill passed by Congress and that Trump signed into law to avoid a second shutdown appropriates less than a quarter of that — $1.375 billion for 55 miles of barrier.
Before that spending agreement, Congress had approved nearly $1 billion to replace more than 50 miles of fencing in California, New Mexico and Texas, the Government Accountability Office reported. On Thursday, Customs and Border Protection announced in a statement leading up to Trump's visit to the southern border that it will begin constructing a 13-mile stretch along the Rio Grande Levee Wall System, a project the president claimed had already begun in February.
Despite opposition from Congress, Trump declared a national emergency in February to ""confront the national security crisis on our southern border."" The White House said it would pull an additional $6.6 billion, besides the $1.375 billion already provided by Congress in the spending bill, from other federal funding for building or repairing more than 230 miles of border wall. Of that total, about $3.6 billion would come from military construction projects and most of the rest from an account for projects to combat drug trafficking. The Pentagon recently notified Congress it had authorized its first transfer toward wall funding, of $1 billion.
Trump acknowledged the process of the declaration — which drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans — would be unpredictable. Last month, the president submitted an annual budget request to Congress asking for another $5 billion for new border wall. Never miss a story

Judge again halts high-capacity magazine sales in California,www.providencejournal.com,"Don Thompson, The Associated Press",04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190405/judge-again-halts-high-capacity-magazine-sales-in-california?rssfeed=true,"Judge again halts high-capacity magazine sales in California Don Thompson, The Associated Press Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 8:14 PM Apr 5, 2019 at 8:15 PM
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) "" A federal judge on Friday halted sales of high-capacity ammunition magazines in California, giving state officials a chance to appeal his order last week that allowed their sale for the first time in nearly 20 years.
U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez barred further sales until the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considers whether to reinstate the state's ban on magazines holding more than 10 bullets.
But the judge said those who bought the extended magazines since his initial order a week ago may keep them without fear of being prosecuted while the appeal proceeds.
Hundreds of thousands of gun owners may have bought the magazines since Benitez threw out the state's ban last week as infringing on their Second Amendment right to bear arms, said Chuck Michel, an attorney for the National Rifle Association and the California Rifle & Pistol Association who filed the lawsuit that led to the ruling.
Under Benitez's order, no one in California is permitted to manufacture, import, buy or sell large-capacity magazines as of 5 p.m. Friday.
California has prohibited such magazines since 2000, though people who had the magazines before then were allowed to keep them. Benitez last week threw out both the 2000 law and a 2016 law and ballot measure banning possession even by those who had owned them legally.
""All the people who bought the magazines in the last week are protected from prosecution, but any further purchase of these magazines is illegal for the moment,"" Michel said. ""There was 20 years of pent up demand for these self-defense tools, and several hundred thousand people bought them in the last week, maybe more than several hundred thousand.""
Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who sought the stay, warned in a court filing that it would be difficult for the state to remove the newly purchased magazines, even if the ban is reinstated.
Becerra cited a half-dozen mass shootings nationwide since 2011 where the killers used large-capacity magazines.
""California leads the nation when it comes to common-sense gun laws. We should all be ensuring the safety of our communities, not fighting against long-standing laws that improve public safety,"" Becerra said in a statement. He added that he's confident the ban is constitutional.
Benitez acknowledged in his six-page stay order that other judges, in California and elsewhere, have upheld bans on high-capacity magazines.

Duke's Williamson wins AP men's college player of the year,www.providencejournal.com,"Aaron Beard, The Associated Press",04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/ZZ/news/20190405/dukes-williamson-wins-ap-mens-college-player-of-year?rssfeed=true,"Duke's Williamson wins AP men's college player of the year Aaron Beard, The Associated Press Friday Apr 5, 2019 at 8:03 PM Apr 5, 2019 at 8:04 PM
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) "" Just about everything Zion Williamson did at Duke created a highlight or headline in a spectacle of a season.
The soaring dunks.
The open-court moves more nimble than his 6-foot-7, 285-pound frame should allow.
Even the freak occurrence of one of his feet tearing through its shoe in a fall to the court.
Handling all that attention became maybe the biggest lesson for the freshman, who quickly became the face of college basketball and the game's biggest star in years "" then fittingly finished as The Associated Press men's player of the year.
""I was comfortable with it because you don't really have a choice,"" Williamson said in an interview with the AP earlier this week. ""I think if you try to force it out, then it's going to bother you. ... My mom just told me to look at it as a lot of kids would wish to be in my position, so if it does bother me, I just think about it like that.""
Williamson claimed 59 of 64 votes from AP Top 25 voters before the NCAA Tournament in results released Friday. Freshman teammate RJ Barrett earned two votes as a fellow AP first-team All-American, while Virginia's De'Andre Hunter, Michigan State's Cassius Winston and Murray State's Ja Morant each earned one vote.
Williamson had hoped to be in Minneapolis preparing for Saturday's national semifinals like Hunter and Winston. But the Blue Devils fell to Winston's Spartans in the Elite Eight as the top overall seed.
""I was just telling (teammates) don't let nobody tell you this season was a disappointment, because people have got to understand it's March Madness,"" he said, adding: ""I mean, winning the championship is not a cakewalk.""
In a likely one-year college stop for a possible top overall NBA draft pick, the 18-year-old Williamson averaged 22.6 points and 8.9 rebounds while ranking second nationally by shooting 68%. He also ranked among the Atlantic Coast Conference leaders in steals (2.12) and blocks (1.79).
Williamson's play was marked by breathtaking athleticism to go by, through and over anyone to get the ball (look at his personal-favorite 360-degree dunk against Clemson or his rapid-closeout swat of Hunter's shot at Virginia for proof).
There was the charisma, too. He projected a self-assured ease amid the crush of postgame interviews, even routinely having walk-on Mike Buckmire join him as a wingman as though bringing his teammate into his unique orbit.
""It's been remarkable what he's done,"" said North Carolina coach Roy Williams, who recruited Williamson. ""There hasn't been many guys like that to come down the road. So the attention he's gotten, I think he'd deserved. ... He's driven a different ship.""
That February shoe blowout illustrated just how different.
Williamson missed nearly six full games after injuring his knee in the fall, which had his left foot sticking through the side of his Paul George signature shoe from Nike. The bizarre image wounded Nike's day-after stock price and had some arguing that he shouldn't return to protect his pro stock.
That was never an option for Williamson. He returned in the ACC Tournament sporting a reinforced pair of Kyrie Irving Nikes, which followed Nike representatives visiting Duke's campus to sort out what went wrong.
The unusual moments of stardom didn't stop there, either.
""Cars will be driving by (on campus) and I mean, they'll just stop,"" Williamson said with a chuckle. ""In the middle of the road. And people will jump out of the car and get pictures. I'm looking at my watch, I have two minutes to get to class and my class is a five-minute walk. ... I'll look at them and they'll be so high, I'm like, 'Yeah, I got you, I'll take the picture.""
He also frequently encountered Duke fans waiting near the practice gym for autographs.
""You've got 20 minutes before that clock starts for practice, you've got like 20 people outside,"" Williamson said. ""You're like, 'I don't think I can do this.' So then it comes down to: do I say no? Or do I tell them to wait?
""I've been in a lot of situations. Sometimes they understood, other times they weren't so accepting of it. But I guess that's part of life.""
Williamson said there's ""obviously a high possibility"" he enters the draft but he's not ready to make anything official as he enjoys being a college student a little longer with plans on taking summer classes toward a degree.
Williamson said he has no regrets, calling the season ""the most fun I've ever had in my life.""
""My mom would tell me, 'College is something you don't want to miss out on' because not only have I enjoyed the basketball side of coming to Duke, I've enjoyed being a student here just as much,"" Williamson said. ""The relationships I've built with the students here "" like talking to kids I guess people wouldn't picture me talking to, hanging out with them "" it's bigger than basketball.""

CINCINNATI (AP) "" A 23-year-old ex-convict accused of pulling a cruel hoax by pretending to be a long-missing Illinois boy was charged Friday with making false statements to federal authorities.
The FBI said Brian Rini had made false claims twice before, portraying himself as a juvenile sex-trafficking victim.
The Medina, Ohio, man was jailed in Cincinnati on Thursday, a day after telling authorities he was 14-year-old Timmothy Pitzen, who disappeared in 2011 at age 6. The FBI declared Rini's story a hoax after performing a DNA test.
The charge should send a message about the damage such false claims can do, said U.S. Attorney Benjamin Glassman.
""It's not OK to do it because of the harm that it causes, the pain, for the family of that missing child,"" Glassman said.
Rini's story had briefly raised hope among Timmothy's relatives that the youngster's disappearance had finally been solved after eight long years. But those hopes were dashed when the test results came back.
""It's devastating. It's like reliving that day all over again,"" said Timmothy's aunt Kara Jacobs.
Rini was jailed for a bail hearing on Tuesday. His public defender did not immediately return a message. Rini could get up to eight years in prison.
Rini was found wandering the streets on Wednesday and told authorities he had just escaped his captors after years of abuse, officials said. He claimed he had been forced to have sex with men, according to the FBI.
When confronted with the DNA results, Rini acknowledged his identity, saying he had watched a story about Timmothy on ABC's ""20/20"" and wanted to get away from his own family, the FBI said.
Rini said ""he wished he had a father like Timmothy's because if he went missing, his father would just keep drinking,"" the FBI said in court papers. A message left with Rini's father for comment was not immediately returned.
Glassman said authorities were skeptical early on of Rini's claim because he refused to be fingerprinted, though he did agree to a DNA swab. Rini also looks older than 14, but Glassman said investigators wanted to make sure ""there was no opportunity missed to actually find Timmothy Pitzen.""
Rini's DNA was already on file because of his criminal record. He was released from prison less than a month ago after serving more than a year for burglary and vandalism.
He twice portrayed himself in Ohio as a juvenile victim of sex trafficking, and in each case was identified after being fingerprinted, authorities said.
In 2017, Rini was treated at an Ohio center for people with mental health or substance abuse problems, according to court papers.
Timmothy, of Aurora, Illinois, vanished after his mother pulled him out of kindergarten, took him on a two-day road trip to the zoo and a water park, and then killed herself at a hotel. She left a note saying that her son was safe with people who would love and care for him, and added: ""You will never find him.""
After Rini's account was pronounced a hoax, Timmothy's grandmother Alana Anderson said: ""It's been awful. We've been on tenterhooks, hopeful and frightened. It's just been exhausting.""
She added, ""I feel so sorry for the young man who's obviously had a horrible time and felt the need to say he was somebody else.""

MEXICO CITY - A partial electricity blackout hit three states on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula on Friday afternoon, but power was gradually returning to tourist hot spots Cancun and Tulum a couple of hours after the outages started, authorities and locals said. ""Electricity is gradually coming back, traffic lights at 100 percent,"" Mara Lezama, the mayor of the Benito Juarez municipality which encompasses Cancun, said on Twitter. A resident of Tulum confirmed that electricity had returned there. State-run power utility CFE said that a brushwood fire between transmission towers had caused the power outage. Power outages had been reported throughout the peninsula, which is dotted with Caribbean coastal resorts. Places affected included Cancun and Tulum in the state of Quintana Roo, the city of Merida in Yucatan state, and the neighboring state of Campeche, a major oil-producing region.

Moroccan court upholds prison sentences against Rif protesters,www.jpost.com,REUTERS,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Moroccan-court-upholds-prison-sentences-against-Rif-protesters-585923,"Moroccan court upholds prison sentences against Rif protesters
RABAT - A Casablanca appeals court confirmed late on Friday the 20-year prison sentence against Nasser Zefzafi, the leader of protests that shook the northern Rif region in late 2016 and 2017, along with three other protesters, lawyers said. Zefzafi was arrested in May 2017 after organizing demonstrations in his predominantly Amazigh (Berber) hometown of Al Hoceima over economic and social problems. Last June, a first instance verdict gave three other Al Hoceima protesters, Nabil Ahamjik, Ouassim Boustati and Samir Ighid, 20 years in prison. Another 35 activists were jailed for between two and 15 years and one received a one-year suspended sentence. “This is a shocking verdict,” said Mohamed Aghnaj, lawyer of the protesters. “Upholding the first instance sentences shows that the appeals court did not sufficiently examine the case,” he told Reuters by phone. State lawyer Mohamed Al Houssaini Karout said the court confirmed the verdict ""as there was nothing new to look at after the defendants and their lawyers abstained from attending the hearings."" The court was “clement” in sentencing Zefzafi to 20 years in jail because he was tried on charges punishable with up to 30 years, he said. As part of the same verdict, local journalist Hamid El Mahdaoui, who covered the protests, saw his three-year sentence confirmed. His sister Nadia expressed grief at the verdict, voicing hope to see her brother acquitted at the court of cassation. The protests erupted after a fishmonger was crushed inside a rubbish truck while trying to recover fish confiscated by authorities in the northern city of Al Hoceima in October 2016. The Al Hoceima demonstrations, along with protests in the mining town of Jerada in early 2018, marked the biggest unrest in Morocco since protests in 2011 prompted King Mohammed VI to devolve some of his powers to an elected parliament.
