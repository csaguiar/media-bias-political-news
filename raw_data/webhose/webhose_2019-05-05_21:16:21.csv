News - Proposed New Mexico Renewable Energy Mandate Could Raise Prices - Heartland Institute,www.heartland.org,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.heartland.org/news-opinion/news/proposed-new-mexico-renewable-energy-mandate-could-raise-prices,"Proposed New Mexico Renewable Energy Mandate Could Raise Prices April 4, 2019 For full text click here. Legislation introduced in the New Mexico legislature would increase the state’s renewable energy mandate (REM) and provide a consumer-paid financing mechanism for the transition to wind and solar power.
Legislation introduced in the New Mexico legislature would increase the state’s renewable energy mandate (REM) and provide a consumer-paid financing mechanism for a forced transition to wind and solar power.
Senate Bill (S.B.) 275 would increase the amount of electricity utilities are required to provide from “renewable” sources from the 20 percent by 2020 currently required by the state’s REM, to 50 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2045.
S.B. 489 would help finance the transition from fossil fuel powered electric plants to renewables through the establishment of “energy transition bonds” to be paid off by a “non-bypassable charge paid by all customers of a qualifying utility for the recovery of energy transition costs,” the bill states.
Documented Cost Increases
States with REMs have had their energy costs rise twice as rapidly as the national average, with electricity prices being 26 percent higher on average in states with REMs than in those without them, states a paper by Timothy Benson, a policy analyst for The Heartland Institute, which publishes Environment and Climate News . The higher the REM, the greater the increase in electricity prices.
Benson’s paper cites a study by the Brookings Institution which found replacing conventional power with wind power raises electricity prices by 50 percent and replacing conventional power with solar power triples electricity costs.
Benson found New Mexico’s existing REM cost state taxpayers and ratepayers more than $192 million in 2016, raising electricity prices by 6.18 percent. Additional REM-related costs included a loss of more than $405 million in economic activity and the loss of more than 3,000 jobs in the state.
This research indicates New Mexico’s current REM will increase electric power prices in the state by an additional $206 million by 2020, with electricity prices increasing by a further 6.77 percent, resulting in an additional 3,500 jobs lost and $444 million in additional foregone economic activity. Those costs would be expected to rise substantially if New Mexico increases its REM requirement as proposed in S.B. 275.
Says Repeal, Don’t Expand
Expanding the REM would not improve the environment, but it would harm New Mexico’s working families, says Benson.
“Affordable energy is the key to productivity growth and the production of virtually all goods and services economy-wide,” said Benson. “Increasing New Mexico’s REM would have no tangible impact on global carbon dioxide emissions while making everything more expensive for working families in New Mexico and raising costs for businesses.
“Instead of seeking to expand New Mexico’s renewable energy mandate, the state’s legislators should be looking to repeal it,” Benson said.
Rough on Ratepayers
Increasing New Mexico’s reliance on renewables is going to hit New Mexico electricity consumers hard, says Paul Gessing, president of the Rio Grande Foundation, citing data from Arizona State University’s business school which estimated New Mexico’s electricity rates would more than double if the state adopted a 50 by 30 plan as proposed in S.B. 275.
“New Mexico is already on its way to 20 percent RPS by 2020, and research from the University of Wyoming’s Timothy Considine indicates increasing the state’s REM would cost ratepayers $2.3 billion more than if the state did nothing,” said Gessing. “This current proposal is way more complicated than proposals Considine looked at, with the possibility the legislature could push the REM to 100 percent by 2050.
“We at the Rio Grande Foundation are generally agnostic concerning how utilities generate their power, and we’ve been arguing for a price cap to say, ‘Hey, if this wind and solar is really cheaper like they keep claiming, then maybe they should be willing to accept a reasonable cap on prices, say like about the level we are paying today, rather than forcing ratepayers to accept ever-rising rate increases over time to pay for electricity from higher-cost sources,’” Gessing said.
Price Hikes, Job Losses
Gessing says the two Senate proposals would cost New Mexico jobs for no environmental gain.
“These two bills will rake New Mexico’s taxpayers over the coals with a massive increase in electricity costs for, at best case, minimal gains in the environment that could be achieved at lower costs and possibly better outcomes through other technology,” Gessing said. “Obviously, New Mexico is a very small component of the United States’ carbon emissions, and when you factor in China and other global carbon emitters, New Mexico’s share really becomes a vanishingly small portion of overall global emissions.
“On the jobs front, New Mexico is Navajo country, and there’s a lot of poverty on the Navajo reservation,” said Gessing. “A lot of people—Anglo, Navajo, etc.—work at the coal mines and at coal-fueled power plants, and despite there often not being high levels of educational attainment in the region, workers are making good money because power plant and mining jobs pay well; yet these jobs are going to go away if these Senate bills become law, necessitating the end of coal-powered energy in the state.”

"Donald Trump Lies So Much 'Because It's Fun,' Ex-White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci Says",www.newsweek.com,Alexandra Hutzler,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/trump-lies-because-fun-anthony-scaramucci-1387161,"Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci, who was ousted from the administration in just ten days, said that President Donald Trump lies so much “because it’s fun.”
“He does it because he thinks it’s fun,” Scaramucci told CNN on Friday morning. “He also does it because he likes the fact that you guys are talking about it. At the end of the day for him there’s a very large group of people inside of our population that, when he does it and the media talks about it, they laugh.”
Scaramucci served as an adviser on Trump’s transition team and was officially hired on July 21, 2017 to take on the role of communications director. His hiring prompted the resignations of press secretary Sean Spicer and chief of staff Reince Priebus.
But after a tumultuous start to his job, where he threatened to “fire everybody” and vowed to purge the administration of leakers, Scaramucci was fired after just a week and a half. He actually set a record for the shortest amount of time served in the position since its creation over five decades ago.
Even still, Scaramucci has remained a supporter of Trump. On Friday, he told CNN’s John Berman that the president is “one of the smartest guys I know.” But he did criticize Trump for his incessant lying.
“I don’t like it. I tell the president, ‘Hey, you don’t need to do that. There is no reason for you to tell these fables or these stories,’” he said, before pointing to some of Trump’s more successful issues like the economy.
Anthony Scaramucci, named Donald Trump's new White House communications director speaks during a press briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C. on July 21, 2017. He was ousted from the administration just ten days later. Scaramucci told CNN that President Trump lies so much because ""he thinks it's fun."" Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images “We can pick different categories John and say, ‘Hey, by and large he’s done a great job.’ So why do you have to tell lies?” Scaramucci said, adding that the president’s penchant for lying probably started in his real estate days.
“He’s very consistent, he’s probably consistent over the past 40 years in terms of the way he frames a narrative and a story,” he said.
According to the Washington Post fact checking database, Trump has made over 9,451 lies in just over 800 days. He is now averaging about 22 false or misleading claims a day, which is a significant rise from the 5.9 misleading claims he was averaging after his first year in office.
In October 2018, Scaramucci told CNN that lying was going to hurt the president going into the upcoming presidential election.
“You don’t want to be stuck in the mid-40s [approval rating] going into the 2020 re-election,” he said. President Trump’s current approval rating, according to Gallup, is at 39 percent.

New Mexico just decriminalized marijuana,www.vox.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/4/18295426/new-mexico-marijuana-legalization-decriminalization,"Justin Sullivan/Getty Images New Mexico is about to become the 24th state to decriminalize marijuana . Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham this week signed legislation that will reduce penalties for marijuana from a criminal to civil violation. A person caught with less than half an ounce of pot will face a $50 fine instead of jail or prison time; penalties for drug paraphernalia will also be reduced. The law takes effect on July 1, KRQE reported . This is different from marijuana legalization . Under decriminalization, criminal penalties linked to marijuana are removed, but civil penalties, like a fine, remain in place and sales remain illegal. Under legalization, civil and criminal penalties for marijuana possession are removed, and sales are typically allowed. Some opponents of legalization favor decriminalization as a step toward peeling back America’s harsh drug and criminal justice policies. They see “tough on crime” policies as too punitive and costly, but they don’t want to resort to full legalization, which they fear would make pot too accessible in the US and allow big corporations to sell and market the drug irresponsibly. The concern for legalization advocates is that decriminalization keeps the ban on selling marijuana, which means users wouldn’t have a legal source for the drug, and criminal organizations would therefore still have a source of revenue that they can use for violent operations around the world. The fines, while less punitive than arrests or prison time, can also cause problems, since they’re often applied in a racially disparate manner . Ten states and Washington, DC, have legalized marijuana, although DC and Vermont don’t allow sales. Fourteen additional states, now including New Mexico, have only decriminalized. Lujan Grisham supports legalization , but the reform didn’t make it through the state’s legislature this year. Supporters of legalization argue that it eliminates the harms of marijuana prohibition: the hundreds of thousands of arrests around the US, the racial disparities behind those arrests, and the billions of dollars that flow from the black market for illicit marijuana to drug cartels that then use the money for violent operations around the world. All of this, legalization advocates say, will outweigh any of the potential downsides — such as increased cannabis use — that might come with legalization. Opponents, meanwhile, claim that legalization will enable a huge marijuana industry that will market the drug irresponsibly. They point to America’s experiences with the alcohol and tobacco industries in particular, which have built their financial empires in large part on some of the heaviest consumers of their products. This could result in far more people using pot, even if it leads to negative health consequences. For now, legalization is not reality in New Mexico. But decriminalization soon will be."
New Mexico Is the Latest State to Join Anti-Electoral College Agreement,www.governing.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.governing.com/topics/politics/New-Mexico-Is-the-Latest-State-to-Join-Anti-Electoral-College-Agreement.html,"New Mexico Is the Latest State to Join Anti-Electoral College Agreement by Tribune News Service | April 5, 2019 AT 7:14 AM
By Andrew Oxford
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed legislation Wednesday that could, someday, potentially short-circuit the Electoral College.
House Bill 55 allows New Mexico to join a compact of states that would allocate their electors in a presidential campaign to the candidate who wins the most votes nationally. RELATED Virginia Scandals Threaten Democrats' High Election Hopes Liberals Prevail in State Supreme Court Elections Will Online Polls Revolutionize Elections?
The idea is to ensure a president cannot be elected with fewer votes than a competitor.
Donald Trump, for example, won fewer votes than Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election but won enough states to be elected president.
""Now, every vote in every state will count in every presidential election,"" Sen. Mimi Stewart, a Democrat from Albuquerque and co-sponsor of the bill, wrote on Twitter after the governor signed the bill.
Under the U.S. Constitution, a state gets one Electoral College vote for each of its seats in Congress. And New Mexico allocates all five of its five Electoral College votes to the presidential candidate who wins the most votes in the state.
But advocates for the popular vote argue the Electoral College system gives more weight to the vote of a person in Wyoming than a person in New York or California.
Wyoming, for example, has around one quarter of New Mexico's population but has three Electoral College votes.
Backers of the current system contend that only works in New Mexico's favor and ensures less populous states are not cut out entirely of presidential elections by candidates chasing votes in more densely inhabited parts of the country.
""These radical bills are pushed by out-of-state interests designed to ensure voters in New Mexico have less of a voice,"" Rep. Bill Rehm, R-Albuquerque, said during the session.
While New Mexico might join the compact, it cannot take effect until enough states have signed on to control a majority of Electoral College votes -- 270. At the beginning of the year, only 12 states had joined, with 172 Electoral College votes. More might sign on this year.
Regardless, the New Mexico Attorney General's Office warned in an analysis of the bill that such a compact would likely be subject to legal challenge, particularly if it swung an election.

The Washington Blade reports :
A group of more than 50 LGBTI rights advocates on Friday met with a high-ranking Vatican official and renewed their calls for the Catholic Church to condemn laws that criminalize consensual same-sex sexual relations.
ILGA World in a press release said the activists met with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, and presented him with “the preliminary findings of a research project” that focuses on the criminalization of consensual same-sex sexual relations in the Caribbean. National LGBT Bar Association Executive Director D’Arcy Kemnitz, ILGA World Co-Secretary General Luz Elena Aranda and IBM Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Tia Silas are among those who met with Parolin.
“On receiving the research, Cardinal Parolin pointed out that the church is against all forms of violence, and supports respecting the dignity of all persons,” said ILGA World. “He also vowed to convey all information to the Holy Father to continue the dialogue.”
America Magazine reports :
The delegates requested that the church declare that “human dignity implies the respect of every person as created by God” and “hence criminalization of L.G.B.T. people is today, as in the darkest times in the history of humanity, a manifestation of irrational hatred for that which is different from the norm and that homophobia is, in effect, a feeling of hatred and rejection which the church condemns, wherever it takes place.”
The group also asked that the Catholic Church “call upon the international community to recognize that criminalization of homosexuality and any form of consented intimate acts, sexual or not, between adults is an intolerable affront to human dignity.”
Gay City News reports :
The pope was notably absent after attendees said he backed out of plans to attend the meeting and make a “strong statement” endorsing the decriminalization of homosexuality. The Vatican did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the meeting or the pope’s absence.
Helen Kennedy, who attended the meeting in her capacity as the executive director of a Canadian LGBTQ human rights group known as Egale Canada, told Gay City News that it was unfortunate that the pope decided not to attend the meeting.
“However, I don’t think that the relevance of the meeting is lost on any of us,” she said in a phone interview from Rome shortly after the meeting concluded. “We are still very encouraged by the meeting that we had. We are still hopeful that a strong statement will soon be coming from the Vatican.” Share"

Redefining gender and sexual identity is the “greatest threat” to the moral fiber of America, said former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, and the fault lies with the Church.“The biggest threat to biblical principles today is the failure to apply a biblical standard of maleness and femaleness,” Huckabee told The Christian Post during a sit-down interview last week in Anaheim, California. “We are creating this illusion that there is no gender, there is no identity, and I’m blaming the Christian Church.”
Huckabee explained that California’s introduction of “no-fault divorce” in 1970 created the mindset that marriage “wasn’t really that important” and that one “could go in and out of it without a second thought.” Prior to that time, some kind of marital fault had to be demonstrated before a divorce could be granted. “So I’m not really that surprised that same sex-marriage has become in vogue because the Christian Church were the ones who essentially abdicated a strict responsibility about what biblical marriage should look like.” Mike Huckabee identifies ‘biggest threat’ to moral fiber of US, why it’s the Church’s fault (EXCLUSIVE) https://t.co/nasXJIrWzS

U.S. Denial of Safe Harbor Compounds Venezuelas Crisis - Just Security,www.justsecurity.org,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.justsecurity.org/63469/u-s-denial-of-safe-harbor-compounds-venezuelas-crisis/,"by Mariam Iskajyan
April 3, 2019
Horrendous political, economic, and public health conditions in Venezuela are spurring one of the worst exoduses of people in Latin America’s memory. The United Nations estimates that the number of Venezuelan refugees and migrants will grow to 5.3 million by the end of 2019, should conditions continue to deteriorate. Many of them are undertaking dangerous journeys by foot.
Yet even as U.S. President Donald Trump threatens military force to achieve the regime change he’s calling for in Venezuela — which could fuel even more displacement and human suffering — his administration has accelerated deportations from the United States, complicated Venezuelans’ efforts to obtain visas, and imposed numerous obstacles to asylum seekers.
Venezuelans rank first in the number of U.S. asylum applicants by nationality, and a disproportionately high 45 percent of those cases were denied in U.S. immigration courts last year. Meanwhile, according to State Department records , the United States has not resettled a single Venezuelan refugee in years.
If the United States is serious about supporting the Venezuelan people, Congress has several initial pathways to provide urgent protections for Venezuelans seeking refuge, and to help ensure that Venezuela’s mass displacement crisis is not compounded.
First, Congress must immediately pass recently – introduced and widely-supported bipartisan legislation directing the administration to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuela. For decades, the TPS program has served as life-saving immigration relief, protecting people from forcible return to countries where their lives or freedoms would be at risk.
More than 72,000 Venezuelans and their U.S.-born children and families could benefit from TPS, and the ongoing conditions in Venezuela satisfy the statutory criteria for TPS designation under Section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Denying TPS for Venezuela could lead to mass deportations back to conditions of suffering, and in a worst-case scenario, even starvation and death. Parents could be faced with the difficult decision of whether to take their U.S.-born citizen children with them to their unsafe country of origin or leave them behind in the United States.
In addition, Congress must revitalize the U.S. refugee and asylum systems and provide robust support to regional refugee host nations like Colombia . For more than two years, the Trump administration has been systematically dismantling the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program and backlogging the U.S. asylum system. It has, for example, rallied against landmark international agreements , set historic-low refugee resettlement goals and failed to meet them, illegally turned away asylum seekers, and further militarized the southern border.
To disrupt this trend, Congress should pass legislation like the GRACE Act , which would set a minimum annual refugee admissions goal of 95,000 and enact other reforms that preserve and expand initiatives to fortify refugee rights and protections.
Ultimately, solidarity with displaced peoples must not stop at humanizing borders and resettling refugees. Instead, we need a renewed commitment to confronting the drivers of forced migration, including failed U.S. foreign policies like blanket sanctions and previous attempts at regime change that have bolstered hardliners and handed them a narrative to solidify their power.
Doing so requires: 1) acknowledging that the conditions perpetuating the crisis in Venezuela — government-sanctioned human rights abuses, food and medical shortages, and rampant crime and corruption — do not have military or simple solutions; and 2) pursuing human-centered, multilateral diplomacy to help achieve stability, accountability, and a negotiated political transition that upholds all Venezuelans’ desire for safety and self-determination.
Human displacement worldwide is at historic proportions, driven by fast-spreading authoritarianism, man-made humanitarian crises, and rampant racism, militarism, and inequality at home and abroad. At such a time of global stress, solidarity with refugees and migrants must guide our foreign policy. Venezuelans fleeing crisis have already faced insurmountable obstacles, heartbreak, and trauma in the pursuit of sanctuary. We must not make this pursuit impossible.

EU condemns Venezuelas move to prosecute Juan Guaid POLITICO,www.politico.eu,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-condemns-venezuelas-move-to-prosecute-juan-guaido/,"Updated 4/4/19, 2:47 PM CET
The EU on Thursday condemned efforts in Venezuela to prosecute Juan Guaidó, considered by many Western countries as the country's head of state.
“The EU rejects the decision taken by the non-recognized National Constituent Assembly to lift Juan Guaidó’s parliamentary immunity. This decision constitutes a serious violation of the Venezuelan constitution, as well as of the rule of law and separation of power,” the EU said in a statement.
“These acts undermine a political way out of the crisis and only lead to further polarization and escalation of tensions in the country,” the statement said.
In February, European countries including France, Germany, Spain and the U.K. officially recognized Guaidó as interim president of Venezuela, after President Nicolás Maduro rejected an EU deadline to call a snap election.
Tens of thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets in January to express their anger over spiraling inflation, a persistent shortage of basic goods and electoral fraud. They also demanded the resignation of Maduro , who was inaugurated for a second term as president on January 10.
Guaidó used an article of Venezuela’s constitution to declare himself interim president, arguing that Maduro's reelection last year was rigged and that there was therefore no democratically elected president available."

Eden Hazard to Real Madrid has to be one of the longest-running transfer rumours there has been.
The magical Belgian’s name is never far away from a headline suggesting he is on his way to Spain but as of now, he remains a Chelsea player.
The Stamford Bridge side will be desperate to ensure that remains the case but it is beginning to look less and less likely with each passing day.
Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane has repeatedly stated his admiration for Chelsea’s talisman and it is a well-known fact that the Spanish super club tends to get what they want.

UNSUNG HERO: Man saves Johnston City woman at concert,www.wsiltv.com,Evie Allen,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.wsiltv.com/story/40261001/unsung-hero-man-saves-johnston-city-woman-at-concert,"WILLIAMSON COUNTY -- In this week's Unsung Hero, a Marion businessman is being credited for saving a Johnston City woman's life.
The two were at a concert in Nashville when the woman got seriously sick. He quickly drove nearly three hours to get her back home, where she was rushed to the emergency room.
Lisa Basler and Jon Mcanelly share a love for country music. The two first met several years ago at Herrin Fest, and have been meeting up at concerts ever since.
Jon is the owner of Neat Cut Lawn Care & Dirtwork in Marion.
""He's my concert buddy,"" said Lisa.
About a year ago, Lisa surprised Jon with tickets to see his favorite country music artist, Kacey Musgraves.
""Oh, I was excited. I was going to go to the show anyway. I was going to wait until closer to time to buy tickets,"" said Jon.
In late February, the two drove to Nashville to see Kacey. After the opening act, Lisa said she began to feel sick.
""She was bent over and, I mean, people next to me were looking at her. Everyone was looking at her like, 'there's something wrong with this girl,'"" explained Jon.
""After the second song, I was like, 'no, I can't do this to him.' The third song came on and I just seen the gleam and the glow in Jon's eyes. You know, he had just waited so long,"" added Lisa.
Much to Lisa's surprise, Jon grabbed their stuff, got the car and rushed her to her home in Johnston City.
""I could tell she wasn't doing good. I mean, I was ready to get out of there,"" said Jon.
It was an almost three-hour drive and Jon had to pull over twice.
""My body just was totally shutting down and I don't even remember the ride home,"" recalled Lisa.
""To be honest with you, I was 100-percent nervous of what was going to happen,"" added Jon.
When they got back, Lisa's mother rushed her to the E.R., where she said the doctor told her her potassium was so low it was life-threatening.
""He said, 'whoever brought me back, just got me back in time,'"" said Lisa.
But Jon only recently found out how bad Lisa's health was that night.
""Her sister came to work and said, 'you saved Lisa's life.' And I was like, 'what?' She started telling me details because {Lisa} was afraid to tell me. She goes, 'no, I was there, the doctor told me, he said, if you wouldn't have gotten her back at a certain time, she wouldn't be here today, or she would have had a major stroke or something bad would've happened,'"" said Jon.
Lisa says, just knowing Jon cared enough to get her home, still chokes her up today.
""I'm just so thankful that he did,"" said Lisa.
Jon says he was just doing what a good friend does. Lisa said she has to take multiple potassium pills daily and will have to undergo more tests because doctors now have concerns about her heart.
She said she had no idea how important potassium is to the body so she hopes to encourage others to get their potassium checked.
Lisa and Jon plan to go see Kacey Musgraves again in September."

The United States made decisions about Iran. US recognized Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization and targets allies in Lebonan parliament.
The United States is preparing sanctions against allies of Lebanon's parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri on account of his longstanding ties with Hezbollah and Iran, The National reported.
Two MPs and Mr Berri's spokesman are expected to land in Washington on Sunday for several days of talks with US officials aimed at minimising the scope of any sanctions.
US is also reportedly preparing to designate IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization, the first such designation of another country’s military, as early as next Monday, Al-Masdar News reported.
The designation might come as early as Monday, three US officials told Reuters and the Wall Street Journal, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Pakistan made another step towards peace - Release of 360 Indian prisoners,ednews.net,,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://ednews.net/en/news/world/361361-pakistan-made-another-step-towards-peace,"1 2 3 4 5 Pakistan made another step towards peace - Release of 360 Indian prisoners A- A A+
Pakistan will release 360 Indian prisoners this month, the foreign office said on Friday, as the nuclear-armed neighbours scale back from a confrontation that prompted world powers to urge restraint.
Tension has been running high since a suicide car bombing by Pakistan-based militants in Indian-controlled Kashmir killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police on Feb. 14, but the risk of conflict rose dramatically on Feb. 27, when India launched an air strike on what it said was a militant training base.
The following day Pakistan shot down an Indian fighter jet and captured its pilot who was later released.
“Pakistan has decided that 360 Indian prisoners – having breakup of 355 fishermen and five civilians, who have completed their term of sentence, will be released,"" Mohammad Faisal, spokesman for the Pakistan Foreign Office, told reporters.
He said the prisoners would be released in four batches starting from April 8.
“We hope that India will reciprocate this,” the foreign office spokesman said."

Impressive loan and deposit balances, higher interest rates and efforts to grow fee income will continue supporting revenue growth.

Hello, I worked as a cleaner in a large fitness center, located in Vancouver, BC, for 3 years. I have good references, and I am a very experienced custodian. There were times when my job required that I clean the male facilities. These duties were performed before closing time, a 'Female custodian working' sign was placed on the door, and I would always announce my presence before entering; consequently, there were never any embarrassing encounters. I have moved away from Vancouver, and I applied for the custodial position at gym whose members are predominantly male. I was told that janitorial closets and equipment were housed in the male locker room, thus it was not appropriate for a female custodian to be working there. When I asked about the female locker room, I was told that 'the female desk clerk cleans it because we have so few female members, and it is very small.' I assured them that I would act professionally, and I showed them my references, but they told me that the job was open only to men! I felt so undervalued and ashamed. Are their actions legal?"

Herman Cain Is Donald Trump’s Latest Unqualified Fox News Personality Chosen For The Federal Reserve,www.newshounds.us,Brian and Ellen,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.newshounds.us/herman_cain_donald_trump_latest_unqualified_fox_news_personality_federal_reserve_040519,"Herman Cain Is Donald Trump’s Latest Unqualified Fox News Personality Chosen For The Federal Reserve Posted by Brian and Ellen -18pc on April 05, 2019 · Flag
Although former Fox News contributor, noted ignoramus and accused sexual harasser Herman Cain has some experience at the Federal Reserve, unlike Stephen Moore, the other unqualified former Fox Newser picked by Trump for another empty seat on the board, nobody should be any more reassured by this choice.
Bloomberg reported that from 1992 to 1996, Cain “served as a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, as well as deputy chairman and then chairman.” However, Think Progress called this an advisory position with no decision-making authority. But Cain's more significant credential was probably the pro-Trump super PAC Cain co-founded in September. Bloomberg notes that the PAC's website features a photo of Trump and states “We must protect Donald Trump and his agenda from impeachment.”
In 2013 , Cain became a Fox News contributor. It’s not clear when that contract expired but he remains a frequent guest on the network. As such, he has a long trail of ignorant partisanship.
In 2016, Cain “diagnosed” Hillary Clinton as not healthy enough to run for president: CAIN: She needs to get medical help . It’s one thing to have one coughing spell but to continue to have multiple coughing spells and they get long and long and longer, her staff is not being sensitive to the fact that maybe she needs to step back. They don’t want to do that because it might continue to add to a lot of the rhetoric and a lot of the perception that maybe she’s not healthy enough to do this.
In 2013, after Cain complained on The O’Reilly Factor about the “severe ignorance” of Obama supporters, The Rachel Maddow Show blog noted the irony: [Cain] doesn’t know China has nuclear weapons . He said the U.S. can’t launch a military strike against Iran because it’s “ very mountainous .” He thinks “ Cuban ” is a language. Asked about an international military conflict in Libya, he said , “I got all this stuff twirling around in my head.” Asked about foreign heads of state, he said he doesn’t care who “the president of Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan” is.
On top of all that, Cain has been accused multiple times of sexual harassment . Funny how abusive people are such a recurring theme in Trump World.
And speaking of abusive people, let’s not forget about incompetent hack Stephen Moore, Trump’s pick for the other open seat on the Federal Reserve board. Since our last post about Moore, when we reported about the $75,000 tax lien against him, quite a bit more has come out. From today's Washington Post : A court in Fairfax County, Va., ordered Stephen Moore [in 2013] to sell his home in order to pay his ex-wife, Allison Moore, the money he legally owed her but had failed to pay for months. Stephen Moore ended up paying $217,000, although only after the court sent several police officers, two realtors and a locksmith to his home to change the locks and prepare the property for sale, records show. […] Allison Moore says in the divorce filing that she was a good wife who “suffered emotional and psychological abuse by [Stephen Moore] throughout their marriage,"" including having to flee the family’s home with their youngest child in fall 2009. Stephen Moore signed a document saying he ""admits all allegations” in his ex-wife’s divorce complaint. […] Stephen Moore has repeatedly praised marriage and homes with a “devoted husband and wife” as the best cure against poverty and other social ills. He wrote a commentary in the Washington Examiner titled “ Marriage, the surest economic stimulus ,” in October 2014, about a year after the court had to compel him to pay his ex-wife child support and alimony. Allison Moore says her husband slept with his mistress in the family home and stated at a graduation ceremony for one of their sons, “I have two women, and what’s really bad is when they fight over you.""

Diamond And Silk: Climate Change Caused By Earth’s Rotation,www.newshounds.us,Ellen,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://www.newshounds.us/diamond_silk_climate_change_caused_earth_rotation_040519,"Diamond And Silk: Climate Change Caused By Earth’s Rotation Posted by Ellen -7585.60pc on April 05, 2019 · Flag
Were Diamond and Silk lying or just shockingly ignorant again when they told Fox & Friends viewers that “with the Earth rotating at 1,000 miles per hour, OK, 365 days of the year, we subject to feel climate changing a little bit?”
The lying duo who once opined that Russia got its nukes from Hillary Clinton was Fox & Friends’ idea of credible experts to attack Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’ Green New Deal. The discussion began with a clip from an Instagram video of Ocasio-Cortez comparing climate change deniers to those who opposed the civil rights struggle.
Cohost Steve Doocy didn’t mention a single scientific credential held by either member of the real-life sisters who make up the pair. Apparently, being black Trump lovers was all the expertise needed for Donald Trump’s morning policy briefing .
Here’s the ""scientific insight"" the dishonest dumb-dumbs gave the viewers (via Media Matters ): LYNETTE HARDAWAY (DIAMOND, FOX NATION PERSONALITY): Listen, you have to realize that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she's reckless, she's clueless, and she have a vacuous mindset. ROCHELLE RICHARDSON (SILK, FOX NATION PERSONALITY): Right. HARDAWAY: First of all, civil rights have nothing to do with climate change. First of all. And then second of all, her Green New Deal is a green new scam that we must stay away from. Now, I know that she's worried about climate change, but she need to talk to Mother Nature. RICHARDSON: That's right. HARDAWAY: Because with the Earth rotating at 1,000 miles per hour, OK, 365 days of the year, we subject to feel climate changing a little bit. But not to the tune where we have to dismantle everything and start the Earth back over again. It's a absolutely no for us.
OK, scammers gotta scam and who am I to attack a pair of “social media stars,” as cohost Ainsley Earhardt described them, for cashing in on being part of the 7% of African Americans who approve of Trump?
But there’s no excuse for anyone on Fox News to pretend they’re anything else.
Yet, as Hardaway called the Green New Deal a “scam,” Earhardt murmured her approval.
There was a long moment of silence after Hardaway offered her ridiculous and grammar-challenged pronouncement on the cause of climate change. But not one of the three cohosts questioned a word.
Eventually, Earhardt (who once criticized President Obama’s de-segregation efforts in Westchester County) prodded the sisters to attack AOC on race. “What do you think about, she was talking about how our grandkids are gonna look back if we don’t take this seriously, if we resist taking action on climate change, our grandchildren are gonna look at us the way we might look at great grandparents that might have protested civil rights changes?” Earhardt asked.
The sisters might not know much about climate change or Russia or Hillary Clinton or nuclear weapons but they surely recognize a prompt to start racial and political hate mongering when they hear one and they know how to exploit it: HARDAWAY: Well, first of all, when we talk about civil rights, let’s talk about the Democrat party – RICHARDASON: That’s right. HARDAWAY: - that did not want black people to have civil rights. RICHARDSON: That’s right. HARDAWAY: So some of the things that she’s conjuring up and talking about, she represent the party that bestowed these types of uh, foolery and ignorance on black people. RICHARDSON: Mmm Hmmm. HARDAWAY: So she need to look at her own party if she want to bring up civil rights. Don’t look at the climate, look at her own Democrat party. RICHARDSON: That’s right.
Not one of the three cohosts pointed out that the anti-civil rights Democrats long ago became Republicans .
Instead, cohost Brian Kilmeade changed the subject to prod the sisters to attack Beto O’Rourke’s criticisms of Trump’s bigotry against immigrants
Hardaway declared that O’Rourke “reminds me of a slave owner” because he wants to have immigrants work for “slave wages.”
No push back from the hosts there, either.
This time, cohost Steve Doocy asked for the ladies' “thoughts” on Trump’s threat to close the border with Mexico and/or put tariffs on cars coming in.
Not surprisingly, the pair called that “a great idea.” “He can shut down immigration altogether!” Hardaway opined. She then offered up her deepest thoughts on the economic aspects of immigration.

Lawrence Jones Gets The Mocking He Deserves For Wearing Tactical Vest For Border Report,www.newshounds.us,Ellen,04-05-2019,2019,4,http://www.newshounds.us/lawrence_jones_gets_mocking_he_deserves_wearing_tactical_vest_border_report_040519,"Lawrence Jones Gets The Mocking He Deserves For Wearing Tactical Vest For Border Report Posted by Ellen -7586.60pc on April 05, 2019 · Flag
Fox News contributor Lawrence Jones probably got a different kind of attention than he had hoped for when he donned a very small tactical vest to visit the border. After being relentlessly mocked on Twitter, Jones dubiously claimed the Border Patrol made him do it
This is the tweet that got the mockery going: Coming up on @FoxNews live from the border. pic.twitter.com/aRlNQxrO1x — Lawrence Jones III (@LawrenceBJones3) April 4, 2019
And this is Jones’ explanation: Border patrol made me wear it. Now, who's the fool? https://t.co/8ytTDLATth — Lawrence Jones III (@LawrenceBJones3) April 4, 2019
Jones, who is also the editor-in-chief at Campus Reform, has the official title at Trump TV of Fox News contributor . But on his Twitter feed , he bills himself as a “@seanhannity correspondent.” Also “Storyteller.” He certainly seems to have gotten that part right. Because in addition to falsely suggesting the border is a war zone, Jones did not make a persuasive case that the was all the Border Patrol’s fault. As Raw Story noted, real journalists Jacob Soboroff and Soledad O’Brien , each of whom have done extensive reporting from the border, say they have never worn a vest. This is totally ridiculous.I have never once worn a bulletproof vest at the border, nor has CBP ever asked me to -- even while on a chase with Border Patrol to apprehend migrants in remote Arizona desert in the middle of the night.Because. The. Border. Is. Not. A. War. Zone. https://t.co/Q1V95e7N5x — Jacob Soboroff (@jacobsoboroff) April 4, 2019 No I’ve done a zillion ride alongs—and was just reporting our entire show from the border—and nope, no vest. https://t.co/LG3R7bhk9k — Soledad O'Brien (@soledadobrien) April 4, 2019
Mediaite asked U.S. Customs and Border Protection about Jones’ vest “but did not receive a response in time for publication.”
However, on Twitter, Jones continued to play up the notion that he had been in danger: Thanks for keeping me safe, K. pic.twitter.com/M3aA2QIZWV — Lawrence Jones III (@LawrenceBJones3) April 5, 2019
Jones told the Hannity viewers Thursday night, “I’m going in danger with these Border Patrol agents to report on this story,” the fake correspondent said. “In order to do my job and the border agents to do their job, I had to come with this vest that they supplied.” However, when Hannity noted that an agent was nearby, thus suggesting that Jones could get an official statement about the vest, Jones took a pass.
However, while he was at it, Jones played the part of a Border Patrol agent, too. “Last night, as we’re going into the thick of it, we caught two Chinese nationals!” Jones said excitedly. A banner on the screen read, “LAWRENCE JONES JOINS BORDER PATROL FOR INSIDE LOOK AT BORDER SECURITY EFFORTS IN LAREDO, TX.” Now, I don’t think Fox meant “join” in the sense of “become part of” but you wouldn’t know it from the way Jones talked. He told another anecdote about seeing migrants trying to cross the border, saying, “We didn’t catch them but we did make them return back to Mexico!”
Look, I don't really care who came up with the idea that Jones wear a vest. The point is, it's clear that Jones didn't need it and that someone thought the optics of making the border look like a war zone was a good idea. Clearly, Jones was using his report to boost his standing in Trump TV World. Whether that's for a job in the Trump administration or something bigger on Fox News doesn't really matter. What counts is that the credulous Trump TV viewers, along with the Fan in Chief, probably believed the BS.
Watch Jones play a warrior on TV below, from the April 4, 2019 Hannity.

Serious Data Breach of Thousands of Vets Info in Tacoma WA -Dave Strider | Justice News Network,www.justicenewsnetwork.com,,04-05-2019,2019,4,https://www.justicenewsnetwork.com/serious-data-breach-of-thousands-of-vets-info-in-tacoma-wa-dave-strider/,"4-5-19 Questions about the Mystery Box of veterans letters with full Names Addresses and FULL Social Security numbers for each individual are NOT getting answered. What Gives?
On March 25 David received a letter from the VA announcing changes in is VA pension procedures. Later that evening UPS delivered a twenty pound box addressed to him with a very strange return address by UPS dropped on his back door step.
Not knowing what was inside the unexpected mystery box, Dave opened it only to find a copy of the VA letter he had received earlier in the day by US Mail. This copy of his letter was rubber-banded on top of the stacked paper and yet on top of a yellow cover sheet. Below that were maybe a couple thousand copies of that same letter, some, like Dave’s, with other attached information.
Keep in mind this box was delivered at almost 6PM at night on a Monday with a very strange annotation that this package was returned to sender. Really? Dave never sent this pile of paper with veteran pensioner confidential information, so how did it come to be delivered to his back door anyway?
The following day the Seattle media was contacted and the only outlet that actually made any effort to follow up on the story was NBC King5 TV. Yes they sent out a video team to shoot footage for a reporter follow up.
More on all that in the next report. Meanwhile these critical unanswered questions remain:
1. How did this box come to be delivered to Dave and who was the box intended for in the first place?
2. Why were these printed copies shipped off site and not transmitted to the destination digitally? Who printed them and for what purpose? The veteran pensioners already had their copies mailed by the post office before the box was delivered to Dave.
3. How many more boxes of these letters were there? And since all the copies of the veterans letters in this box seem to be East Coast residents, and not in Dave’s West Coast region, WHY is his info included? And why was his letter placed on top and separated from all others? Stranger still, it was apparently used to create the “Returned To Sender” label through the UPS Overgoods Department. And how did it originate from somewhere in Pennsylvania?
About Dave- He Says that We Americans have been getting the short end of the stick ever since Nixon declared the War on Drugs and implemented Healthcare for Profit in 1973. Then when Reagan dropped top tax rates from 70% to 28%, began union busting in 1981, going all “Right To Work” on average Americans, and allowed his pals at ALEC to write our Laws; and well, here we are today.
