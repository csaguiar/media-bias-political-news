We have problems both with illegal border-crossers and with visa overstays. The remedy for one may not be the remedy for the other, but that's not an argument implementing one or the other. A remedy for both problems is urgently needed, and both remedies should be implemented.
A simple expedient for visa overstays would be to reinstate the provision that foreigners present in this country on longer-term visas should be required once yearly to report to the immigration authorities and register their current addresses. This was the rule for a long time but was dropped some time in the 1990s. We see the results, and it is hard to conclude they are accidental."

Brooks said that if the Mueller report goes to Congress, “it’ll go to the public. And so, in my view, that’s a much more dangerous option. … Maybe Barr is not an honest broker here. We don’t know. I think he’s handled it reasonably well. But at least let Barr issue what — the next piece of the report that he’s going to issue. Let’s take a look at it and see what we think then. But the idea of just basically leaking out the whole report, which I think would be inevitable, seems to me, a miscarriage of justice.”

Apartment resident’s 10-year battle to clear out illegal car park | Free Malaysia Today,www.freemalaysiatoday.com,Predeep Nambiar,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/04/07/apartment-residents-10-year-battle-to-clear-out-illegal-car-park/,"Apartment resident’s 10-year battle to clear out illegal car park By - April 7, 2019 7:30 AM Cars parked along the common driveway at Taman Pekaka apartments, in Bayan Lepas. Despite repeated notices, the 100-odd lots are still in use, and are a hindrance to emergency vehicles.
GEORGE TOWN: A Bayan Lepas resident who has spent the past 10 years complaining about 100 car park bays at the driveway of his apartment building has questioned why orders to remove them have been ignored.
Dr Bala Anthony, 59, said he had written to three different authorities since 2008, who have issued orders for the removal of the car parks bays at the building in Taman Pekaka, Sungai Dua. But they have remained on the driveway.
The orders were issued by the Penang Island City Council (MBPP), Fire and Rescue Department (Bomba) and the Commissioner of Buildings, he said.
Anthony questioned how the management of the apartment block at Taman Pekaka have been able to carry on, apparently with impunity.
He said the driveway of the building was clear of obstacles when it opened in 2002. In November 2008, the building management decided to demarcate 100 car park bays in the driveway area. Dr Balavendrian Anthony showing a notice from the Fire and Rescue Department in 2011 to the management to remove all car park lots. Nothing has been done since.
He said his objections were ignored by the management, and he wrote to the authorities and Consumers’ Association of Penang (CAP).
In 2011, the Bomba declared the car parks to be illegal, and ordered that they be removed. In 2016, the Bomba director-general Wan Mohd Nor Ibrahim, wrote to him, confirming that the parking lots were indeed illegal and that they should be removed immediately.
He said the Commissioner of Buildings of the Penang Island City Council had also ordered the car parks to be removed.
FMT has seen the letters sent by Bomba and MBPP to Bala and has confirmed their authenticity.
He said that in 2015, rescue vehicles were unable to attend to a woman who had accidentally reversed her car off the third storey car park and and fallen on the driveway below.
The fire engine and paramedics had difficulty entering the driveway to rescue her and the firemen lugged their equipment from their engine parked outside. A letter by the Fire and Rescue director-general in 2016 also ordering the removal of the parking lots.
“We have nearly 2,000 people living here. In an emergency, how are the ambulances or fire engines to enter the area? The authorities have ordered that the car parks be removed, yet the management seems to be able to act with impunity.”
Bala said that, as a protest, he had only paid half his monthly maintenance fees.
When asked by FMT, a man who identified himself as the building supervisor with the name “Rahman” refused to comment on the car park problem but said that Anthony’s refusal to pay the maintenance fees in full had been taken to the Housing and Strata Management Tribunal.
FMT has contacted the mayor, Yew Tung Seang, for comment. TAGS"

Netanyahu vows to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected - Breitbart,www.breitbart.com,,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/news/netanyahu-vows-to-annex-west-bank-settlements-if-re-elected/,"Netanyahu vows to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected AP 6 Apr 2019
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Saturday to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if re-elected, a dramatic policy shift apparently aimed at rallying his nationalist base in the final stretch of the tight race.
Netanyahu has promoted Jewish settlement expansion in his four terms as prime minister, but until now refrained from presenting a detailed vision for the West Bank, seen by the Palestinians as the heartland of a future state.
An Israeli annexation of large parts of the West Bank is bound to snuff out any last flicker of hope for an Israeli-Palestinian deal on the terms of a Palestinian state on lands Israel captured in 1967.
A so-called two-state solution has long been the preferred option of most of the international community. However, intermittent U.S. mediation between Israelis and Palestinians ran aground after President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital early in his term. The Palestinians, who seek Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem as their capital, suspended contact with the U.S.
More recently, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a plateau Israel captured from Syria in 1967. The move was viewed in Israel as a political gift by Trump to Netanyahu who is being challenged by former military chief Benny Gantz.
Polls have indicated a close race, though Netanyahu’s Likud Party is expected to have a better chance than Gantz’s Blue and White slate to form a ruling coalition. Polls forecast more than 60 out of 120 parliament seats for the Likud and smaller right-wing and ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties
On Saturday, Netanyahu gave an interview to Israel’s Channel 12 TV at the top of the prime-time newscast. Netanyahu portrayed the U.S. policy shifts on Jerusalem and the Golan Heights as his achievements, saying he had managed to persuade Trump to take these steps.
Netanyahu pledged that he would not dismantle a single Jewish settlement and that Israel would retain control of the territory west of the Jordan River — the West Bank. More than 600,000 Israelis now live on war-won lands, two-thirds in the West Bank.
The interviewer asked why he hadn’t annexed some of the larger settlements during his current term. “The question you are asking is an interesting question, whether we will move to the next stage and the answer is yes,” he said, adding that the next term in office would be fateful. “We will move to the next stage, the imposing of Israeli sovereignty.”
“I will impose sovereignty, but I will not distinguish between settlement blocs and isolated settlements,” he said. “From my perspective, any point of settlement is Israeli, and we have responsibility, as the Israeli government. I will not uproot anyone, and I will not transfer sovereignty to the Palestinians.”
In any partition deal, the more isolated Jewish settlements would likely have to be uprooted to create a viable Palestinian state.
Saeb Erekat, a veteran former Palestinian negotiator, said he held the international community, especially the Trump administration, responsible for Israel’s policies.
“Israel will continue to brazenly violate international law for as long as the international community will continue to reward Israel with impunity, particularly with the Trump administration’s support and endorsement of Israel’s violation of the national and human rights of the people of Palestine,” he said in a statement.

Former Auburn Coach Tommy Tuberville To Challenge Doug Jones In Alabama Senate Race,www.newsweek.com,Donica Phifer,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.newsweek.com/former-auburn-coach-tommy-tuberville-challenge-doug-jones-alabama-senate-race-1388201,"On 4/6/19 at 7:33 PM EDT Share U.S. American politics Congress
Former college football coach Tommy Tuberville is setting his sights on a new career.
Tuberville, who served as head football coach for Auburn University from 1998 to 2008, announced Saturday that he intends to challenge Alabama Sen. Doug Jones for his seat in 2020.
""After more than a year of listening to Alabama’s citizens, I have heard your concerns and hopes for a better tomorrow. I am humbled to announce the next step -- I will be a @GOP candidate for US Senate. I invite you to join my team,"" Tuberville posted to Twitter.
Jones, a Democrat, won the seat in a 2017 special election after Jeff Sessions was confirmed to serve as the first Attorney General for President Donald Trump. Tuberville joins Rep. Bradley Byrne in the Republican race for the general election.
Tuberville spent 21 seasons coaching football, including stops at the University of Mississippi, Texas Tech and the University of Cincinnati. His most successful coaching tenure came at Auburn where Tuberville led the Tigers to an 85-40 record and eight consecutive bowl game appearances. Tuberville was named SEC Coach of the year twice, in 1997 and 2004, and also earned Associated Press Coach of the Year honors in 2004 after Auburn finished the season 13-0 and ranked No. 2 in the AP's end of season poll behind the University of Southern California.
Though the senate campaign will be the first run for an elected office for the former coach, Tuberville previously weighed entering into Alabama's governor's race in 2018.
""I think I could make a difference if I do decide to run (for governor of Alabama) because it is all about sales, organization and leadership,"" Tuberville told Mobile, Alabama radio station WNSP in February 2017. ""Some people say you haven't been in politics. I've been in a big part of it. This whole country is politics now. If I figure and I think I can help this state - which I think I could - then I might give it a run.""
""I want things to get better. It seems like we have no plan and no vision for the future. We kinda live year by year, and I'm tired of us losing. We're not winning. We win in football in this state. People won a lot of championships, but we can't get out of the cellar in state government,"" Tuberville said.
However, weeks later, Tuberville said he had decided not to enter the race as he wanted to continue coaching. He then endorsed Tommy Battle for governor. Battle later lost in the Republican primary to incumbent Kay Ivey. Ivey, who served as Lieutenant Governor from 2011 to 2017, was sworn in as Alabama's Governor in April 2017 after Robert Bentley resigned from the position. She was elected to a full term in 2018.
""I really intended to pull the trigger on [running for governor], leadership is what’s needed in a lot of these political venues, but when Bentley was impeached and Ivey moved up, I figured she’s a good Auburn lady and hey let her go. She’s probably going to run again, I pulled out and the rest is history,"" Tuberville told WBRC in October 2018 .

Ron Wyden says every day without the Mueller report is ‘indicative of a cover-up’ Posted at 6:59 pm on April 6, 2019 by Brett T. Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
It’s done, finally. Robert Mueller submitted his report on his investigation into Russian collusion with the Trump campaign in 2016 and submitted it to Attorney General William Barr. Barr released a four-page letter saying Mueller found no evidence of collusion and there would be no further indictments.
The Resistance had pinned its hopes on the Mueller report for two years, and this called for an emergency response. Obviously, the first step was to discredit Barr and assume he was covering up the substance of the report (which of course found … something). Rep. Jerry Nadler filed to subpoena the unredacted report. Protesters gathered across the country Thursday night to demand the release of the report. They just know there’s something in there that will take down Trump.
So it’s utterly irresponsible for Sen. Ron Wyden to suggest that the longer the report goes unreleased, the more likely it is there’s a cover-up. Sen. Ron Wyden: ""Every day that goes by without the American people getting the actual report… is indicative of a cover-up."" pic.twitter.com/4UflzqRncq
— The Hill (@thehill) April 6, 2019
Does he know that 1) the report is going to be released once it’s been redacted, and 2) Robert Mueller himself is assisting with the redactions? The guy who spent two years investigating is in on the cover-up?
These clowns just will not give it up. Hillary lost. Repeat: Hillary lost. The honest and honorable thing to do would be to apologize for the hoax than to continue to carry on the charade, but then their gullible minions don't want to hear that.
— pirkster (@pirkster_jax) April 6, 2019 Shame on you @RonWyden implying a “cover up” when there’s no such thing going on. Barr has already told you when to expect the report. Now stop your stupid political games – we’ve had enough of the lies. No Collusion No Obstruction @CNN @MSNBC #MTP https://t.co/WcF4qaLyT2"

Grassley Snarks at the History Channel: ‘UNBELIEVABLE…There is Real History On’ by Tamar Auber | Apr 6th, 2019, 7:33 pm
Sen. Chuck Grassley had some thoughts about the History Channel and its programming Saturday afternoon.
“From Land of the UNBELIEVABLE THE BELIEVABLE,” Grassley snarked on Twitter. “Hurry there is real History on the Channel.” From Land of the UNBELIEVABLE THE BELIEVABLE. Hurry there is real History on the Channel
It is unclear what the Senator dubbed “real history” but on Saturday, the channel ran back-to-back episodes of The Men Who Built America: Frontiersmen featuring stories of Davy Crockett, Tecumseh and Andrew Jackson.
Grassley has also offered previous Twitter clues about what he does not consider history at all.
Last year, Grassley made it clear Swamp People is not real history, or at least in his view. Oh the joy of watching ppl rope an alligator on “Swamp people” on History Channel. G
— ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) April 21, 2018
His gripe is also long-running since back in 2012, Grassley tweeted this: “Ocassionally I turn to History channel hope to c history. Whenevr will the history channel hv a real old fashion histry.” Ocassionally I turn to History channel hope to c history. Whenevr will the history channel hv a real old fashion histry program
— ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) January 7, 2012
Prior to his History Channel snark, Grassley also took a jab at Democrats who he insisted needed more “patience.” Dems now going after AG Barr digging up anything they can to discredit him Barr said he’d release the Mueller report mid month. Dems need to hv patience Let law+process work but they can’t get over that Pres Trump is our constitutionally elected president
Neither the Democrats nor the History Channel has responded to Grassley’s tweets.

President Trump's Executive Order Targeting Foreign Techies Will Hurt American Companies and Workers - Reason.com,reason.com,Stuart Anderson,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/archives/2017/04/20/president-trumps-executive-order-targeti,"Immigration authorities opened up the annual H-1B visa lottery for American companies that want to hire foreign tech professionals on April 3. And this week they announced that they received 199,000 petitions—or more than double the number allowed. Clearly, current law fails to meet the needs of American employers. But instead of relaxing this program as would befit a president who promised to remove the regulatory handcuffs on Foter.com American businesses, President Donald Trump has issued a ""Buy American, Hire American"" executive order that will pass new regulations making it even more difficult to recruit high-skilled foreign workers—never mind the overwhelming evidence that these workers help, not hurt, American jobs and wages.

Immigration Donald Trump Executive Order The H-1B cap is reached every year because the annual 65,000 limit—0.04 percent of the U.S. labor force—was set in 1990. Since then, technological advances like the World Wide Web and smartphones have turbocharged the demand for high-skilled technical labor. ""Mobile app developers"" -- a highly prized job today—didn't even exist 15 years ago. However, when companies recruit for tech talent at U.S. universities, they find Americans, to be sure—but the vast majority consists of international students, who make up an astounding 77 percent of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and 71 percent in computer science.
An H-1B visa is often the only way for these students or high-skilled foreign nationals educated abroad to work legally in America. That means new restrictions on H-1B visas would likely block the only feasible means for any foreign-born computer specialists, engineers, doctors or scientists to work in the United States.
Despite this, several conservative bills in Congress are trying to squash even this meager program. A bill co-sponsored last year by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions wanted to force employers to pay well above market rates for these tech professionals and also require international students from U.S. universities to work for 10 years outside the United States before they could work in America. Another bill co-sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) would require companies to prove to labor authorities that they tried to recruit an American before hiring a foreign national, which will expose employers to massive legal liability for every such hire.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration's pledge to build a wall around excessive regulation has a giant hole in it when it comes to immigration, as his executive order directing federal agencies to implement new rules and policies discouraging the hiring of H-1Bs shows. Part of this will no doubt involve stepped up site visits by Department of Labor investigators to companies with H-1Bs in their employ. ""The moves seemed designed to appease President Trump's supporters, who urged him to make good on campaign promises to eviscerate the H-1B program,"" reported the Washington Times .
To discredit the hiring of all high-skilled foreign nationals and set the stage for draconian legislative and regulatory measures, Congressional critics and anti-immigration activists have skillfully publicized stories alleging that companies lay off U.S. workers and replace them with H-1B visa holders. However, in these stories—and the same ones involving Disney or Southern California Edison have received repeated media attention, including recently on 60 Minutes— what is actually happening is that companies are focusing on their primary business line and contracting out functions considered either non-essential, underperforming or technologically out of date.
Everyone sympathizes with the U.S. workers at Disney and Southern California Edison who lost their jobs. The question is whether these personal misfortunes require changes in the law. After all, the U.S. Department of Labor reports that every year in America approximately 20 million people are laid off or discharged from their jobs for all kinds of reasons .
I interviewed nearly a dozen advisers who evaluate bids and help companies figure out whether to contract out work and they confirmed the following:
First , companies decide whether to outsource and, therefore, on the need to make layoffs, before a contract is put out for bids, meaning they would be unlikely to know details like whether or to what extent visa holders will service the new contract.
Second, experts in outsourcing say companies are replacing the employees with new systems and technology, often with an offshore element, not making one-for-one replacements. H-1B visa holders generally play a limited, specialized role, primarily in gathering information from existing employees to help the transition from the old to the new contract, according to Alex Kozlov of the management consulting firm Alsbridge. So, experts say, whatever the appearance, the laid off employees are not actually training their foreign replacements, as is often alleged.
Third , new technologies, such as cloud computing and automation, affect far more jobs than anything related to foreign nationals on skilled visas.
There is no evidence to support the central claim of H-1B critics that Disney, Southern California Edison or other companies decided to lay off workers because they found a ""loophole"" in U.S. immigration law.
Consider what happened at Southern California Edison: Its decision to outsource, as Computerworld pointed out, was preceded by a highly critical outside management report that the company commissioned following a tragic shooting of two managers in its IT department in 2011. The report revealed ""dysfunction"" in the department, prompting the company to outsource its IT functions. Likewise, a source at Disney told me the 2014 decision simply continued Disney's long history of contracting out IT services, including a $1.3 billion deal with IBM and Affiliated Computer Services back in 2005, nine years earlier, that resulted in a reported 1,000 layoffs.
Setting aside those stories, none of the 40 economists polled in February 2017 by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business believed that scaling back H-1B visas would lead to a material rise in jobs for U.S. workers. To the contrary, nearly all economists think the entry of high-skilled foreign nationals benefits the U.S. economy as a whole. And many believe that cutting back on H-1Bs would hurt American worker themselves.
Estimates by University of California-Davis' Giovanni Peri and Kevin Shih and Colgate University's Chad Sparber suggest that the presence of foreign STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) workers accounts for about 30 to 50 percent of the aggregate productivity growth in the United States between 1990 and 2010. Furthermore, they found a percentage point increase in the share of foreign STEM workers in a city's employment mix ""increased the wage growth of native college-educated labor by about 7 to 8 percentage points.""
Similarly, Madeline Zavodny, a professor of economics at Agnes Scott College, found that foreign and U.S. workers complement each other, with each additional 100 approved H-1B professionals being associated with an additional 183 jobs among U.S. natives. Likewise, a paper by economists William R. Kerr (Harvard Business School) and William F. Lincoln (University of Michigan) examined patenting and concluded, ""Total invention increases with higher [H-1B] admission levels primarily through the direct contributions of immigrant inventors.""
A few outlier and rather flawed studies have excited restrictionists, however. One published by John Bound and Nicolas Morales of the University of Michigan and Gaurav Khanna at UC-San Diego in February argues that native computer worker wages and jobs would have risen more during the 1990s if all H-1B visa holders had been blocked from the U.S. But what restrictionists fail to mention is that the study also concludes that the entry of H-1B visa holders makes essentially everyone else—namely, consumers and businesses—in America better off. More to the point, the authors concede there was actually great improvement for computer workers during this period. Employment of computer scientists and software developers rose by 161 percent from 1990 to 2000, and median real wages rose by 18 percent. In effect, their claim only is that wages and jobs among U.S. natives would have gone up a little more, not that either actually fell during the 1990s.
But even this modest impact is debatable. That's because the authors assumed that during the eight years they examined—1994 to 2001— the U.S. was ""the only producer of IT"" in the world, thereby eliminating the most obvious response companies would (and did) have: hiring outside the United States. That assumption strains credulity, since faced with current and past immigration restrictions, nearly all major and even mid-sized U.S. companies have set up or expanded offices and placed high-skilled people abroad. Policymakers who support restrictions on high-skilled immigration by assuming U.S. companies will not respond by placing even more work abroad are mistaken."
Safeguarding The Health of People and Planet Through Food,www.globalissues.org,,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.globalissues.org/news/2019/04/06/25178,"Safeguarding The Health of People and Planet Through Food Safeguarding The Health of People and Planet Through Food by Tharanga Yakupitiyage ( united nations ) Saturday, April 06, 2019 Inter Press Service
UNITED NATIONS, Apr 06 (IPS) - Food sustainability, both in production and consumption, is at the heart of a healthy public and planet.
On World Health Day, it is increasingly clear that a radical transformation of the global food system is sorely needed. Mothers and their children gather at a community nutrition centre in the little village of Rantolava, Madagascar, to learn more about a healthy diet. Credit: Alain Rakotondravony/IPS
""In recent years we have witnessed a gradual departure from sustainable food models, such as the Mediterranean Diet, in favor of models rich in animal-based proteins, processed foods with high percentages of sugar, salt, fat or low in fiber,"" said Barilla Foundation's nutritionist and researcher Katarzyna Dembska.
""These food solutions can expose us, in the long run, to very expensive diseases or health problems. Choosing sustainable diets, in addition to reducing the impact on the environment, can positively affect longevity,"" she added.
The EAT-Lancet Commission echoed similar sentiments in a report, stating: ""Food is the single strongest lever to optimize human health and environmental sustainability on Earth. However, food is currently threatening both people and planet.""
According to the Barilla Foundation, more than 650 million people over the age of 18, equal to 13 percent of the world's population, are obese.
Obesity, caused by unhealthy diets, is among the risk factors for non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, respiratory problems and diabetes.
New research by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) found that unhealthy diets are responsible for 11 million deaths worldwide per year, even more than smoking tobacco.
The assessment shows that diets high in sodium and low in whole grains, fruit, vegetables, and nuts all contribute to diet-related deaths. Heart attacks and strokes are the main diet-related causes of death.
The study also found that an improvement of diet could prevent one in five deaths worldwide.
""This finding suggests that dietary policies focusing on promoting the intake of components of diet for which current intake is less than the optimal level might have a greater effect than policies only targeting sugar and fat, highlighting the need for a comprehensive food system interventions to promote the production, distribution, and consumption of these foods across nations,"" researchers said.
Obesity and diet-related diseases additionally incur high long-term expenses, which ""weigh on the entire global economic and health system,"" Barilla Foundation said.
Obesity costs the global economy an estimated $2 trillion, representing almost 3 percent of the world's gross domestic product (GDP).
In Italy alone, costs associated to cardiovascular diseases amount to almost $17 billion while the treatment of cancer costs approximately $7 billion.
But it is not just the way we consume food that threatens our health, but also its production.
Food production is one of the largest contributors to climate change, accounting for a third of greenhouse gas emissions.
According to U.N. University, emissions from livestock account for almost 15 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Beef and dairy alone make up 65 percent of all livestock emissions.
In fact, meat and dairy companies are on track to become the world's biggest contributors to climate change, surpassing the fossil fuel industry.
Already, climate change has taken a toll on health including in 2003 when temperatures rose 20-30 percent above average in Europe, resulting in over 30,000 deaths.
The World Health Organization (WHO) predicts that climate change will cause 250,000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition and heat stress between 2030 and 2050.
But this can be prevented with a shift in how we eat and produce food.
""The care of our health really starts from our plate,"" Dembska said.
For instance, the Double Environmental Food Pyramid combines the classic food pyramid alongside a new environmental pyramid where foods are categorized according to their ecological footprint. Namely, red meat is at the bottom of the environmental pyramid with high environmental impact while being at top of the classic pyramid with low nutrition.
A shift to a Mediterranean diet, similar to the classic food pyramid which emphasizes plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, is estimated to add 4.5 years of life expectancy.
The EAT-Lancet Commission's proposed planetary health diet is similar, requiring the consumption of red meat to be cut by half while vegetables, fruit, and nuts must double.
""The global adoption of healthy diets from sustainable food systems would safeguard our planet and improve the health of billions,"" they said.

The point is Andy and Larry Wachowski figured they’d hit on the perfect wrinkle for a classic postmodern nerd franchise — the Star Wars of our generation. And if you say, “Hang on, old boy, surely Star Wars is the Star Wars of our generation?”, I’d say, nah, it’s too 1930s radio serial, and its grandiosity is plonkingly earnest and squaresville instead of as coolly meta as Keanu Reeves’ too-bored-to-act acting style. The Matrix was quickly followed by The Matrix Revisited , The Matrix Reloaded , The Matrix Recycled , and Neo got paleo pretty quick. None of the sequels could quite match the initial red-pilling of surface reality, and so they simply dug the rabbit hole deeper. Zion is the last outpost of humanity – but maybe it’s merely a Matrix-within-the-Matrix? Ever consider that, huh? And what if Neo himself is a Matrix-within-the-Matrix-within-the-Matrix? He was supposed to be “The One”– but maybe one of the others is The One. Maybe The One flew over the cuckoo’s nest.
By the sequel, the Wachowskis’“innovative visual style” (a Cecil B De Mille-scale computer game peopled by sullen pouters) was looking a lot less innovative: they did all the same things they did in the first film all over again, just more expensively and even more arbitrarily — the scene in which Keanu/Neo is fighting a hundred guys in black and doesn’t win, doesn’t lose, but just finds himself fighting vainly the old ennui and so buggers off after 15 minutes pretty much sums it up. By the second movie, Keanu had perfected his morose blank look, and fine actors like Laurence Fishburne were turning in performances so clunkily solemn you’d think they were auditioning for George Lucas. As usual, the subterranean city of Zion proved to be just another generic dystopian underground parking garage; and the orgiastic dance party looked like a weekend rave in Huddersfield.
But by then the Matricians or Matricists or Matrons or whatever they’re called were hooked. In the original film, Neo discovers that the meaning of our lives is an illusion; in the first sequel, the meaning of the film is an illusion. It doesn’t make much sense as it’s flying by, and it makes even less if you pause the tape and copy out all the dialogue. The rabbit hole doesn’t go deep at all; the buck stops about four inches down.
Oh well, no two of us can expect to agree on every thing, right? I loved ’em all then, and I still love ’em now. I am willing to grant that the second one was the weakest of the series; that extended Zion-party sequence was indeed tedious at best. It felt like filler, a superfluous time-killer without any real narrative point or purpose. That stipulated, however, I did still like at least some of the rest of Reloaded , and thorougly dug Revolutions start to finish."

Whoop! There it is!
The latest campaign reports are in — the last ones before the Coral Gables election on Tuesday — and, just as expected, Mayor Raul Valdes-Fauli got a windfall from real estate developers and the construction industry.
More than $80,000 in seven days ! That must have set some kind of campaign record in Coral Gables. Not all of it is development — there is some healthcare bundles in there, and Versailles owner Felipe Valls gave $3,000 — but most of it is related to the industry: Developers, real estate investors, architects, engineers, property managers, vendors and subcontractors. Read related: Mayoral race in Coral Gables is a do over on over development
That last report, covering March 29 through April 4 , brings the mayor’s total to $254,125. More than half of that has been collected in the last two reports, or since March 15. And it’s where the development money has come out. All but $5,000 has been reported in the last week, after nearly 4,000 people voted via absentee ballots.
Perhaps Valdes-Fauli wanted thousands of people to vote absentee before they knew the building industry was funding his re-election.
And boy are they coming out now to rescue Raul. It’s almost as if they’re afraid that former Commissioner Jeannett Slesnick will beat the incumbent and try to stop or curb the upzoning of properties to maximize developers’ profits.
One of the special interest contributors bundling maximum $1,000 donations was NP International, the developer behind both the Gables Station and Paseo de la Riviera projects on U.S. 1 — the latter is going up now and photographed here — which were given height and density variances and have drawn much residential ire. NP had only contributed $1,000 as of the last report through March 28. But in one week, they made up for any lack of enthusiasm with another $6,000 from multiple companies and their two officers in Minnesota.
Ladra can’t help but wonder how much more they will give Valdes-Fauli in the next four days that we won’t hear about until after everyone has voted.
It’s not the only out of state money. This latest report has another $13,000 coming from real estate investors in New York, New Jersey, North Carolina and Texas.
Allan Morris donated another $5,000 through his companies and Jorge Perez of Related gave at least $2,000.
Valdes-Fauli has spent $221,389 of the bank, leaving at least $32,000 for expenses in the next four days.
Slesnick has the whole $100K nut she loaned herself, which she hasn’t touched really. She has spent $73,000 of the $82,000 she raised, $20K in the last week — not an easy task when you do it $100 and $200 at a time with a $500 thrown in now and then from all different people rather than in bundles of $1,000 from the same dozen dudes.
And while there may be some related “development” money through real estate interests and the supporting industry, Slesnick’s contributors are also almost exclusively Coral Gables residents — another good sign for her on Tuesday.
Because the developers in Minnesota, Texas, North Carolina, New Jersey and New York who gave to Valdes-Fauli can’t vote for Valdes-Fauli.

Editor’s Note: This will be a work in progress which I will return to throughout the evening. I’ve been really enjoying studying, learning and writing and getting nostalgic about a different epoch of our history. Do you remember the time progressives tried to prohibit alcohol?
Alcoholism was a scourge in post-Civil War America. Why not simply ban the devil’s drink?
As I thought more about it, the progressive attempt to ban alcohol in the 1920s through the Eighteenth Amendment wasn’t all too different from the current progressive crusade to ban “hate” in America through putting White America in a cultural straight jacket. It hasn’t succeeded in abolishing “hate.” Instead, political correctness has only driven our discourse underground on the internet.
The progressive educated urban middle classes were the people who were behind Prohibition. They are also the constituency behind political correctness. In this case, the goal isn’t to ban a physical drink like alcohol, which was a utopian fantasy given the fact that alcohol (and its costs and benefits) has been part of our culture since ancient times. No, the current crusade against “hate” is even dumber than Prohibition because it involves forcibly deracinating Europeans and stripping them of a positive sense of identity, any sense pride in their own culture and heritage and making them jump through the hoops of a fake moral code (i.e., the -isms and the -phobias) which was concocted and spread through the mass media and by academic elites in the 20th century for the sake of abolishing tribalism, ethnocentrism and “hate” which is a normal emotion that every human being on the planet experiences.
Quite simply, the Prohibition of White people of European ancestry having a healthy sense of identity is likely the dumbest, most utopian social crusade in all of human history.

Do you feel that game console giants hold you over a barrel by making you subscribe to a service to play online? You might have an ally in your corner. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority is investigating Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony to see if their online service practices violate consumer protection law. It wants to know whether their auto-renewal policies are fair, how easy it is to get a refund (or cancellation) and whether or not the terms of service grant these companies too much power.
The move is the second part of the CMA’s response to a “super-complaint” on the loyalty penalty, or the tendency for some companies (not just in gaming) to punish long-serving customers by making it difficult or costly to leave.
Officials emphasized that the investigation had only started, and that it might only take “enforcement action” if it believed the companies weren’t being fair.
While it’s hard to know what the CMA will say, there are areas of concern. Sony has raised prices for PlayStation Plus more than once, and there’s no guarantee that you’ll get the same volume of free games or other perks (even if there are good reasons for it, such as hardware obsolescence). And yes, auto-renewal is common — even Switch owners taking advantage of the Twitch Prime promotion have to turn renewal off. Those aren’t necessarily illegal, but they’re certainly pain points.

The Carbon Offset Market: Leveraging Forest Carbon’s Value In The Brazilian Amazon,www.eurasiareview.com,Eurasia Review,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.eurasiareview.com/07042019-the-carbon-offset-market-leveraging-forest-carbons-value-in-the-brazilian-amazon/,"By Eurasia Review
As companies seek and are required to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, the world’s carbon markets are expanding. A government-run program in the Amazon rainforest in northwestern Brazil transforms forest carbon value into public wealth by focusing on labor rather than land rights.
In the Brazilian state of Acre, some of the revenue from carbon credits is distributed to rural laborers and family farmers without land rights. A Dartmouth study just published examines Acre’s forest carbon program, and the benefits and risks associated with this approach, including the potential impact on labor, state power and efforts to prevent deforestation. The study’s findings are published in the Journal of Peasant Studies .
“In resource rich areas in the rainforest, powerful actors have often profited at the expense of indigenous peoples and other local communities, who are often displaced from their land. Efforts to value forest carbon threaten to do the same. Through Acre’s carbon value program, in contrast, the state government attempts to create an inclusive, green economy in a way that also expands its social welfare initiatives. There are also risks to this approach” says study author, Maron Greenleaf, a lecturer and research associate in the department of anthropology at Dartmouth College.
In many other forest carbon credit programs, land has to be privately owned. In contrast, “through Acre’s system, poorer people are not excluded from forest carbon’s value because of their lack of formal land rights. Rather, many benefit from it,” explained Greenleaf. “This is an example of how we’re seeing environmental policy being harnessed to create new kinds of economies.”
Acre’s 2010 System of Incentives for Environmental Services (SISA) focuses on environmental services, including carbon sequestration, to protect the approximately 86 percent of the state (total of 164,000 sq km) that is forested. SISA’s carbon program is an example of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), which prioritizes sustainable forestry management and conservation practices to combat climate change.
With Acre’s 2017 agreements with Britain and Germany, and others, demand for Acre’s forest carbon value appears to be relatively strong. One such agreement is Acre’s 2010 Memorandum of Understanding with California. This month, the California Air Resources Board, which regulates the carbon market within the state, will determine whether or not to adopt the “Tropical Forest Standard.” Considered to be a model of tropical forest protection, Acre is the most likely jurisdiction to be approved under the Standard, which would allow for its carbon credits to be purchased by California-based companies. This would be the first time that REDD+ credits are accepted into a cap and trade market.
Greenleaf’s insights on Acre’s carbon offset program are based on her fieldwork conducted in 2012 and 2013-14. As part of her research, she interviewed “rural producers,” who practice small-scale farming for subsistence and markets, and engage in local wage labor and/or cattle ranching. These include “posseiros,” who have land claims based on informal possession.
In the study, Greenleaf discusses the complexity of the land tenure process in Acre. There may be land conflicts and land usage, which may be dictated by culturally specific arrangements, including overlapping individual and/or collective claims– nuances that are not reflected on maps. She explains how if REDD+ was not administered by the Acreano Government, many rural laborers and family farmers might not be able to participate in this program; obtaining formal title from the government can be challenging or next to impossible, requiring resources and documentation that many lack.
Shifting allocation of carbon value to “green labor” provides an alternative that bypasses some of the challenges associated with the recognition of land rights, but does not eliminate them, as seeking land title is not only a path for upward mobility for the poor but also integral to identity and status. Even if rural laborers lack sufficient evidence to demonstrate formal land claims, Greenleaf explains how the small economic benefit that they may receive from the state could help make their land claims “less easily dismissed” in the future.
At the same time, she points out that this model reinforces Acre’s state power and enables the government to make decisions over the land “as forest carbon’s presumptive owner.” The question looms as to whether Acre’s progressive, carbon value program will continue on its path of inclusive forest protection, particularly in the wake of the 2018 Brazilian elections, and whether other entities will look to adopt this model.

Countries That Help Working Class Students Get Into University Have Happier Citizens,www.eurasiareview.com,Eurasia Review,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.eurasiareview.com/07042019-countries-that-help-working-class-students-get-into-university-have-happier-citizens/,"By Eurasia Review
A study has shown that ‘inclusive’ educational policies that help working class students access higher education, such as delaying streaming children according to their ability until they are older, lowering the cost of private education, and increasing the intake of universities so that more students can attend all act to reduce the ‘happiness gap’ between the rich and poor.
Research shows that the more educated people are, the happier they tend to be. Unfortunately it is also the case that children from privileged, wealthy backgrounds tend to do better at school and are more likely to go to university than children from poorer working class backgrounds. This means that by the time they reach adulthood, there is a big ‘happiness gap’ between middle class kids and their peers from disadvantaged backgrounds.
However, a new study, published in the British Journal of Sociology of Education shows that this doesn’t have to be the case, and that the link between social class and happiness can be moderated by educational policies that offer more opportunities to disadvantaged children.
Researchers from Umeå University in Sweden used the European Social Survey, a European wide survey carried out every two years since 2002, to calculate the life satisfaction and happiness of almost 15,000 people aged 18-29 years from a total of 25 countries.
They then looked at the impact of four different education policies on the wellbeing of citizens. These included streaming, or tracking children according to ability at a young age; providing low cost education to all; allowing universities to increase their number of places so that more young people could attend; and giving students a second chance to go to university if they did not get the right grades.
The results showed that, as expected, young people from privileged social backgrounds were more satisfied with their life than those from disadvantaged backgrounds. However the size of this disparity was affected by the types of educational policies adopted by European countries.
For example in countries that delayed streaming, or tracking children according to ability until a later age, there was a negligible difference in life satisfaction between different social classes.
“The age at which children were streamed had no effect on the wellbeing of middle class students, however children from impoverished backgrounds were significantly happier when streaming age was delayed,” says Björn Högberg from Umeå University, who led the study.
People from disadvantaged backgrounds were also happier in countries where the average cost of education was low, where universities increased their enrolment size, and when universities allowed second chance opportunities.
The gap in happiness between social classes was largest in Hungary and Bulgaria, where children are streamed at a very young age and there are limited second chance opportunities provided for students to go to university.
The UK and Germany also had significant ‘happiness gaps’, which in the UK was due to the very high costs of private education and the low enrollment levels of British universities.
Denmark, on the other hand was one of the most equal country in terms of the happiness of its citizens. It also had the most inclusive educational policies – tracking pupils at an older age, providing low cost private education, and giving children generous second chance opportunities to go to university.
“Among the wealthier western European countries, those with more inclusive education systems, such as Denmark, had smaller social differences (in fact none at all, on average) than equally wealthy but less inclusive countries, such as the UK or Germany,” says Högberg.
The study suggests that governments and other policymakers need to consider the wider impact of their education policies on society.
“Schools have the potential to have a huge impact on children and youth and on their life chances, but a narrow focus on academic outcomes such as test results provides only an incomplete picture of the consequences of education policies,” says Högberg.
“I would recommend that education policy, especially at higher levels, are designed such that the opportunity to access education, should one want to, is maximised, either through institutional measures, such as widening access for poorer students, or through financial measures – such as lowering student fees.” "
"Rocket Fuel That’s Cleaner, Safer And Still Full Of Energy",www.eurasiareview.com,Eurasia Review,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.eurasiareview.com/07042019-rocket-fuel-thats-cleaner-safer-and-still-full-of-energy/,"By Eurasia Review
Research published in Science Advances shows that it may be possible to create rocket fuel that is much cleaner and safer than the hypergolic fuels that are commonly used today. And still just as effective. The new fuels use simple chemical “triggers” to unlock the energy of one of the hottest new materials, a class of porous solids known as metal-organic frameworks, or MOFs. MOFs are made up of clusters of metal ions and an organic molecule called a linker.
Satellites and space stations that remain in orbit for a considerable amount of time rely on hypergols, fuels that are so energetic they will immediately ignite in the presence of an oxidizer (since there is no oxygen to support combustion beyond the Earth’s atmosphere).
The hypergolic fuels that are currently mainly in use depend on hydrazine, a highly toxic and dangerously unstable chemical compound made up of a combination of nitrogen and hydrogen atoms. Hydrazine-based fuels are so carcinogenic that people who work with it need to get suited up as though they were preparing for space travel themselves.
Despite precautions, around 12,000 tons of hydrazine fuels end up being released into the atmosphere every year by the aerospace industry.
“This is a new, cleaner approach to making highly combustible fuels, that are not only significantly safer than those currently in use, but they also respond or combust very quickly, which is an essential quality in rocket fuel,” says Tomislav Frišči?. He is a professor in the Chemistry Department at McGill, and co-senior author on the paper along with former McGill researcher Robin D. Rogers.
“Although we are still in the early stages of working with these materials in the lab, these results open up the possibility of developing a class of new, clean and highly tunable hypergolic fuels for the aerospace industry,” says the first author, Hatem Titi, a post-doctoral fellow who works in Frišči?’s lab.
Friscis is interested in commercializing this technology, and will work with McGill and Acsynam, an existing spin-off company from his laboratory, to make this happen. "

Megyn Kelly Hoping To Stage A Right-Wing Media Comeback,www.newshounds.us,Ellen,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://www.newshounds.us/megyn_kelly_hoping_stage_right_wing_media_comeback_040619,"Megyn Kelly Hoping To Stage A Right-Wing Media Comeback Posted by Ellen -7587.60pc on April 06, 2019 · Flag
Like a bad penny, Megyn Kelly seems poised to turn up again in the media once Donald Trump goes away, assuming he ever does. But I've got some unsolicited advice for her to do better by doing good.
While she sits at home counting the $69 million she made from her ill-fated and truncated NBC career, The Daily Beast reports that Kelly is plotting a return to right-wing media right around the time Trump may lose re-election: [“A source close to Kelly” said]: “The urgency to fire it back up for the next day to three months is pretty low. But ever? Like in a year? Much higher. It’s not like she’s sprinting and saying ‘I gotta get there now.’ But she does want to get informed and get to a place where she can make a really good decision. So she’s sort of setting herself up for that now and patiently going about that process. But no doubt, the engines will fire up at some point.” […] Kelly herself predicted—to a TMZ crew that miraculously ran into her one January night on an Upper East Side sidewalk—that she’ll be back on television sometime this year. The encounter was a prelude to what looked to media observers like a planted Feb. 26 Page Six item headlined “Megyn Kelly eyes October return for 2020 race.”
It’s unlikely that Kelly will get a spot on a major network any time soon given that she has managed to antagonize viewers and co-workers at NBC and Fox News . Unless she starts donning a MAGA hat and starts railing about the “deep state,” it’s unlikely she’ll fit in again at Fox right now.
But after 2020? That could be a whole different scenario. Lachlan Murdoch didn’t completely shut the door last November, just before the midterm elections: ""I'm a big fan of Megyn's. I like her a lot. We didn't want her to leave Fox when she did,"" the CEO of New Fox said at The New York Times' annual DealBook Conference. ""Having said that, I'm very happy with our current lineup on Fox, and we won't be making any changes there.""
The Daily Beast suggests that Kelly’s return may be via a lower-profile (and lower-paying) media presence, maybe at Newsmax, Sinclair or even via podcast. But it's easy to see her returning to Fox News, especially if it's a bit less of a Trump PR operation at some point next year. ""Several industry insiders"" told The Daily Beast they also think Fox a logical place for Kelly to reboot.
But I’ve got some unsolicited advice for Kelly: She’s got enough money to keep her and her family more than comfortable for the rest of their lives. Why not use this time to do something for a cause greater than herself? Nothing would rehabilitate her racist image better than putting some serious efforts and money into a mission on behalf of African Americans. Not incidentally, it could actually bring the kind of reward and benefits that neither money nor fame could ever deliver."
Mark Zuckerberg Calls for Government Regulation of Political Speech on Facebook,reason.com,Ken Shultz,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/blog/2019/04/05/mark-zuckerberg-calls-for-government-reg#comment_7748615,"Facebook's p/e is average for the S&P 500 at about 22.
A year ago, when traders' estimates of Facebook's growth prospects were higher, the multiple on their earnings put their p/e at 32.
If Facebook's p/e were 32 instead of 22 today, back of the napkin, they'd be worth another $200 billion. You think they took a $200 billion haircut because they're so progressive?
The reason investors won't pay such a high multiple for their earnings today is because they don't expect Facebook's growth to be what they expected it to be a year ago. There are a number of reasons for that, but one of them is that they can't seem to get mainstream advertisers to stay on board for fear that their advertising will end up on posts that advertisers do not want to be associated with. Bud's Gun Shop might not even want their advertising showing up next to gun videos in the aftermath of a school shooting--much less McDonalds."

The advertisers with the deep pockets will not follow Facebook where Facebook needs to go for growth. Hell, they're scared that the safe stuff isn't as safe as they thought. That's a serious problem for Facebook's growth prospects going forward--regardless of whether the company is actually a communist conspiracy to trick people into not being able to say terrible things about gay people."

But the notion that there's someting odd about a variety of conservative who defines his beliefs by refrerence to what he opposes strikes me as, er, odd. The whole point of conservatism is ""conserve"". Opposition to change.
Obviously it gets a bit complicated in detail because opposing change is a pretty feeble approach if you give up as soon as the change lever has been pulled, and immediately become a supporter of the newly positioned lever position. Thus a conservative necessariy contains a reactionary admixture - so resistance to change may include enthusiasm for reversing recent, and even some not so recent, changes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he had not read Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report investigating contacts between his 2016 campaign and Russia that his Democratic opponents say should be released in full.
“I have not read the Mueller Report yet, even though I have every right to do so,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Only know the conclusions, and on the big one, No Collusion.”
U.S. Attorney General William Barr has said he plans to make public a redacted copy of the nearly 400-page investigative report into Russian interference in the 2016 election by the middle of this month, if not sooner.
On March 22, Mueller completed his 22-month probe and Barr
sent a four-page letter to Congress two days later outlining the main findings. Barr told lawmakers the investigation did not establish that members of Trump’s election campaign conspired with Russia, but also did not exonerate the president on obstruction of justice.
Barr said he had concluded there was not enough evidence to show that Trump committed the crime of obstruction. But news media reports this week said members of Mueller’s team were unhappy with the way Barr, a Trump appointee, had characterized the report’s conclusions.
Asked in an interview with Fox and Friends Weekend about calls for the release of the full confidential report, Trump said: “It’s really up to the attorney general, whatever he wants to do.”
In another tweet, Trump called the report “a total waste of time.”
Barr did not meet a demand by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives to provide the unredacted report to lawmakers by April 2.
He told Congress in a letter last week he must redact material that was presented to a grand jury, as required by law, as well as information that could reveal U.S. intelligence agencies’ sources and methods. Congressional Democrats have indicated they will fight those redactions in court if the subpoena is ignored.
Russia’s government has denied interfering in the U.S. election.

Cruel Intentions: The 90’s Musical,www.chicagonow.com,Let's Play,04-07-2019,2019,4,http://www.chicagonow.com/lets-play/2019/04/cruel-intentions-the-90s-musical/,"By Let's Play , Saturday at 4:41 pm The Manipulative World of Dangerous Liaisons
Long gone are the days of the squeaky clean teen movies that adolescents in the '50s were accustomed to watching. The movie screen image of the young Sandra Dee who appeared in ""A Summer Place"" as Troy Donahue's teen girlfriend or twenty to thirty years later with family-friendly television shows like ""Dawson's Creek, Saved By The Bell or The Wonder Years.""
The producers of television shows started to see that life wasn't as wholesome, with segway into 90's featured shows like ""90210"" which focused on typical issues such as sex, date rape, homophobia, animal rights, alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic violence, eating disorders, antisemitism, racism, teenage suicide, teenage pregnancy, and AIDS.
The late nineties ruled the big screen with dark teen dramas, Fear, The Craft, Jawbreaker, and Wild Thing. Then came a film featuring a high school era narrative filled with dangerous liaisons that captured the nuances of adolescence.
Cruel Intentions took its characters into a twisted new territory of scheming and manipulation by playing terrible games with people's lives. This modern-day tale was inspired by the 18th-century classic novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos. It has been almost twenty years since Roger Kumble cult-hit film Cruel Intentions made its way to the big screen, via the bickering and wicked-minded step-siblings who controlled much of the social lives of the students in an affluent NY prep school.
Cruel Intentions: The 90s Musical has found a new home at Broadway Playhouse at Water Tower Place with nostalgic music and lyrics by various artists and a book by Roger Kumble, Lindsey Rosin, and Jordan Ross. The game of dangerous liaisons is set around Manhattan's Upper East Side in 1999.
The musical is centered on two wealthy step-siblings Sebastian Valmont (Jeffrey Kringer) a kind of Don Juan who seduces women, and his equally conniving stepsister Kathryn Merteuil (Taylor Pearlstein). Kathryn is a sexy cinematic firebomb, dressed in a blood-sucking red bustier with a cocaine-stuffed crucifix strung on her neck; who enjoys corrupting any incoming first-year student that she feels might be her competition.
Using hit songs from the 1990s as its central theme, two diabolically souls wreak havoc on anyone within their path of secrets, lies, temptation, and the cruelest game of all; love. Sebastian and Kathryn are willing to hurt anyone in their game of ""Who's Next,"" as they seek pleasure at the expense of others.
As the two step-siblings set their eyes on their next target of seduction, a wager is made to deflower the innocent, elite Manhattan prep school headmaster daughter, Annette Hargrove (Betsy Stewart) before the end of summer break. There's one problem Annette publicly stated in a ‘Seventeen' magazine that she would wait to have sex with a man until she falls in love and is married.
As Sebastian seeks to trick her by making her believe he is in love with her, a naïve Cecile Caldwell (Brooke Singer) is caught in Kathryn scheme to smear her reputation by speeding up her sexual awakening after learning that her ex-boyfriend and Cecile are dating.
If Kathryn wins the bet, she gets Sebastian's vintage 1959 Jaguar Roadster, and if Sebastian wins, he gets to sleep with Kathryn, the ultimate conquest.
The hilarity of this throwback musical is a part of the modern-day soap opera. It is intoxicating to watch especially with these two rich, spoiled step-siblings who are used to getting what they want.
We recommend you see the movie Cruel Intentions if you never saw it to enrich your enjoyment. The funny and nostalgia-fueled juke-box musical with a soundtrack of guilty pleasure pop hits is spot on with the storyline, and the musical score features some of your favorite throwback hits by Boyz II Men, Christina Aguilera, REM, *NSYNC, Britney Spears, that will take you straight back to the nineties, singing all night long.
If you are a child of the '90s or love 90's music, this play is definitely for you. NSYNC's ""Bye, Bye, Bye,"" The Back Street Boys, ""I Want It That Way, and I'm Only Happy When It Rains by Garbage was a crowd pleaser, but it was nothing like hearing the audience of Millennials screaming with Taylor Pearlstein sung ""Bitch,"" by Meredith Brooks.
If you are from the era of Echo Boomers, you remember that this 1997 song was on every women's playlist.
Casting directors Henry Russell and Bergstein, CSA does an excellent job with casting the perfect look-alikes lead from the original movie for the musical with a well-rounded cast that provokes habit in their classmate's lives. This musical by far isn't the best acting and singing you will see in Chicago Theaters; however, you will go home entertained.
Let's Play ‘Recommend' Cruel Intentions: The 90's Musical. It's a delightful treat.
Broadway Playhouse at Water Tower Cruel Intentions: The 90's Musical Created by Jordan Ross, Lindsey Rosin and Roger Kumble Based on the film by Roger Kumble Directed by Lindsey Rosin"

Beto: Amnesty for Illegals Will Make Angel Families 'Demonstrably Safer',www.breitbart.com,breitbart.com,04-06-2019,2019,4,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/04/06/watch-beto-orourke-amnesty-for-illegal-aliens-will-make-angel-families-demonstrably-safer-in-u-s/," Watch–Beto O’Rourke: Amnesty for Illegal Aliens Will Make Angel Families ‘Demonstrably Safer’ in U.S. JOHN BINDER 6 Apr 2019 Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX), a 2020 Democrat presidential candidate, says giving amnesty to all 11 to 22 million illegal aliens will make American citizens — and specifically, the Angel Families who have lost loved ones to illegal alien crime — “demonstrably safer” in the United States. During a town hall in Iowa this week, O’Rourke was asked about the thousands of Angel Families who have lost children, parents, grandparents, relatives, and friends to crimes committed by illegal aliens living in the U.S.
O’Rourke said, in response, that his plan to amnesty all illegal aliens living in the U.S. will make Angel Families and American citizens “demonstrably safer.” O’Rourke said he would only deport illegal aliens after they have committed a crime against an American citizen.
The exchange went as follows:
IOWA VOTER : I know you are for tearing down existing wall … and you’re basically for open borders. Have you ever met any Angel Moms here in Iowa? There’s a woman by the name of Michelle Root , about a hundred miles east of here. And her daughter Sarah was killed by a drunk illegal alien right after she graduated from college … what would you tell her about your immigration stance? [Emphasis added]
BETO O’ROURKE : First I would tell her — through you if you could get this message to her — that I am deeply sorry for your loss . And I would also share with you that I think I understand the spirit of your question, but the premise is incorrect. I’m not for open borders. I do think there are places where physical barriers along the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexican border makes sense. [Emphasis added]
…
We will be demonstrably safer when we know who is in this country and right now there are millions, there are millions in those shadows that we know nothing about today . Give them the chance to get right with the law. Come into the light of day . Contribute even more to the success of this country. If they have committed crimes, deport them back to their countries of origin. But if they are contributing to the success of our country, they’re raising U.S.-citizen children, let’s offer them a future here in the United States of America . [Emphasis added]
O’Rourke’s response to Angel Families comes as multiple Americans have been allegedly killed and murdered by illegal aliens over the last few months.
Alabama mother and school teacher Sonya Jones was most recently allegedly killed by an illegal alien from Guatemala who crossed into the U.S. two years ago. Likewise, Washington state police officer Ryan Thompson , a father of three children, was allegedly shot and killed by a 29-year-old illegal alien who has been living illegally in the U.S. since 2014, when he overstayed his H-2A visa.
Paige Gomer , a 28-year-old mother, was allegedly shot and killed in Oklahoma by an illegal alien last month. In Tennessee, an illegal alien has been charged with killing 22-year-old Pierce Corcoran in a hit-and-run crash days before New Year’s Eve. Similarly, an illegal alien in Nevada is accused of going on a killing spree to steal meth money, allegedly murdering four Americans in their homes.
Last Fiscal Year, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency arrested about 2,000 illegal aliens who had been either convicted of homicide or had pending homicide charges against them. Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) estimates that about 2,000 Americans die every year at the hands of illegal aliens.

"Lightning 6, Bruins 3: Tampa Bay ties record for most wins (62) in a season",www.providencejournal.com,Mike Loftus The Quincy Patriot Ledger,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.providencejournal.com/sports/20190406/lightning-6-bruins-3-tampa-bay-ties-record-for-most-wins-62-in-season,"By Mike LoftusThe Quincy Patriot Ledger Saturday Apr 6, 2019 at 8:12 PM Apr 6, 2019 at 8:12 PM
BOSTON — The tedious, but tense part of the waiting is over. The two games the Bruins had to play after locking in their playoff position have been completed.
Now it’s much more about anticipation. By the time they play their postseason opener against the Maple Leafs later this week, the Bruins will have practiced two or three times, attended several meetings and video sessions, and long forgotten Saturday’s 6-3 loss to the Lightning at TD Garden that ended the regular season.
“Let’s get it going,” said goalie Tuukka Rask. “A couple of days of rest and a couple of practices and that’s it. Best time of the year.”
Rask, who was recognized before the game for becoming the team’s all-time leader in wins back on Feb. 3, gave his detractors some ammunition by getting beat five times on 21 shots, the last goal a 50-foot wrist shot off the stick of Braydon Coburn that gave the Lightning a 5-3 lead just 13 seconds after Matt Grzelcyk brought the B’s to within 4-3 with 5:57 left in regulation.
Had there been anything at stake on Saturday, head coach Bruce Cassidy might have expressed concern. But the B’s nailed down first-round home ice with Tuesday’s 6-2 win at Columbus, where Rask made 32 saves against a hot team still fighting for a playoff berth. But it wasn’t like Saturday’s opponent was some slouch. The Lightning, who tied the NHL record for wins in a season (62 by Detroit in 1995-96), got a goal (41st of the season) and an assist (87th) from league scoring leader Nikita Kucherov and a shorthanded, unassisted breakaway goal from Steven Stamkos, who led the NHL’s most explosive team (325 goals) with 45.
“I don’t think (Rask) is that concerned about it, other than he’s a professional and wants to play well every time he’s in the net,” Cassidy said. “I believe he’ll be ready to go (for Game 1) and in good form, but that’s why we play the games. We’ll find out.”
Because the Bruins escaped Saturday’s game with no discernible physical damage, Rask will play behind the Bruins’ best available lineup when the best-of-7 series against the Leafs begins. That wasn’t the case on Saturday.
The Brad Marchand-Patrice Bergeron combination, a tandem in even-strength, shorthanded and power-play situations, got the day off, as did the defense pairing of Torey Krug (power-play quarterback) and Brandon Carlo (shorthanded standout). The B’s took a beating in Saturday’s special-teams battle as a result, going 0-for-2 on the power play while allowing a shorthanded goal, and killing only 1-of-2 shorthanded situations.
The power-play goal (Erik Cernak), followed eight minutes later by the Stamkos shorthander, wiped out the 2-0 lead the B’s built on first-period goals by David Krejci and Danton Heinen. Anthony Cirelli gave the Lightning its first lead with 3:01 left in the second; Kucherov stretched it to 4-2 in the first minute of the third.
The Lightning got only 22 shots on goal, though, and since Cassidy was using the game as something of a dress rehearsal for the Toronto series (which, if the Bruins win, could lead to them playing the league-leading Lightning in Round 2), the coach wasn’t too upset.
“We talked about certain things that they do similarly to Toronto,” Cassidy said. “For the most part, we did a good job.
“We still found a way to give up five goals, so we’ll look at that. … Team-wise, we checked some boxes, and other ones we didn’t quite hit.”
The Bruins weren’t hit with any injuries, though, and expect to have everyone but center Sean Kuraly (hand) and defenseman John Moore (upper body) available for Game 1.
“It’s always nice to have the team healthy, so we’re obviously feeling good about ourselves,” said Krejci, whose goal (20th) and assist (53rd) he scored in 2008-09 — his first full NHL season. “Now we’ve got a few days to get ready, get excited to get it started.”"

BOSTON — Playoff-bound teams often try out new combinations, or bring up new personnel, once a postseason position or opponent is guaranteed.
The Bruins took that concept to an extreme in the last two games of the regular season. Forwards Marcus Johansson and Charlie Coyle, who weren’t even in the organization at the beginning of the year, were teamed with Zach Senyshyn, who hadn’t played an NHL game before Thursday night in Minnesota.
“It felt really good,” said Senyshyn, who got in another game with Johansson and Coyle in Saturday’s regular-season finale against the Lightning. “Of course, it’s my first game and I don’t really know anything else, but playing with two extremely talented players like that always makes it a little bit easier.
“They made my first game really fun. They were really good with me on the bench. It was a nice first game.”
Senyshyn, a first-round draft pick in 2015 (No. 15 overall) who has spent almost two full seasons at AHL Providence, marked that first game with an empty-net goal that sealed a 3-0 win over the Wild. It came on the last of his four shots on goal, as he and the relatively new combination of Johansson (obtained from the Devils on Feb. 25) and Coyle (acquired from the Wild on Feb. 20) played a solid game.
Senyshyn, who had 14 goals and 24 points in 62 games at Providence before the Bruins called him up on Wednesday, is expected to return to the P-Bruins to help them try to lock down a Calder Cup playoff berth.
“I’m just trying to take it day by day,” he said. “It’s kind of been a little bit of a whirlwind the past couple of days, but it’s been a lot of fun.
Rest day for some
Brad Marchand got his second straight game off on Saturday, and was joined this time by linemate Patrice Bergeron and Noel Acciari. The defense pairing of Torey Krug and Brandon Carlo also got the day off. Those moves brought center David Krejci and defensemen Zdendo Chara and Charlie McAvoy (all three rested on Thursday against the Wild) back into the lineup, which was completed with the one-day promotions of defenseman Jeremy Lauzon and forward Anton Blidh from Providence.
Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said that none of the players who sat out either of the season’s final two games requested time off, or complained about being taken out.
“Nobody willingly wanted to come out today or on Thursday, to be honest with you,” Cassidy said. “Some of these decisions are a little maintenance, little nagging injuries where we just feel we’re better off not playing. Other guys we feel are better off in the lineup, want to be in the lineup.
“There’s always two schools of thought with that. That’s just a decision we made with a lot of our guys.”
Being cautious
Winger Chris Wagner and defenseman Kevan Miller, both nursing lower-body injuries, also skipped Saturday’s game. Wagner didn’t play in three of the season’s last four games while Miller was in his third game back after missing 16 with an upper-body injury when he got hurt in Thursday’s second period.
Cassidy believes both players will be ready for the start of the Bruins’ first-round series against the Maple Leafs, which is expected to begin on Thursday at TD Garden.
“I anticipate (Miller) will be full practice on Monday, ready to go,” Cassidy said. “(Wagner) .... we’ve been advised to hold out. He’ll be best served not playing to be at his best Thursday.”
Center Sean Kuraly, two weeks removed from surgery to repair a fracture in his right hand, and defenseman John Moore, who missed the last six games of the season with an upper-body injury, both skated on Saturday morning, but Cassidy doesn’t expect either to be ready for Game 1 against the Leafs.
Around the boards
Coyle played the 500th game of his NHL career. … Marchand won the 98.5 Sports Hub Three Stars competition (Bergeron finished second, David Pastrnak third) and the Elizabeth C. Dufresne Trophy as the top Bruin in home games. … Jake DeBrusk was the Eddie Shore Award winner (exceptional hustle and determination, selected by the Gallery Gods), and Chara received the John P. Bucyk Award for off-ice charitable work. Never miss a story
