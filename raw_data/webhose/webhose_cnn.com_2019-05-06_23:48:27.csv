Illinois raises age for buying tobacco - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Emanuella Grinberg,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/health/illinois-tobacco-age/index.html,"(CNN) Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed legislation on Sunday that raises the legal age for purchasing cigarettes, e-cigarettes and other tobacco products from 18 to 21.
HB 345 takes effect July 1. It aims to reduce tobacco use among teens and young adults by preventing them from starting, said Pritzker and state lawmakers who attended Sunday's bill signing. Gov. JB Pritzker signs legislation raising the age for buying tobacco products. Statistics show that most smokers start as teenagers, and the younger they are when they start, the more likely they'll become addicted. Illinois joins a growing list of states and municipalities adopting ""Tobacco 21"" policies, as vaping among teens is on the rise . Teen smoking rates have declined over the years, but advocates warn that the popularity of e-cigarettes threatens to reverse the progress. Read More Some tobacco and e-cigarette companies have signaled support for Tobacco 21 policies. The chief executive officer of JUUL Labs commended Pritzker and the bill's sponsors for their ""leadership on the issue."" In a statement, Ken Burns pledged the e-cigarette maker's support for similar legislation in other states, saying the policies reduce sharing by legal-age peers, a major contributor to youth tobacco use. ""We know Tobacco 21 policies work. In areas where they are already enacted, smoking rates are falling,"" the company said previously . ""We urge lawmakers in states without these age protections to follow their example, and when and if they do, we will proudly support their efforts."" Other places where you have to be 21 to purchase tobacco Washington's governor on Friday signed legislation that will take effect in 2020. The New York Senate passed legislation on April 1 that is expected to go to the governor's desk. States where the legal age is already 21 include Hawaii, California, New Jersey, Oregon, Maine and Massachusetts. Laws will take effect later this year in Arkansas and Virginia. Chicago raised the age in 2016 for purchasing tobacco, in what Pritzker called a model for the statewide legislation. Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who attended Sunday's signing, said raising the age contributed to reductions in youth smoking in Chicago. Pritzker cited statistics showing that tobacco use is on the rise among youth, driven largely by e-cigarettes . The new law would help reverse the trend, he said. ""We're dealing with an old problem in a new form,"" Pritzker said. ""And while all our residents have the right to make this choice for themselves, we need to be realistic about what that choice means for our young people."" His predecessor, Gov. Bruce Rautner, vetoed a similar measure, saying it would limit consumer choice and drive people to other states or non-licensed vendors for purchases. Pritzker dismissed concerns that the legislation would hurt businesses by depriving them of revenue. He called on neighboring states to pass similar laws to discourage people from crossing state lines. The new law does not include penalties for underage possession, but businesses face fines and sanctions for selling to consumers under 21. What parents should know about the 'huge epidemic' of vaping A March 2015 report by the Institute of Medicine -- now called the National Academy of Medicine -- concluded that raising the age would save lives and lead to better public health outcomes. The report found that increasing the age reduces tobacco initiation among 15- to 17-year-olds, leading to reductions in smoking prevalence. Representative Camille Y. Lilly, who sponsored the Illinois legislation, said it will reduce sharing among underage teens who get tobacco from older friends. ""It takes health care to make America better,"" she said. ""This piece of legislation brings us forward."""
Trump says DHS Secretary Nielsen leaving – The White House News,www.cnn.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/kirstjen-nielsen-homeland-security/index.html,"Suspected Rhino Poacher Killed By Elephant, Eaten By Pride Of Lions In South Africa – NPR 投稿日 2019年4月8日 05:06:00 （総合） "
UK to tech execs: Clean up your platforms or face fines - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Hadas Gold,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/tech/uk-social-media-regulations/index.html,"London (CNN Business) Tech executives could be hit with substantial fines and criminal penalties under new rules proposed by the UK government that aim to make the internet safe for children and other vulnerable groups.
The penalties were set out Monday in a government position paper that says the United Kingdom will make internet companies legally responsible for unlawful content and material that is damaging to individuals or the country. The government said that an independent regulator would be created to enforce the new rules, which focus on removing content that incites violence, encourages suicide or constitutes cyber-bullying. Content related to terrorism and child abuse would face even stricter standards. Companies would be required to ""take reasonable and proportionate action"" to address objectionable content on their platforms, the government said in a statement. A ""code of practice"" would include measures to minimize the spread ""of misleading and harmful disinformation with dedicated fact checkers, particularly during election periods,"" it added. Why the UK is moving to regulate the internet Europe has taken a much more robust approach to tech regulation than the United States, confronting industry giants over competition issues, data protection, privacy and tax. Calls for stricter regulation have increased recently in the United Kingdom after social media was blamed for the suicide of a British teenager and Facebook failed to stop the live broadcast of a mass killing in New Zealand. Read More ""For too long these companies have not done enough to protect users, especially children and young people, from harmful content,"" Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement. ""That is not good enough, and it is time to do things differently."" The United Kingdom is casting a wide net. The plan, which the government will continue to develop over the next 12 weeks before proposing as legislation, extends to any company that ""allows users to share or discover user generated content or interact with each other."" That would include Twitter ( TWTR ) and Google ( GOOGL ) video platform YouTube, but also popular internet message boards such as Reddit. The companies would be required to have an easy and effective complaints function, where users would ""receive timely, clear and transparent responses to their complaints."" Social media firms would also be forced to publish annual reports on the amount of harmful content on their platforms and explain what they were doing to address the issue. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg calls for more regulation of the internet The government said that the new regulator would be empowered to block access to websites or apps that break the rules, thereby disrupting their business models. It also said that a ""range of options"" were being considered for subjecting individual senior managers to civil fines and criminal liability. The proposal suggested that rules governing executives in the financial services industry could be used as a model. Tech response Kent Walker, senior vice president at Google, wrote in a blog post earlier this year that the company was seeking to address illegal and harmful content by increasing transparency and working with regulators. Facebook ( FB ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in March that governments and regulators should play a ""more active role"" online. But he said that a global approach was needed to ensure that ""the Internet does not get fractured"" and ""entrepreneurs can build products that serve everyone."" ""Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree,"" he wrote in the Washington Post. ""I've come to believe that we shouldn't make so many important decisions about speech on our own."" Rebecca Stimson, Facebook's head of UK public policy, said Monday that new rules should support innovation, the digital economy and freedom of speech. ""These are complex issues to get right and we look forward to working with the [UK] government and parliament to ensure new regulations are effective,"" she said in a statement. Twitter's UK head of public policy Katy Minshall said in a statement on Monday that the company is ""deeply committed"" to the safety of its users, touting what she said are ""70 changes to our policies and processes last year."" ""We look forward to engaging in the next steps of the process, and working to strike an appropriate balance between keeping users safe and preserving the open, free nature of the internet,"" Minshall said."
Convicted murderer who dismembered two of his lovers on the run in Sydney - CNN,edition.cnn.com,James Griffiths,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/australia/australia-murderer-run-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Police in Sydney have rearrested a convicted double murderer who went on the run Sunday after removing his electronic monitoring anklet while on parole.
Damien Peters, 50, vanished at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, a Sydney suburb, on Sunday afternoon. His monitoring anklet was found later that evening. Police said it had been ""forcibly removed."" On Monday evening, police said Peters had been spotted and arrested without incident. According to CNN affiliate 7 News , Peters pleaded guilty in 2001 to murdering and dismembering two men in his apartment in Sydney's Surrey Hills neighborhood. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, becoming eligible for parole in 2015. Specifics of his current legal status were unclear except that he was being monitored. The court was told how Peters, then 32, had stabbed 50-year-old Tereaupii Akai twice in the neck before cutting up his body and throwing it in the trash. About eight months later, Peters stabbed 57-year-old Bevan James Frost to death while giving him a massage, before cutting up his body as well.

"No, Americans are not 'dumb' for wanting to see Trump's tax returns (Opinion) - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Dean Obeidallah,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/opinions/trump-tax-returns-obeidallah/index.html,"Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program ""The Dean Obeidallah Show"" and a columnist for The Daily Beast.

(CNN) Donald Trump's acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney made it clear in one word Sunday when Trump will produce his tax returns in response to recent requests by congressional Democrats: ""Never."" Mulvaney, then, channeling what you'd expect to hear from ""the Hand of the King"" in ""Game of Thrones,"" added, ""Nor should they"" obtain the President's taxes.
While Mulvaney may have conjured up the dismissiveness of a monarch, at least he didn't dub the Democratic officials seeking Trump's tax returns ""dumb."" That, though, was the response of Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, on Friday, who slammed Rep. Richard Neal, D-Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, in response to his recent request to obtain six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns. Kennedy not only claimed the entire effort was political in nature, he personally mocked Neal for making the request, telling CNN's Jake Tapper, ""It must really suck to be that dumb."" Trump's odd riffs If Kennedy believes that people who want to see Trump's tax returns are ""dumb,"" then I'm as dumb as they come. In fact, so are 60% of my fellow Americans who believe House Democrats should ""make use of (their) authority to obtain and publicly release"" Trump's tax returns, as a January ABC News/Washington Post poll found. You don't have to be a detective on ""CSI"" to get a sense that there's a reason Trump doesn't want America to see his tax returns. I don't want to engage in rank speculation as to the why, but the fact is that Trump was the first major party presidential candidate since Watergate to fail to release his tax returns. Yet Trump wants you to believe he's all for transparency. During the 2016 campaign, Trump told us he didn't ""mind releasing"" his returns, but he couldn't do so at the time because he was ""under a routine audit."" Read More There are a few problems with that response if we are to believe Trump sincerely has no issues with releasing his returns. First, then-President Richard Nixon released his tax returns in the midst of an audit in 1973. In addition, the IRS publicly stated in the heat of the 2016 campaign that there was no prohibition on Trump, or any individual for that matter, releasing his or her returns during an audit. On top of all that, Trump's own lawyers during the 2016 campaign stated that the IRS audit of Trump's returns through 2008 was completed , begging the question: if Trump was truly about transparency, why didn't he release the returns not being audited?! New York Times: Trump requested that Senate prioritize IRS chief counsel nomination And since winning the election, Trump's response to requests for his tax returns have ranged from evasiveness to outright stonewalling. For example, in January 2017, when asked about releasing his returns, Trump claimed that only the media cared about the issue, ""You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, okay? They're the only ones."" Then in May 2017, when again asked about his tax filings, Trump told us for the first time that, "" I might release them after I'm out of office. "" But Trump has now taken his opposition to the release of his tax returns to desperate heights, in light of Rep. Neal's formal request for six years of his personal and corporate returns. As CNN recently reported , Trump and his legal team are so opposed to releasing the returns that they ""are willing to fight the House Democratic request all the way to the Supreme Court."" As one Trump official added, ""This is a hill and people would be willing to die on it."" People are willing to ""die"" to keep Trump's tax returns from going public?! Wow, so much for Trump being happy to release his returns after the audit was completed. And to that end, an attorney for Trump sent a letter to the Department of Treasury on Friday objecting to Rep. Neal's request, claiming it was a ""gross abuse of power"" and was simply an effort to ""harass"" Trump because Democrats ""dislike his politics and speech."" Curiously missing from that letter was any claim Trump was still under audit or that Trump would release his returns once any audit was completed. (Rep. Neal has also requested that the IRS verify that Trump is in fact being audited.) Stay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter .

In addition to Mulvaney stating bluntly on Sunday that Democrats will ""never"" get the tax returns, Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's lawyers, declared on Friday that Trump would not turn over ""a single thing"" to congressional Democrats in regard to Trump's taxes, claiming the request was ""pure harassment."" When you reflect on how Trump and his allies are doing their best to keep the American people from seeing Trump's tax returns, I don't think the word ""dumb"" is the right word to describe those who want transparency. Rather, it would be dumb to not compel the production of those documents, because American voters deserve to know what is in Trump's returns before they vote in 2020."

Beijing parks to create blacklist of 'uncivilized' visitors,www.cnn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-parks-tourism-blacklist/index.html,"Parks in Beijing want to blacklist 'uncivilized' visitors James Griffiths, CNN • Published 7th April 2019 Facebook Twitter Email (CNN) — Tourism authorities in Beijing said they are considering creating a blacklist of ""uncivilized visitors"" in order to curb bad behavior by visitors, as the city is inundated with tourists for Tomb Sweeping Festival. According to state media , officials at the Beijing Municipal Administration Center of Parks said that the upsurge in domestic tourists visiting the Chinese capital for the three-day holiday, also known as Qingming Festival, had coincided with ""uncivilized tourist behavior,"" including climbing peach trees, picking flowers, damaging plants, fishing in park lakes, and selling things illegally within the city's parks. A blacklist would block ""loutish travelers"" from visiting the city's parks, using facial recognition software and other surveillance technology to monitor guests and keep out those with a record of bad behavior. In 2017, Beijing's Temple of Heaven Park installed face scanners in its toilets to prevent what officials said was an epidemic of toilet paper theft. Those needing paper had to make eye contact with a machine before it spit out a single portion -- anyone needing more than the provided amount would need to wait 9 minutes. ""Many old people come here for free toilet paper. They were probably born in 1940s or 1950s,"" Wu Qingqi, a visitor to the park, told CNN at the time. ""During that time, people were very poor. And they somehow still are in fear of being poor. Other migrant workers come here too."" An aerial picture of graves taken on April 5, 2019, ahead of the annual Qingming festival, or Tomb Sweeping Day, at a cemetery in Dagantangcun, east of Beijing. FRED DUFOUR/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Chinese tourists made more than 112 million domestic trips during this year's Tomb Sweeping Festival, a 10.9% increase on last year, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism . Beijing alone saw more than 700,000 people visiting some dozen parks around the city. Policing of tourists has been ramping up in recent years. In 2016, the China National Tourism Administration placed 20 people with a history of bad behavior on a blacklist, restricting their ability to travel. Two of those blacklisted had caused a plane from Bangkok to the Chinese city of Nanjing to return halfway after they got into an argument with fight attendants, while in another case, a passenger tried to prevent a plane taking off by forcing open its emergency exit. Last year, the travel blacklist was expanded to include more than 670 people. While some of the offenses which landed people on the list included travel misbehavior such as disrupting flights or smoking on trains, it also includes those who have failed to pay court judgments or taking part in illegal securities trading. People on the list can be banned from some or all air and train travel for up to 12 months. Such blacklists are seen as a precursor to a proposed countrywide ""social credit system,"" which would be used to monitor and police a huge range of behavior. People with poor social credit scores could be prevented from traveling, struggle to apply for loans, or banned from taking part in some businesses. Human Rights Watch has described the proposed system as ""dystopian,"" and warned it could have major ramifications for privacy."

Read the resignation letter Nielsen posted online:
Mr. President, I hereby resign from the position of Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), effective April 7th 2019. It has been my great honor to lead the men and women of the Department as its sixth Secretary. I could not be prouder of and more humbled by their service, dedication, and commitment to keep our country safe from all threats and hazards. I join all Americans in thanking them for their sacrifices and those of their families. Read More For more than two years of service beginning during the Presidential Transition, I have worked tirelessly to advance the goals and missions of the Department. I am immensely proud of our successes in transforming DHS to keep pace with our enemies and adversaries — whether it is in cyberspace or against emerging threats from new technologies. Despite our progress in reforming homeland security for a new age, I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside. I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America's borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation's discourse. Our country and the men and women of DHS deserve to have all the tools and resources they need to execute the mission entrusted to them. I can say with confidence our homeland is safer today than when I joined the Administration. We have taken unprecedented action to protect Americans. We have implemented historic efforts to defend our borders, combat illegal immigration, obstruct the inflow of drugs, and uphold our laws and values. We have responded decisively to record-breaking natural disasters and helped Americans rebuild. We have prevented the disruption of U.S. elections and guarded against foreign interference in our democracy. We have replaced complacency with consequences in cyberspace, we are holding digital intruders accountable, and we are stepping up our protection of American networks. We have thwarted terrorist plotting against our homeland and launched new efforts to block terrorists and criminals from reaching our shores. And we have ramped up security measures to make it harder for our enemies and adversaries to attack us, whether it is with drones, chemical and biological weapons, or through other means. Thank you again for the privilege to serve the American people and to lead the outstanding men and women of the Department of Homeland Security. Supporting these patriots has been the honor of a lifetime. Sincerely, Kirstjen M. Nielsen Secretary of Homeland Security"
Maldives President who promised to investigate China headed for landslide election win,edition.cnn.com,James Griffiths,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/asia/maldives-election-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Maldives President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih's political party looks to have scored a landslide victory in parliamentary elections Sunday.
According to state media , initial results show Solih's Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) has won 67 out of 87 seats in parliament, an historic margin that will strengthen his mandate to investigate the former government's ties to China. ""Today is a happy day,"" Solih said in a statement late Sunday. ""Without exception, the biggest winners of today's elections are the Maldivian people. To have this election across the country under peaceful and civil conditions is a clear win for us as a society. That our campaign was issue-oriented and not based on hatred and narrow divisions is a win for our young democracy. That our government did not hinder those candidates with whom we did not agree is a big win for the country."" Despite his party's victory, Solih promised to continue to work with coalition partners who last year helped him turf out former leader Abdulla Yameen , who plunged the country into chaos as he jailed activists and defied court orders in an attempt to maintain power. Yameen also moved the Maldives away from traditional ally India toward China, inviting investment under Beijing's expansive Belt and Road Initiative. Read More Ahead of last year's election, former President Mohamed Nasheed, then in exile in Sri Lanka, claimed as much as 80% of the Maldives' foreign debt was owed to China. Solih promised to reverse this and investigate the former administration's ties to China amid accusations of corruption. Speaking to supporters on Sunday, he said a new commission would be tasked with ""investigating corruption and recovering state assets function with the support of the new parliament."" ""The work of the commission investigating unresolved deaths and enforced disappearances will go ahead more quickly with the support of this parliament,"" he added, according to Reuters . The Maldives is one of multiple countries across Asia where Chinese investment and influence have become a major election issue . In Indonesia, which goes to the polls later this month, incumbent President Joko Widodo has come in for significant criticism over the amount of money his administration has accepted from Beijing. With Chinese investment being viewed with more suspicion, and increased skepticism over the Belt and Road Initiative, pre-existing concerns over Beijing's foreign policy aims and numerous regional territorial disputes have returned to the fore, harming Chinese influence."
Trump meets Egypt's President Sisi as human rights issues persist,edition.cnn.com,"Amir Ahmed, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/egypt-sisi-trump-white-house-visit/index.html,"(CNN) As President Trump prepares to have a warm welcome for Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Tuesday for the second time at the White House, rights groups say they are intensifying their efforts to lobby members of Congress for a less friendly visit.
Egyptian officials are hailing the meeting, which came at the invitation of the US administration, as a high mark for a new era of relations between the two countries. ""President Sisi has been able to restore Egyptian-American relations to their former political and economic prosperity,"" said Ashraf Osman, an influential member of Egypt's parliament. The meeting on Tuesday will focus on building the ""robust military, economic and counterterrorism cooperation"" between Washington and Cairo, the White House said. But the meeting this week is not without controversy. Read More Human rights groups have accused the Egyptian regime of carrying out widespread and systematic torture of political prisoners , silencing dissidents and using death sentences to settle scores . Sisi's government has vehemently denied the allegations. But rights groups continue to raise Cairo's dismal human rights record as an issue that congressmen should take into account when officials meet Sisi this week. It's a topic Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notably did not mention during his last visit to Cairo earlier this year . Amnesty International along with Egyptians Abroad For Democracy Worldwide have been working for the last year in a joint effort to lobby Congress to ""oppose the death penalty in Egypt and to improve human rights,"" according to documents shared with CNN. The groups are also lobbying to make $1.3 billion of military aid this year conditional on improving human rights in Egypt. The State Department has sought the same amount in foreign military financing for Egypt in its 2020 budget request, indicating that the administration wants to keep business as usual with Cairo. Egypt is the second largest recipient of US foreign military aid. JUST WATCHED Voters have few options in Egypt Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Voters have few options in Egypt 02:40 Last year, the Trump administration released $195 million in military aid to Egypt which had been temporarily withheld due to concerns over the country's human rights record. The State Department cited ""steps"" taken by Cairo in response to ""specific U.S. concerns"" when the funds were released. But rights groups continue to lobby Congress to make the annual military aid conditional on Egypt achieving certain democratic benchmarks. However, the White House has so far avoided such conditions by pressuring Congress to include a ""national security waiver"" on the aid legislation. Amnesty and Egyptians Abroad for Democracy Worldwide have a letter that is circulating Congress to encourage members ""to consider the executions and human rights in their discussion on US financial aid to Egypt,"" Amnesty International's Egypt Country Specialist, Geoffrey Mock said. But President Trump is likely to ignore those efforts as he holds talks with Sisi this week -- their sixth meeting since 2016, according a report released by Egypt's presidency. Trump is not expected to mention controversial constitutional amendments, including an extension to Egyptian presidential terms that could see Sisi remain in office until 2034. The two leaders are expected to talk about the fight against ISIS in the Sinai Peninsula, and a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, according to state-run Ahram Online citing a spokesman to the Egyptian president."

This year, a star went down, but the season ends with a championship.
Baylor, the top overall seed of the women's NCAA basketball tournament, has won its third national title, defeating No. 1 seed Notre Dame 82-81 at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida on Sunday. It's Baylor's first title since 2012, which also came against the Fighting Irish. Baylor (37-1) led by as many as 17, but after a leg injury to Bears star forward Lauren Cox in the third quarter, the Irish (35-4) surged back to take the lead with just over three minutes left.

""My teammates and my coaches believed in me so much,"" Jackson said to ESPN. ""And we had to do it for LC. She got us here. We had to finish the job for her."" A hobbled Cox -- who had to leave the game in a wheelchair -- was able to return to the court before the game ended and got to hoist the trophy with her teammates. Baylor forward Lauren Cox is assisted off the court after she went down with injury. ""Lauren Cox, my god, she's the heart and soul of our team,"" Baylor head coach Kim Mulkey said through tears to ESPN. ""And I just know she's hurt because that kid would have gotten up. ... I just know when you lose a big-time player in the middle of a national championship, you're not supposed to win."" Before she was forced out, Cox had eight points, eight rebounds and three blocked shots. ""I'm one of the leaders of this team, so (I came back) just to have my voice there, to tell them that I'm still OK,"" Cox said to ESPN. ""They told me they were going to do this for me.""

— ESPN (@espn) April 8, 2019 The three titles put Mulkey behind only Geno Auriemma, who has 11 at Connecticut, and the late Pat Summitt, who had eight at Tennessee, in the women's game. The Bears have won 29 consecutive games, last losing at Stanford in December. Before she was forced out with an injury, Baylor forward Lauren Cox had eight points, eight rebounds and three blocked shots. Of Mulkey's three titles, it's the second time that Baylor head coach is sharing it with her daughter. In 2012, Baylor went 40-0 when Makenzie (Robertson) Fuller was a guard on that title team. She's now in her fourth season on Mulkey's staff, serving as associate director of basketball operations. In November 2017, Fuller lost her unborn child, Scout Marie. The stillborn infant was delivered after doctors didn't detect a heartbeat during a weekly checkup, according to CNN affiliate KWTX . Scout Marie was believed to have Turner's syndrome, a condition that affects only females, in which one of the X chromosomes is missing or partially missing. NCAA men's Final Four: Virginia, Texas Tech advance to the title game ""I don't think it's any secret that we had just a horrible year with the death of a grandchild, yet I don't think as a family, I'm talking about Makenzie and myself, we had time to grieve,"" Mulkey said after Baylor's win against Oregon in the Final Four. In October, Fuller gave birth to a son, Kannon , who Mulkey had with her on the dais after Friday's win and on the floor Sunday after winning the championship. ""You bet I'm going to hang onto him,"" Mulkey said at the time of Friday's win. ""Holding a child up here is a heck of a lot more touching than holding one right here that's deceased. I've done both in the last year and a half."" Last year's title run by Notre Dame was a shock. The Fighting Irish had more ACL tears (four) than losses, and those injuries last season left Notre Dame with just seven scholarship players. And the way they won in 2018 was breathtaking, with buzzer-beaters by Ogunbowale in the semifinal and championship games against Connecticut and Mississippi State, respectively. Finishing with 31 points, Arike Ogunbowale couldn't quite match last year's heroics for Notre Dame, missing a free throw in the final 1.9 seconds that could have helped forced overtime. It was different entering the 2018-2019 season. The Irish returned several of their players from that championship team. They were the preseason No. 1, something that made head coach Muffet McGraw uncomfortable. It's something she alluded to before Sunday's final. ""We came into the season with all of that on us. No. 1, defending champs,"" McGraw said Saturday. ""Sometimes defending champs aren't really because they don't have their team back. But we did. We were truly the defending champs. It was a burden."" On Sunday, she called the loss ""frustrating."" ""Well, I'm sad for the seniors that we came that close after getting down 17, clawing our way back,"" McGraw said. ""We had so many missed opportunities both ends of the floor. ... We just didn't come out ready. That was disappointing."""
Enormous python captured at Florida nature preserve - CNN,www.cnn.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/07/us/florida-huge-python-captured-trnd/index.html,"Scientists just captured a record 17-foot-long python in Florida By Chandrika Narayan, CNN Updated 2:33 PM EDT, Sun April 07, 2019
(CNN) The Burmese python is one of the largest snakes in the world. But even by python standards, this one was colossal.
Scientists caught a female python in the Florida Everglades that was more than 17 feet long, weighed 140 pounds and contained 73 developing eggs.
The snake is the largest python ever removed from Big Cypress National Preserve , a 729,000-acre expanse of swampland west of Miami in South Florida, according to a statement Friday on the preserve's Facebook page .
The picture with the Facebook post tells it all.
It shows a team of four researchers, standing apart from one another, holding up the gigantic reptile.
While pythons of all sizes have been found in the Everglades, most of them are between 6 and 10 feet long. The largest one was over 18 feet long and weighed more than 100 pounds , according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Still, this latest find is impressive. Big Cypress' rangers credit research and new tracking technology with making it possible.
""Using male pythons with radio transmitters allows the team to track the male to locate breeding females,"" their statement says. ""The team not only removes the invasive snakes, but collects data for research, develops new removal tools and learns how the pythons are using the Preserve.""
The Burmese python is native to Southeast Asia, but in recent decades the big snakes have become a slithering menace in Florida. The Everglades is a vast area with a tropical climate perfect for pythons to hide and thrive.
State wildlife officials estimate there are as many as 100,000 pythons living in the vast swamps outside Miami. The snakes pose significant threats to native wildlife.
To control their population, Florida even holds competitions encouraging hunters to remove as many of them as possible. Conservationists in Florida sometimes use radio telemetry to track Burmese pythons.
Some 1,600 people registered for the inaugural Python Challenge in 2013, organized by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The searchers found only 68 snakes.
In 2017, 25 hunters were paid to euthanize pythons under a $175,000 pilot program by the South Florida Water Management District.
The pythons began turning up in the Everglades in the 1980s, most likely abandoned by pet owners when the snakes got too big to handle. Some pet pythons also may have escaped from a breeding facility destroyed during Hurricane Andrew in 1992. "

He says he loved working there. But after the presidential election, he noticed a disturbing ""change in tone.""
""I was fine with working with and for people who had different values and opinions than I did, but I noticed a significant shift in the ferociousness and, frankly, in the relationship with facts, you know, particularly on the Fox side,"" Azam said. As President Donald Trump took office, ""it became very profitable to kind of fall in line with an anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-Muslim rhetoric,"" he said. ""And I was affected by that."" Azam, an Afghan-American immigrant, eventually had enough. He resigned in late 2017. He recounted the ups and downs of working for the Murdoch media empire on CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" on Sunday. Azam was a senior vice president in the legal department at News Corp, the half of Murdoch's house that includes the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers. Fox News is part of the other half. But both sides came together in the New York City tower where Azam worked. He said he interacted with Fox hosts in the elevators, for example, ""so I was exposed to it every day.""

""By the dehumanization taking place in some of the coverage and the opinion shows"" and by ""a lack of decency."" News Corp declined to comment on Azam. It is well known that Murdoch's companies employ many, many people who don't share the family's conservative ideology. But it is rare to hear from a former executive like this.

He named Tucker Carlson's weekday show and Jeanine Pirro's Saturday show as examples of especially objectionable content. Both are also among the best-rated shows on Fox News.

"DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen out, says President Donald Trump",us.cnn.com,Priscilla Alvarez,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/kirstjen-nielsen-homeland-security/index.html,"(CNN) Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security who has become a face of President Donald Trump's hardline immigration push, is leaving the administration, President Donald Trump announced on Twitter Sunday afternoon.
""Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service,"" Trump said on Twitter. ""I am pleased to announce that Kevin McAleenan, the current U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, will become Acting Secretary for @DHSgov. I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!"" Trump continued. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position, and I would like to thank her for her service....
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 7, 2019 Nielsen did not resign willingly, a person close to her told CNN, but was under pressure to do so. Nielsen did not fight nor grovel to keep her job, the source said. Nielsen should be staying for a week of transition, another White House official said. McAleenan is a holdover from the Obama administration. He was sworn in on March 20, 2018, as commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection. He is expected to serve as the acting secretary ""in the short term,"" meaning he is not expected to be in the position for the long term, according to a White House official. Read More Senior administration officials told CNN that Nielsen had a 5 p.m., meeting at the White House with Trump where she was planning to discuss with him the immigration and border issues and a path forward. She had no intention of resigning, according to one of the sources, but rather was going there with an agenda. Trump had grown increasingly frustrated with the situation at the border, which has seen an influx in migrants, predominantly from Northern Triangle countries. In California on Friday, a senior administration official tells CNN, Trump told border agents he wanted them to stop letting people cross the border, despite the fact that Central American asylum seekers according to US law can do so. Nielsen ""believed the situation was becoming untenable with the President becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests,"" a senior administration official tells CNN. ""I hereby resign from the position of Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), effective April 7th 2019,"" Nielsen wrote in her resignation letter. ""Despite our progress in reforming homeland security for a new age, I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside."" READ: Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation letter from DHS secretary post In a series of tweets, Nielsen said, ""it has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with the brave men and women"" of DHS and repeated what she also said in her resignation letter that she ""could not be prouder of and more humbled by their service."" Nielsen has felt ""in limbo"" for the last week, a person close to her says, as she bore the brunt of the President's anger over the border. She's been increasingly on thin ice in the eyes of the President. She did not realize how dire it was when she left the US last weekend, but quickly did, as she abruptly returned. She did interviews -- including on CNN -- to try and improve the President's souring view of her, the source close to Nielsen said, but to little avail. ""Nothing she could do or say could change how the President started viewing her,"" the source close to Nielsen said. That said, she was prepared to be fired at any moment, but did not know going into Sunday's meeting it would be imminent. Democrats immediately reacted to the news. ""Hampered by misstep after misstep, Kirstjen Nielsen's tenure at the Department of Homeland Security was a disaster from the start. It is clearer now than ever that the Trump Administration's border security and immigration policies - that she enacted and helped craft - have been an abysmal failure and have helped create the humanitarian crisis at the border,"" said House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson in a statement. Rep. Mike Rogers of Alabama, the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, acknowledged Nielsen's challenges in a statement and expressed confidence in McAleenan and whomever the President nominated later. ""Secretary Nielsen served her country honorably as Homeland Security Secretary, despite facing numerous challenges including dire conditions at our southwest border,"" Rogers said. ""Although Commissioner McAleenan will have his work cut out for him, I am confident the department is in capable hands. I look forward to working with McAleenan in his new role and to learning who the president intends to nominate on a permanent basis."" Tumultuous tenure The departure comes just days after Trump suddenly withdrew the nomination of Ron Vitiello for Immigration and Customs Enforcement director , blindsiding the Department of Homeland Security and the Hill. Nielsen was unaware what was happening until after the nomination had been pulled, a person familiar with the news said. The announcement Sunday also follows plans to cut aid to some Central American countries , marking a sudden reversal after Nielsen had days earlier visited Honduras to sign a regional compact agreement with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. Nielsen has had a tumultuous tenure that saw Trump steadily ramping up pressure on his team to execute his immigration promises, which he believes is the single driving issue for his base of political supporters. Trump has vented privately that Nielsen hasn't adequately secured the border or enacted stricter immigration rules, even as she became the face of policies that administration critics called heartless and illegal. Incoming acting secretary of Homeland Security 'not an ideologue or fire breather' In recent weeks, administration officials have been sounding the alarm over the increase in migrants at the southern border, underscoring the change in demographics as one of the reasons for the host of challenges they're facing. McAleenan said late last month that the US was on pace to encounter more than 100,000 migrants in March alone, making it ""the highest month since 2008."" ""Right now, we have an emergency on our hands. We need to treat it as such,"" Nielsen told Chris Cuomo on CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" Thursday. Nielsen, who served in President George W. Bush's administration, never overcame internal skepticism about her allegiance to Trump. She joined the administration as chief of staff to John Kelly, who was Trump's first Homeland Security secretary. When Kelly moved to the West Wing as chief of staff, Nielsen followed, becoming a deputy chief of staff tasked with helping Kelly bring rigor to a freewheeling staff. The role didn't gain her popularity, but it helped her gain enough of Trump's trust to elevate her to the Cabinet post. But at the agency that oversees border protection and immigration matters -- Trump's signature issue -- it was inevitable Nielsen would find herself in the President's crosshairs. After a previous Cabinet meeting during which Trump berated her for not acting strongly enough on preventing illegal immigration, Nielsen considered resigning, people familiar with the matter said at the time. She didn't then and went on to become one of the public faces of a controversial policy that separated families at the southern border. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement on Nielsen's resignation, saying, ""It is deeply alarming that the Trump Administration official who put children in cages is reportedly resigning because she is not extreme enough for the White House's liking."" Pelosi went on to say, ""The President's dangerous and cruel anti-immigrant policies have only worsened the humanitarian suffering at the border and inflicted vast suffering on the families who have been torn apart."" The President posted on Twitter shortly after announcing Nielsen's departure that the ""Country is FULL!"" and wrote there have been more apprehensions at the southern border ""than in many years."" He called on Congress to ""fix loopholes"" and reiterated his threat to close the border."
Kevin McAleenan 'not an ideologue or fire breather',us.cnn.com,Kate Sullivan,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/kevin-mcaleenan-acting-secretary-homeland-security/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's choice to fill the role of Kirstjen Nielsen as secretary of Homeland Security is a career official who served in the Obama administration and whom a senior DHS official says is ""not an ideologue or fire breather"" on immigration.
Kevin McAleenan, who is expected to take over DHS in an acting capacity, was serving as the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection before Sunday's announcement. He was confirmed as commissioner by the Senate in March 2018 by a vote of 77-19. He is expected to serve as the acting secretary ""in the short term,"" according to a White House official. Nielsen should be staying for a week of transition, another White House official said. Nielsen tweeted Sunday night that she ""agreed to stay on as Secretary through Wednesday, April 10th to assist with an orderly transition and ensure that key DHS missions are not impacted."" Removing Nielsen and installing McAleenan as acting secretary presents issues for the line of succession. Putting McAleenan in charge skips over acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady, who also serves in the Senate confirmed role as the Undersecretary of Management, which raises questions about her future. A senior administration official told CNN that legally Grady is next in line and will have to go in order for McAleenan to assume the role of acting secretary. Another official, asked about this question, told CNN there are issues that need to be addressed before McAleenan can take over. Read More The senior DHS official told CNN McAleenan is ""not an ideologue or fire breather"" on immigration like White House senior adviser Stephen Miller or Trump. This official wondered how McAleenan will fit in as Miller has placed several political appointees in the department who follow the immigration hardliner's marching orders. Another senior DHS official said, ""he's good at what he does. Every role he has had, he's improved conditions. I expect this will be the same."" But another administration official cautioned that although McAleenan ""knows border and immigration,"" he ""may not know the rest of DHS."" McAleenan also has shared some of Nielsen's frustrations with Trump over his demands from the department, two US officials familiar with his thinking said. He's also viewed warily by some of the White House immigration hardliners, led by Miller, who has Trump's ear on the issues he views as key to his re-election prospects. Career official Trump says DHS Secretary Nielsen leaving McAleenan is a career official who previously served as the deputy commissioner during President Barack Obama's administration. As commissioner of CBP, he oversaw 60,000 employees and managed a budget of more than $13 billion, according to the department's website . Last month, McAleenan said the ""breaking point has arrived"" for the US immigration system, and said CBP encountered the largest total number of migrants in years, with more than 4,000 in a single day, the vast majority of which were apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally. He announced he was moving 750 officers from ""key roles"" at the ports of entry to help Border Patrol care for migrants, including helping with processing and transportation.

That month, two Guatemalan children died after they were detained with their fathers after crossing the US-Mexico border. McAleenan received the Presidential Rank Award in 2015, according to the department's website, and also received the Service to America Medal and Call to Service Award in 2005 for spearheading anti-terrorism efforts at the border after the September 11, 2001 terrorism attacks.

Egyptian officials are hailing the meeting, which came at the invitation of the US administration, as a high mark for a new era of relations between the two countries. ""President Sisi has been able to restore Egyptian-American relations to their former political and economic prosperity,"" said Ashraf Osman, an influential member of Egypt's parliament. The meeting on Tuesday will focus on building the ""robust military, economic and counterterrorism cooperation"" between Washington and Cairo, the White House said. But the meeting this week is not without controversy. Read More Human rights groups have accused the Egyptian regime of carrying out widespread and systematic torture of political prisoners , silencing dissidents and using death sentences to settle scores . Sisi's government has vehemently denied the allegations. But rights groups continue to raise Cairo's dismal human rights record as an issue that congressmen should take into account when officials meet Sisi this week. It's a topic Secretary of State Mike Pompeo notably did not mention during his last visit to Cairo earlier this year . Amnesty International along with Egyptians Abroad For Democracy Worldwide have been working for the last year in a joint effort to lobby Congress to ""oppose the death penalty in Egypt and to improve human rights,"" according to documents shared with CNN. The groups are also lobbying to make $1.3 billion of military aid this year conditional on improving human rights in Egypt. The State Department has sought the same amount in foreign military financing for Egypt in its 2020 budget request, indicating that the administration wants to keep business as usual with Cairo. Egypt is the second largest recipient of US foreign military aid. JUST WATCHED Voters have few options in Egypt Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Voters have few options in Egypt 02:40 Last year, the Trump administration released $195 million in military aid to Egypt which had been temporarily withheld due to concerns over the country's human rights record. The State Department cited ""steps"" taken by Cairo in response to ""specific U.S. concerns"" when the funds were released. But rights groups continue to lobby Congress to make the annual military aid conditional on Egypt achieving certain democratic benchmarks. However, the White House has so far avoided such conditions by pressuring Congress to include a ""national security waiver"" on the aid legislation. Amnesty and Egyptians Abroad for Democracy Worldwide have a letter that is circulating Congress to encourage members ""to consider the executions and human rights in their discussion on US financial aid to Egypt,"" Amnesty International's Egypt Country Specialist, Geoffrey Mock said. But President Trump is likely to ignore those efforts as he holds talks with Sisi this week -- their sixth meeting since 2016, according a report released by Egypt's presidency. Trump is not expected to mention controversial constitutional amendments, including an extension to Egyptian presidential terms that could see Sisi remain in office until 2034. The two leaders are expected to talk about the fight against ISIS in the Sinai Peninsula, and a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, according to state-run Ahram Online citing a spokesman to the Egyptian president."
National Library Week: 9 fascinating facts about librarians CNN,us.cnn.com,"Sam Romano, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/us/national-library-week-facts-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Libraries in the US have long been community fixtures, providing gathering spaces along with public access to books and information.
And at the center of these hubs are your local librarians, juggling reference requests while helping patrons find reliable resources. In honor of National Library Week , which runs from April 7-13, here are some facts about librarians that might surprise you. 1. They serve more customers than your local movie theater According to the Institute of Museum and Library Services , around 1.3 billion people visit public libraries every year, more than the 1.24 billion movie theater admissions in 2017. These readers will probably tell you the book is better than the movie, too. Read More 2. There are more of them than you might think According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are about 126,800 librarians in the US. New York has the most, with 12,360 librarians. 3. They help spies Want to work for the Central Intelligence Agency? A library degree (and the ability to pass an intensive background check) might be your ticket in. At the CIA, you can earn up to six figures working in their library . 4. They help preserve your favorite music The Library of Congress has been preserving recordings in the National Recording Registry since 2002. Latest additions included hip-hop group Run-DMC's 1986 album ""Raising Hell,"" Fleetwood Mac's 1977 album ""Rumours"" and the soundtrack to ""The Sound of Music."" 5. Their job prospects are on the rise Employment of librarians is expected to grow 9% by 2026. Some 12,000 jobs are projected to open as communities look to librarians for a variety of information services. 6. They have left their mark on history Former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, author Lewis Carroll, former first lady Laura Bush and China's Mao Zedong all worked as librarians or in libraries. 7. They are trusted resources According to a Pew Research Center poll, 78% of American adults feel that public libraries help them find reliable sources. 8. They sometimes watch over historic artifacts The New York Public Library contains around 46 million items, though not all of them are books. It houses a 16th-century globe, an original copy of the Bill of Rights and a Honus Wagner baseball card largely considered to be one of the rarest in the world. 9. Working in a library used to be considered too intense for women At the end of the 19th century, library work was considered to be too overwhelming for women, and in 1900, the Brooklyn Public Library Association proposed building ""a seaside rest home for those who had broken down in library service."" Melvil Dewey, who invented the Dewey Decimal System, also believed women would have a hard time working in libraries because of their supposed poor health. Thankfully, these ideas began to disappear around the 1920s."

And they're ranked -- so the #1 story is the most important of the coming week.
Tell your friends to subscribe to The Point newsletter to get these rankings delivered to your inbox! 5. The waiting is the hardest part Another week of waiting for and fighting over the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russia appears to be on tap. Attorney General William Barr has said to expect the report, with redactions, by the end of the month -- most people assume it will be closer to the end of the month rather than the middle. A ruling Friday by a federal appeals court on the release of grand jury testimony seems to make more redactions likely, even as Democrats keep up their insistence that not seeing the full report is unacceptable. Read More ""There could be grounds for impeachment, there could be grounds for other actions, there could be things the American people ought to know,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (N.Y.) said on ""Face The Nation"" earlier today. Meanwhile, expect President Donald Trump to keep singing the same old song on the Mueller report. Tweeted Trump Sunday morning: ""Looks like Bob Mueller's team of 13 Trump Haters & Angry Democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the Fake News Media make up their own stories with or without sources - sources no longer matter to our corrupt & dishonest Mainstream Media, they are a Joke!"" 4. The field just keeps getting bigger (and bigger) California Rep. Eric Swalwell is expected to join the Democratic presidential field as soon as this week, according to The Atlantic . Sen. Michael Bennet (Colo.) is moving toward the race too. As is former Gov. Terry McAuliffe (Va.). And Rep. Tim Ryan (Ohio) got into the race this past week. Ryan was the 17th announced Democrat. And the field seems likely to go above 20 by the end of the month. (Don't forget about Joe Biden, who hasn't announced -- but is clearly running. More on him below.) Why so many candidates? First, because Trump is president -- proving that anything can happen in politics. Second, not all of these candidates think they will win but understand that running for president brings them a national spotlight -- for them personally or for an issue they care about -- they wouldn't get otherwise. 3. $$$, part 2 Most of the candidates we expected to raise a ton of cash in the first quarter -- Bernie Sanders ($18.2 million), Beto O'Rourke ($9.4 million), Kamala Harris ($12 million) -- have already released their reports. Which means that the numbers we see this week are coming from either a) second-tier candidates (and below) and b) top-tier candidates who have underperformed expectations in the money game. Cory Booker said Sunday that he had raised more than $5 million in the first quarter, putting him well behind the leaders of the pack. But he downplayed the importance of high dollar amounts, adding that his campaign team had met the first-quarter goal they had set for themselves. ""I think this election is not going to be decided by money,"" Booker said. ""We're going to raise the money that we need to run our plan."" We are still waiting on money totals from Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand -- among others. Warren's report will be the most closely scrutinized because she was expected to do quite well and early returns suggest she may have underperformed. 2. Town halls as far as the eye can see CNN is hosting 5(!) town halls with 2020 candidates this week, featuring Gillibrand, former HUD secretary Julián Castro and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee as the headliners. (Longer shots Marianne Williamson and Andrew Yang will also get a chance to answer questions from town hall crowds.) Gillibrand will start things off Tuesday, followed by Inslee on Wednesday and Castro on Thursday. And the task for each of the trio is similar: Find a way to stand out in a field currently dominated by better known and financed candidates. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!
In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!
Here's the one-line takeaway each of the candidates want voters to have after their town hall: Gillibrand: An advocate for the rights of women during her Senate tenure Inslee: Climate change isn't an environmental issue. It's an everything issue Castro: The only Latino candidate in the race, and the Texan not named Beto 1. Can Biden (finally) stop the bleeding? The former vice president is still not in the 2020 race -- sounds like a post-Easter announcement right now -- but he had his worst week of his (un)campaign last week. In trying to put allegations of unwanted touching with women behind him, Biden put out three statements and a video message. Problem was, he never just said ""sorry"" in any of them, and inflamed the whole story Friday when he joked about his habit of violating peoples' personal space. The reaction of Biden and his team -- underestimating the problem and then failing to deal with it effectively (and quickly) -- should worry anyone who thinks the former VP is the party's best nominee. The question now is whether Biden can move on from this bad past 10 days. He has an event in Philadelphia on Thursday to discuss the opioid crisis but nothing until then. Does the media -- and Democrats -- move on between now and then? Or is Biden asked questions about his behavior around women on Thursday? And, if he is asked, does he have a better answer than he had last week?"
Beto O'Rourke: Netanyahu a 'racist',us.cnn.com,Eli Watkins,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/beto-orourke-israel-netanyahu/index.html,"(CNN) Former Texas Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke offered sweeping criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday, outright calling him ""racist"" and an obstacle to peace.
Speaking in Iowa as he campaigns for the Democratic nomination for president, O'Rourke said the US-Israeli relationship was among the most important ""on the planet"" and singled out Netanyahu. ""That relationship, if it is to be successful, must transcend partisanship in the United States, and it must be able to transcend a prime minister who is racist, as he warns about Arabs coming to the polls, who wants to defy any prospect for peace as he threatens to annex the West Bank, and who has sided with a far-right, racist party in order to maintain his hold on power,"" O'Rourke said. O'Rourke continued, saying he did not believe Netanyahu ""represents the true will of the Israeli people"" or the ""best interests"" of the relationship between the US and Israel. He went on to endorse a two-state solution to achieve peace between Israel and the Palestinians. ""We must be able to transcend his current leadership to make sure that that alliance is strong, that we continue to push for and settle for nothing less than a two-state solution, because that is the best opportunity for peace for the people of Israel and the people of Palestine,"" O'Rourke said. ""It is the best opportunity for the full human rights of everyone who is living in that region."" Read More CNN has reached out to the Israeli Embassy in Washington for comment. O'Rourke made his comment to reporters after a rally where a voter asked about the conflict in the region. In the rally itself, O'Rourke offered similar criticism of Netanyahu, while also saying the Palestinian Authority had not acted in good faith. O'Rourke's comments joined a larger debate taking place in the US and Democratic Party about Israel and Netanyahu, whom President Donald Trump hosted in the White House just weeks before Israel is set to hold decisive elections in which Netanyahu is up for re-election. Trump has sought to seize on the issue, including by invoking a controversy in the House over anti-Semitism, while many Democrats running to challenge Trump in 2020 have rebuffed the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a political group strongly supportive of Netanyahu. Trump signed a proclamation in March recognizing the Golan Heights as part of Israel, overturning longstanding US policy regarding the area and handing Netanyahu a significant foreign policy victory in the run-up to the upcoming election. A report from Haaretz Quote: d Netanyahu as telling Channel 12 News Saturday, ""A Palestinian state will endanger our existence and I withstood huge pressure over the past eight years. No prime minister has withstood such pressure. We must control our destiny."" Netanyahu went on to say, ""I will extend sovereignty but I don't distinguish between the settlement blocs and the isolated ones, because each settlement is Israeli and I will not hand it over to Palestinian sovereignty."" Netanyahu has tacked further right in the leadup to the April elections, including working openly to improve the electoral prospects of lawmakers with roots in a party banned in the 1980s for racism."
Men arrested in connection with the deaths of 2 women in South Carolina CNN,us.cnn.com,Dakin Andone,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/us/spartanburg-south-carolina-bodies/index.html,"(CNN) Two suspects have been arrested and face murder charges after one of them told authorities where they could find the bodies of two women they allegedly killed and buried in Spartanburg, South Carolina officials said.
Jonathan Patterson Galligan, 39, and Christian Daniel Hurlburt, 41, both face charges of murder and accessory to murder after the fact in the deaths of Christin Bunner and Melissa Rhymer, according to a news release from the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office. Bunner's family had reported her missing in December 2018, the sheriff's office statement said, and told investigators Galligan was her current boyfriend. CNN affiliate WYFF reported both suspects were denied bond on Saturday night. CNN has been unable to determine if they have attorneys. Sheriff's deputies had responded to reports of a disturbance at a towing company on Wednesday night, according to the statement. Upon arrival, they encountered Hurlburt, who was holding his hands behind his back. Read More After initially refusing deputies' commands to show his hands, Hurlburt revealed a gun and shot himself in the head, the sheriff's office statement said. He received immediate medical aid on the scene, and was transported to a local hospital for further treatment. Investigation ongoing The next afternoon, Hurlburt asked investigators to visit him in the hospital and told them he was present when Galligan killed Bunner in December. He also admitted to helping Galligan bury the body behind a house on nearby Williams Street, according to the sheriff's office. Investigators located Galligan on Friday morning, while another team searched the Williams Street location. Galligan immediately asked for a lawyer and there was not enough evidence to hold him at that time, authorities said in a statement. Back at the hospital, Hurlburt then said a second woman had been killed and buried at the home, but he didn't know her name, the sheriff's office said. Hurlburt said he had killed her in January, and he and Galligan buried her near Bunner's grave. He provided enough information that authorities were subsequently able to locate both bodies, the statement said. The coroner identified the second victim as Rhymer. She was not listed as a missing person. Following a Friday press conference by Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright, authorities received a tip from a convenience store owner, who said he had seen Galligan. He was arrested without incident Saturday afternoon, the statement said. Hurlburt was also taken into cusody after being released from the hospital. Authorities have been unable to determine a motive for either killing, the sheriff's office said, and the investigation remains ongoing."
READ: Kirstjen Nielsen resignation letter from DHS Secretary post,us.cnn.com,CNN staff,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/kirstjen-nielsen-resignation-letter-dhs/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump announced on Twitter Sunday that Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security, is leaving his administration .
Read the resignation letter Nielsen posted online:
Mr. President, I hereby resign from the position of Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), effective April 7th 2019. It has been my great honor to lead the men and women of the Department as its sixth Secretary. I could not be prouder of and more humbled by their service, dedication, and commitment to keep our country safe from all threats and hazards. I join all Americans in thanking them for their sacrifices and those of their families. Read More For more than two years of service beginning during the Presidential Transition, I have worked tirelessly to advance the goals and missions of the Department. I am immensely proud of our successes in transforming DHS to keep pace with our enemies and adversaries — whether it is in cyberspace or against emerging threats from new technologies. Despite our progress in reforming homeland security for a new age, I have determined that it is the right time for me to step aside. I hope that the next Secretary will have the support of Congress and the courts in fixing the laws which have impeded our ability to fully secure America's borders and which have contributed to discord in our nation's discourse. Our country and the men and women of DHS deserve to have all the tools and resources they need to execute the mission entrusted to them. I can say with confidence our homeland is safer today than when I joined the Administration. We have taken unprecedented action to protect Americans. We have implemented historic efforts to defend our borders, combat illegal immigration, obstruct the inflow of drugs, and uphold our laws and values. We have responded decisively to record-breaking natural disasters and helped Americans rebuild. We have prevented the disruption of U.S. elections and guarded against foreign interference in our democracy. We have replaced complacency with consequences in cyberspace, we are holding digital intruders accountable, and we are stepping up our protection of American networks. We have thwarted terrorist plotting against our homeland and launched new efforts to block terrorists and criminals from reaching our shores. And we have ramped up security measures to make it harder for our enemies and adversaries to attack us, whether it is with drones, chemical and biological weapons, or through other means. Thank you again for the privilege to serve the American people and to lead the outstanding men and women of the Department of Homeland Security. Supporting these patriots has been the honor of a lifetime. Sincerely, Kirstjen M. Nielsen Secretary of Homeland Security"
Why the UK is moving to regulate the internet (Opinion) - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Jeremy Wright,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/opinions/uk-government-online-regulation-wright/index.html,"Jeremy Wright is the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in the UK. He was previously attorney general and elected the Conservative MP for Kenilworth and Southam in 2010. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN.
(CNN) The world recently celebrated the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web, which has changed the world for the better in many ways. It's now easier than ever to buy things with the click of a few buttons, share information quickly and safely, and give people who previously did not have a voice platforms to express their opinions.
Jeremy Wright But even the web's inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee has called for action to address a slate of problems borne out of the internet. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also recently came out in favor of stricter regulation. These are calls that the UK government has been listening to. We've heard tragic stories of everything from bullying and harassment to the promotion of self harm, suicide, child sexual abuse and the glorification of terrorism and violent crime. It's clear to us that self-regulation among tech companies has not been sufficient and action in the form of regulation is now needed. In a world first, the UK has published a blueprint for new legislation that will hold tech companies to account and protect those using their platforms. Snapchat ramps up advertising and vows to be better at privacy than Facebook The online world is changing rapidly, and it needs an independent regulator. It will enforce a new legal obligation for online platforms to exercise a duty of care to their users. This means that companies will have a responsibility to take reasonable and proportionate steps to protect their users from harm. It is similar to the principle that when you take your child to a playground, you trust that the builder made sure the equipment was safe and that no harm will come to them. Why should it be any different online? Read More This duty of care will be translated by the regulator into clear, concrete responsibilities for tackling harmful content and activity online. It will make tech companies more responsible for the content they host and place tougher requirements on platforms to take robust action against terrorism and child sexual exploitation and abuse. Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook won't delay livestreams after New Zealand massacre The regulator will have the powers needed to hold companies to account when they fail to keep us safe, including the power to issue substantial fines. And we are considering making senior managers liable for breaches of their company's duty of care. This is not about curtailing freedom of expression online. The internet has given people a voice, and we want to make sure that everyone has the freedom to express themselves. Our support for the free, open, global internet is undimmed. At the same time, we must uphold our values and democracy must be protected. It is about taking a balanced approach where government intervention helps tackle online harms, with the help of the tech firms themselves. HUD's new lawsuit against Facebook is a dagger at the heart of the consumer internet It is about not just using law, but also innovation. Technology companies need to be part of the solution and come up with innovative ways to protect their users. And we will make sure the new law minimizes the burden on start-ups, so we don't accidentally make it harder to innovate. The UK government will open these ideas up for consultation, and I want to hear views from the United States too. I recently visited Silicon Valley, where I met with the executives of large tech companies including Facebook, Google, Twitter and Apple. Online safety is a global issue, and we need to work together on it -- this can't be done in isolation, and we want to work with you and learn from partners around the world. I believe that the plan we have set out is a major step in the right direction. The tech sector has improved our lives immeasurably. Britain has always fostered and welcomed innovation, and we will continue to embrace it. Brits invented precursors of the modern computer, along with the World Wide Web, and we want to lead the debate on how we keep our citizens safe online. Stay up to date...

UK lawmakers warn journalists and activists could be extradited to China under new law - CNN,edition.cnn.com,James Griffiths,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/asia/hong-kong-extradition-law-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) The UK government has expressed concern over a new extradition law between Hong Kong and China, as British lawmakers warned the move could see pro-democracy activists, journalists, and foreign business owners surrendered to Chinese authorities.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had ""formally lodged our initial concerns"" with the Hong Kong government, he said in a letter to Chris Patten, the city's last colonial governor. ""We have made it clear to the Chinese and Hong Kong Special Administrative Regions that it is vital that Hong Kong enjoys, and is seen to enjoy, the full measure of its high degree of autonomy and rule of law as set out in the Joint Declaration and enshrined in the Basic Law. ... I can assure you that I, and my department, will continue to closely monitor developments in Hong Kong,"" Hunt said, according to a copy of the letter Patten shared with UK-based pressure group Hong Kong Watch . ""It is clear that the relatively short formal consultation process has not been sufficient to capture the wide-ranging views on this important topic. While Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, the city operates its own legal and political system, and citizens enjoy a number of freedoms not protected on the mainland. At present, Hong Kong does not have an extradition law with China, Taiwan or Macau, a situation officials in the city say has created loopholes preventing criminals from being brought to justice. Read More Fear that the law will allow dissidents and pro-democracy activists to be bundled over the border to China has dogged the bill since it was first suggested, however. Business groups too have expressed concerns, prompting the government to remove nine economic crimes from the list of potentially extraditable offenses. The government also changed the minimum severity of offense from those carrying one year in prison to three. In a statement responding to those changes, the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) said members continued ""to have serious concerns about the revised proposal."" ""Those concerns flow primarily from the fact that the new arrangements could be used for rendition from Hong Kong to a number of jurisdictions with criminal procedure systems very different from that of Hong Kong -- which provides strong protections for the legitimate rights of defendants -- without the opportunity for public and legislative scrutiny of the fairness of those systems and the specific safeguards that should be sought in cases originating from them,"" the AmCham statement said. ""We strongly believe that the proposed arrangements will reduce the appeal of Hong Kong to international companies considering Hong Kong as a base for regional operations."" Protesters march along a street during a rally in Hong Kong on March 31, 2019, to protest against the government's plans to approve extraditions with mainland China, Taiwan and Macau. Responding to reporter's questions about the law last month, Hong Kong Secretary for Security John Lee said the extradition law was part of the city's ""international commitment to fight organized crime."" He said the foreign business community should support the effort, which ""will benefit (the) business environment."" ""If the accusation is that somebody may unwittingly become a political offender, then I have said repeatedly that the law at present, under our Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, has clearly stated that this will not be possible,"" Lee added. ""There is a provision to say that no matter how you purport that offense to be, if it relates to political opinion, religion, nationality or ethnicity, then it will not be surrenderable."" AmCham's statement is part of a growing chorus of condemnation of the law from multiple quarters. Critics of the law point to past situations where people have been snatched in Hong Kong and transported to China to face trial, including multiple booksellers and Chinese businessman Xiao Jianhua . Last week , the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) said the new law could enable the Chinese government to extradite reporters critical of Beijing, saying it would ""not only threaten the safety of journalists but also have a chilling effect on the freedom of expression in Hong Kong."" ""Over the years, numerous journalists have been charged or harassed by mainland authorities with criminal allegations covered by the (law),"" it said. ""The (law) will make it possible for mainland authorities to get hold of journalists in Hong Kong (on) all kinds of unfounded charges. This sword hanging over journalists will muzzle both the journalists and the whistleblowers, bringing an end to the limited freedom of speech that Hong Kong still enjoys."" The Hong Kong Bar Association has also criticized the new law , and questioned the government's assertion that there were loopholes in the city's current arrangements."

Kevin McAleenan 'not an ideologue or fire breather' - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Kate Sullivan,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/07/politics/kevin-mcaleenan-acting-secretary-homeland-security/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump's choice to fill the role of Kirstjen Nielsen as secretary of Homeland Security is a career official who served in the Obama administration and whom a senior DHS official says is ""not an ideologue or fire breather"" on immigration.
Kevin McAleenan, who is expected to take over DHS in an acting capacity, was serving as the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection before Sunday's announcement. He was confirmed as commissioner by the Senate in March 2018 by a vote of 77-19. He is expected to serve as the acting secretary ""in the short term,"" according to a White House official. Nielsen should be staying for a week of transition, another White House official said. Nielsen tweeted Sunday night that she ""agreed to stay on as Secretary through Wednesday, April 10th to assist with an orderly transition and ensure that key DHS missions are not impacted."" Removing Nielsen and installing McAleenan as acting secretary presents issues for the line of succession. Putting McAleenan in charge skips over acting Deputy Secretary Claire Grady, who also serves in the Senate confirmed role as the Undersecretary of Management, which raises questions about her future. A senior administration official told CNN that legally Grady is next in line and will have to go in order for McAleenan to assume the role of acting secretary. Another official, asked about this question, told CNN there are issues that need to be addressed before McAleenan can take over. Read More The senior DHS official told CNN McAleenan is ""not an ideologue or fire breather"" on immigration like White House senior adviser Stephen Miller or Trump. This official wondered how McAleenan will fit in as Miller has placed several political appointees in the department who follow the immigration hardliner's marching orders. Another senior DHS official said, ""he's good at what he does. Every role he has had, he's improved conditions. I expect this will be the same."" But another administration official cautioned that although McAleenan ""knows border and immigration,"" he ""may not know the rest of DHS."" McAleenan also has shared some of Nielsen's frustrations with Trump over his demands from the department, two US officials familiar with his thinking said. He's also viewed warily by some of the White House immigration hardliners, led by Miller, who has Trump's ear on the issues he views as key to his re-election prospects. Career official Trump says DHS Secretary Nielsen leaving McAleenan is a career official who previously served as the deputy commissioner during President Barack Obama's administration. As commissioner of CBP, he oversaw 60,000 employees and managed a budget of more than $13 billion, according to the department's website . Last month, McAleenan said the ""breaking point has arrived"" for the US immigration system, and said CBP encountered the largest total number of migrants in years, with more than 4,000 in a single day, the vast majority of which were apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally. He announced he was moving 750 officers from ""key roles"" at the ports of entry to help Border Patrol care for migrants, including helping with processing and transportation.

In December, after two migrant children died in custody of US border officials, McAleenan reiterated calls for Congress to provide more funding to handle the influx of migrants crossing the border. That month, two Guatemalan children died after they were detained with their fathers after crossing the US-Mexico border. McAleenan received the Presidential Rank Award in 2015, according to the department's website, and also received the Service to America Medal and Call to Service Award in 2005 for spearheading anti-terrorism efforts at the border after the September 11, 2001 terrorism attacks.

US pulls troops from Libya amid a surge in violence,us.cnn.com,Eliza Mackintosh,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/middleeast/libya-tripoli-violence-intl/index.html,"(CNN) The United States military pulled a contingent of its troops from Libya on Sunday amid a surge in violence in the capital city of Tripoli, America's top commander for Africa said.
""The security realities on the ground in Libya are growing increasingly complex and unpredictable,"" Marine Corps Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, head of US Africa Command, said Sunday in a statement. ""Even with an adjustment of the force, we will continue to remain agile in support of existing US strategy."" The American forces, who provide military support for diplomatic missions, counterterrorism activities and improving regional security, have been relocated temporarily in response to ""increased unrest."" Col. Chris Karns, spokesman for Africa Command, reiterated that the movement of troops would not impact the force's ability to respond to threats and targets. ""For security reasons, I won't pinpoint where these forces will flow,"" said Karns. ""It is important (that) groups, such as ISIS, don't have an exact map of our whereabouts, but instead we use our finite resources on the continent to adjust swiftly, efficiently, and employ with maximum effect."" Read More Years of chaotic fighting in the war-torn country have reached a crescendo in recent days as General Khalifa Haftar pushes to take control of the capital. On Sunday, his so-called Libyan National Army (LNA) said it had launched airstrikes targeting UN-backed forces in southern Tripoli. General Khalifa Haftar salutes during a military parade in Benghazi on May 7, 2018. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement calling on Haftar to stop the offensive. ""We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital,"" he said in a statement Sunday. Saying there is ""no military solution to the Libya conflict,"" Pompeo called on Libyan leaders and other international partners to return to UN mediated negotiations. The United Nations Mission to Libya (UNSMIL) called for a ""humanitarian truce"" from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. local time in the south of the city, urging rival forces to halt fighting so that ambulances could safely extract civilians injured in clashes. Forces under the command of the renegade Libyan general made a surprise advance Thursday on the capital, where the country's UN-recognized government, the Government of National Accord, has its base. The GNA has announced a counteroffensive to defend Tripoli as Haftar's troops draw closer. On Sunday, spokesman for the GNA's armed forces, Mohammed Qanouno, heralded the launch of a military operation dubbed ""Volcano of Rage,"" aimed at ""cleansing all Libyan cities from the outlawed,"" Tripoli-based Libya Al-Ahrar TV reported. A spokesman for the Libyan forces of the Government of National Accord (GNA) holds a press conference in Tripoli on April 7. In the eight years since Moammar Gadhaffi was deposed and killed in the 2011 conflict, Haftar has been one of a handful of strongmen to take advantage of the nation's descent into disarray. Based in the city of Benghazi, Haftar already wields control over much of eastern Libya, but he has his sights set on claiming Tripoli. Warring militia occasionally spar for control over the heavily populated capital, which has prevented the UN-recognized and Western-backed government of Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj from fully grasping the reins of power. In the mix are multiple tribes competing for control of Libya's dwindling oil wealth, as well as militant groups, including ISIS, scattered across the vast country. A US citizen wants to overthrow a US-backed government in Libya. Here's why ""To our army stationed on the border of Tripoli today, we continue the march of struggle and response to the appeal of our people in the capital as we promised them,"" Haftar said in an audio recording posted on his media office's Facebook account on Thursday. He added that ""safety of our foreign guests and our institutions"" should be ensured. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres was in Benghazi last week for talks with Haftar to push for an international peace deal, but left empty handed. Following their meeting, Guterres said he was leaving Libya ""with a heavy heart and deeply concerned. I still hope it is possible to avoid a bloody confrontation in and around Tripoli."" The UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) have raised concerns over how the ongoing clashes will impact refugees and migrants stuck in detention centers in the area. ""The safety of migrants in detention is especially concerning should there be an escalation in military action,"" IOM Director General António Vitorino said in a statement on Friday. ""The fate of all Libyan civilians and the safety of humanitarian workers also remains an overriding concern."""
Maldives President who promised to investigate China headed for landslide election win,us.cnn.com,James Griffiths,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/asia/maldives-election-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Maldives President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih's political party looks to have scored a landslide victory in parliamentary elections Sunday.
According to state media , initial results show Solih's Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) has won 67 out of 87 seats in parliament, an historic margin that will strengthen his mandate to investigate the former government's ties to China. ""Today is a happy day,"" Solih said in a statement late Sunday. ""Without exception, the biggest winners of today's elections are the Maldivian people. To have this election across the country under peaceful and civil conditions is a clear win for us as a society. That our campaign was issue-oriented and not based on hatred and narrow divisions is a win for our young democracy. That our government did not hinder those candidates with whom we did not agree is a big win for the country."" Despite his party's victory, Solih promised to continue to work with coalition partners who last year helped him turf out former leader Abdulla Yameen , who plunged the country into chaos as he jailed activists and defied court orders in an attempt to maintain power. Yameen also moved the Maldives away from traditional ally India toward China, inviting investment under Beijing's expansive Belt and Road Initiative. Read More Ahead of last year's election, former President Mohamed Nasheed, then in exile in Sri Lanka, claimed as much as 80% of the Maldives' foreign debt was owed to China. Solih promised to reverse this and investigate the former administration's ties to China amid accusations of corruption. Speaking to supporters on Sunday, he said a new commission would be tasked with ""investigating corruption and recovering state assets function with the support of the new parliament."" ""The work of the commission investigating unresolved deaths and enforced disappearances will go ahead more quickly with the support of this parliament,"" he added, according to Reuters . The Maldives is one of multiple countries across Asia where Chinese investment and influence have become a major election issue . In Indonesia, which goes to the polls later this month, incumbent President Joko Widodo has come in for significant criticism over the amount of money his administration has accepted from Beijing. With Chinese investment being viewed with more suspicion, and increased skepticism over the Belt and Road Initiative, pre-existing concerns over Beijing's foreign policy aims and numerous regional territorial disputes have returned to the fore, harming Chinese influence."

The government said that an independent regulator would be created to enforce the new rules, which focus on removing content that incites violence, encourages suicide or constitutes cyber-bullying. Content related to terrorism and child abuse would face even stricter standards. Companies would be required to ""take reasonable and proportionate action"" to address objectionable content on their platforms, the government said in a statement. A ""code of practice"" would include measures to minimize the spread ""of misleading and harmful disinformation with dedicated fact checkers, particularly during election periods,"" it added. Why the UK is moving to regulate the internet Europe has taken a much more robust approach to tech regulation than the United States, confronting industry giants over competition issues, data protection, privacy and tax. Calls for stricter regulation have increased recently in the United Kingdom after social media was blamed for the suicide of a British teenager and Facebook failed to stop the live broadcast of a mass killing in New Zealand. Read More ""For too long these companies have not done enough to protect users, especially children and young people, from harmful content,"" Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement. ""That is not good enough, and it is time to do things differently."" The United Kingdom is casting a wide net. The plan, which the government will continue to develop over the next 12 weeks before proposing as legislation, extends to any company that ""allows users to share or discover user generated content or interact with each other."" That would include Twitter ( TWTR ) and Google ( GOOGL ) video platform YouTube, but also popular internet message boards such as Reddit. The companies would be required to have an easy and effective complaints function, where users would ""receive timely, clear and transparent responses to their complaints."" Social media firms would also be forced to publish annual reports on the amount of harmful content on their platforms and explain what they were doing to address the issue. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg calls for more regulation of the internet The government said that the new regulator would be empowered to block access to websites or apps that break the rules, thereby disrupting their business models. It also said that a ""range of options"" were being considered for subjecting individual senior managers to civil fines and criminal liability. The proposal suggested that rules governing executives in the financial services industry could be used as a model. Tech response Kent Walker, senior vice president at Google, wrote in a blog post earlier this year that the company was seeking to address illegal and harmful content by increasing transparency and working with regulators. Facebook ( FB ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in March that governments and regulators should play a ""more active role"" online. But he said that a global approach was needed to ensure that ""the Internet does not get fractured"" and ""entrepreneurs can build products that serve everyone."" ""Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree,"" he wrote in the Washington Post. ""I've come to believe that we shouldn't make so many important decisions about speech on our own."" Rebecca Stimson, Facebook's head of UK public policy, said Monday that new rules should support innovation, the digital economy and freedom of speech. ""These are complex issues to get right and we look forward to working with the [UK] government and parliament to ensure new regulations are effective,"" she said in a statement. Twitter's UK head of public policy Katy Minshall said in a statement on Monday that the company is ""deeply committed"" to the safety of its users, touting what she said are ""70 changes to our policies and processes last year."" ""We look forward to engaging in the next steps of the process, and working to strike an appropriate balance between keeping users safe and preserving the open, free nature of the internet,"" Minshall said."
Former News Corp exec explains how he was affected by Fox's 'anti-immigrant rhetoric',us.cnn.com,Brian Stelter,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/media/joseph-azam-news-corporation-rupert-murdoch-reliable-sources/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Joseph Azam joined Rupert Murdoch's News Corp in 2015. He says he loved working there. But after the presidential election, he noticed a disturbing ""change in tone.""
""I was fine with working with and for people who had different values and opinions than I did, but I noticed a significant shift in the ferociousness and, frankly, in the relationship with facts, you know, particularly on the Fox side,"" Azam said. As President Donald Trump took office, ""it became very profitable to kind of fall in line with an anti-immigrant, anti-refugee, anti-Muslim rhetoric,"" he said. ""And I was affected by that."" Azam, an Afghan-American immigrant, eventually had enough. He resigned in late 2017. He recounted the ups and downs of working for the Murdoch media empire on CNN's ""Reliable Sources"" on Sunday. Azam was a senior vice president in the legal department at News Corp, the half of Murdoch's house that includes the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers. Fox News is part of the other half. But both sides came together in the New York City tower where Azam worked. He said he interacted with Fox hosts in the elevators, for example, ""so I was exposed to it every day.""

""I'm comfortable saying I wasn't the only one who was troubled,"" he added. Troubled by what exactly? ""By the dehumanization taking place in some of the coverage and the opinion shows"" and by ""a lack of decency."" News Corp declined to comment on Azam. It is well known that Murdoch's companies employ many, many people who don't share the family's conservative ideology. But it is rare to hear from a former executive like this. Azam left the building quietly when he resigned in late 2017. But he has been increasingly vocal on Twitter, commenting at one point last month that ""I am so glad not to be walking into work in that building any more.""

In that interview, and again on Sunday, he cited recent acts of violence by extremists as a motivating factor. ""After the murder of an Afghan-American in Indiana, after Christchurch, after Tree of Life, it became really important, you know, to think about saying something and engaging more in the discourse that was taking place publicly,"" he said. He named Tucker Carlson's weekday show and Jeanine Pirro's Saturday show as examples of especially objectionable content. Both are also among the best-rated shows on Fox News. Despite his criticism of the content, Azam said he very much enjoyed working at News Corp: ""There were a lot of inherently smart, hard-working decent people there."" He said it's a ""very diverse company"" — and that ""one of the things that I was hoping to accomplish by coming out is to say 'We're here, too.'"""

Aro called the recognition ""precious ... because my work has also cost me so much."" She has suffered harassment and cyberattacks since she started reporting on Russian propaganda activities in 2014. US embassy officials in Helsinki asked her last October if she would accept a nomination for the award. She thought it was a done deal in January. ""But then it was taken away,"" she said on Sunday's ""Reliable Sources"" on CNN. Read More In the weeks leading up to the March 7 ceremony in Washington, Aro's award was rescinded. Foreign Policy magazine, which broke the story about Aro , Quote: d sources who said she was nixed because she repeatedly criticized President Donald Trump on Twitter. The yanking of her award ""really counters the whole idea of this award,"" Aro said. Someone inside the Trump administration, she implied, lacked courage. Aro said she was grateful for the Foreign Policy story because she had been in the dark about what happened. But she was ""horrified"" that her commentary about Trump was an apparent factor. She went through her past tweets -- like a February 17 reply to the president, when he called the media ""rigged,"" ""corrupt"" and an ""enemy of the people."" She replied to him that day and said ""the Kremlin doesn't need any troll factories as long as it has YOU trolling on behalf of it!"" ""I still stand by what I said and what I tweeted,"" she said. ""I think that President Trump's attacks against the media are disgraceful, and need to be also discussed on Twitter as well."" Speaking to a US audience, Aro said, ""I am really sorry for you guys over there if that really is the situation, if Trump or his administration have been infected with fear and self-censorship."" After the Foreign Policy story came out, Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee obtained a set of emails between Aro and the State Department and called for the agency's inspector general to investigate the circumstances. New documents raise questions over State Dept. move to rescind honor for Trump critic A State Department spokesman originally claimed that Aro was ""incorrectly notified"" that ""she'd been selected as a finalist. This was an error. This was a mistake."" But the internal emails cast doubt on this version of events. The emails showed months of correspondence about the award and her expected trip to Washington. Things changed after an embassy official asked her to send a list of her ""social media handles."" Aro said the State Department's original claims were ""factually incorrect."" And that's why she is thankful that senators are looking into the matter. ""I really want to know: Who was the person who really gave the order to cancel my award? And what would he or she like to tell about her motivation in doing so?"" ""It doesn't really look like this process of canceling my award has followed the best practices and transparency policies of the State Department governance,"" Aro added. The State Department inspector general's office has not commented on the possibility of a probe. As for the reason why she was going to be recognized in the first place, Aro is now working on a book about so-called Russian troll farms. And she said she will continue training people to better recognize trolling and propaganda warfare efforts. Aro said westerners still don't understand ""how cynical and massive"" the Russian effort really is. ""We are misunderstanding the scale and also the impact of these propaganda operations of the Kremlin,"" she said. ""Viral disinformation is being used to manipulate and agitate actual people, real people, into hateful actions."""
The bold women of 'Game of Thrones' have origins in Scottish history,us.cnn.com,"Sarah Minnear, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/entertainment/game-of-thrones-women-history-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) Beginning April 14, the world will tune in to watch the Starks, Daenerys Targaryen's armies and some wayward Lannisters do battle with an undead army and a zombie dragon.
For most of the past decade ""Game of Thrones"" has awed viewers with its bold plotlines and political intrigue. But its fantasy world is not as mythical as it seems, and some of its most pivotal moments are rooted in history. Author George R.R. Martin often draws from the historical record, and there are a plethora of historical parallels in his ""Song of Ice and Fire"" series upon which the HBO series is based. The Dothraki's fearsome bloodriders mirror the indomitable force of Genghis Khan's cavalry. And the shocking Red Wedding was practically torn from the pages of Scottish history as it was based on the Glencoe massacre of 1692, in which Archibald Campbell's soldiers slaughtered members of the McDonald clan amid a bitter blood feud. 'Game of Thrones' is wrapping up and we have SO many questions we need answered Feuding is rampant in ""Game of Thrones"" and likely inspired in part by the Wars of the Roses in 15th-century England between the Lancasters and the Yorks -- and the feuding in Scotland, which was far more prevalent. Blood feuding, both in Scotland and in Westeros, evokes images of bloodthirsty men of the aristocracy, eager to exact retribution for slain family members. However, for every Rob Stark we have a Catelyn Stark, who took it upon herself to avenge her dead husband. Read More So what does history tell us about these bold women? Historian Keith Brown, Dean of Humanities at the University of Manchester, notes that the women of early Scottish history were seen as ""soft targets"" in the eyes of acquisitive neighbors -- or sometimes their own family -- and their ""best defense lay in marriage."" Yet these women could also wield power to avenge their families, not unlike Cersei Lannister, Margaery Tyrell and Sansa Stark. Janet Scott, the Sansa Stark of Ferniehirst Sansa Stark is coming into her own as a strong and savvy leader. Dame Janet Scott was certainly not a ""soft target"" during the vicious Scott-Kerr feud of the 1500s. She had a reason to resent the Kerr clan, just as Catelyn Stark hated the Lannisters or Daenerys Targaryen loathed Robert Baratheon. Her grandfather was stabbed to death in Edinburgh by a group of Kerrs in 1548 and her father was murdered that same year. Her mother was killed when the Kerrs locked her inside a tower and set it aflame. Ferniehirst Castle, home of Dame Janet Scott. Just as Sansa Stark remembers how Joffrey slaughtered her father, Janet Scott would never forget that the Kerrs were responsible for murdering her family. When Dame Janet grew older and became responsible for her frequently exiled husband's lands, she acted on this burning resentment by using the Scottish courts to harass a powerful lord named Robert Kerr. Scott obtained letters ordering Kerr to deliver crops to her. If he failed to respond, she threatened to ""put him to the horn,"" meaning Kerr would be declared an outlaw and potentially be banished. It was a brave step considering that Kerr once reportedly killed four men to avenge the theft of a sheepdog. This same feminine contempt for powerful men is seen in ""Game of Thrones"" when Sansa Stark taunts Ramsay Bolton before the Battle of the Bastards. Her words to him -- ""You're going to die today, Lord Bolton. Sleep well"" -- certainly mirror Janet Scott's attitude towards Robert Kerr. He came from a family that had taken so much from her, and she was not afraid to strike back. Henrietta Stewart, the Margaery Tyrell of Dunfermline Margaery Tyrell used her beauty to seduce and manipulate powerful men. Henrietta Stewart is another example of how historical women could be active participants in a blood feud. Her masterful manipulation of Scottish court politics rivals only ""Game of Thrones'"" Margaery Tyrell and the queen of thorns, Lady Olenna. Margaery knew how to use her charisma to advance her family's interests. For example, she frequently told Sansa Stark how happy she would be in Highgarden if she married Loras Tyrell. Although the union never happened, Margaery nearly succeeded in securing the north for the Tyrells. In 16th-century Scotland, Henrietta Stewart used similar tactics during a blood feud between her family and the Gordons. Dunfermline Abbey, home to Henrietta Stewart. Stewart's masterful politicking reached its height after a scuffle between her husband, George Gordon, and James Stewart (who, despite his name, was from a different family). In December 1590, things became heated when Gordon and James Stewart were both in Edinburgh, surrounded by considerable retinues and on the brink of violence. Henrietta Stewart used her charm, and her friendship with Queen Anne of Denmark, to persuade King James VI of Scotland to broker an agreement between the two parties, forcing the two noblemen to remain in the city. This stalemate spared the Gordons' lands from attack and gave her family a tactical advantage. It's clear evidence of how a woman can take a proactive role during a feud. Margaery Tyrell would certainly approve. Agnes Keith, the Catelyn Stark of Argyle Catelyn Stark, whose efforts to vanquish the Lannisters ended badly for her. In ""Game of Thrones"" Lady Catelyn Stark plots revenge after her husband Ned is betrayed and killed by the Lannisters. She spends the rest of her days hassling Lannister family members and recruiting armies to oppose them. Castle Doune in central Scotland, once home to the Stewart family. ""Game of Thrones"" has shot scenes there. And in Scotland in the 1500s, Lady Agnes Keith held a terrible grudge against the Gordons over the slaying of her husband, James Stewart. She made life difficult for George Gordon, especially during a quarrel involving fishing rights on the River Spey. Her persistence, like Catelyn Stark's, shows how widows didn't cower after the deaths of their husbands. Despite facing eventual defeat, both women proved to be a nuisance for their enemies. Isobel Sinclair, the Cersei Lannister of Caithness The ruthless Cersei Lannister. In her thirst to vanquish her enemies, ""Game of Thrones'"" Cersei Lannister inadvertently causes the death of her son and last surviving child, Tommen. It's not unlike what happened in Scotland in 1567, when John Gordon, the 11th Earl of Sutherland, and his wife were poisoned at Helmsdale Castle by Isobel Sinclair, whose family was feuding with the Gordons (everyone was feuding with the Gordons). The Castle of Mey in Caithness was once home to the Sinclair family. But in doing so, Sinclair accidentally poisoned her own son. Both Sinclair and Cersei were schemers who advanced their family's interests and power -- but at the cost of losing a child."

(CNN) The world recently celebrated the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web, which has changed the world for the better in many ways. It's now easier than ever to buy things with the click of a few buttons, share information quickly and safely, and give people who previously did not have a voice platforms to express their opinions.
Jeremy Wright But even the web's inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee has called for action to address a slate of problems borne out of the internet. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also recently came out in favor of stricter regulation. These are calls that the UK government has been listening to. We've heard tragic stories of everything from bullying and harassment to the promotion of self harm, suicide, child sexual abuse and the glorification of terrorism and violent crime. It's clear to us that self-regulation among tech companies has not been sufficient and action in the form of regulation is now needed. In a world first, the UK has published a blueprint for new legislation that will hold tech companies to account and protect those using their platforms. Snapchat ramps up advertising and vows to be better at privacy than Facebook The online world is changing rapidly, and it needs an independent regulator. It will enforce a new legal obligation for online platforms to exercise a duty of care to their users. This means that companies will have a responsibility to take reasonable and proportionate steps to protect their users from harm. It is similar to the principle that when you take your child to a playground, you trust that the builder made sure the equipment was safe and that no harm will come to them. Why should it be any different online? Read More This duty of care will be translated by the regulator into clear, concrete responsibilities for tackling harmful content and activity online. It will make tech companies more responsible for the content they host and place tougher requirements on platforms to take robust action against terrorism and child sexual exploitation and abuse. Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook won't delay livestreams after New Zealand massacre The regulator will have the powers needed to hold companies to account when they fail to keep us safe, including the power to issue substantial fines. And we are considering making senior managers liable for breaches of their company's duty of care. This is not about curtailing freedom of expression online. The internet has given people a voice, and we want to make sure that everyone has the freedom to express themselves. Our support for the free, open, global internet is undimmed. At the same time, we must uphold our values and democracy must be protected. It is about taking a balanced approach where government intervention helps tackle online harms, with the help of the tech firms themselves. HUD's new lawsuit against Facebook is a dagger at the heart of the consumer internet It is about not just using law, but also innovation. Technology companies need to be part of the solution and come up with innovative ways to protect their users. And we will make sure the new law minimizes the burden on start-ups, so we don't accidentally make it harder to innovate. The UK government will open these ideas up for consultation, and I want to hear views from the United States too. I recently visited Silicon Valley, where I met with the executives of large tech companies including Facebook, Google, Twitter and Apple. Online safety is a global issue, and we need to work together on it -- this can't be done in isolation, and we want to work with you and learn from partners around the world. I believe that the plan we have set out is a major step in the right direction. The tech sector has improved our lives immeasurably. Britain has always fostered and welcomed innovation, and we will continue to embrace it.

Trump's personal security breaches are a problem for all (Opinion) - CNN,us.cnn.com,Samantha Vinograd,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/opinions/presidential-weekly-briefing-trump-personal-security-breach-vinograd/index.html,"Samantha Vinograd is a CNN national security analyst.

(CNN) Every week, I offer a glimpse of the kind of intelligence assessments that are likely to come across the desk of the President of the United States, modeled on the President's Daily Briefing, or PDB, which the director of national intelligence prepares for the President almost daily.
Sam Vinograd Here's this week's briefing: There is nothing new about security breaches affecting US Presidents -- they have always been key targets of foreign intelligence operations. Foreign governments are eager to understand US Presidents -- their motivations, misgivings, and moods -- so that they can influence US policy. While US Presidents have long been plagued by security risks, they have historically done everything possible to guard against threats to their property, person, and personnel. What is new, however, is how knowingly President Donald Trump increases his personal insecurities, rather than trying to neutralize them. JUST WATCHED New audio released of woman in Mar-a-Lago security breach Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
New audio released of woman in Mar-a-Lago security breach 02:13 Read More ""Flukes"" are trending Earlier this week, Yujing Zhang breached security at President Trump's private club, Mar-a-Lago. Zhang was found with four cell phones, a laptop, an ""external hard drive type device"" and a thumb drive which a preliminary investigation found contained malicious malware, according to the criminal complaint. She has been charged with making false statements and entering a restricted area. It's notable that Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo responded to the incident in very different ways. Trump said he was ""not concerned at all"" and called the security breakdown a fluke while Pompeo said it was a sign of the threat that China poses. This security breach comes just weeks after news broke that Cindy Yang, a Chinese-American businesswoman who founded the massage parlor chain where New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was arrested in a prostitution sting, allegedly advertised access to events like ""VIP activities at Mar-a-Lago."" Trump White House's self-inflicted security debacle Democrats are demanding a new FBI investigation into the company that Yang reportedly started, GY US Investments, and the two incidents. Both raise serious questions about security at Mar-a-Lago, where management -- not the Secret Service -- determines who is allowed access to the club. As a private property, Secret Service does not have full control over who accesses Mar-a-Lago. It is a commercial property that the President visits on a temporary basis (often). Mar-a-Lago management (which President Trump knows well, of course) is in charge of access at the property, and it is unlikely that they screen guests the same way that Secret Service would before guests access presidential properties like the White House or Camp David. Instead of visiting permanent presidential retreats like Camp David or simply staying in the White House, where Secret Service has full control over security, President Trump often chooses to visit Mar-a-Lago and his other properties. The potential for foreign agents to pose as guests raises serious counterintelligence concerns for the President and his family. For the right price (or membership fee ) almost anyone can get close to the President while he is at Mar-a-Lago and, at a minimum, observe him while he is there and not inside classified or restricted spaces at the club. There are a number of other soft targets at Mar-a-Lago. Compromised electronics can pose serious information security or surveillance threats, and there are real risks that people at Mar-a-Lago can compromise existing information infrastructure at the club by accessing computers, phones or more. President Trump is the commander-in-chief -- he could choose not to visit Mar-a-Lago, where he knows there are serious risks, or he could shut down the club while he is President. At the very least, he could suggest that Mar-a-Lago consult with the FBI on how to mitigate counterintelligence risks associated with members' access, considering what an prime target it is. Keeping members happy might keep the cash flow steady, but presidential security should be the priority, not an afterthought. Put down your phone The President's communications choices also signal that he's either not listening to counterintelligence experts or simply doesn't care what they have to say. Trump has resisted efforts to makes his iPhone activity more secure. And he continues to use his iPhones despite security experts telling him that foreign intelligence services are listening. Why Javanka's security clearances were vital to Trump Unless he was planning on a conference call, he is knowingly flouting experts' advice and letting foreign governments potentially listen to his private conversations -- conversations that our own government may not be allowed to listen to. Foreign intelligence services have historically tried to hack other leaders' devices to gain insights into their preferences, trigger points, and thinking. It doesn't help that the President chooses to use devices that are not as secure as they could be. And, while they have easier access to his personal phones and conversations, President Trump's Twitter trigger finger means that a lot more about him is public knowledge -- including his mood at various times of the day. It's one thing to like large audiences, it's another to have any extra eyes or ears on his personal communications. Clearance chaos The ongoing security clearance saga is another public reminder that the President has chosen to ignore experts' recommendations. Trump overruled intelligence officials and a White House lawyer when he ordered his chief of staff to grant his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner top-secret security clearance. Whistleblower Tricia Newbold said senior officials granted clearances to another 25 people who were initially denied over a range of disqualifying reasons, although it's unclear how many of those cases Trump personally intervened in. Democrats face a tough choice in battling Trump on executive privilege If Kushner misuses any intelligence he now has access to, or falls prey to manipulation at the hands of foreign governments, the President has no one to blame but himself. Kushner's access to top-secret material not only endangers security in the West Wing, it threatens the trust our alliances have in sharing sensitive material with us. Our intelligence partners in countries like the UK or Canada, for example, could choose to hold back on the intel they share with the United States if they fear those close to the President cannot responsibly handle classified information. If the President was really focused on promoting US national security, he would strip Kushner of his clearance, launch a review of all those who were initially denied, and rely solely on experts' recommendations going forward. It seems unlikely the President will undertake that plan of action. And we don't know if the President has directed his team to follow experts' advice when awarding new clearances -- even when it comes to his own personal friends and family. Seeing red With special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation -- or at least Attorney General William Barr's summary of it -- behind him, the President is propagating the conclusion that he is not a Russian asset and that anyone that says so is motivated by politics. But we don't know if the broader counterintelligence investigation into the President concluded when Mueller submitted his report to Attorney General Barr. And the Mueller investigation centered around the 2016 election -- so unless the FBI says the President is not the target of a counterintelligence investigation, we don't know if they still have concerns about his behavior. We don't know if the President is being manipulated (knowingly or unknowingly) by Russia, but we do know that he is doing things that make their mission against us a lot easier. Regardless of what the details of the Mueller report include, the US intelligence community assessed that Russia is trying to undermine trust in our authorities as well as our democratic process, and that they're using information warfare to spread disinformation and divisions. President Trump gets far more detailed briefings on Russian activities in a classified setting, yet he still continues to say and do things that help further those Russian operations against us. He encouraged paranoia about US election results, and continually trashes the US law enforcement community and the media. To top it off, hardly a day goes by without Trump tweeting something divisive or inaccurate. Stay up to date...
Our adversaries have always adapted and evolved their tactics while we have historically tried to make their jobs as hard as possible. If President Trump doesn't prioritize national security and address the ways he's made himself an easy target, foreign intelligence services and the leaders they serve have a major leg up on us. Instead of reflecting on how he can make himself -- and by extension, all of us -- safer, the President seems intent on sticking by his bad decisions. He's signaling that convenience and comfort -- for him and his family -- trump securing his person and his property. President Trump's personal insecurities are showing -- and growing."
"No, Americans are not 'dumb' for wanting to see Trump's tax returns (Opinion) - CNN",us.cnn.com,Dean Obeidallah,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/opinions/trump-tax-returns-obeidallah/index.html,"Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM radio's daily program ""The Dean Obeidallah Show"" and a columnist for The Daily Beast. Follow him @DeanObeidallah . The opinions are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN.
(CNN) Donald Trump's acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney made it clear in one word Sunday when Trump will produce his tax returns in response to recent requests by congressional Democrats: ""Never."" Mulvaney, then, channeling what you'd expect to hear from ""the Hand of the King"" in ""Game of Thrones,"" added, ""Nor should they"" obtain the President's taxes.
While Mulvaney may have conjured up the dismissiveness of a monarch, at least he didn't dub the Democratic officials seeking Trump's tax returns ""dumb."" That, though, was the response of Sen. John Kennedy, R-Louisiana, on Friday, who slammed Rep. Richard Neal, D-Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, in response to his recent request to obtain six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns. Kennedy not only claimed the entire effort was political in nature, he personally mocked Neal for making the request, telling CNN's Jake Tapper, ""It must really suck to be that dumb."" Trump's odd riffs If Kennedy believes that people who want to see Trump's tax returns are ""dumb,"" then I'm as dumb as they come. In fact, so are 60% of my fellow Americans who believe House Democrats should ""make use of (their) authority to obtain and publicly release"" Trump's tax returns, as a January ABC News/Washington Post poll found. You don't have to be a detective on ""CSI"" to get a sense that there's a reason Trump doesn't want America to see his tax returns. I don't want to engage in rank speculation as to the why, but the fact is that Trump was the first major party presidential candidate since Watergate to fail to release his tax returns. Yet Trump wants you to believe he's all for transparency. During the 2016 campaign, Trump told us he didn't ""mind releasing"" his returns, but he couldn't do so at the time because he was ""under a routine audit."" Read More There are a few problems with that response if we are to believe Trump sincerely has no issues with releasing his returns. First, then-President Richard Nixon released his tax returns in the midst of an audit in 1973. In addition, the IRS publicly stated in the heat of the 2016 campaign that there was no prohibition on Trump, or any individual for that matter, releasing his or her returns during an audit. On top of all that, Trump's own lawyers during the 2016 campaign stated that the IRS audit of Trump's returns through 2008 was completed , begging the question: if Trump was truly about transparency, why didn't he release the returns not being audited?! New York Times: Trump requested that Senate prioritize IRS chief counsel nomination And since winning the election, Trump's response to requests for his tax returns have ranged from evasiveness to outright stonewalling. For example, in January 2017, when asked about releasing his returns, Trump claimed that only the media cared about the issue, ""You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, okay? They're the only ones."" Then in May 2017, when again asked about his tax filings, Trump told us for the first time that, "" I might release them after I'm out of office. "" But Trump has now taken his opposition to the release of his tax returns to desperate heights, in light of Rep. Neal's formal request for six years of his personal and corporate returns. As CNN recently reported , Trump and his legal team are so opposed to releasing the returns that they ""are willing to fight the House Democratic request all the way to the Supreme Court."" As one Trump official added, ""This is a hill and people would be willing to die on it."" People are willing to ""die"" to keep Trump's tax returns from going public?! Wow, so much for Trump being happy to release his returns after the audit was completed. And to that end, an attorney for Trump sent a letter to the Department of Treasury on Friday objecting to Rep. Neal's request, claiming it was a ""gross abuse of power"" and was simply an effort to ""harass"" Trump because Democrats ""dislike his politics and speech."" Curiously missing from that letter was any claim Trump was still under audit or that Trump would release his returns once any audit was completed. (Rep. Neal has also requested that the IRS verify that Trump is in fact being audited.) Stay up to date...
In addition to Mulvaney stating bluntly on Sunday that Democrats will ""never"" get the tax returns, Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's lawyers, declared on Friday that Trump would not turn over ""a single thing"" to congressional Democrats in regard to Trump's taxes, claiming the request was ""pure harassment."" When you reflect on how Trump and his allies are doing their best to keep the American people from seeing Trump's tax returns, I don't think the word ""dumb"" is the right word to describe those who want transparency. Rather, it would be dumb to not compel the production of those documents, because American voters deserve to know what is in Trump's returns before they vote in 2020."
A government-funded Swedish art project will pay you to do whatever you want Style,www.cnn.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/style/article/swedish-train-station-art-job-style/index.html,"A government-funded Swedish art project will pay you to do whatever you want Published 8th March 2019 A government-funded Swedish art project will pay you to do whatever you want Written by Michelle Lou Saeed Ahmed, CNN A Swedish art project is offering the ultimate dream job for slackers: It will pay someone about $2,280 a month to do whatever their heart desires. The successful candidate will be required to clock in and out every day at the new Korsvägen train station in Gothenburg, Sweden. Other than that, the position has no set responsibilities or duties. The employee will have free rein to move around -- and they won't even need to stay in the station once they've checked in for work, as long as they return at the end of the day. Man leaves original Picasso on train The idea, titled ""Eternal Employment,"" is the brainchild of Swedish art duo Simon Goldin and Jakob Senneby. The conceptual performance has been designed to offer political commentary and insight into the labor market. ""Eternal Employment"" was a winning entry in the Chronotopia competition , which sought public art ideas for two new train stations in Gothenburg. Construction work on Korsvägen station is expected to finish in 2026, which is also the anticipated start date for the ""Eternal Employment"" job. Applications will open in 2025. The purpose of labor The train station will offer a changing room for its new employee, and a clock used to check in and out of work. The clock will be connected to fluorescent lights above the platform. These ""working lights,"" which will be designed to resemble archetypical office lights, will signal whenever the employee is ""at work,"" according to the artists' proposal. ""Although almost invisible at first, over time 'Eternal Employment' has the potential to amass a rich history of rumors, jokes, news stories and other secondary mediation, making its way into the oral history of Gothenburg,"" the proposal reads. Art or amusement park? Tremendous public installations that will boggle your mind The project seeks to explore the role of labor at a time when growing numbers of people take on nontraditional jobs in a post-industrial society, the artists said. Goldin and Senneby acknowledge that an employee without specific duties may become bored. But their proposal also suggests that the successful candidate may come up with their own creative projects or ""simply embrace a state of perpetual leisure."" ""Eternal Employment not only offers a different understanding of work and the worker,"" the proposal continues, ""but questions the very notions of growth, productivity and progress which are at the core of modernity."" ""In the face of mass automation and artificial intelligence, the impending threat/promise is that we will all become productively superfluous,"" the artists added. ""We will all be 'employed at Korsvägen', as it were."" Commentary on inequality The artists were inspired by economist Thomas Piketty, who argued that return on capital grows faster than average wage increases in developed countries. In effect, the rich get richer while the poor continue to struggle. Exploring the effects of social media on art and culture, one selfie at a time Goldin and Senneby said the project is financially feasible because we live in a society where ""money pays better than work."" As such, the artists plan to set up a foundation to oversee the long-term investment of 6 million Swedish krona (about $633,000) -- the sum of the prize money provided by the Public Art Agency Sweden and the Swedish Transport Administration as part of the competition. Capital gains from the investment will fund the employee's salary for at least 120 years, according to the artists' estimates. The pay, pension and holidays offered with the position match those of an average public sector employee, according to the proposal. If the money runs out, the employment would stop and the lights would never turn on again, it said. ""That would imply an historical shift in the relation between return on capital and wages,"" the artists wrote. ""A sustained period in which work pays better than money."" Best Lifestyle & Leisure"
UK lawmakers warn journalists and activists could be extradited to China under new law,us.cnn.com,James Griffiths,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/07/asia/hong-kong-extradition-law-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) The UK government has expressed concern over a new extradition law between Hong Kong and China, as British lawmakers warned the move could see pro-democracy activists, journalists, and foreign business owners surrendered to Chinese authorities.
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had ""formally lodged our initial concerns"" with the Hong Kong government, he said in a letter to Chris Patten, the city's last colonial governor. ""We have made it clear to the Chinese and Hong Kong Special Administrative Regions that it is vital that Hong Kong enjoys, and is seen to enjoy, the full measure of its high degree of autonomy and rule of law as set out in the Joint Declaration and enshrined in the Basic Law. ... I can assure you that I, and my department, will continue to closely monitor developments in Hong Kong,"" Hunt said, according to a copy of the letter Patten shared with UK-based pressure group Hong Kong Watch . ""It is clear that the relatively short formal consultation process has not been sufficient to capture the wide-ranging views on this important topic. While Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, the city operates its own legal and political system, and citizens enjoy a number of freedoms not protected on the mainland. At present, Hong Kong does not have an extradition law with China, Taiwan or Macau, a situation officials in the city say has created loopholes preventing criminals from being brought to justice. Read More Fear that the law will allow dissidents and pro-democracy activists to be bundled over the border to China has dogged the bill since it was first suggested, however. Business groups too have expressed concerns, prompting the government to remove nine economic crimes from the list of potentially extraditable offenses. The government also changed the minimum severity of offense from those carrying one year in prison to three. In a statement responding to those changes, the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) said members continued ""to have serious concerns about the revised proposal."" ""Those concerns flow primarily from the fact that the new arrangements could be used for rendition from Hong Kong to a number of jurisdictions with criminal procedure systems very different from that of Hong Kong -- which provides strong protections for the legitimate rights of defendants -- without the opportunity for public and legislative scrutiny of the fairness of those systems and the specific safeguards that should be sought in cases originating from them,"" the AmCham statement said. ""We strongly believe that the proposed arrangements will reduce the appeal of Hong Kong to international companies considering Hong Kong as a base for regional operations."" Protesters march along a street during a rally in Hong Kong on March 31, 2019, to protest against the government's plans to approve extraditions with mainland China, Taiwan and Macau. Responding to reporter's questions about the law last month, Hong Kong Secretary for Security John Lee said the extradition law was part of the city's ""international commitment to fight organized crime."" He said the foreign business community should support the effort, which ""will benefit (the) business environment."" ""If the accusation is that somebody may unwittingly become a political offender, then I have said repeatedly that the law at present, under our Fugitive Offenders Ordinance, has clearly stated that this will not be possible,"" Lee added. ""There is a provision to say that no matter how you purport that offense to be, if it relates to political opinion, religion, nationality or ethnicity, then it will not be surrenderable."" AmCham's statement is part of a growing chorus of condemnation of the law from multiple quarters. Critics of the law point to past situations where people have been snatched in Hong Kong and transported to China to face trial, including multiple booksellers and Chinese businessman Xiao Jianhua . Last week , the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) said the new law could enable the Chinese government to extradite reporters critical of Beijing, saying it would ""not only threaten the safety of journalists but also have a chilling effect on the freedom of expression in Hong Kong."" ""Over the years, numerous journalists have been charged or harassed by mainland authorities with criminal allegations covered by the (law),"" it said. ""The (law) will make it possible for mainland authorities to get hold of journalists in Hong Kong (on) all kinds of unfounded charges. This sword hanging over journalists will muzzle both the journalists and the whistleblowers, bringing an end to the limited freedom of speech that Hong Kong still enjoys."" The Hong Kong Bar Association has also criticized the new law , and questioned the government's assertion that there were loopholes in the city's current arrangements."

Why the UK is moving to regulate the internet (Opinion),rss.cnn.com,Jeremy Wright,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/KY_oa2NBTqM/index.html,"Jeremy Wright is the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in the UK.

(CNN) The world recently celebrated the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web, which has changed the world for the better in many ways. It's now easier than ever to buy things with the click of a few buttons, share information quickly and safely, and give people who previously did not have a voice platforms to express their opinions.
Jeremy Wright But even the web's inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee has called for action to address a slate of problems borne out of the internet. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg also recently came out in favor of stricter regulation. These are calls that the UK government has been listening to. We've heard tragic stories of everything from bullying and harassment to the promotion of self harm, suicide, child sexual abuse and the glorification of terrorism and violent crime. It's clear to us that self-regulation among tech companies has not been sufficient and action in the form of regulation is now needed. In a world first, the UK has published a blueprint for new legislation that will hold tech companies to account and protect those using their platforms. Snapchat ramps up advertising and vows to be better at privacy than Facebook The online world is changing rapidly, and it needs an independent regulator. It will enforce a new legal obligation for online platforms to exercise a duty of care to their users. This means that companies will have a responsibility to take reasonable and proportionate steps to protect their users from harm. It is similar to the principle that when you take your child to a playground, you trust that the builder made sure the equipment was safe and that no harm will come to them. Why should it be any different online? Read More This duty of care will be translated by the regulator into clear, concrete responsibilities for tackling harmful content and activity online. It will make tech companies more responsible for the content they host and place tougher requirements on platforms to take robust action against terrorism and child sexual exploitation and abuse. Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook won't delay livestreams after New Zealand massacre The regulator will have the powers needed to hold companies to account when they fail to keep us safe, including the power to issue substantial fines. And we are considering making senior managers liable for breaches of their company's duty of care. This is not about curtailing freedom of expression online. The internet has given people a voice, and we want to make sure that everyone has the freedom to express themselves. Our support for the free, open, global internet is undimmed. At the same time, we must uphold our values and democracy must be protected. It is about taking a balanced approach where government intervention helps tackle online harms, with the help of the tech firms themselves. HUD's new lawsuit against Facebook is a dagger at the heart of the consumer internet It is about not just using law, but also innovation. Technology companies need to be part of the solution and come up with innovative ways to protect their users. And we will make sure the new law minimizes the burden on start-ups, so we don't accidentally make it harder to innovate. The UK government will open these ideas up for consultation, and I want to hear views from the United States too. I recently visited Silicon Valley, where I met with the executives of large tech companies including Facebook, Google, Twitter and Apple. Online safety is a global issue, and we need to work together on it -- this can't be done in isolation, and we want to work with you and learn from partners around the world. I believe that the plan we have set out is a major step in the right direction. The tech sector has improved our lives immeasurably.

Baylor, the top overall seed of the women's NCAA basketball tournament, has won its third national title, defeating No. 1 seed Notre Dame 82-81 at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Florida on Sunday. It's Baylor's first title since 2012, which also came against the Fighting Irish. Baylor (37-1) led by as many as 17, but after a leg injury to Bears star forward Lauren Cox in the third quarter, the Irish (35-4) surged back to take the lead with just over three minutes left.

Before she was forced out, Cox had eight points, eight rebounds and three blocked shots. ""I'm one of the leaders of this team, so (I came back) just to have my voice there, to tell them that I'm still OK,"" Cox said to ESPN. ""They told me they were going to do this for me.""

The Bears have won 29 consecutive games, last losing at Stanford in December. Before she was forced out with an injury, Baylor forward Lauren Cox had eight points, eight rebounds and three blocked shots. Of Mulkey's three titles, it's the second time that Baylor head coach is sharing it with her daughter. In 2012, Baylor went 40-0 when Makenzie (Robertson) Fuller was a guard on that title team. She's now in her fourth season on Mulkey's staff, serving as associate director of basketball operations. In November 2017, Fuller lost her unborn child, Scout Marie. The stillborn infant was delivered after doctors didn't detect a heartbeat during a weekly checkup, according to CNN affiliate KWTX . Scout Marie was believed to have Turner's syndrome, a condition that affects only females, in which one of the X chromosomes is missing or partially missing. NCAA men's Final Four: Virginia, Texas Tech advance to the title game ""I don't think it's any secret that we had just a horrible year with the death of a grandchild, yet I don't think as a family, I'm talking about Makenzie and myself, we had time to grieve,"" Mulkey said after Baylor's win against Oregon in the Final Four. In October, Fuller gave birth to a son, Kannon , who Mulkey had with her on the dais after Friday's win and on the floor Sunday after winning the championship. ""You bet I'm going to hang onto him,"" Mulkey said at the time of Friday's win. ""Holding a child up here is a heck of a lot more touching than holding one right here that's deceased. I've done both in the last year and a half."" Last year's title run by Notre Dame was a shock. The Fighting Irish had more ACL tears (four) than losses, and those injuries last season left Notre Dame with just seven scholarship players. And the way they won in 2018 was breathtaking, with buzzer-beaters by Ogunbowale in the semifinal and championship games against Connecticut and Mississippi State, respectively. Finishing with 31 points, Arike Ogunbowale couldn't quite match last year's heroics for Notre Dame, missing a free throw in the final 1.9 seconds that could have helped forced overtime. It was different entering the 2018-2019 season. The Irish returned several of their players from that championship team. They were the preseason No. 1, something that made head coach Muffet McGraw uncomfortable. It's something she alluded to before Sunday's final. ""We came into the season with all of that on us. No. 1, defending champs,"" McGraw said Saturday. ""Sometimes defending champs aren't really because they don't have their team back. But we did. We were truly the defending champs. It was a burden."" On Sunday, she called the loss ""frustrating."" ""Well, I'm sad for the seniors that we came that close after getting down 17, clawing our way back,"" McGraw said. ""We had so many missed opportunities both ends of the floor. ... We just didn't come out ready. That was disappointing."""

"In one week, 4 major Trump-policy spins and flips - CNNPolitics",www.cnn.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/06/politics/trumps-flips-policy-changes/index.html,"
The border with Mexico will not be closed. Republicans will not soon present a replacement for the Affordable Care Act. He doesn't actually think the Mueller report on Russian election interference should be publicly released. His nominee to head Immigration and Customs Enforcement is his nominee no longer.
What's on display is a President who just says things that pop into his head or announces policies via Twitter -- then must find ways to retreat from them or make them real.
Did he ever really believe he would close the entire border with Mexico, or was it just bluster? After the utter disappointment of failing to repeal Obamacare, for which Trump still carries a festering grudge , did he sincerely think it would get another vote?
That Trump often says incorrect things about issues big and small has been well-documented. Just this week, for some mystifying reason, he repeated his untrue contention that his father was born in Germany . But his credibility, such as it is, faces new questions as the week draws to a close. The White House is radio silent on clarifying Trump's misrepresentation about his father's birthplace
For example, declaring the US would close its southern border had wide implications that caused consternation in many quarters. But Trump has now retreated from the closure threat and subbed in a threat for new auto tariffs on Mexico a year from now. Should the Mexican government take that seriously? And should Americans believe that Trump can deliver on a new health care plan after the 2020 election? What is his credibility on any policy proposal if they don't seem to be much more than thoughts that suddenly occur to him?
Here's a closer look at a week of flip-flops. Full retreat on health care
Trump is no stranger to bold pronouncements, but this week found him rebuked, uncharacteristically, by the actions and words of Republicans in the Senate.
When the President overruled his attorney general and health and human services secretary to endorse a Texas judge's decision a few months ago that the entire Affordable Care Act should be invalidated, it underlined the fact that Republicans don't have a plan to replace Obamacare at the moment and the party had largely given up on it even as the GOP sought new ways to starve and undermine the law.
Trump promised the public that a new plan would be forthcoming and Republicans would be the ""party of health care!""
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, however , broke it to the President that no such plan would get a vote on Capitol Hill since the Democrats who now control the House have very different ideas about how to fix the problem of unaffordable health insurance.
Trump retreated late Monday in a tweet.
""The Republicans are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words it will be far less expensive & much more usable than ObamaCare. Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win back the House. It will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America,"" he said. A staggered retreat on closing the border
A similar dose of truth-telling appears to have made him retreat from repeated threats to close the border with Mexico, which almost everyone in government said would be an economic disaster .
McConnell said it would have a catastrophic impact, but while he told Trump no, essentially, on health care, on the border wall he simply expressed his desire.
""Closing down the border would have potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country, and I would hope we would not be doing that,"" he said Tuesday .
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't mind the economic impact.
""Security is more important to me than trade,"" the President said during an appearance in the Oval Office . ""So we're going to have a secure border.""
But on Thursday, he twice changed his tune, first giving Mexico an ultimatum.
""We're going to give them a one-year warning, and if the drugs don't stop or (are) largely stopped, we're going to put tariffs on Mexico and products, in particular, the cars ... and if that doesn't stop the drugs, we close the border,"" Trump said.
Later that day he seemed to be laying the groundwork to back off his earlier threat to shut the border.
""I don't think we'll ever have to close the border because the penalty of tariffs on cars coming into the United States from Mexico, at 25%, will be massive,"" the President said.
Business leaders and lawmakers are still nervous about tariffs. And as Trump hopes to finalize his new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, it's a serious and legitimate question: Is this tariff threat real or just part of an effort to mask his retreat? Giving one nominee the unexpected boot and sticking by other picks
It wasn't just policy on which Trump was pivoting when, as he left Washington on his way to California for a visit to the border on Friday, he announced to reporters that he was pulling his nominee to lead the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, Ron Vitiello. While thehealth care and border retreats were caused by Trump running into political and economic realities, this one had his allies confused.
""We're going in a little different direction. Ron's a good man, but we're going in a tougher direction. We want to go in a tougher direction,"" Trump said.
He didn't mention the very difficult confirmation fight acting director Vitiello had faced . But the move was announced so quickly that it caught the Department of Homeland Security off guard and leadership at ICE thought the move was a clerical error Friday morning.
On the other hand, Trump wants to nominate Herman Cain to a powerful spot on the Federal Reserve Board, and the President made clear to reporters that his people would have to figure out how to make it happen. Cain, a former business executive and a 2012 Republican presidential hopeful whose campaign was troubled by allegations of sexual harassment, has no direct monetary policy experience.
""I've recommended Herman Cain,"" Trump said Thursday. ""A terrific man, a terrific person. He's a friend of mine,"" the President told reporters in the Oval Office. ""I've recommended him highly for the Fed. I've told my folks that that's the man and he's doing some pre-checking now and I would imagine he'd be in great shape.""
Trump is also standing behind his pick for another open Fed seat, Stephen Moore of the conservative Heritage Foundation, a former CNN analyst. Moore seems likely to immediately push for interest rate cuts urged by Trump, which has set off alarm bells on Wall Street . He has also faced criticism for failing to pay spousal and child support, according to The New York Times , and $75,000 in taxes . A switch on the Mueller report
Before Attorney General William Barr boiled down special counsel Robert Mueller's nearly 400-page report on Russian election interference into a four-page summary that was very beneficial to Trump -- though it did not exonerate him on the issue of obstruction of justice -- the President said the whole report should be released.
But now that Barr's summary of the report is public, Trump has evolved over the past two weeks and doesn't see the need for full disclosure.
Barr is working on a redacted version of the full report that scrubs out certain material that is classified or comes from grand jury information. Nearly every page is thought to have redactions, according to the Justice Department . Democrats are already moving in the direction of a subpoena to see the full report, even though the attorney general has not yet released Barr's version. Trump's war on windmills now includes wild cancer claim
""It's a 400-page report, right? We could give them 800 pages, and it wouldn't be enough. They'll always come back and say it is not enough,"" Trump said Tuesday.
That Trump makes bold pronouncements he can't deliver on is nothing new. That's how a complete ban on Muslim people entering the country ultimately became a targeted ban on some people from certain countries.
That he sours on some people without explanation while sticking blindly with others has been a theme of his hiring and firing at the White House.
That he would say he supports something unexpected and then actively work against it has been at the heart of several of his positions on the Mueller investigation and on transparency. He said he would happily give testimony in person for the investigation and then his legal team fought very hard for him not to . He promised to release his tax returns once he wasn't being audited, but it's doubtful he ever will.
But the increasingly rapid pace of flips and spins, of the time it takes to go from bold Trump statement to complete retreat, has exposed a continuing problem for his presidency:
Nobody -- not voters, policymakers, heads of state or his own staff -- knows when they can trust what he says. "
Korean Air chairman and CEO Cho Yang-ho dies,edition.cnn.com,Sherisse Pham,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/business/cho-yang-ho-korean-air/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) The man who helped turn Korean Air into a global powerhouse has died.
Cho Yang-ho died in Los Angeles on Sunday, Korean Air said in a statement Monday. He was 70 years old. The company didn't reveal the cause of death. Cho took over as chairman and CEO of Korean Air from his father in 1999. The following year, Cho became a founder of the SkyTeam airline alliance — a move that put Korean Air on the international map. Cho was also head of Korean Air parent company Hanjin Group, one of South Korea's sprawling family-run conglomerates. In more recent years, Cho made headlines for all the wrong reasons. He and his family have been accused of fostering a culture of abuse and violence at the company.

Culture of abuse and violence at the heart of some of South Korea's biggest companies Weeks before his death, Cho was booted from his position as chairman of the board at Korean Air. He was on trial over charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. He denied the charges against him. The ""nut rage"" incident of 2014 — when Cho's daughter, Heather Cho, assaulted two Korean Air flight attendants for serving her macadamia nuts in a bag instead of a porcelain bowl — was perhaps the most infamous example of the corrosive environment at the company. Last year, Cho's youngest daughter Emily Cho faced a storm of public criticism for allegedly throwing a drink at a business meeting attendee. She was later cleared of all charges related to the incident. Cho's widow, Lee Myung-hee, is currently facing criminal charges for physically and verbally abusing her staff. The alleged abuse includes claims that she assaulted an employee for forgetting to buy ginger and drenched another with water for driving too slowly. The criminal indictment against Lee was released by a South Korean lawmaker earlier this year."

On April 3, the small oil-rich kingdom of Brunei introduced a strict Islamic legal code mandating death for adultery and sex between men, as well as lashes for lesbian sex and amputation for crimes like theft. It has sparked a tide of condemnation from Western nations and celebrities alike. UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on April 1 described the laws as ""draconian"" and a setback for human rights. But across Brunei's border in Indonesia and Malaysia, both Muslim-majority countries, there has been official silence.

CNN reached out to both the Indonesian and Malaysian governments for comment. Rise of conservative Islam Brunei is the first country in Southeast Asia to impose capital punishment for crimes such as LGBT sex or adultery, but neighboring Malaysia and Indonesia have been experimenting with strict Islamic laws for years. Malaysia already enforces a mixed secular and religious legal system, with some regions mandating Sharia laws punishing what the penal code calls ""unnatural"" acts such as homosexual sex with caning and fines, while Indonesia's conservative northwestern province of Aceh has a history of enacting Sharia law. 'Barbaric to the core': Brunei brings in gay sex stoning law Human Rights Watch researcher Andreas Harsono said Brunei public prosecutors even visited Aceh in 2014, ahead of the introduction of Sharia law in their own country, to learn about its implementation. Conservative politicians in Indonesia and Malaysia voiced their support for the Brunei laws this month. One member of Parliament from the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party congratulated Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah on his ""bravery."" ""Congratulations to Brunei for their bravery and political will in implementing Sharia criminal law ... upholding the Sharia is an obligation in ensuring Allah's rights to maintain peace for humans,"" Mohd Khairuddin Aman Razali wrote on his official Facebook page. In Indonesia, one of the leaders of the legislative Ulama Council in Aceh told local news media that Brunei's laws were just ""religious freedom."" Harsono said he was concerned that already vocal conservative Muslims in Malaysia and Indonesia would use Brunei's example to strengthen calls for stricter Islamic policies and laws. ""Already there are more than 60 local regencies and three provinces with mandatory hijab regulations in Indonesia. More than 20 local areas have regulations criminalizing LGBT people,"" he said. As of Friday, there had been no official comment on the laws from either Indonesian President Joko Widodo or Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Harsono said he did not expect Widodo, who is running for reelection, to speak until he knew how prominent Indonesian Islamic organizations would respond. ""If the NU is opposed to hand amputation, Jokowi will speak up indeed,"" he said, referring to the Nahdlatul Ulama mass religious movement. ""If they don't, Jokowi will not risk his election on making such a statement."" Indonesia's President Joko Widodo (C), who is running for his second term, and his running mate, Islamic cleric Ma'ruf Amin (3rd L) in September. Moving backward Neither Indonesia nor Malaysia has national laws similar to Brunei's. In Malaysia, homosexual sex is illegal but punished by prison sentences. In Indonesia, it is still legal but culturally taboo. But both countries in recent years have seen a steady rise in powerful conservative Islamic groups, who have pressed for tougher legislation in line with religious morality. ""It's impossible now for any politician to take a stance on religious matters without consulting their Muslim advisers and supporters,"" Harsono said. Ahead of the April 17 Indonesian election, Widodo controversially picked conservative Islamic scholar Ma'ruf Amin as his candidate for vice-president. In 2017, local media quoted Ma'ruf as saying he regretted the Constitutional Court's decision to reject a petition criminalizing gay sex. ""We want a stern prohibition of LGBT activities and other deviant sexual activities and legislation that categorizes them as crime,"" he told reporters in 2016. Indonesian Muslim demonstrators, holding banners that read ""put Ahok in jail,"" march towards the presidential palace in Jakarta on November 4, 2016. Indonesia's minister for religious affairs met with the Brunei ambassador just days after the news of Brunei's law broke, but publicly only mentioned halal certification and religious education. There was no mention of the Sharia law. Conservative Islamic groups helped rally popular support for the imprisonment in 2017 of Widodo's former ally, Jakarta mayor and Christian Basuki ""Ahok"" Tjahaja Purnama, on what some saw as trumped-up blasphemy charges. Activists said the rise of conservative Islamic groups had been marked by growing homophobia in both countries, and an increase in official action against LGBT people. In September 2018 two women were publicly caned in the Malaysian state of Terengganu for the first time for attempting to have sex in a parked car. One month earlier, one of Kuala Lumpur's only gay clubs was raided. Malaysian LGBT rights campaigner Sulathireh said when some rainbow flags appeared at an International Women's Day march earlier this year, there was a pronounced backlash against attendees. ""It resulted in people at the rally being questioned by their family members, their employers, their schools, about why they were there,"" she said. Observers gather to witness the caning of two women convicted of having sex in Terengganu, Malaysia, in 2018. 'Anything is possible' The idea that Indonesia or Malaysia might move to impose stricter Islamic laws isn't just theoretical. There have already been clear attempts by anti-LGBT activists. In early 2018, a large coalition of conservative Muslim groups presented a case to the Indonesian Constitutional Court to introduce a new penal code criminalizing LGBT relations. Brunei's LGBT community flees 'inhumane' new stoning laws The move was eventually abandoned, but the groups that supported it are still a powerful force in the country. It was this law that actor George Clooney alluded to in an opinion piece for ""Deadline,"" in which he warned about the potential fallout from Brunei's decision and called for a boycott of major hotels owned by the sultanate. ""The most dangerous issue is Brunei's neighbors. Indonesia has plenty of human rights issues, but they haven't stoned anyone yet,"" the actor wrote. ""But there was a law on the books, and if Brunei isn't met with loud, forceful resistance that shakes their business establishments, then anything is possible."""

""Let us be friends, but do not touch Pagasa Island and the rest,"" Duterte said, according to CNN Philippines , using the Philippine word Pagasa for Thitu.

Nielsen ouster lays bare Trump's own immigration crisis - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Stephen Collinson,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/donald-trump-kirstjen-nielsen-immigration/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The forced resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is not just the usual story of an administration racked by chaos and the short shelf life of almost everyone who works for an imperious and grudge-bearing President.
Nielsen was hardly a moderate out of step with President Donald Trump on his signature issue of immigration . She became the administration's public face of the zero-tolerance policy that caused widespread outrage after hundreds of migrant children were separated from their parents. But she is nonetheless paying the price for a crisis exacerbated by the President's decision-making amid a major surge in migrants crossing the border. Her departure is a victory for conservative immigration voices, such as White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, who have long had Trump's ear and are pushing the President to adopt an even more hardline border policy. Trump says DHS Secretary Nielsen leaving It's a sign of a government stocked with acting secretaries and hampered by thin personnel benches, stretched beyond functionality by Trump's impulses and the most prodigious staffing burn rate of any modern President. Read More Nielsen's ouster fits with a pattern of Trump forcing out officials who have pushed back against his more radical instincts or been unable to carry them out, or who have earned his ire for being unwilling to match his defiance for governing practice and convention. They include former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, ex-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former national security adviser H.R. McMaster and former chief of staff John Kelly. Yet there is also a more fundamental reason for Nielsen's departure that gets closer to the heart of Trump's behavior and political strategy than almost all of the many, previous exits from his administration. Nielsen's demise is the clearest indication yet of the impossibility of reconciling Trump's ideological and emotional instincts on immigration -- which helped make him President -- with legal, humanitarian and international realities. Nielsen ""believed the situation was becoming untenable"" with Trump ""becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests,"" a senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday. Her departure mirrors that of former Defense Secretary James Mattis last year, whose authority was shredded by a sudden, and apparently spontaneous announcement of a Syria withdrawal by the President, but who had gradually grown apart from his boss. In both cases, the complexity of serious policy problems, often in life or death situations, clashed with the political instincts of a President who abhors detail and prefers to govern from the gut, while ignoring conventional expertise -- even from subordinates that in no way could be considered moderates. As the crisis on the US-Mexico border worsened, Trump's tolerance for Nielsen snapped. And the President might also have gone looking for a scapegoat. Last week, he was forced to climb down on a public threat to close the southern border after officials, business groups and political leaders warned of a pending economic disaster if he went ahead. He covered his blushes by going on a tear on immigration, with some of the most unconstrained rhetoric on the issue ever heard by an American president, that was scorching even by the standards of Trump himself. ""Can't take you anymore. Can't take you. Our country is full ... Can't take you anymore, I'm sorry. So turn around. That's the way it is,"" Trump said in a message to asylum seekers during a trip to the border on Friday. A day later, Trump mocked those fleeing persecution seeking a better life in the United States, portraying asylum seekers as criminals and gang members, rather than the families Nielsen described in a CNN interview last week. ""'I am very fearful for my life,'"" Trump said mockingly during a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition on Saturday. ""I am very worried that I will be accosted if I am sent back home. No, no, he'll do the accosting!"" ""Asylum, oh give him asylum! He's afraid!"" Trump said. Tense meeting JUST WATCHED Secy. Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving, Trump tweets Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Secy. Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving, Trump tweets 00:40 Nielsen's departure, confirmed in a tense White House meeting with Trump on Sunday afternoon, came after days of speculation and was in retrospect a logical consequence of the President's boiling frustration. He had been dissatisfied with Nielsen for months, though their relationship appeared to improve marginally during the government shutdown that spanned the turn of the year and turned into another political reverse for Trump. Speculation about her status ballooned last week, after Trump suddenly declared that he would halt hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, accusing them of sending migrants to the US border. The move utterly undercut Nielsen who had just days before signed what her department called a ""historic, regional compact"" to tackle undocumented migration at its source. Immigration experts said that the aid cutoff would ultimately make the situation far worse as it would exacerbate the deprivation and lawlessness in Central America that is a key driver of migration and asylum claims. Nielsen's departure comes as more critical moments loom for the administration that are likely to test Trump's equilibrium at a time when he is already furious about the border situation. When he was not fulminating about immigration over the weekend, he was lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller and Democratic demands that all of his report should be released. Attorney General William Barr, caught between an angry President and Democrats in Congress after finding there was no evidence to support election collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, has pledged to release a redacted version of the report by mid-month. The White House is also trying to escape a self-imposed snafu over health care policy after sending confusing signals of whether the President wanted a new bid to replace Obamacare before or after the 2020 election. And this week, the administration is expected to significantly escalate tensions with Iran by against throwing caution to the wind by designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, a move some in the defense and intelligence communities fear could expose US personnel in the Middle East to reprisals.

Cuomo to DHS Sec: Why's Trump viewing fencing, not kids? 01:32 As he seeks to manage the immigration crisis, the President now has a chance to insert a like-minded replacement in what in the wake of Nielsen's departure looks like an increasingly impossible job. Trump has already signaled that he will make immigration a centerpiece of his 2020 re-election bid and has every political incentive, since he is basing his hopes of a second term on energizing his base, to turn up the heat on the issue. The new secretary will also face the same limits as Nielsen. As much as Trump rages against asylum claims, they are codified in US and international laws that he in practice cannot just disregard. He recently found out that his preferred, dramatic solution of just closing the border would cause a swift and massive economic backlash that in itself could harm his hopes of winning a second term. The President is already pushing his power to the limit, and possibly beyond it by seeking to use a national emergency declaration to redirect money already allocated by Congress for other projects to the border wall that was at the symbolic center of his 2016 campaign. For all his fiery speeches, it is difficult for Trump to argue that his hardline approach on immigration is actually working. After years of declines, the tide of asylum seeking and undocumented migrants crossing the border has climbed dramatically. The White House says US Customs and Border Protection engaged in more than 100,000 border enforcement actions in March -- the most for one month in more than a decade. It argues that Trump has reassigned customs officers to the border and directed them to return as many migrants as possible to Mexico to wait for immigration proceedings on the southern side of the border. But ultimately, there will be no solution to the border problem and the chronic glut in the asylum and court systems, without action by Congress. Nielsen did ""everything she could to make the problem better,"" a senior Department of Homeland Security official told CNN's Geneva Sands on Sunday. ""Worst place for you to be is where you need Congress to act,"" the official said. The White House wants asylum law tightened and the power to detain families traveling with children -- a practice Democrats have branded inhumane. Trump named Kevin McAleenan , the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, as acting replacement for Nielsen at the Department of Homeland Security. McAleenan is not seen as an ideologue and served former President Barack Obama -- so there must be considerable doubt about how long he will also be in the post -- but he has less problematic ties with Congress than Nielsen. READ: Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation letter from DHS secretary post Attempts at reaching a broad political solution on the border have been complicated by Trump's choice to use immigration as a rallying call for his base and his adoption of rhetoric that stains any political common ground. He has several times pulled out of immigration deals with Democrats that might have helped mitigate the situation at the border apparently because he feared a backlash from his most fervent supporters and cheerleaders in conservative media. Democrats complain that the so-called master of the art of the deal wants to win on all his immigration priorities while offering nothing in return -- for example a path to legal status for people brought to the US illegally and who are protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. They also argue that his rhetoric is incompatible with the founding principles of a nation built on immigration. ""When even the most radical voices in the administration aren't radical enough for President Trump, you know he's completely lost touch with the American people,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday, remarking on Nielsen's departure. Yet while there is evidence that Trump's flame throwing commentary on immigration hurt Republicans in swing districts and helped Democrats win the House in midterm elections, Trump's warning that the US is under assault by marauding caravans of immigrants is widely backed by his supporters. That's why ultimately, even Nielsen, who was reviled on the left over the family separations policy and attempted to shape the President's instincts into a workable policy always seemed doomed. Trump has shown that he will always, eventually side with the themes and voters that powered his political rise even faced with insurmountable political and practical obstacles."

Investors are pouring their money into so-called passive index funds that blindly track market indexes using computers. It's a shift that is coming at the expense of funds that are run by mere mortals, aka invesment managers , who try to pick stocks that will outperform the market.
The trend is especially pronounced in the United States, where 28% of the industry's $17 trillion in assets are currently invested in passive funds, up from just 13% in 2008, according to data from market research firm Morningstar.
American investors have plowed a total of $671 billion into passive funds since the start of 2015, while pulling $257 billion out of so-called active funds run by managers over the same period.
Prominent BlackRock ( BLK ) CEO Larry Fink predicted this week that regulatory changes in the industry will encourage even more money to flow into these funds.
""We are likely to see a historical shift on how assets are being managed,"" he said. ""[Investors] will use [passive funds] more and more at the center of their portfolios.""
BlackRock's ( BLK ) popular iShares business, which offers investors passive exchange-traded funds (aka ETFs), saw $51 billion in net inflows over the past quarter while the firm's active funds brought in less than one-tenth that amount. U.S. investors have historically put more money into active funds. But the passive fund industry is growing at a much faster rate. It now has $4.8 trillion in assets under management.
While it's tempting to invest with top investment managers who promise to outperform the market, research has shown that this strategy often results in smaller returns.
""Actively managed funds have generally underperformed their passive counterparts, especially over longer time horizons,"" said Morningstar researchers in a recent paper.
The reason for the lackluster performance of active funds typically comes back to investment fees -- which are much higher at active funds. (Computer algorithms don't have kids to feed back at home!)

BRIC investing is officially dead at Goldman Sachs,money.cnn.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://money.cnn.com/2015/11/09/investing/bric-fund-goldman-sachs-emerging-markets/index.html,"For the latest business news and markets data, please visit CNN Business BRIC investing is officially dead at Goldman Sachs by Alanna Petroff @AlannaPetroff November 9, 2015: 9:04 AM ET The acronym ""BRIC"" refers to Brazil, Russia, India and China. It was later expanded to ""BRICS"" to include South Africa. BRIC investing has officially fallen out of favor. Goldman Sachs ( GS ) ' asset management business has killed off its BRIC fund , concluding that it would not ""experience significant asset growth in the foreseeable future."" The powerful investment bank was the original champion of investing in Brazil , Russia , India and China , which became known as BRIC nations.
Goldman's former chairman Jim O'Neill coined the ""BRIC"" acronym in 2001 and brought the world's attention to strong growth potential in these large emerging markets. The acronym was later expanded to BRICS to include South Africa.
However, the promise of BRIC countries has faded as Brazil's economy slumps , Russia struggles with low oil prices and international sanctions, and China's economy slows after previously posting double-digit growth figures.
Goldman's BRIC fund was created in June 2006 and experienced wild swings during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009.
An official filing shows that it averaged a measly 3% average annual return and underperformed the MSCI BRIC index.
Goldman warned in September that it planned to fold the BRIC fund into a more diversified emerging market fund on Oct. 23.
Even though the BRIC era appears to be over, Goldman Sachs said it's not time to give up on all emerging markets.
""Over the last decade emerging market investing has evolved from being tactical and opportunistic to being a strategic part of most asset allocations,"" said Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs. ""We continue to recommend that our clients have exposure to emerging markets across asset classes as part of their strategic asset allocation."" Recap: Jim O'Neill on the BRIC problem
An October report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies questioned whether the BRICS still matter, arguing that ""the foundation of the BRICS concept is beginning to crumble.""
""Conflicting interests and the indisputable political, social, and cultural differences among the group's members have kept the BRICS from translating their economic force into collective political power on the global stage,"" the report said.

The performance of Harvard's endowment has been disappointing in recent years. Its returns have lagged behind Ivy League peers like Yale and Columbia.
Harvard's endowment grew by 5.8% in fiscal year 2015, which ended in June, but Blyth noted that's unlikely to vault Harvard back to the top.
Real estate and venture capital were Harvard's top performing assets last year. Blyth said the endowment team will continue to look for opportunities in life sciences, laboratory space and the retail sector.
Harvard's frothy markets comment comes on the heels of other prominent financial leaders' warnings. Germany's finance minister has gone as far as to use the word ""bubble"" about current market conditions.

The investing app military families love,money.cnn.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://money.cnn.com/2016/08/19/investing/stash-investing-app/index.html,"The investing app military families love by Heather Long @byHeatherLong August 19, 2016: 1:31 PM ET Wall Street banks prefer clients with millions -- if not billions -- to invest. Soldiers, nurses and construction workers typically aren't anywhere near that wealthy. That's why a growing number of average Joes are turning to an app called Stash instead. On Stash, you can start investing with just $5 . The company's motto is ""investing for real people."" ""Lots of our users start investing with less than $100. For us, that's great because they've taken that first step. They're learning,"" says Brandon Krieg, co-founder and CEO of Stash.
Stash launched last fall. It already has over 150,000 users. About 10% of those are active-duty military, says Krieg. It's a high percentage considering less than half a percent of the U.S. population overall currently serves in the armed forces.
""Stash is the solution for millions of Americans traditionally ignored or taken advantage of by big investing firms,"" says Krieg. ""Almost all of our customers are first-time investors.""

In addition to military personnel, the app is also popular with people who are self-employed, including Uber drivers.
Stash makes investing incredibly simple. There are only 33 investment options, which is much easier than navigating the universe of thousands of stocks and funds.
The app helps steer you in the right direction, but you still get to make the final decision. That's different than the so-called ""roboadvisor"" apps like Wealthfront and Betterment, where a computer decides how to invest your money.
The co-founders of Stash wanted people to learn how to invest, not just hand over their money.
""Financial literacy in this country is a huge problem,"" Krieg told CNNMoney. The Stash app is about to unveil a new feature called ""learn"" to help educate users even more.
Related: My job nearly drove me to commit suicide
To get going, the Stash app asks a few basic questions to determine if someone is comfortable with low, medium or high-risk investing. As you might expect, most people fall in the middle.
Stash encourages most people to put at least some of their money into the ""Moderate Mix"" fund. Think of it like vanilla ice cream: A very solid option that still satisfies a person's desire to grow their money for retirement or sending a kid to college.
Users can also choose from other funds like ""Internet Titans,"" ""Defending America,"" and ""Clean & Green."" These are stock funds, but the names have been translated from Wall Street jargon into normal people speak.
Stash gets high marks from users for making investing easy and accessible, but pay attention to the fees. Stash charges $1 a month. That doesn't sound like a lot, but a user really needs to invest at least $250 or more for that level of fees to not eat up returns.
Expect even more new features and growth from Stash this fall. This week the company announced $9.25 million in a Series A funding round led by Goodwater Capital. CNNMoney (New York) First published August 19, 2016: 1:31 PM ET CNNMoney Sponsors"

It's an ""investor revolt,"" is how Credit Suisse characterized it.
Normally when investors panic about stocks falling, they sell stocks and buy bonds, which are viewed as safer. But that's not happening now.
Investors aren't just fleeing stocks, they're exiting bonds, commodities and international funds too. July and August will be the first two-month stretch that retail investors have pulled money from BOTH stock and bond funds since the end of 2008, according to Credit Suisse.
The wild swings in stocks in the past week have only exacerbated the selling.
This week alone, investors have pulled nearly $30 billion from stock funds. That's the largest weekly outflow since Bank of America Merrill Lynch began tracking the data in 2002.

As they save lives, biotech companies are simultaneously making a lot of money for investors.
That's why the hottest ETFs (exchange-traded funds) on the planet since the bull market began in March 2009 invest in biotech companies.
The First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech ETF ( FBT ) has skyrocketed more than 500% over that timeframe. That trounces the S&P 500's 200% gain. The fund outperformed by owning a bunch of the sexiest names in the biotech industry, including Gilead Sciences ( GILD ) , Biogen ( BIIB ) and Novavax ( NVAX ) .
ETFs specialize in giving investors diversified exposure to a specific corner of the market, like biotech. These pooled vehicles invest in numerous stocks, bonds and commodities -- not just one.
That's especially helpful when investors want exposure to a volatile sector like biotech, which experiencesturbulence tied to the risks involved with getting drugs approved by the government.
As an added bonus, ETFs are cheap. Or at least cheaper than most mutual funds. That's partially because most ETFs are index funds, meaning they track a basket of assets that's already been created by highly-paid professionals.
Other biotech related- ETFs are also generating spectacular returns, including the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF ( IBB ) and the PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals ETF ( PJP ) . The latter ETF combines biotech stocks with more traditional pharmaceutical players like Eli Lilly ( LLY ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMY ) .

Pensions ask retirees to pay back tens of thousands,money.cnn.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://money.cnn.com/2013/10/24/retirement/pension-overpayments/index.html,"For the latest business news and markets data, please visit CNN Business Pensions ask retirees to pay back tens of thousands by Melanie Hicken @melhicken October 25, 2013: 2:29 PM ET Carole Grant, 75, has been told she owes almost $61,000 for nearly 20 years of pension overpayments. Some pension plans have overpaid retirees for years -- now they're demanding their money back. For retirees, it can mean owing tens of thousands of dollars. And with little warning, their pension checks are being slashed to cover their debt. In April 2011, New Jersey resident Carol Montague received a letter from American Water Works Co.'s pension plan saying it had overpaid her for more than five years and wanted its money back -- plus interest. Montague, now 67, was told she owed roughly $45,000.
Two weeks later, Montague's pension benefits dropped from $1,246 to around $325 a month, or half what she should have been paid all along. The plan takes out roughly $300 a month in order to pay itself back.
Once Montague's health care premium is deducted, her monthly pension check shrinks to less than $25. She gets another $1,200 a month from Social Security, but it's not enough. So, in addition to her part-time job as a school crossing guard, she is working as a salesperson at Macy's.
So far, Montague has repaid almost $9,000 -- calculations show that she won't repay her debt in full until 2024.
Share your story: Are you worried about your pension?
American Water said Montague signed a document verifying the correct pension amount and that they are legally allowed to collect any overpayment, with interest, to protect the viability of the pension fund. Montague acknowledges she made a mistake, but didn't think she needed to confirm that her benefits matched the amount in the letter she had signed almost a yearbefore she retired.
""I put it away in a steel box. I never looked at it again. It was stupid on my part,"" she said. ""But it took (almost) six years for them to find out they overpaid me?""
With the help of the Mid-Atlantic Pension Counseling Project, a government-sponsored program, she has appealed to the pension plan to waive the interest, as well as ease some of the overpayment burden. But the plan has refused.
As pensions face increased financial scrutiny -- and shrinking funds -- pension counseling programs are seeing even more cases like Montague's.
This year, nearly 600 retired metal workers and their spouses are facing these so-called recoupment demands from the Sheet Metal Workers Local Union No. 73 Pension Fund, based outside of Chicago.
Related: Will your congressman retire richer than you?
In a letter sent to the pension recipients in May, the fund said a 2010 audit found that certain pensions were calculated incorrectly from 1974 to 2004, resulting in more than $5 million in overpayments, according to an IRS filing. The fund is now demanding that the retirees pay back decades worth of mistakes,including interest based on the plan's rates of return.
In July, the pension fund reduced hundreds of checks to the proper payment amount and then again , to make up for the overpayments,oftenby as much as 25%.
Since the pension fund is forecasting that many of the retirees will die before their debts are repaid, it is asking many of them to make large upfront payments.
It's unclear why the pension fund, which did not respond to requests for comment, waited several years to make the adjustments.
Carole Grant, 75, was told by the sheet metal worker's plan that she owed almost $61,000 (roughly half of which was interest) for nearly 20 years of overpayments on the spousal benefits she received from her deceased husband's pension. Her monthly benefit of $394 should have actually been $249, the pension fund said.
Related: Are you saving enough for retirement?
As a result, she's been asked to make an upfront payment of $54,000 and her check has been reduced to $187 a month. While she has other sources of income, she doesn't think she should have to turn over her retirement savings.
""I don't feel that I should be penalized for the mistakes that they made,"" she said. Save money without a steady income
Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center, a Washington D.C.-based advocacy group, said that, in most cases, retirees have no idea they are being overpaid since ""the way a benefit is figured in a typical pension plan is impossible for an ordinary person to fathom.""
She called the sheet metal workers case the ""most egregious"" she's seen, underscoring the need for federal regulations, such as imposing a statute of limitations and limiting how dramatically a pension check can be reduced. She also said many retirees don't realize that plans rarely take legal actions to recover the lump sums.
Money 101: Planning for retirement
While some of the retired sheet metal workers have been able to get their debts forgiven or reduced by filing ""hardship waivers,"" many have had appeals denied, said Tim Kelly, an attorney representing some of the retirees.
One of his clients, 63-year-old Ed Cochran, has received a disability pension since 1995 and was told he owes the fund nearly $100,000, $42,464 of which is interest. His monthly checks had included an excess $262 a month.
Cochran paid years' worth of income taxes and child support based on the amounts he received. And he's heard of many retirees in worse financial shape than him.
""There are so many other older retirees who didn't plan for rainy days,"" Cochran said. ""This is all they have.""

Many middle-class Americans plan to work until they die,money.cnn.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://money.cnn.com/2013/10/23/retirement/middle-class-retirement/index.html,"For the latest business news and markets data, please visit CNN Business Many middle-class Americans plan to work until they die by Melanie Hicken @melhicken October 23, 2013: 2:00 PM ET Many middle-class workers plan to work throughout their old age, according to a recent Wells Fargo survey. A growing percentage of middle-class Americans say they have saved so little for retirement that they expect to work into their 80s or evenuntil they either get too sick or die, according to a recent survey. Nearly half of middle-class workers said they are not confident that they will be able to save enough to retire comfortably, according to a Wells Fargo survey of 1,000 workers between the ages of 25 and 75, with household incomes between $25,000 and $100,000. As a result, 34% said they plan to work until they're at least 80 -- that's up from 25% in 2011 and 30% last year. An even larger percentage, 37%, said they'll never retire and plan to either work until they get too sick or die, the survey found.
Driving these concerns is that many of the respondents said they simply can't afford to pay their monthly bills and save for retirement at the same time.
Money 101: Planning for retirement
""For the past three years, the struggle to pay bills is a growing concern and the prospect of saving for retirement looks dim, particularly for those in their prime saving years,"" Laurie Nordquist, head of Wells Fargo Institutional Retirement and Trust, said in a statement.
The concerns come as many middle-class families are trying to make do with less. The country's median annual household income is down by more than 8% since 2007. And many of the jobs lost during the recent recession have been replaced with lower wage positions.
With minimal savings built up, a third of those surveyed said Social Security will be their primary source of income during retirement. Of those making less than $50,000, nearly half said they will relymainlyon Social Security.
In August, the average Social Security recipient received around $15,000 a year in retirement benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.

Another factor holding back middle-class savers is a fear of investing in the stock market, said Nordquist.
Across workers of all ages, only 24% said they were confident in the stock market as a place to invest for retirement. And slightly more than half said they don't invest in the stocks because they are afraid to lose their savings in the ups and downs of the market. How I talk to my spouse about retirement
This is despite the fact that financial planners say that investing in stocks is the best way to grow a nest egg that will be large enough to cover decades of retirement. Over years of savings, short-term losses are overtaken by the long-term gains that years of compounded returns offer.
""There is a striking amount of fear about the stock market among all investors,"" she said. ""The middle class just isn't making the link between being invested and the potential growth of their savings. CNNMoney (New York) First published October 23, 2013: 2:00 PM ET"

Its star has dramatically dimmed after its founder, the ""bond king"" Bill Gross, left Pimco almost a year ago. Investors started taking out billions of dollars from Pimco after Gross left and continue to do so. Just in August, they pulled $1.8 billion out of Pimco's Total Return fund, Gross' former signature fund. Today it has less than $100 billion in total assets, the lowest level since 2007, according to the company.
At its height in 2013, the fund managed $293 billion. In May, Vanguard surpassed Pimco as the world's largest bond fund manager.
Pimco's fall from grace is a lesson in what happens when a firm's fortunes are so closely linked to one person's identity.
Gross was synonymous with the Pimco name and it's no surprise that the firm's fortunes have suffered after his departure.

Gross allegedly left after clashing with other execs over how to manage the company. Gross had developed a reputation of being a little strange towards the end of his tenure. He once wrote an ode to his dead cat named Bob in an investment outlook note to clients.
He left Pimco last September to work at Janus Capital Group ( JNS ) . The fund had been losing money before Gross left, but his departure appears to have led to an exodus of funds.

Millennials may not be able to afford retirement essentials,money.cnn.com,,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://money.cnn.com/2013/12/04/retirement/millennial-retirement-savings/index.html,"For the latest business news and markets data, please visit CNN Business Millennials may not be able to afford retirement essentials by Melanie Hicken @melhicken December 4, 2013: 12:29 AM ET Find out if you will have enough to retire. Click the image to use our retirement calculator. While many Americans are falling short on savings, millennials are most at risk of being unable to afford essential retirement expenses -- such as food, shelter and medical care, according to a Fidelity Investments survey released Wednesday. Fidelity found that about 55% of people surveyed are at risk of being unable to cover these expenses. Typical baby boomers (born 1946 to 1964) are on track to reach 81% of their retirement income needs, according to the survey. Generation X-ers (born 1965 to 1977) are expected to reach only 71%, and Generation Y or millennials (born 1978-1988) have the largest projected income gap at 62%.
The retirement provider asked over 2,000 Americans a range of questions, from their health to retirement saving habits. It analyzed a variety of factors, including current income, savings rates, home equity and projected Social Security and pension benefits to predict how much money people will need in retirement and whether they are on track to meet that goal.

Across generations, many people simply aren't saving enough, Fidelity found, with 40% of those surveyed saving less than 6% of their salaries -- far below the 10 to 15% recommended by financial planners. For millennials, that percentage jumps to 51%.
Also driving the disparity: Boomers are more likely to have some sort of pension benefit and plan to work longer, according to John Sweeney, Fidelity's executive vice president of retirement and investing strategies.
Boomers had a median desired retirement age of 66, whereas millennials wanted to retire two years earlier than that. Yet today's young people could live well into their 90s and will have to wait until they are 67 in order to claim full Social Security benefits. Save a million before you retire
""Some of the older folks had more realistic expectations,"" he said.
Many young people are also playing it too safe with investments, he said. Of millennials surveyed, 50% said they had less than half of their investments in stocks. In contrast, common rules of thumb recommend that 30-year-olds should have up to 90% of their portfolio in stocks since they have decades of savings ahead of them.

It's not all bad news though. Sweeney noted that while they have the farthest to go, millennials also have the most time to catch up. Here are some key ways savers of all ages can boost their savings;
Up your savings rate: For young people especially, the most effective move is to sock away more money each month, since money saved when young enjoys decades of compound returns.
Review your asset mix: While you can't control the markets, you can make sure your investment strategy is age appropriate. Fixing a portfolio that is either too risky or too conservative could significantly help retirement readiness, Fidelity found.

(CNN) In early 1996, John Perry Barlow -- founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and one-time member of the Grateful Dead -- declared the internet to be independent of national governments.
""I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us,"" he wrote. ""You have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear."" Barlow, who died last year , was more prone to flowery prose than many of his contemporaries, but his declaration was reflective of a widespread belief that the internet was a thing apart, where traditional rules and regulations did not -- and could not -- apply. For years, this libertarian thinking was the guiding philosophy of Silicon Valley as tech firms aggressively pushed back at any attempt to regulate them or control how people behaved online. Conveniently, this lack of regulation allowed them to build massive monopolies and make huge profits. Today, Silicon Valley is facing the backlash. Amid widespread concerns over fake news, influence campaigns, cybersecurity and the sharing of violent and extremist content, more and more countries are pushing to rein in big tech.

While Australia has a history of overreaching when it comes to internet regulation — a plan for a web blacklist was abandoned in 2010 amid widespread criticism — the country is by no means alone in the latest push for greater control.

""It's clear to us that self-regulation among tech companies has not been sufficient and action in the form of regulation is now needed,"" Jeremy Wright, the UK's secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, wrote in a piece for CNN Opinion . He promised to make tech firms responsible ""for tackling harmful content and activity online."" ""(We) will make tech companies more responsible for the content they host and place tougher requirements on platforms to take robust action against terrorism and child sexual exploitation and abuse,"" Wright added. In the US, where tech firms have benefited most from decades of sympathetic legislation and constitutional protections for free speech, there are calls for similar action. On Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang proposed the creation of a news and information ombudsman ""with the power to fine egregious corporate offenders."" ""We need a robust free press and exchange of information. But we should face the reality that fake news and misinformation spread via social media threatens to undermine our democracy and may make it impossible for citizens to make informed decisions on a shared set of facts,"" Yang said in a statement. ""This is particularly problematic given that foreign actors, particularly Russia, intend to do us harm and capitalize on our freedom of information. We need to start monitoring and punishing bad actors to give the determined journalists a chance to do their work."" In Singapore, meanwhile , a new anti-fake news bill will make it illegal to spread ""false statements of fact"" where that information is ""prejudicial"" to Singapore's security, public safety, ""public tranquility,"" or to the ""friendly relations of Singapore with other countries,"" among numerous other topics. JUST WATCHED 2019: The year Chinese internet censorship goes into overdrive Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
2019: The year Chinese internet censorship goes into overdrive 03:53 Free speech concerns Few people would deny that there are major issues with the internet, and that government action is required to fix them. ""While the web has created opportunity, given marginalized groups a voice and made our daily lives easier, it has also created opportunity for scammers, given a voice to those who spread hatred and made all kinds of crime easier to commit,"" Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, wrote last month on the technology's 30th anniversary. Even Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has called for greater regulation. But while many of the problems have come as a result of governments' hands-off approach to big tech, many of the proposed — or in Australia's case, enacted — laws actually give more power to companies to police content. This could be seen as a ""you broke it, you fix it,"" approach, but the risk is that platforms, which are not subject to the same kinds of obligations to protect free speech or expression as governments, end up deleting anything politically sensitive. Such is the case in China, where private tech firms carry out the majority of internet censorship. Because the law provides only vague guidelines on what needs to be controlled, while carrying big penalties for the failure to do so, companies typically err on the side of censorship -- a situation that compounds the country's already stringent controls on speech. ""Internet regulation needs a calm, evidence-based approach that safeguards freedom of expression rather than undermining it,"" said Joy Hyvarinen, head of advocacy for the London-based Index on Censorship. Index said that the proposed ""duty of care"" for internet companies under the British law could create a ""strong incentive for online platforms to restrict and remove content."" Already, users who find their content or pages removed from social media have limited ability to appeal. Activists, particularly on the political fringes, have expressed concern that this could lead to the increased marginalization of minority or dissident voices. ""Forcing companies to regulate content under threat of criminal liability is likely to lead to over-removal and censorship as the companies attempt their best to avoid jail time for their executives or hefty fines on their turnover,"" internet freedom group Access Now said about the new Australian laws . ""Also worryingly, the bill could encourage online companies to constantly surveil internet users by requiring proactive measures for general content monitoring, a measure that would be a blow to free speech and privacy online."" The internet is not independent of national governments, a fact they have made abundantly clear in the decades since John Perry Barlow issued his declaration. But nor is it free from the regulation and control of private companies. And as regulators all over the world attempt to fix the problems their own inaction helped create, the risk is that both their power and the power of big tech increases -- at the expense of ordinary users."
Chicago State's Attorney Kim Foxx says calls for her resignation are personal,edition.cnn.com,Amir Vera,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/chicago-state-attorney-jussie-smollett/index.html,"(CNN) Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx says the calls for her resignation run deeper than the Jussie Smollett case.
Foxx joined Rev. Jesse Jackson at Rainbow PUSH headquarters on Saturday to address the criticism. She said her criminal justice efforts were once celebrated in Chicago and are now ""being attacked because of one case and one celebrity."" ""I think we have to ask ourselves what is this really about? I've been asking myself for the last two weeks, 'What is this really about?'"" Foxx said. ""I will tell you this is personal, it's personal."" The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) and the police chiefs associations called for her resignation after holding votes of no confidence last week. The vote took place more than a week after Foxx's office dropped all charges against Smollett. FOP President Kevin Graham said the move undermined the public's faith in the criminal justice system. Foxx said she was ""undaunted by the events of the last two weeks."" Read More ""I'm committed to serving my term and, should the people have me, continuing forward,"" she said. Foxx took office in December 2016. Foxx welcomes outside review of Smollett case The FOP protested Foxx last Monday and called for her to resign for failing to follow through on charges that used significant police resources. The union has also called for a federal investigation into Foxx's involvement in the Smollett case. The protests came a week after her office dropped 16 felony charges against the ""Empire"" actor, who agreed to forfeit $10,000 in bail and do community service. Dueling protestors clash over Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office's decision to drop all charges against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, Monday, April 1, 2019, in Chicago. Foxx has previously said she welcomes an ""outside, nonpolitical review"" into how her office handled the Smollett case. She had separated herself from decision-making in the case in mid-February out of ""an abundance of caution."" She repeated her invitation for a review Saturday. ""I am again availing myself to an independent review of how we handled this case because it is owed to the public,"" she said. Despite the last few weeks, Foxx said she still stands with her law enforcement partners. ""I have never, will never, speak ill of our partners in this work,"" she said. ""I believe in their ability to do good work, I support them, I always have."" US representative says race plays a factor in resignation calls Supporters of Foxx also spoke out Saturday. ""The FOP is the sworn enemy of black people,"" US Rep. Bobby Rush told CNN affiliate WBBM-TV . ""They want to keep African Americans in total disarray."" Foxx said the calls for her resignation are ""disheartening."" ""When we get in these positions somehow goalposts change,"" she said. For Chicago's top cop, Smollett case wasn't a hate crime -- but this one is The FOP and the the police chiefs associations insisted, their issues with Foxx did not start with Smollett. ""This is not just about Jussie Smollett,"" Kevin Graham, FOP president, said. ""This is about many cases in the Cook County system that have gone unprosecuted, or having charges reduced."""
Uganda kidnap: US tourist Kimberly Sue Endicott freed from abductors - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Susannah Cullinane, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/africa/uganda-us-tourist-rescued/index.html,"(CNN) It was Kimberly Sue Endicott's dream to go on an excursion to see gorillas in their natural habitat.
That dream looked more like a nightmare last week when the California woman and her tour guide were kidnapped in a Ugandan national park, taken by gunmen who later used their hostages' cell phones to issue ransom demands. But the ordeal ended Sunday when Ugandan security forces rescued Endicott and her Ugandan guide, Jean Paul Mirenge. They were freed unharmed from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which borders the Queen Elizabeth National Park -- the scene of their abduction during a game-watching drive Tuesday evening. Four other people taken at the same time were previously released, officials said. Abducted US tourist and guide rescued in Uganda, officials say Endicott is from Orange County and lives in Costa Mesa, working as an esthetician there, CNN affiliate KABC reported Thursday. Read More Endicott's friends told KABC that she had been enthusiastic about her trip to Uganda. One -- neighbor Pascale Douglas -- said that hearing the news that her friend had been abducted was like a ""punch to the gut."" ""She had mentioned when I met her one of her big dreams was to go see the gorillas,"" Douglas told KABC. ""At the time she asked me if it was something I would consider doing also, but time went by and she ended up going on her trip."" Friends were elated at the news of Endicott's release, said Andrea Glasgow, who worked with Endicott at Platino Salon and Suites. ""Everyone was overjoyed that she was returned safely and that no harm came to her,"" Glasgow said. ""Everyone was very concerned at our work for her safety."" Sandy Benton, who said she was formerly Endicott's hairdresser and has known her for 8 years, was ""very happy"" she was rescued. ""I can't imagine what she is going through. I hope she is coming home soon,"" Benton said. ""She has a love for animals. She has always been like that."" Freddie Medina and Shawn O'Hearn work at an advertising design company a couple doors down from Endicott's office. ""We are relieved she is safe,"" O'Hearn said. ""It's crazy,"" said Medina. ""You just don't think this would happen to someone so close to you."" Kimberly Sue Endicott, right, and her tour guide after their release. Armed gang demanded a ransom Ugandan police said Thursday that an armed gang had kidnapped Endicott and her guide, and made frequent demands for a ransom of $500,000 using their victims' cell phones. Police had said they would not offer the money. Ugandan security forces eventually rescued Endicott and the guide, although officials released few details about how the rescue unfolded. Endicott at Ishasha Wilderness Camp after her rescue. ""Both were rescued from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and are safely back in Kanungu district in Uganda,"" government spokesman Ofwono Opondo said Sunday. Endicott arrived in the Ugandan capital of Kampala on Monday. Mike Rourke, the manager of Wild Frontiers Uganda, told CNN that Endicott was in the custody of personnel from the US Embassy. Wild Frontiers is the tour company Endicott was with when she and her tour guide were kidnapped. Opondo said the kidnappers fled the scene of the rescue when law enforcement officers and soldiers moved in. A US defense official told CNN that the US military had provided support to Ugandan security forces. The support included intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets and liaison officers, the official said. Uganda's Minister for Tourism Ephraim Kamuntu said in a televised address Sunday that authorities had been ""under pressure"" over the abduction. ""We can now put the anxiety to rest,"" he added. Kamuntu praised communities near the park where Endicott was taken, saying: ""The media and the communities surrounding the national park were cooperative and sympathetic. They helped the security operatives in rescuing the abducted tourist and driver."" 'A quiet and peaceful' handover A ransom was paid to free Endicott and Mirenge, a source with knowledge of the exchange told CNN on Sunday. The handover was ""quiet and peaceful,"" the source said. Wild Frontiers said it is ""extremely relieved"" to confirm the release of the two unharmed and thanked Ugandan and US authorities for their help, which involved a ""negotiated handover, conducted between the Ugandan and US authorities."" ""We also are working with the investigating authorities to ascertain precisely what happened and how this can be prevented in the future,"" the company said. Wild Frontiers said the identities of the alleged kidnappers have not been revealed. President Trump tweeted Sunday afternoon that he was ""pleased to report"" the two had been released. Pleased to report that the American tourist and tour guide that were abducted in Uganda have been released. God bless them and their families!

IRS: Retirement contribution limits will rise in 2019,money.cnn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://money.cnn.com/2018/11/01/retirement/irs-contributions/index.html,"Retirement contribution limits will rise in 2019 by Anna Bahney @annabahney November 1, 2018: 4:50 PM ET Planning young: a retirement roadmap Good news retirement savers: The Internal Revenue Service announced cost of living increases to the contribution limits for retirement-related plans in 2019. Annual contribution limits to 401(k)s will increase to $19,000 from $18,500. And the annual contribution to an IRA, last increased in 2013, rises to $6,000 from $5,500.
""This is another win for investors and savers,"" says Stephanie Bacak, a financial planner at Capstone Global Advisors. ""For so long there were really no cost of living increases in the IRA so it is a great opportunity for so many to be more prepared for retirement.""
Catch-up contributions, available to those age 50 and over, will remain unchanged at $6,000 for 401(k)s and $1,000 for IRAs.
In addition to 401(k)s, limits for 403(b)s, most 457 plans and the federal government's Thrift Savings Plan will also increase to $19,000.
Also rising next year are the income ranges that determine eligibility for deductible contributions to IRAs, to Roth IRAs, and to claim the saver's credit.
For example, the income phase-out range for taxpayers making contributions to a Roth IRA increased to $122,000 to $137,000 for singles and heads of household, up from $120,000 to $135,000. For married couples filing jointly, the income phase-out range is $193,000 to $203,000, up from $189,000 to $199,000.
The IRS increases are helpful, says Shane Mason, certified financial planner at Brooklyn FI, but only if you are able to make the maximum contribution.
He says those who want to continue to max out their 401(k) should revisit their contributions to make sure they're putting in enough with each paycheck.
Those that are paid semi-monthly (twice a month or 24 times a year) should be contributing $792 per paycheck and those paid biweekly (every two weeks or 26 times a year) should be contributing $731 per paycheck. CNNMoney (New York) First published November 1, 2018: 4:50 PM ET"

"As Sudan brutalizes its people, the US offers closer relations",www.cnn.com,,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/04/africa/sudan-crackdown-us-normalization-talks-intl,"As Sudan brutalizes its people, the US offers closer relations By Nima Elbagir and Eliza Mackintosh , CNN
Khartoum, Sudan – As the Trump administration holds talks on whether to normalize relations with Sudan, a CNN investigation has found evidence that the north African country is failing to comply with a key US requirement to improve “human rights protections and practices.”
An undercover CNN team in Khartoum witnessed the brutal crackdown on protests which began over a rise in the cost of living but have escalated into a push for President Omar al-Bashir’s removal.
At demonstrations in a residential area of the capital in mid-March, CNN filmed the indiscriminate violence that has become synonymous with Sudan’s security forces.
Soon after one rally started, national security agents descended on the crowds, sending people scattering into alleyways and neighborhood homes.
We sought refuge in a nearby safe house, where a local family provides shelter to protesters – and people like us – who are trying to avoid detection. Getting caught could have meant death.
People spoke in hushed tones as they dashed quickly through the gates and inside, one whispering “God protect us” as they locked the door. Sudanese security agents stalk the streets of Khartoum in search of protesters. Source: CNN
Peering out from behind the curtains, we could see officers dressed in riot gear, batons in hand, hunting for anyone who might have been at the protest. Suddenly, they were trailed by the dull and ominous thud of a tear gas cannon being fired. We were trapped.
Hours passed as we waited, stuck inside while the troops stalked the streets. Eventually they dragged the neighbor’s son out of the house next door, hitting him as a woman screamed.
The young man was swiftly spirited away by security forces, like so many others who have been involved in Sudan’s uprising. Their accounts of what happens behind closed doors are far worse. The Refrigerator
More than 3,000 people have been arrested since protests began in December, based on testimony gathered by CNN from activists, lawyers and victims. Many have been taken to secret detention sites known as “ghost houses,” which the government says don’t exist, and where detainees say they face physical and psychological torture.

At one such facility, located north of the snaking Blue Nile river in Khartoum, sub-zero temperatures are allegedly used to torment prisoners. The detention center is known as Al Talaja, or the “Refrigerator.” No one who has spent time inside has spoken about it on the record until now.
“Because we were so severely beaten, we went numb, I couldn’t feel my legs and arms. The place was made so cold. It felt like there were knives piercing our bodies,” Wifaq Ahmed Abdullah, an activist detained in Khartoum’s Burri district in January, told CNN.
Unlike the brutal beatings doled out by security agents, the cold holding cells in the Refrigerator leave no physical marks on the body.
“I only spent two days there, but they were the worst two days of my life. I don’t know, but I really wonder how the people who spend weeks and months there cope with the experience. Only two days were enough to make me break down,” Abdullah said. How Sudan is cracking

Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) has the power to detain individuals without a warrant for up to 45 days, granting it impunity to act without judicial oversight or accountability, in violation of international laws on arbitrary arrest and detention.
Ghost houses were a staple of Bashir’s rule in the 1990s before they were eventually phased out. But, since the protests picked up pace earlier this year, a new wave of such facilities have cropped up in nearly every neighborhood in the capital, activists told CNN.
Another site described to CNN by eyewitnesses is an imposing green building in the Garden City district, once owned by former Interior Minister Abdel Rahim Muhammad Hussein, an indicted war criminal. In the parking lot outside, we witnessed security trucks dropping off what appeared to be detainees. A building in central Khartoum that eyewitnesses say is used as a ghost house. Source: CNN Attack on medical professionals could amount to a war crime
The moniker “ghost house” alludes to what happens behind closed doors there: people disappear. If they get out at all, it’s as a shadow of their former selves.
We gathered detailed testimony from detainees who said they were abused in these black sites. Graphic images shared with CNN show: dark red blisters, bruising from baton beatings, scabbed scars criss-crossing backs, and bandaged, bloodied heads – all evidence of systematic torture according to human rights groups and observers. Photos provided to CNN by detainees who say they were abused in government detention facilities. Source: CNN
These are just some of the severe injuries that doctors say they’ve been treating. Other demonstrators have arrived at hospitals suffering asphyxiation from teargas inhalation, or wounds from rubber bullets and live ammunition.
Sudan’s government has reported 32 fatalities, including three security personnel, since protests began in December, but doctors and opposition activists suggest the toll is much higher. At least five more people were killed Saturday in one the biggest demonstrations so far, according to an opposition union of doctors.
Medical professionals say that estimating an accurate toll of those wounded and dead is nearly impossible because demonstrators often avoid getting treatment – fearful of retribution from security forces.
On January 9, security agents stormed a hospital in Omdurman, a suburb of Khartoum, firing live bullets and tear gas into the emergency ward as they pursued people seeking treatment for injuries sustained during demonstrations earlier that day, according to the UN Human Rights Office and Amnesty International. Social media footage shows the attack on Omdurman Hospital as it unfolded on January 9. Source: Social media
Two months later, when CNN visited the teaching hospital, it was still surrounded by national security agents.
Inside the hospital, some doctors told CNN that many of their names had been placed on a government registry of so-called “collaborators,” endangering their lives and the lives of their families.
“I no longer carry around my ID cards that say I’m a doctor,” said one female physician, who spoke with CNN under the condition of anonymity.
“If I’m not on duty I stay home all day because it’s not safe to go out. I know I’m a target. I don’t even feel safe speaking on the phone anymore, I know we’re being monitored.”
Targeting medical professionals is considered a war crime under the Geneva Conventions, and it’s clear the Sudanese government doesn’t want anyone interviewing doctors operating here.
A spokesman for Bashir’s party told Reuters that the Khartoum governor had launched a “fact-finding committee to investigate what happened at Omdurman Hospital.” The Sudanese government has not responded to CNN’s multiple requests for comment.
Before long, we were told security agents roaming the hospital corridors were looking for us and we had to leave. Exiting through a back door, we were able to escape. US talks with Sudan move forward despite violence

Negotiations to re-engage with the Sudanese government, which could bring two decades of hostile relations to an end, have been widely viewed as a bid by the Trump administration to improve regional counter-terror cooperation and boost its diplomatic clout in Africa.
Last Thursday, a bipartisan group of US Senators, including Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Cory Booker, raised their concerns over the muted US policy response to the crackdown in Sudan in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The letter said that while cooperation on counterterrorism was a “necessary precondition” for talks, it was “not sufficient to justify engagement with the Sudanese regime.”
But CNN has also learned that one of the Trump administration’s key aims is to address outstanding cases brought by Americans against Sudan for its links to the al Qaeda bombings of US embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, in 1998, and the attack on the USS Cole in 2000.
Sudan has vehemently denied allegations that it provided material support for the attacks, but, last November, the government announced it had signed a cooperation agreement with the FBI, and, as part of normalization talks, will participate in “good faith negotiations” to agree financial compensation for claimants.
Sources close to the talks tell CNN that if the US was able to deliver compensation to the families of American victims, after all these years, it would be seen as a major coup for Trump.
The rapprochement with President Bashir, one of the world’s longest serving dictators, follows a familiar pattern of US President Donald Trump cozying up to some authoritarian leaders.
The US formally lifted a raft of sanctions against Sudan in October 2017, citing signs of progress in several areas, including Khartoum’s cessation of hostilities in the war-torn Darfur region and a push to promote regional stability. At the time, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said that any further normalization of ties would require more progress by the Sudanese government, including ensuring human rights.
A year later, Nauert outlined six key criteria – including freedom of the press – that Sudan would need to abide by in order to be removed from a list of countries considered sponsors of terrorism.
Sudan has detained an unprecedented number of reporters and sought to censor news coverage of protests. Journalists found reporting on the demonstrations risk life imprisonment and the death penalty.
Five months later, despite a state of emergency aimed at crushing dissent, the US is pressing on with the second phase of bilateral dialogue.
Rep. Gus M. Bilirakis, a Republican from Florida who led the US delegation in Sudan, said in a statement that the next round of talks would focus on financial compensation related to the US embassy bombings and USS Cole attack.
Bilirakis also acknowledged the mounting tensions in Sudan and called on authorities to release all political detainees, including an American citizen – one of three dual-nationals known to have been detained by Sudanese authorities since demonstrations began in December.
In a statement, the State Department denied the US was in “normalization talks” with Sudan, but acknowledged that ongoing negotiations offered the possibility of “improved relations.”
It added that the ongoing crackdown was “at odds with our objectives” and called for “restraint in dealing with the peaceful protests.”
Rudwan Daoud, a Sudanese-American activist who was arrested at a protest in January and detained for six weeks in the NISS headquarters without charge, told CNN that he was disappointed to see normalization talks moving forward.
“For the US government to normalize the relationship with a country that is led by a person who is indicted by the ICC [International Criminal Court], who is wanted for crimes against humanity, I don’t think that is a moral thing to do,” Daoud said. “I appeal to the US administration to focus on helping the Sudanese people – not Sudan’s government.” Nima Elbagir reported from Khartoum, and Eliza Mackintosh reported and wrote from London. Michelle Kosinski contributed to this report from Washington. Related links "

Chicago State's Attorney Kim Foxx says calls for her resignation are personal CNN,us.cnn.com,Amir Vera,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/us/chicago-state-attorney-jussie-smollett/index.html,"(CNN) Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx says the calls for her resignation run deeper than the Jussie Smollett case.
Foxx joined Rev. Jesse Jackson at Rainbow PUSH headquarters on Saturday to address the criticism. She said her criminal justice efforts were once celebrated in Chicago and are now ""being attacked because of one case and one celebrity."" ""I think we have to ask ourselves what is this really about? I've been asking myself for the last two weeks, 'What is this really about?'"" Foxx said. ""I will tell you this is personal, it's personal."" The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) and the police chiefs associations called for her resignation after holding votes of no confidence last week. The vote took place more than a week after Foxx's office dropped all charges against Smollett. FOP President Kevin Graham said the move undermined the public's faith in the criminal justice system. Foxx said she was ""undaunted by the events of the last two weeks."" Read More ""I'm committed to serving my term and, should the people have me, continuing forward,"" she said. Foxx took office in December 2016. Foxx welcomes outside review of Smollett case The FOP protested Foxx last Monday and called for her to resign for failing to follow through on charges that used significant police resources. The union has also called for a federal investigation into Foxx's involvement in the Smollett case. The protests came a week after her office dropped 16 felony charges against the ""Empire"" actor, who agreed to forfeit $10,000 in bail and do community service. Dueling protestors clash over Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office's decision to drop all charges against ""Empire"" actor Jussie Smollett, Monday, April 1, 2019, in Chicago. Foxx has previously said she welcomes an ""outside, nonpolitical review"" into how her office handled the Smollett case. She had separated herself from decision-making in the case in mid-February out of ""an abundance of caution."" She repeated her invitation for a review Saturday. ""I am again availing myself to an independent review of how we handled this case because it is owed to the public,"" she said. Despite the last few weeks, Foxx said she still stands with her law enforcement partners. ""I have never, will never, speak ill of our partners in this work,"" she said. ""I believe in their ability to do good work, I support them, I always have."" US representative says race plays a factor in resignation calls Supporters of Foxx also spoke out Saturday. ""The FOP is the sworn enemy of black people,"" US Rep. Bobby Rush told CNN affiliate WBBM-TV . ""They want to keep African Americans in total disarray."" Foxx said the calls for her resignation are ""disheartening."" ""When we get in these positions somehow goalposts change,"" she said. For Chicago's top cop, Smollett case wasn't a hate crime -- but this one is The FOP and the the police chiefs associations insisted, their issues with Foxx did not start with Smollett. ""This is not just about Jussie Smollett,"" Kevin Graham, FOP president, said. ""This is about many cases in the Cook County system that have gone unprosecuted, or having charges reduced."""
Kirstjen Nielsen resignation lays bare Trump's own immigration crisis - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Stephen Collinson,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/donald-trump-kirstjen-nielsen-immigration/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The forced resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is not just the usual story of an administration racked by chaos and the short shelf life of almost everyone who works for an imperious and grudge-bearing President.
Nielsen was hardly a moderate out of step with President Donald Trump on his signature issue of immigration . She became the administration's public face of the zero-tolerance policy that caused widespread outrage after hundreds of migrant children were separated from their parents. But she is nonetheless paying the price for a crisis exacerbated by the President's decision-making amid a major surge in migrants crossing the border. Her departure is a victory for conservative immigration voices, such as White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, who have long had Trump's ear and are pushing the President to adopt an even more hardline border policy. Trump says DHS Secretary Nielsen leaving It's a sign of a government stocked with acting secretaries and hampered by thin personnel benches, stretched beyond functionality by Trump's impulses and the most prodigious staffing burn rate of any modern President. Read More Nielsen's ouster fits with a pattern of Trump forcing out officials who have pushed back against his more radical instincts or been unable to carry them out, or who have earned his ire for being unwilling to match his defiance for governing practice and convention. They include former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, ex-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former national security adviser H.R. McMaster and former chief of staff John Kelly. Yet there is also a more fundamental reason for Nielsen's departure that gets closer to the heart of Trump's behavior and political strategy than almost all of the many, previous exits from his administration. Nielsen's demise is the clearest indication yet of the impossibility of reconciling Trump's ideological and emotional instincts on immigration -- which helped make him President -- with legal, humanitarian and international realities. Nielsen ""believed the situation was becoming untenable"" with Trump ""becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests,"" a senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday. Her departure mirrors that of former Defense Secretary James Mattis last year, whose authority was shredded by a sudden, and apparently spontaneous announcement of a Syria withdrawal by the President, but who had gradually grown apart from his boss. In both cases, the complexity of serious policy problems, often in life or death situations, clashed with the political instincts of a President who abhors detail and prefers to govern from the gut, while ignoring conventional expertise -- even from subordinates that in no way could be considered moderates. As the crisis on the US-Mexico border worsened, Trump's tolerance for Nielsen snapped. And the President might also have gone looking for a scapegoat. Last week, he was forced to climb down on a public threat to close the southern border after officials, business groups and political leaders warned of a pending economic disaster if he went ahead. He covered his blushes by going on a tear on immigration, with some of the most unconstrained rhetoric on the issue ever heard by an American president, that was scorching even by the standards of Trump himself. ""Can't take you anymore. Can't take you. Our country is full ... Can't take you anymore, I'm sorry. So turn around. That's the way it is,"" Trump said in a message to asylum seekers during a trip to the border on Friday. A day later, Trump mocked those fleeing persecution seeking a better life in the United States, portraying asylum seekers as criminals and gang members, rather than the families Nielsen described in a CNN interview last week. ""'I am very fearful for my life,'"" Trump said mockingly during a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition on Saturday. ""I am very worried that I will be accosted if I am sent back home. No, no, he'll do the accosting!"" ""Asylum, oh give him asylum! He's afraid!"" Trump said. Tense meeting JUST WATCHED Secy. Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving, Trump tweets Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
Secy. Kirstjen Nielsen is leaving, Trump tweets 00:40 Nielsen's departure, confirmed in a tense White House meeting with Trump on Sunday afternoon, came after days of speculation and was in retrospect a logical consequence of the President's boiling frustration. He had been dissatisfied with Nielsen for months, though their relationship appeared to improve marginally during the government shutdown that spanned the turn of the year and turned into another political reverse for Trump. Speculation about her status ballooned last week, after Trump suddenly declared that he would halt hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, accusing them of sending migrants to the US border. The move utterly undercut Nielsen who had just days before signed what her department called a ""historic, regional compact"" to tackle undocumented migration at its source. Immigration experts said that the aid cutoff would ultimately make the situation far worse as it would exacerbate the deprivation and lawlessness in Central America that is a key driver of migration and asylum claims. Nielsen's departure comes as more critical moments loom for the administration that are likely to test Trump's equilibrium at a time when he is already furious about the border situation. When he was not fulminating about immigration over the weekend, he was lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller and Democratic demands that all of his report should be released. Attorney General William Barr, caught between an angry President and Democrats in Congress after finding there was no evidence to support election collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, has pledged to release a redacted version of the report by mid-month. The White House is also trying to escape a self-imposed snafu over health care policy after sending confusing signals of whether the President wanted a new bid to replace Obamacare before or after the 2020 election. And this week, the administration is expected to significantly escalate tensions with Iran by against throwing caution to the wind by designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization, a move some in the defense and intelligence communities fear could expose US personnel in the Middle East to reprisals.

Cuomo to DHS Sec: Why's Trump viewing fencing, not kids? 01:32 As he seeks to manage the immigration crisis, the President now has a chance to insert a like-minded replacement in what in the wake of Nielsen's departure looks like an increasingly impossible job. Trump has already signaled that he will make immigration a centerpiece of his 2020 re-election bid and has every political incentive, since he is basing his hopes of a second term on energizing his base, to turn up the heat on the issue. The new secretary will also face the same limits as Nielsen. As much as Trump rages against asylum claims, they are codified in US and international laws that he in practice cannot just disregard. He recently found out that his preferred, dramatic solution of just closing the border would cause a swift and massive economic backlash that in itself could harm his hopes of winning a second term. The President is already pushing his power to the limit, and possibly beyond it by seeking to use a national emergency declaration to redirect money already allocated by Congress for other projects to the border wall that was at the symbolic center of his 2016 campaign. For all his fiery speeches, it is difficult for Trump to argue that his hardline approach on immigration is actually working. After years of declines, the tide of asylum seeking and undocumented migrants crossing the border has climbed dramatically. The White House says US Customs and Border Protection engaged in more than 100,000 border enforcement actions in March -- the most for one month in more than a decade. It argues that Trump has reassigned customs officers to the border and directed them to return as many migrants as possible to Mexico to wait for immigration proceedings on the southern side of the border. But ultimately, there will be no solution to the border problem and the chronic glut in the asylum and court systems, without action by Congress. Nielsen did ""everything she could to make the problem better,"" a senior Department of Homeland Security official told CNN's Geneva Sands on Sunday. ""Worst place for you to be is where you need Congress to act,"" the official said. The White House wants asylum law tightened and the power to detain families traveling with children -- a practice Democrats have branded inhumane. Trump named Kevin McAleenan , the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, as acting replacement for Nielsen at the Department of Homeland Security. McAleenan is not seen as an ideologue and served former President Barack Obama -- so there must be considerable doubt about how long he will also be in the post -- but he has less problematic ties with Congress than Nielsen. READ: Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation letter from DHS secretary post Attempts at reaching a broad political solution on the border have been complicated by Trump's choice to use immigration as a rallying call for his base and his adoption of rhetoric that stains any political common ground. He has several times pulled out of immigration deals with Democrats that might have helped mitigate the situation at the border apparently because he feared a backlash from his most fervent supporters and cheerleaders in conservative media. Democrats complain that the so-called master of the art of the deal wants to win on all his immigration priorities while offering nothing in return -- for example a path to legal status for people brought to the US illegally and who are protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. They also argue that his rhetoric is incompatible with the founding principles of a nation built on immigration. ""When even the most radical voices in the administration aren't radical enough for President Trump, you know he's completely lost touch with the American people,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday, remarking on Nielsen's departure. Yet while there is evidence that Trump's flame throwing commentary on immigration hurt Republicans in swing districts and helped Democrats win the House in midterm elections, Trump's warning that the US is under assault by marauding caravans of immigrants is widely backed by his supporters. That's why ultimately, even Nielsen, who was reviled on the left over the family separations policy and attempted to shape the President's instincts into a workable policy always seemed doomed. Trump has shown that he will always, eventually side with the themes and voters that powered his political rise even faced with insurmountable political and practical obstacles."

Will Brunei's anti-LGBT Sharia law spread across southeast Asia?,us.cnn.com,Ben Westcott,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/asia/brunei-indonesia-malaysia-islam-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Brunei's new law punishing homosexual sex with death by stoning has sent a wave of fear across the LGBT population in neighboring Malaysia and Indonesia.
On April 3, the small oil-rich kingdom of Brunei introduced a strict Islamic legal code mandating death for adultery and sex between men, as well as lashes for lesbian sex and amputation for crimes like theft. It has sparked a tide of condemnation from Western nations and celebrities alike. UN High Commissioner on Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on April 1 described the laws as ""draconian"" and a setback for human rights. But across Brunei's border in Indonesia and Malaysia, both Muslim-majority countries, there has been official silence. The lack of response from the prominent Southeast Asian leaders is likely to fuel concerns about the rise of conservative Islam in the region and the consequences for sexual and religious minorities.

— Kementerian Agama RI (@Kemenag_RI) April 1, 2019 In recent years, conservative Muslim groups have become a powerful force in the region, pushing for closer adherence to the more rigid of Islamic values and intimidating national governments. In one Indonesian province, gay people have been publicly shamed and caned . A Christian governor of Jakarta was thrown in jail on blasphemy charges. And in March, Malaysia's tourism minister claimed there were no gay people in his country. Malaysian LGBT rights campaigner Thilaga Sulathireh said the immediate reaction among the gay community was concern the crackdown could spread. ""All these things are creating a lot of fear for people and a lot of uncertainty,"" she said. ""What's going to happen to our lives and our future?"" CNN reached out to both the Indonesian and Malaysian governments for comment. Rise of conservative Islam Brunei is the first country in Southeast Asia to impose capital punishment for crimes such as LGBT sex or adultery, but neighboring Malaysia and Indonesia have been experimenting with strict Islamic laws for years. Malaysia already enforces a mixed secular and religious legal system, with some regions mandating Sharia laws punishing what the penal code calls ""unnatural"" acts such as homosexual sex with caning and fines, while Indonesia's conservative northwestern province of Aceh has a history of enacting Sharia law. 'Barbaric to the core': Brunei brings in gay sex stoning law Human Rights Watch researcher Andreas Harsono said Brunei public prosecutors even visited Aceh in 2014, ahead of the introduction of Sharia law in their own country, to learn about its implementation. Conservative politicians in Indonesia and Malaysia voiced their support for the Brunei laws this month. One member of Parliament from the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party congratulated Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah on his ""bravery."" ""Congratulations to Brunei for their bravery and political will in implementing Sharia criminal law ... upholding the Sharia is an obligation in ensuring Allah's rights to maintain peace for humans,"" Mohd Khairuddin Aman Razali wrote on his official Facebook page. In Indonesia, one of the leaders of the legislative Ulama Council in Aceh told local news media that Brunei's laws were just ""religious freedom."" Harsono said he was concerned that already vocal conservative Muslims in Malaysia and Indonesia would use Brunei's example to strengthen calls for stricter Islamic policies and laws. ""Already there are more than 60 local regencies and three provinces with mandatory hijab regulations in Indonesia. More than 20 local areas have regulations criminalizing LGBT people,"" he said. As of Friday, there had been no official comment on the laws from either Indonesian President Joko Widodo or Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Harsono said he did not expect Widodo, who is running for reelection, to speak until he knew how prominent Indonesian Islamic organizations would respond. ""If the NU is opposed to hand amputation, Jokowi will speak up indeed,"" he said, referring to the Nahdlatul Ulama mass religious movement. ""If they don't, Jokowi will not risk his election on making such a statement."" Indonesia's President Joko Widodo (C), who is running for his second term, and his running mate, Islamic cleric Ma'ruf Amin (3rd L) in September. Moving backward Neither Indonesia nor Malaysia has national laws similar to Brunei's. In Malaysia, homosexual sex is illegal but punished by prison sentences. In Indonesia, it is still legal but culturally taboo. But both countries in recent years have seen a steady rise in powerful conservative Islamic groups, who have pressed for tougher legislation in line with religious morality. ""It's impossible now for any politician to take a stance on religious matters without consulting their Muslim advisers and supporters,"" Harsono said. Ahead of the April 17 Indonesian election, Widodo controversially picked conservative Islamic scholar Ma'ruf Amin as his candidate for vice-president. In 2017, local media Quote: d Ma'ruf as saying he regretted the Constitutional Court's decision to reject a petition criminalizing gay sex. ""We want a stern prohibition of LGBT activities and other deviant sexual activities and legislation that categorizes them as crime,"" he told reporters in 2016. Indonesian Muslim demonstrators, holding banners that read ""put Ahok in jail,"" march towards the presidential palace in Jakarta on November 4, 2016. Indonesia's minister for religious affairs met with the Brunei ambassador just days after the news of Brunei's law broke, but publicly only mentioned halal certification and religious education. There was no mention of the Sharia law. Conservative Islamic groups helped rally popular support for the imprisonment in 2017 of Widodo's former ally, Jakarta mayor and Christian Basuki ""Ahok"" Tjahaja Purnama, on what some saw as trumped-up blasphemy charges. Activists said the rise of conservative Islamic groups had been marked by growing homophobia in both countries, and an increase in official action against LGBT people. In September 2018 two women were publicly caned in the Malaysian state of Terengganu for the first time for attempting to have sex in a parked car. One month earlier, one of Kuala Lumpur's only gay clubs was raided. Malaysian LGBT rights campaigner Sulathireh said when some rainbow flags appeared at an International Women's Day march earlier this year, there was a pronounced backlash against attendees. ""It resulted in people at the rally being questioned by their family members, their employers, their schools, about why they were there,"" she said. Observers gather to witness the caning of two women convicted of having sex in Terengganu, Malaysia, in 2018. 'Anything is possible' The idea that Indonesia or Malaysia might move to impose stricter Islamic laws isn't just theoretical. There have already been clear attempts by anti-LGBT activists. In early 2018, a large coalition of conservative Muslim groups presented a case to the Indonesian Constitutional Court to introduce a new penal code criminalizing LGBT relations. Brunei's LGBT community flees 'inhumane' new stoning laws The move was eventually abandoned, but the groups that supported it are still a powerful force in the country. It was this law that actor George Clooney alluded to in an opinion piece for ""Deadline,"" in which he warned about the potential fallout from Brunei's decision and called for a boycott of major hotels owned by the sultanate. ""The most dangerous issue is Brunei's neighbors. Indonesia has plenty of human rights issues, but they haven't stoned anyone yet,"" the actor wrote. ""But there was a law on the books, and if Brunei isn't met with loud, forceful resistance that shakes their business establishments, then anything is possible."""

Uganda kidnap: US tourist Kimberly Sue Endicott freed from abductors,us.cnn.com,"Susannah Cullinane, CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/africa/uganda-us-tourist-rescued/index.html,"(CNN) It was Kimberly Sue Endicott's dream to go on an excursion to see gorillas in their natural habitat.
That dream looked more like a nightmare last week when the California woman and her tour guide were kidnapped in a Ugandan national park, taken by gunmen who later used their hostages' cell phones to issue ransom demands. But the ordeal ended Sunday when Ugandan security forces rescued Endicott and her Ugandan guide, Jean Paul Mirenge. They were freed unharmed from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which borders the Queen Elizabeth National Park -- the scene of their abduction during a game-watching drive Tuesday evening. Four other people taken at the same time were previously released, officials said.

""At the time she asked me if it was something I would consider doing also, but time went by and she ended up going on her trip.""

Narendra Modi's mixed record on the India economy,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Rishi Iyengar,04-06-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/05/economy/narendra-modi-economy-election-india/index.html,"New Delhi (CNN Business) Narendra Modi had lofty ambitions for India when he came to power in a landslide election win in 2014.
The prime minister and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised to overhaul the economy and create millions of jobs for young people, saying they would reverse a decade of ""jobless growth"" under the previous government. As Modi seeks a second term, he's setting the bar even higher — the election manifesto released by the BJP on Monday aspires to make India the world's third largest economy by 2030. Here's a look at the Indian leader's record so far. A much bigger economy Read More The country has surged up the ranks of the world's largest economies and is on track to displace the United Kingdom from fifth spot in 2019, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. India's gross domestic product is forecast to be nearly $1 trillion bigger this year than it was in 2014. Only the United States, China, Japan and Germany can boast a larger GDP. Now the BJP wants to boost GDP to $5 trillion by 2025, from $2.9 trillion projected for this year. That would allow India to overtake Germany to become the fourth biggest economy. If all goes according to plan, GDP should then rise to $10 trillion by 2032, surpassed only by the United States and China. Under Modi, GDP per capita has also risen from $1,600 in 2014 to a projected $2,200 in 2019 — an increase of more than 35%. The country's rise has bolstered its status as a key global market for several industries eager to access its enormous population, increased spending power, and relatively open economy. Foreign investment has surged Modi aggressively courted foreign investors, removing several barriers for overseas players in sectors such as manufacturing, retail and aviation. They responded enthusiastically, pouring around $45 billion into India during the last fiscal year, according to official data. That's nearly double the amount in 2014, the year Modi came to power. Still, the growth in foreign direct investment has cooled in recent years, falling to less than 5% between 2017 and 2018. Recent crackdowns on foreign companies, particularly leading online retailers such as Walmart ( WMT ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) , have led many to question India's unpredictable policy-making. But analysts say those protectionist regulations reflect election dynamics, rather than a strategic shift, as Modi looks to drum up support from local business owners that form a big part of his base. ""There have been a number of FDI-specific reforms, and I would think that would set the tone for the next few years rather than a shift towards more protectionist policies,"" Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics, told CNN. Fluctuating growth The most keenly-watched metric since Modi came to office has been the pace of India's growth. India overtook China as the world's fastest-growing major economy in 2015, and except for a brief period in 2017, it has held that position ever since. But there has been a sharp deceleration in the last couple of years, with the biggest hit to growth resulting from some of Modi's signature reforms. He stunned the country in November 2016 by abruptly banning the two biggest banknotes in circulation, making 86% of the country's cash worthless at a stroke. While the stated goal was to crack down on illegal funds and move India towards a more digital future, the move wreaked havoc in the cash-dependent economy and brought several sectors to a halt. A massive overhaul of India's tax system a few months later hit the economy even harder, as businesses still reeling from the cash ban struggled to cope with the changeover. The economy had rebounded strongly by the beginning of last year, but growth has since slumped from 8.2% to 6.6%. ""If you really look at what this government has done, it has systematically ticked a lot of boxes,"" said Pronab Sen, India director at the International Growth Centre and the country's former chief statistician. ""But the one big error was [the cash ban.] The consequences of that one act, I think, more than outweighs the good things that have been done."" Rising unemployment The government has also disappointed many with its performance on jobs. India needs to create more than 10 million every year just to keep pace with the growth in its working age population. India has not released official employment data for several years, and the fact that more than 80% of its economy is informal makes it difficult to tell whether Modi has managed to keep his promise. The Indian government canceled the planned release of its latest labor survey in February. But the numbers it reportedly contained paint a grim picture. The Business Standard newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the survey that showed unemployment at its highest rate in 45 years. The majority of India's economy is informal. The head of India's government-run think tank said the data had not been adequately verified by the administration. Critics accused the government of trying to suppress the numbers. Independent calculations also show a rise in unemployment. India lost 11 million jobs in 2018, according to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy, an independent think tank. And a study last year by researchers at India's Azim Premji University showed that rapid economic growth is producing far fewer jobs than it used to. ""The increase in unemployment is clearly visible all across India,"" the study said. What happens next? Modi is still widely considered the frontrunner to win India's upcoming election, but questions over his economic promises have gotten louder as the polls approach. India's growth is likely to slow further in the coming months as an uptick in government spending around the election fades, Shah said. And while Modi has pushed through several policies with mixed success, many keenly-awaited promises in more sensitive areas — such as land and labor market reforms -— are yet to be delivered. Even if Modi wins reelection, changes in those areas will likely ""stay off the table,"" Shah added."

Cho Yang-ho died in Los Angeles on Sunday, Korean Air said in a statement Monday. He was 70 years old. The company didn't reveal the cause of death. Cho took over as chairman and CEO of Korean Air from his father in 1999. The following year, Cho became a founder of the SkyTeam airline alliance — a move that put Korean Air on the international map. Cho was also head of Korean Air parent company Hanjin Group, one of South Korea's sprawling family-run conglomerates. In more recent years, Cho made headlines for all the wrong reasons. He and his family have been accused of fostering a culture of abuse and violence at the company. Read More Investors are now hoping the company's governance issues are behind it — shares in Hanjin Transportation spiked 14% in Seoul following the news of Cho's death. Korean Air rose as much as 4% in morning trading. Culture of abuse and violence at the heart of some of South Korea's biggest companies Weeks before his death, Cho was booted from his position as chairman of the board at Korean Air. He was on trial over charges of embezzlement and breach of trust. He denied the charges against him. The ""nut rage"" incident of 2014 — when Cho's daughter, Heather Cho, assaulted two Korean Air flight attendants for serving her macadamia nuts in a bag instead of a porcelain bowl — was perhaps the most infamous example of the corrosive environment at the company. Last year, Cho's youngest daughter Emily Cho faced a storm of public criticism for allegedly throwing a drink at a business meeting attendee. She was later cleared of all charges related to the incident. Cho's widow, Lee Myung-hee, is currently facing criminal charges for physically and verbally abusing her staff. The alleged abuse includes claims that she assaulted an employee for forgetting to buy ginger and drenched another with water for driving too slowly. The criminal indictment against Lee was released by a South Korean lawmaker earlier this year."
"About 1 in 4 Japanese adults in their 20s and 30s are virgins, says study - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Emiko Jozuka,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/japan-sexual-inexperience-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) Japanese adults have their first heterosexual sexual experiences later than their counterparts in the United States and the UK, according to a new study.
Public health experts at the University of Tokyo found that sexual inexperience was on the rise in the country, with the percentage of women aged 18 to 39 who'd never had sex rising to 24.6% in 2015 from 21.7% in 1992. The change was greater for men of the same age, with 25.8% virgins in 2015, up from 20% in 1992. ""Sexual inexperience has become a national concern in Japan, but previous reports did not examine the trend across different age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds,"" said Peter Ueda, a public health researcher at the University of Tokyo and an author of the study, published Monday. By comparison, surveys from the UK, the United States and Australia suggest that rates of heterosexual inexperience are between 1% to 5% of adults in or around their 30s, said the paper, which was published in the journal BMC Public Health. Read More The authors said that while it had been suggested that an increasing number of Japanese adults were sexually inexperienced, their study was the first to address this issue using nationally representative data. The paper defined heterosexual sexual experience as vaginal intercourse between men and women. It did not include responses from those identifying as LGBTQ or asexual, and it assumed that all married couples had had sex. The researchers based their nationwide estimate on data from seven national fertility surveys conducted over three decades. Each drew on the responses of between 11,553 and 17,859 adults 18 to 39 years old. 'Money talks' The report found that a higher percentage of men on lower incomes remained sexually inexperienced compared to women. ""Although the discussion around cause and effect becomes very complex when considering who becomes sexually experienced and who remains a virgin, we show that heterosexual inexperience is at least partly a socioeconomic issue for men. Simply put, money talks,"" said Cyrus Ghaznavi, the lead author of the study. The issue of birth rate is important in Japan because its population is aging rapidly. Japan is considered a ""super-aged"" nation, meaning more than 20% of its population is over 65 years old. Just 946,060 babies were born in 2017 , a record low since official records began in 1899. The decline means a shrinking cohort of workers is left supporting an increasingly elderly population in need of health care and pensions, explained Kukhee Choo, a media studies professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, who wasn't involved in the research. Choo added that putting a spotlight on the rise of sexlessness is part of a domestic agenda to rectify the population decline. In recent years, local governments have boosted their efforts to pair off heterosexual single s in a bid to reverse the country's declining fertility rate. ""There seems to be a national push to get people to really think about this issue and feel a sense of urgency,"" Choo said. Furthermore, despite Japan's multibillion-dollar porn industry, Choo said discussions around porn and sex remain taboo. ""Sex is seen as dirty and corrupting in Japan,"" Choo said. ""My students can't use the word 'penis' or 'vagina,' and if a woman expresses any knowledge or interest in sex, you're seen as a fallen women. Men don't talk about it, either."" Economy link Conservative attitudes around sex haven't always been the norm in Japan, according to Choo. Many Japanese embraced Western notions of free love and sexual liberation after Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945 and the introduction of US values, said Choo. As Japan underwent an ""economic miracle"" from the late 1940s to the the late '80s, during which it became the world's second-largest economy after the United States, Japan's male white-collar workers increased. Though they were expected to work long hours, corporations rewarded them with stable middle-class lifestyles and lifetime employment. Such men became the dominant idea of masculinity. During those decades, companies in cities and densely populated towns became the breeding ground for new romances as they looked favorably upon marriages between staff. ""They'd actively hire people who they thought would be a good match for one another and organize sports days and company holidays to facilitate matches between people,"" said Shigeru Kashima, a Japanese studies professor at Meiji University. Who is having more sex over age 50, research explores But by the '90s, Japan's economic boom went bust, resulting in a long period of financial insecurity and economic stagnation that came to be known as the ""lost decade."" Kashima argues that men's loss of economic clout following the country's period of financial stagnation affected their confidence when it came to pursuing women. ""Over the past two decades, some Japanese men have found it hard to face external hardships and fear rejection,"" Kashima said. ""There's also an attitude of men devoting themselves more to their hobbies compared to women dedicating themselves to work."" Redefining virginity and sex Choo said that while some Japanese heterosexuals may be inexperienced sexually, relationships mean different things to different people. ""Some people are in a relationship and they're sexless. Some people don't want to be in a relationship because they don't want to be sexual. This is all going on at the same time among young people in Japan,"" Choo said. The real reason people rent middle-aged men in Japan Ueda, the co-author of the study, said the heterosexual virgins surveyed in the report expressed an interest in marrying later on in life, suggesting that their sexual inexperience wasn't by choice. And while the reasons behind rising heterosexual virginity rates are complex, virtual sex and porn consumption have also been blamed for the decline of heterosexual relations in Japan. ""You could say that there is a demand for alternative sexual or romantic experiences because people are finding it difficult to find partners, or you could hypothesize that the rise in these services are because some people prefer to express their sexuality in these ways,"" Ueda said.

Ueda's team also suggested that Japan could be leading a global trend toward sexual inexperience between heterosexual couples, with sexual inactivity rising among young adults in Germany and the United States, suggesting a global shift in attitudes on sex."
"Interior Secretary nominee said his calendars were public. Then, Interior released calendars with more information in them - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Ellie Kaufman,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/interior-secretary-calendars-public/index.html,"(CNN) Although Acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said in a letter to the House Natural Resources Committee in February that he didn't keep calendars and the records of his daily schedule others kept for him were public, the Department recently published to its website hundreds of pages of documents that reveal new details about some meetings that were left off of previous versions of his calendars.
The House Natural Resources Committee requested ""all calendars and schedules"" of Bernhardt's on Feb. 7, after saying the versions posted on the Interior Department's website were missing important details and excluding meeting descriptions or topics for more than 100 hours of ""official government time,"" according to the committee's letter. Bernhardt responded to the committee by stating that he had ""no legal obligation to personally maintain a calendar."" He said ""numerous people"" who create calendar entries for him have made those entries public. ""To the extent Agency records are created through that process, they are appropriately maintained to fully comply with the Federal Records Act and the Freedom of Information Act,"" he said in the letter. Read More Now, days before his confirmation vote to be the next Interior Secretary, the Interior Department released 439 pages of documents spanning from Sept. 2017 to Nov. 2018 with more information about Bernhardt's daily schedule than previously released by the department. Getting a complete picture of what the former Deputy, now Acting, and, if confirmed, the next Secretary of the Interior Department has been doing since he started in 2017 has been an ongoing battle for outside watchdog groups and Congress. Interior said that the new documents released this week were not calendars, but ""daily cards,"" which are ""created the evening before or sometimes early the morning of each workday."" The Interior Department said these daily cards are a ""synopsis of the Acting Secretary's calendar given to him as a reminder of his upcoming events"" and are often ""outdated by midday,"" according to a letter and statement Interior spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort provided to CNN. A previous analysis by the House Natural Resources Committee and outside groups found that the versions of Bernhardt's calendars published on the Interior Department's website were missing meetings altogether. Multiple versions of his daily schedule had been created in Google Calendar, and the versions online were not complete, according to a source familiar with the investigation. During a House Oversight and Government Reform committee hearing on March 13, an Interior FOIA official acknowledged that she was aware of the issue that some items from Bernhardt's calendars had been deleted. When Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) asked Interior Deputy Chief FOIA officer Rachel Spector if she was aware of calendar entries being deleted, she said ""I have some familiarity with the issue that you are raising and understand that the solicitor's office in the Department is working with the records officer in the Department to determine what's occurred there and whether it's consistent."" Potential conflicts of interest Bernhardt is a former oil and gas lobbyist and has recused himself from certain dealings with his former clients for a period of time. During his confirmation hearing , Democrats on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee questioned Bernhardt's priorities and conduct since joining the Interior Department, insinuating that his lobbying ties were influencing his policy decisions. While Bernhardt signed an ethics agreement when he joined the department and said during his confirmation hearing that he has complied with all of his ethics requirements, Congressmen and watchdog groups were concerned by the lack of transparency in the initial calendars. ""The only reason to take all these steps to overwrite your actual calendar every day is if you are trying to conceal what you're doing from the American people,"" Center for Western Priorities Deputy Director Aaron Weiss told CNN. The Center for Western Priorities is a conservation group that has been critical of the Trump administration. House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-NM) acknowledged that releasing the full, unredacted versions of Bernhardt's daily calendars was a step toward being more transparent. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who resigned last year amid multiple ethics investigations, left meetings off of his calendars as well, CNN previously reported . Grijalva said that while Interior is ""notorious"" for not responding to FOIA requests ""of any kind,"" he hoped their release of the new calendar information was a move towards greater transparency. ""I hope they've had an epiphany, that they understand that these requests, the requests the committee's making, are not burdensome,"" Grijalva told CNN. ""I think they came to the realization that, if pressed on the issue, they would have to release them anyway."" In a response to the committee's requests, Bernhardt asked Grijalva to publicly disclose all of his meetings as well. ""Given your recognition of the acute need for transparency, I encourage you in your new leadership role to join me in adopting this disclosure procedure. Together, our leadership on this issue will provide a good example,"" Bernhardt said in the letter to Grijalva. When asked for comment from Interior in response to Grijalva's comments, Interior asked if Grijalva had agreed to disclose his meetings like Bernhardt has. ""Has he committed to do so like the Acting Secretary has? I haven't seen,"" Vander Voort said. Complete calendars In the 439 pages now available on Interior's website of Bernhardt's daily schedule, a cursory comparison reveals several discrepancies between the previously released calendars found on the same page of Interior's website and the documents published this week. In some instances, meetings that included little detailed information in the older version now say who Bernhardt met with or the topic of an internal meeting. In the previous versions of the calendars, there were a number of entries that excluded descriptive information and instead offered general terms like ""external meeting,"" ""event"" or ""call time."" In the new version of the calendars, some descriptions of those external meetings shed more light on who Bernhardt has met with during his time at the department. When comparing April 2018 between the previously released version and the new version of the calendars, there are two instances where Bernhardt met with people who work with or for his previous clients that are listed on his ethics agreement as entities he has recused himself from. Bernhardt signed an ethics agreement stating he would recuse himself from working with certain businesses, but he is still allowed to meet with people that work at those businesses. On April 12, Bernhardt met with Lynne Hackedorn, the new calendar reveals. On the older version of his calendar, this event was listed as a ""personal meeting."" Hackedorn was the Vice President of Government Affairs at Cobalt International Energy, a former Bernhardt client that is included on his ethics agreement. Interior spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort said the meeting was personal, and Hackedorn was no longer employed by Cobalt when she met with Bernhardt. On April 17, the new calendar listed a meeting between Bernhardt and Ed Manning from 9:30-10:00 am. The previous version did not include this entry, because the meeting was cancelled, Vander Voort said. Manning is a lobbyist for KP Public Officials who has represented the Westlands Water District, also listed on Bernhardt's ethics agreement. On April 18, a meeting at 4 p.m. that was listed as an external meeting on the original calendar is revealed to be a meeting with the National Mining Association on the new version. Some of the discrepancies between the two calendars give more context to internal meetings as well. On April 12, a meeting that was listed as ""Briefing with BLM"" on the original version of Bernhardt's calendar is listed as ""Sage Grouse Update"" in the new version. Interior finalized a policy in March that opens up land previously protected as a habitat for the sage grouse bird to oil and gas drilling. The policy change outraged advocacy groups who have closely monitored the agency's every move regarding the sage grouse, and Grijalva called it a ""smash-and-grab job on our environment."" On April 24, a meeting at 2 p.m. originally titled ""Briefing with FWS,"" meaning U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, an office within Interior, is titled ""FWS Monsanto MOU"" in the new version of the calendars. MOU stands for Memorandum of Understanding. Monsanto is a large and influential biotech company. ""There is no legal protocol that defines the way a public official must label events on their calendar, and the Department has taken great strides to publicly disclose all meetings held with individuals or parties other than government entities,"" Vander Voort said in a statement. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted to advance Bernhardt's nomination on April 4, a procedural step, with a vote of 14-6. The Senate will vote on Bernhardt's confirmation as soon as next week."

1. Kirstjen Nielsen Kirstjen Nielsen is out as the secretary of Homeland Security . Nielsen has been the face of President Trump's hardline immigration policies, but apparently she wasn't hardline enough for Trump on his signature issue. Nielsen didn't resign willingly, a source told CNN, with her resignation announcement coming after a tense meeting at the White House with the President. Nielsen's tenure at Homeland will probably best be remembered for her defense of the administration's zero-tolerance policy , which caused widespread outrage after hundreds of migrant children were separated from their parents. Trump named Kevin McAleenan, who is the US Customs and Border Protection commissioner, as Homeland Security's acting secretary.

UK and tech companies Social media companies could be held legally responsible for any violent content on their platforms under new rules proposed by the UK government. The rules, intended to make the internet safe for kids and other vulnerable groups, would force tech companies to scrub from their platforms any content that incites violence, encourages suicide or constitutes cyber-bullying. The government would block access to websites or apps that fail to comply and the senior managers of those tech companies could face civil fines and criminal liability. More details on the proposed rules will be available today in a government position paper. European countries have taken a more robust approach in trying to regulate tech companies than the US has.

Trump's tax return fight with the Democrats: What happens now? - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Lauren Fox,04-08-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/08/politics/trump-tax-returns-congress-whats-next/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration has just days to respond to a request from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to turn over six years of President Donald Trump's business and personal tax returns.
But, while the deadline is Wednesday, the showdown for the tax returns is expected to last much longer as both sides dig in. What happens next is not immediately clear, though the legal posturing on both sides suggests that a court battle could be on the horizon. Before that, however, expect the team behind the President and the team behind Neal to produce a lot of paperwork supporting why they're right and the other is wrong. Trump has been clear he has no intention of making this fight easy. On Friday, his lawyers sent a letter to the Department of Treasury's counsel dismissing the request for tax returns as a politically-motivated pursuit, writing that ""Ways and Means has no legitimate committee purpose for requesting the President's tax returns or return information. While the committee has jurisdiction over taxes, it has no power to conduct its own examination of individual taxpayers."" ""The idea that you can use the IRS as a political weapon is incorrect as a matter of statutory law and constitutionally"" Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week."" ""We should not be in a situation where individual private tax returns are used for political purpose. What stops another party from doing the same thing by the way."" Read More But, Neal -- who spent months preparing a case to obtain Trump's tax returns -- won't take no for an answer. Using a little-known provision in the tax code, the Massachusetts Democrat is requesting the tax returns under 6103, a statute that allows the chairman of House Ways and Means panel to make requests for individuals' tax information. Neal and Democrats have argued that the law clearly states that if the chairman asks for the information, the secretary of the Treasury ""shall furnish"" it. ""This was a very reasonable approach,"" Neal told reporters last week. ""We wanted to make sure that the case we constructed was one that stood up under the critical scrutiny of the courts."" Read: Trump lawyers send letter to Treasury Dept pushing back on tax return request He added that if the IRS still doesn't respond they will decide on next steps but he assured us ""surely there will be one."" An aide close the process told CNN that Neal is expected to send at least one followup letter, reiterating his request maybe even more, but that the steps after that are still being discussed. Tax law experts are divided about whether or not Neal would issue a subpoena on top of his request or whether the 6103 authority implies the power to receive the information on its own. In that case, the question is whether a subpoena actually undermines the chairman's 6103 authority. ""A subpoena is a tactical decision. It is not required,"" said Andy Wright, former associate counsel for President Barack Obama. Before the request was made last week, liberals on the committee had pushed Neal more and more publicly to seek Trump's returns but Neal moved on his own timeline, cognizant of the political storm that would ensue after he sent his official letter. Trump's attorneys have also been preparing for the anticipated request, a source close to Trump's legal team told CNN. ""We've been looking at this issue for several months,"" the source said. Why American may never see Trump's tax returns The legal road ahead is a long one. The 1920s era law is largely untested in court with vast questions remaining about how broad a chairman's congressional authority is. While 6103 requests are made all the time for compiling research, the request of an individual's personal tax returns as high-profile as the President has raised questions. And, if Neal gets the returns, there are questions about how much he would publicly be able to share. Even if Neal obtained Trump's tax returns and the other tax information he's requested after a protracted legal battle, the public still won't automatically see them. Instead, the chairman would get the returns and then under the law he alone would have the authority to look at them unless he designates others to see them. Those designees could include members of the committee or members of the Joint Committee on Taxation. Once those individuals have the power to look at the tax information, they are subject to harsh punishments if any of the information is leaked. That penalty is $250,000 fine and five years in prison per infraction. It's serious. If Neal wanted to make the returns public -- and Neal has not said what he plans to do with the returns if he obtained them -- there is a process. Neal would put the committee into a private session and then the committee would vote. That would be a rare event. The last time Congress made the decision to disclose private tax information was during the fight over whether the IRS was discriminating against conservative groups. Then, however, the vote was bipartisan. Releasing Trump's tax info would likely split along party lines. What would the returns even show? There are still real questions about how informational Trump's tax returns would even be. Six years of returns including two while Trump was President will paint some picture, but not necessarily a comprehensive one. That is why while Neal is asking for tax returns, he is also asking for ""all administrative files"" including ""workpapers, affidavits, etc."" Tax returns can't tell the committee everything, but the administrative files could be more revealing including worksheets and audit reports. This is where the committee would actually learn how the presidential audit process works, and if Trump was under audit as a private citizen."
Lion bite rugby player pays tribute to surgeon who saved his hand,rss.cnn.com,"Nick Friend, for CNN",04-08-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/Bp5BRvP-Rsg/index.html,"(CNN) Bitten by a lion, but biting back against the Cheetahs; Welsh rugby player Scott Baldwin has paid tribute to the surgeon who saved his hand.
As he returned to South Africa on Saturday as part of the Ospreys team that beat the appropriately named Bloemfontein-based outfit, Baldwin took the opportunity to thank Faf Weyers, who led the operation following his perilous run-in. During a 2017 trip to the city to take on the same opposition, Baldwin's team had visited the Weltevrede Game Lodge on Bloemfontein's outskirts, only for the lion to gnaw at the hooker after he ignored advice by getting too close to the predator as he tried to stroke its head. Baldwin has regained fitness since the unusual injury, starting Saturday's 31-14 victory over the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein - his first visit to the city since being bitten by the lion. Since then, however, Baldwin has made a full recovery. He started Saturday's 31-14 Pro14 victory over the same opposition, before seeking out Weyers to present him and his family with his match jersey. Following the reunion, Baldwin tweeted a photo, saying: ""Faf literally saved my hand. Thank you my man! it was a pleasure to give you my March jersey after the game tonight.""

"About 1 in 4 Japanese adults in their 20s and 30s are virgins, says study",us.cnn.com,Emiko Jozuka,04-08-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/08/health/japan-sexual-inexperience-intl/index.html,"Hong Kong (CNN) Japanese adults have their first heterosexual sexual experiences later than their counterparts and the UK, according to a new study.
Public health experts at the University of Tokyo found that sexual inexperience was on the rise in the country, with the percentage of women aged 18 to 39 who'd never had sex rising to 24.6% in 2015 from 21.7% in 1992. The change was greater for men of the same age, with 25.8% virgins in 2015, up from 20% in 1992. ""Sexual inexperience has become a national concern in Japan, but previous reports did not examine the trend across different age groups and socioeconomic backgrounds,"" said Peter Ueda, a public health researcher at the University of Tokyo and an author of the study, published Monday. By comparison, surveys from the UK, the United States and Australia suggest that rates of heterosexual inexperience are between 1% to 5% of adults in or around their 30s, said the paper, which was published in the journal BMC Public Health. Read More The authors said that while it had been suggested that an increasing number of Japanese adults were sexually inexperienced, their study was the first to address this issue using nationally representative data. The paper defined heterosexual sexual experience as vaginal intercourse between men and women. It did not include responses from those identifying as LGBTQ or asexual, and it assumed that all married couples had had sex. The researchers based their nationwide estimate on data from seven national fertility surveys conducted over three decades. Each drew on the responses of between 11,553 and 17,859 adults 18 to 39 years old. 'Money talks' The report found that a higher percentage of men on lower incomes remained sexually inexperienced compared to women. ""Although the discussion around cause and effect becomes very complex when considering who becomes sexually experienced and who remains a virgin, we show that heterosexual inexperience is at least partly a socioeconomic issue for men. Simply put, money talks,"" said Cyrus Ghaznavi, the lead author of the study. The issue of birth rate is important in Japan because its population is aging rapidly. Japan is considered a ""super-aged"" nation, meaning more than 20% of its population is over 65 years old. Just 946,060 babies were born in 2017 , a record low since official records began in 1899. The decline means a shrinking cohort of workers is left supporting an increasingly elderly population in need of health care and pensions, explained Kukhee Choo, a media studies professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, who wasn't involved in the research. Choo added that putting a spotlight on the rise of sexlessness is part of a domestic agenda to rectify the population decline. In recent years, local governments have boosted their efforts to pair off heterosexual single s in a bid to reverse the country's declining fertility rate. ""There seems to be a national push to get people to really think about this issue and feel a sense of urgency,"" Choo said. Furthermore, despite Japan's multibillion-dollar porn industry, Choo said discussions around porn and sex remain taboo. ""Sex is seen as dirty and corrupting in Japan,"" Choo said. ""My students can't use the word 'penis' or 'vagina,' and if a woman expresses any knowledge or interest in sex, you're seen as a fallen women. Men don't talk about it, either."" Economy link Conservative attitudes around sex haven't always been the norm in Japan, according to Choo. Many Japanese embraced Western notions of free love and sexual liberation after Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945 and the introduction of US values, said Choo. As Japan underwent an ""economic miracle"" from the late 1940s to the the late '80s, during which it became the world's second-largest economy after the United States, Japan's male white-collar workers increased. Though they were expected to work long hours, corporations rewarded them with stable middle-class lifestyles and lifetime employment. Such men became the dominant idea of masculinity. During those decades, companies in cities and densely populated towns became the breeding ground for new romances as they looked favorably upon marriages between staff. ""They'd actively hire people who they thought would be a good match for one another and organize sports days and company holidays to facilitate matches between people,"" said Shigeru Kashima, a Japanese studies professor at Meiji University. Who is having more sex over age 50, research explores But by the '90s, Japan's economic boom went bust, resulting in a long period of financial insecurity and economic stagnation that came to be known as the ""lost decade."" Kashima argues that men's loss of economic clout following the country's period of financial stagnation affected their confidence when it came to pursuing women. ""Over the past two decades, some Japanese men have found it hard to face external hardships and fear rejection,"" Kashima said. ""There's also an attitude of men devoting themselves more to their hobbies compared to women dedicating themselves to work."" Redefining virginity and sex Choo said that while some Japanese heterosexuals may be inexperienced sexually, relationships mean different things to different people. ""Some people are in a relationship and they're sexless. Some people don't want to be in a relationship because they don't want to be sexual. This is all going on at the same time among young people in Japan,"" Choo said. The real reason people rent middle-aged men in Japan Ueda, the co-author of the study, said the heterosexual virgins surveyed in the report expressed an interest in marrying later on in life, suggesting that their sexual inexperience wasn't by choice. And while the reasons behind rising heterosexual virginity rates are complex, virtual sex and porn consumption have also been blamed for the decline of heterosexual relations in Japan. ""You could say that there is a demand for alternative sexual or romantic experiences because people are finding it difficult to find partners, or you could hypothesize that the rise in these services are because some people prefer to express their sexuality in these ways,"" Ueda said.
Ueda's team also suggested that Japan could be leading a global trend toward sexual inexperience between heterosexual couples, with sexual inactivity rising among young adults in Germany and the United States, suggesting a global shift in attitudes on sex."
