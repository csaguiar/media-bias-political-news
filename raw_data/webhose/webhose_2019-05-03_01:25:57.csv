Unneeded Green New Deal higher-speed train in Florida barrels ahead,dailytorch.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://dailytorch.com/2019/04/unneeded-green-new-deal-higher-speed-train-in-florida-barrels-ahead/,"

Less than a month after cancelling its planned initial public offering (IPO) on Nasdaq, in early March Virgin Trains USA LLC withdrew its application for a $3.7 billion Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing (RRIF) loan to build a higher-speed train from Orlando to Miami.
The latest setback for the train, formerly Brightline, now leaves the project in some doubt after the company reportedly posted a $117 million loss on $10 million of revenues in 2018 and projects losses between $15 million to $36 million in 2019.
Now, the train’s last leg of financing comes from a separate Department of Transportation $2.7 billion allotment of tax-exempt municipal private activity bonds, the largest ever allocation in the program’s history. That included an initial $600 million issue that was used to pay off millions of corporate debt at a high interest rate . Afterward, the company came back for another $1.15 billion of bonds and most recently yet another $950 million was approved.
On April 2, Virgin Trains USA sold $1.75 billion of the bonds, which included the $1.15 billion of bonds and refinanced the initial $600 million again. The bonds will pay interest between 6.25 percent and 6.5 percent.
While the Department of Transportation has already approved the latest private activity bond allocation of $950 million, the final decision had been delayed at the Florida Development Finance Corporation (FDFC) but could be formally approved at its April 5 meeting.
The agency and the Department of Transportation should be asking whether the latest approval will not just result in another round of musical chair refinancing for a project that has already been delayed for years.
The plan also counts on substantial customer demand once the tracks do get laid to Orlando. Right now, the train offers service between Miami and West Palm Beach.
Currently, Amtrak already offers express service between Orlando and Miami that takes about five and a half hours. The Virgin Trains USA line would reportedly cut an hour and a half to two hours off that.
High speed rail is a long-term objective of Green New Deal proponents who want to end air travel and eliminate carbon emissions, but with so many alternatives including driving presently available, it is unclear how viable such an expensive endeavor will be.
As it is, it remains to be seen what demand there is for a slightly faster option from Orlando to Miami, and also for the service that will run up Florida’s east coast. Virgin is betting that the customers will come but it may be the state of Florida that ends up holding the bill if the project ultimately fails.

CNN Host Presses Comey On Why He Failed To “Shut Down” Trump’s Campaign Statements As Hate Speech,jonathanturley.org,jonathanturley,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://jonathanturley.org/2019/04/03/cnn-host-presses-comey-on-why-he-failed-to-shut-down-trumps-campaign-statements-as-hate-speech/,"CNN Host Presses Comey On Why He Failed To “Shut Down” Trump’s Campaign Statements As Hate Speech CNN Screenshot
There was a chilling moment on CNN this week in an interview of former FBI Director James Comey, by CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. In the middle of the interview, Amanpour asked Comey if he had wished the FBI “shut down” President Donald Trump’s “hate speech” during the 2016 presidential election. Next week I will be debating an advocate of such speech codes and the criminalization of hate speech at Rice University . This was a particularly revealing moment as one of the top personalities at CNN pressed the former head of the FBI on why he did not simply shutdown Trump’s speeches as hate speech. Amanpour has been an outspoken critic of Trump but this reflect more of the diminishing European view of free speech.
We have previously discussed the alarming rollback on free speech rights in the West , particularly in France ( here and here and here and here and here and here and here ) and England ( here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here ). There are encroachments appearing in the United States, particularly on college campuses. Notably, the media celebrated the speech of French President Emmanuel Macron before Congress where he called on the United States to follow the model of Europe on hate speech.
Amanpour pressed Comey on why he did not simply send agents to shut up Trump: “Of course, ‘Lock Her Up’ was a feature of the 2016 Trump campaign. Do you in, retrospect, wish that people like yourself, the head of the FBI, the people in charge of law and order had shut down that language, that it was dangerous potentially, that it could have created violence, that it kind of is hate speech? Should that have been allowed?”
While I have been critical of Comey’s conduct during and after his stint as FBI Director, I was not surprised by his immediate and correct statement of the law: “That’s not a role for government to play. The beauty of this country is people can say what they want even if it’s misleading and it’s demagoguery.” Amanpour’s question succeeded in showing not just an unbridled bias against Trump but an unnerving view of free speech. In the United States, we are not “allowed” to speak by the discretion of the government.
It was an embarrassing moment for CNN which has been criticized for his relentless criticism of Trump and the airing of legal experts who spent the last two years assuring viewers that criminal acts by Trump were already well established. What was ironic is that CNN has (correctly) aired criticism of Trump who has called for new legal measures to punish those who voice what he calls “fake news.” At least Trump has been largely calling for civil not criminal penalties. Here was one of CNN top figures treating the criminalization of speech as a discretionary power of the government.
CNN has done nothing to correct the record that Amanpour’s chillingly anti-free speech message was not shared by the network.
The question was a disgrace for any news organization. CNN constantly calls for the protection of the free press with its promotion series “This is an apple.” Yes, that is an apple and Amanpour’s comments are anti-free speech. Perhaps CNN can call that fact for what it is. Share this:"

Trump jokes 'young bartender' Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal will get him reelected,www.politico.com,CAITLIN OPRYSKO,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/03/trump-ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal-1251095,"Share on Facebook Share on Twitter
President Donald Trump referred to Democratic firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as the “young bartender” on Tuesday night, pleading with GOP lawmakers not to kill her Green New Deal proposal before he gets the chance to run against it in 2020.
“The Green New Deal done by a young bartender, 29 years old,” Trump said at a fundraising dinner Tuesday night for the National Republican Congressional Committee. “A young bartender, wonderful young woman, the Green New Deal. The first time I heard it I said, ‘That's the craziest thing.’” Story Continued Below
Ocasio-Cortez shot to fame last year, becoming the youngest woman elected to Congress by upsetting Rep. Joe Crowley, a longtime fixture in the Democratic caucus, in a Democratic primary.
The self-proclaimed democratic socialist has embraced her outsider status, winning fans by touting her relatively humble roots and frequently mentioning her day job as a bartender in New York City before being sworn in to Congress.
Her star has only continued to rise, commanding a huge following thanks in part to her prolific social media presence. Through her first three months in Congress, she has sought to push Democrats to the left on a number of issues, including her sweeping Green New Deal proposal to combat climate change. But she’s become a punching bag for those on the right who have held her up as proof of a radical leftward shift in the Democratic party and seized on her every misstep.

Trump on Tuesday riffed on Ocasio-Cortez’s ability to drive news cycles and policy discussions, claiming that her influence was intimidating to much more senior lawmakers.
“You have senators that are professionals that you guys know that have been there for a long time, white hair, everything perfect, and they are standing behind her and they are shaking. They are petrified of her,” Trump said. “They really believe this stuff.”
But while Trump dismissed the Green New Deal, he held it up as the perfect foil for his reelection campaign and joked that he hopes Republicans don’t kill the proposal just yet.
“We will have to do something,” he promised. But, he added, “don't do it too early, please. Don't kill it because we want to be able to run against it. If they beat me with the Green New Deal, I deserve to lose.”"

Part 6 The Transect
“In a time of universal deceit – telling the truth is a revolutionary act.” “Political language . . . is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.” -George Orwell, author and Fabian Socialist
In my article, “ Incrementalism, Regionalism and Revolution ,” I briefly touched on planning and quoted from author, Jo Hindman. She will again help me explain what is happening vis a vis Urban Renewal and metro-planning. From her book, Blame Metro , we read, “Much is written about the incognito warfare on United States soil which public officials and their accomplices are waging to wrest private property from landowners. The strategy is to make property ownership so unbearable by harassment through building inspections, remodeling orders, fines and jailings, that owners give up in despair and sell to land redevelopers at cut-rate prices. Positive municipal codes are the weapons in the warfare .” [1]
Note, Hindman wrote that in 1966, yet it fully applies to today’s attacks on private property; many of the same strategies are being used, they just “changed the names to protect the guilty.”
Hindman writes, “‘Strengthening county government’ is a hackneyed Metro phrase indicating that the Metro take-over has begun. . .. Planning assistance subsidized by Federal money leads small cities and counties into direct obedience under a regional master plan. Land use rights are literally stolen ( ital. mine ) from landowners when zoning is applied to land.” [2]
In 1949, the Communitarian forebears of today’s planners wrote the original plans that were designed to free us of our property under the National Housing Act. Back then it was the American Society of Planning Officials, [3] the American Institute of Planners, and the National Planning Association. Today it is the American Planning Association (APA), which was formed in 1978 by combining the American Institute of Planners and the Society of Planning Officials. As you can see by their footnote, the APA brags that they were meddling in our private affairs since 1909, in fact here are the exact words, “ On May 21-22, 1909, 43 planners met in Washington, D.C., at the first National Planning Conference. This event is considered to be the birth of the planning movement in America .” A sad day for the American Republic.
Mimicking today’s ICLEI V.P. Harvey Ruvin , the 60s’ American Institute of Planners “makes no bones about its socialist stance regarding land; its constitution states AIP’s ‘particular sphere of activity shall be the planning of the unified development of urban communities and their environs and of states, regions, and the nation as expressed through determination of the comprehensive arrangement of land uses and land occupancy and the regulation thereof. [4] . . .The present-day crew of planners, drawing no line between public and private property, believe that land-use control should be vested in government and that public planners should have sole right to control the use of all land.” [5]
That is not just similar to what is going on today; that is exactly what is happening. Why? Because the sons, daughters and cronies of the puppeteers that were pulling the strings back in the beginning and middle of the 20th Century are pulling the strings of today’s planners. We just have a new generation of the same treacherous, thieving scheme updated with new-fangled, high-tech sounding names for the same old land (and people) control mechanisms.
THE TRANSECT
A 2002 APA Journal article gives the original meaning of transect as: a cut or path through part of the environment showing a range of different habitats. Biologists and ecologists use transects to study the many symbiotic elements that contribute to habitats where certain plants and animals thrive .
Planners took that technique, one that was designed for studying flora and fauna, and tweaked it to apply to humans. I would say the tweak was more a wrenching, actually it is more in the line of suspending critical thinking to superimpose the artificial and nonsensical process of the transect on humans and their mobilization.
Under the biological study, a transect shows where certain flora and fauna thrive, exist somewhat readily, or barely subsist in the different habitats from (get description i.e., arctic to tropical). With great literary(?) license, planners take the definition of biologic transect and, like Oliver Stone, rewrites history, these planners are rewriting biology; they want to play an active role in the phylogeny of homo sapiens , in fact they want to devolve it. One of the problems here is that their fairy tale is being used to take property rights (and thus liberty) from man and make him a slave. Laws should not be based upon make-believe. Yet this country, no the entire world, is being redesigned using Communitarians’ far-fetched, pseudo-utopian desires to sate the global elites’ desire to control the entire globe.
Look at their definition of transect for people and land planning: “Human beings also thrive in different habitats. Some people prefer urban centers and would suffer in a rural place, while others thrive in the rural or suburban zones. Before the automobile, American development patterns were walkable, and transects within towns and city neighborhoods revealed areas that were less urban and more urban in character. This urbanism could be analyzed as natural transects are analyzed.”[ Link ]
To compare humans in differing habitats with flora or fauna is preposterous hubris, and especially because the planners are using apples and oranges: “some people prefer urban centers and would suffer in a rural place,” does not mean the same thing as the biology transect means. The suffering would be a mental fabrication and would be such that to call it suffering in the same sense as plants or animals outside their natural habitat is absurd.
The planners also extol the virtues of the time before the automobile, “American development patterns were walkable, and transects within towns and city neighborhoods revealed areas that were less urban and more urban in character. This urbanism could be analyzed as natural transects are analyzed .” As if what we have today is “unnatural.” What these planners keep forgetting (and want us to forget also) is that we humans are part of nature and thus what we are and what we do is natural . Unlike other animals, we humans have a moral and cognitive brain. Our brain is what provides us with the necessary tools we need to survive and prosper, and one of those tools is the automobile.
So we have a convoluted, computer-modeled construct of what the entire ecosystem of the world should be and is called the Transect. But as with everything else in this New World Order NewSpeak, that really isn’t the truth. No, they did not sit down with the details of biological transect and translate it via computer modeling to a human/development version. What they did was take The Ideal Communist City [6] and figured out how to sell it to the American public by superimposing it over their Transect model.
The APA describes the Transect as “a geographical cross-section of a region used to reveal a sequence of environments. For human environments, this cross-section can be used to identify urban character, a continuum that ranges from rural to urban. In transect planning, this range of environments is the basis for organizing the components of the built world: building, lot, land use, street, and all of the other physical elements of the human habitat. [7] Pay close attention to that last sentence, “the basis for organizing the components of the built world.” In my understanding of English, that means telling us where each component of our lives goes; we don’t get to choose where we build our homes unless they in the area designated by planners. I am not misreading that because that same sentence continues, “building, lot, land use, street, and all of the other physical elements of the human habitat (ital. mine).” Sounds fairly simple to me, we will be told what and where we may build or even if we may build, and how we will live in that habitat.
To continue from the APA article, “In transect planning, the essential task is to find the main qualities of immersive environments, [8] …. Once these are discovered, transect planning principles are applied to rectify the inappropriate intermixing of rural and urban elements — better known as sprawl. This is done by eliminating the ‘urbanizing of the rural’. . . or, equally damaging, the ‘ruralizing of the urban’.
into discrete categories. This approach is also dictated by the requirement that human habitats fit within the language of our current approach to land regulation (i.e., zoning) .” [9]
The discrete categories of the transect continuum run from Rural Preserve, Rural Reserve, Sub-Urban, General Urban, Urban Center to Urban Core. Understand that the Rural Preserve is the Wildlands, the area humans will be forbidden to enter, and the Rural Reserve will be the connecting corridors to the Reserve area, i.e., corridors for fauna movement and human use will be highly restricted.
Remember, as I pointed out at the beginning of this article, the Communitarians, or global elites, introduced the zoning and planning systems used in this country. Now that they have gotten the American public inured to “planning,” they want to move us to the next step — where they plan every aspect of our lives through planning. To do so, they have to pretend that the original zones and plans came from us, the people, so they can say they need to throw the old ones out and introduce a whole new system. We are told, “ The most important obstacle to overcome is the restrictive and incorrect zoning codes currently in force in most municipalities . Current codes do not allow New Urbanism to be built, but do allow sprawl. Adopting a TND ordinance and/or a system of ‘smart codes’ allows New Urbanism to be built easily without having to rewrite existing codes.”
If you go to the link above, you will see that New Urbanism (transect planning plus) deals with everything but property rights. (Actually property rights are verboten in this not-so-brave new world they are bringing us, so they ignore them because property rights will not exist in the not to distant future if we do not put a stop to this.) It is Sustainable Development written in capitals and boldface. And how do they plan on doing this? The most effective way to implement New Urbanism is to plan for it, and write it into zoning and development codes . This directs all future development into this form.
Note: “directs all future development into this form.”
The new planning codes they want: Smart Codes. What are they?

The Smart Code
[Note: Part 6, “The Transect ,” should be read before reading this article to get full understanding of SmartCode.]
One of the most fundamental requirements of a capitalist economic system—and one of the most misunderstood concepts—is a strong system of property rights. For decades social critics in the United States and throughout the Western world have complained that “property” rights too often take precedence over “human” rights, with the result that people are treated unequally and have unequal opportunities. Inequality exists in any society. But the purported conflict between property rights and human rights is a mirage. Property rights are human rights . – Arman Alchian
“ The SmartCode is a form-based code that incorporates Smart Growth and New Urbanism principles . It is a unified development ordinance, addressing development at all scales of design, from regional planning on down to the building signage. It is based on the rural-to-urban transect rather than separated-use zoning, thereby able to integrate a full range of environmental techniques. Because the SmartCode envisions intentional outcomes based on known patterns of urban design, it is a more succinct and efficient document than most conventional codes.“ (To download SmartCode, go down to smartcode version 9.2 and click on it.)
The American Planning Association brags that their “definition emphasizes comprehensive planning that results in a unique sense of community and place, preservation of natural and cultural resources, of the expansion of transportation and housing choices beyond what we have now and we also emphasize the promotion of public health and healthy communities, which is an issue that has just begun to surface over the past two years.” [1] Understand that the “transportation and housing choices beyond what we have now” refer to walking, biking, rail and stack-em and pack-em housing. We have all those means of transportation now but we are not utilizing them as the APA and other Sustainable Development proponents would like because they are either expensive, impractical or unappealing to us. There is stack-em and pack-em housing already in large cities and in slum areas. Right now, most people chose what kind of housing they want and many chose single family homes in suburban (aka sprawl in Greenspeak) and rural areas — anathema to Smart Growth promoters. Also we want to retain our individual freedom which would negate being forced into communal housing with the associated communal living requirements of Smart Growth.
You may notice that they (Sustainablists, Commutarians) keep touting that people are moving from the rural and suburban areas into the cities at great rates “because they want the infrastructure and amenities available there.” I am not sure that people are moving into cities (yet) in any great numbers, but those groups, let’s call them Sustainablists, not only want to drive people into the cities (so they can be more easily controlled), and they are writing the planning to do just that. Looking at areas around the country, they are succeeding because they have established planning commissions in every city, town and county .
“The SmartCode is a form-based code, meaning it envisions and encourages a certain physical outcome — the form of the region, community, block, and/or building. Form-based codes are fundamentally different from conventional codes that are based primarily on use and statistics — none of which envision or require any particular physical outcome.” [2] Right, conventional codes, the codes used now, do not require all buildings, streets and towns to look alike.
“The SmartCode is a tool that guides the form of the built environment in order to create and protect development patterns that are compact, walkable, and mixed use. These traditional neighborhood patterns tend to be stimulating, safe, and ecologically sustainable. The SmartCode requires a mix of uses within walking distance of dwellings, so residents aren’t forced to drive everywhere. It supports a connected network to relieve traffic congestion. At the same time, it preserves open lands, as it operates at the scale of the region as well as the community.” [3] Go back and look closely at what was said: “. . . guides the form of the built environment, . . .” just as I said above, they are making all buildings the same.
And remember, in Part 6, The Transect, I quoted the the APA , “In transect planning, this range of environments is the basis for organizing the components of the built world: building, lot, land use, street, and all of the other physical elements of the human habitat . (emphasis mine)” [4]
Transfer of Development Rights (TDR)
“ Local governments use TDR programs to mitigate the economic impact of land use regulations, specifically to compensate landowners for perceived partial takings (Johnston and Madison, 1997). This planning tool offers landowners a way to recapture some lost economic value when a property is downzoned[1] from residential use to agricultural use for preservation purposes.” Note the two phrases: “to compensate landowners for perceived partial takings” and “to recapture some lost economic value when a property is downzoned.” They are inferring that takings are a figment of the property owners’ imaginations and with the “recapture of some lost value” admitting that they are not going to compensate owners with the full value of their property.
Some of the things the SmartCode does: “It utilizes a type of zoning category that ranges systematically from the wilderness to the urban core.” [5] In other words, it encompasses the entire land mass. • “It enables and qualifies Smart Growth community patterns that include Clustered Land Development (CLD), Traditional Neighborhood Development (TNDTM), Regional Center Development (RCD), and Transit-Oriented Development (TOD).” [6] • “It integrates the scale of planning concern from the regional through the community scale, on down to the individual lot and, if desired, its architectural elements.” [7] In other words, every aspect of development and they want to chose your appliances also. • “It integrates methods of environmental protection, open space conservation and water quality control. • “It integrates subdivision, public works and Transfer of Development Rights(TDR) standards. • “It encourages specific outcomes through incentives, rather than through prohibitions.” [8] The intention is to make using SmartCode easy and standard codes difficult so that people are inclined to take the path of least resistance — not realizing what it means for property rights and individual freedom. “Encouraging specific outcomes” should scare the devil out of you. Why would they want specific outcomes for every person in America?
As I noted near the beginning of this article the APA brags that their “definition emphasizes comprehensive planning that results in a unique sense of community and place, preservation of natural and cultural resources, of the expansion of transportation and housing choices beyond what we have now and we also emphasize the promotion of public health and healthy communities, which is an issue that has just begun to surface. . . .” What the meaning is that humans will no longer own their own homes instead we will be herded into the “unique sense of community and place” which is the stack-em and pack-em Smart Growth communal habitats. The healthy communities are Commutarian, Sustainablist versions of healthy, but healthy for whom? Not for individuals who believe in free will, individual freedom and the right to private property. In these new “healthy communities” you will be told what is healthy and what is not and you will not be given the choice of deciding for yourself if you want to follow the leader. You think Bloomberg’s soda ban is draconian, just wait.
In Part 8 I will go deeper into SmartCode.

Wall Street Thinks The Cable TV Sector Could Easily 'Unravel.' That's Probably A Good Thing.,www.techdirt.com,Karl Bode,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190318/08345641817/wall-street-thinks-cable-tv-sector-could-easily-unravel-thats-probably-good-thing.shtml,"from the adapt-or-perish dept Wed, Apr 3rd 2019 6:40am — Karl Bode
For the better part of the last decade, some Wall Street analysts have quietly been pointing out that the current pay TV business model is unsustainable. As it stands, broadcasters increasingly impose giant price hikes for the same programming to cable companies, who in turn pass those higher costs on to consumers. Those consumers are, in turn, increasingly ""cutting the cord"" by moving to cheaper streaming alternatives. And when those streaming alternatives don't provide what they want or raise rates (as AT&T recently did with its DirecTV Now service ), subscribers then shift toward free options like over the air antennas or piracy.
Smaller cable providers have been warning for years that unless you enjoy the size and leverage of being a giant ISP and broadcaster combined (AT&T/Time Warner, Comcast/NBC Universal), you're not going to be able to survive this new tight-margin market. Some, like CableONE , have opted to get out of TV entirely and focus on broadband. It's a trend that's only likely to accelerate.
Some Wall Street analysts, like MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett, have been noting for a while that this entire mess isn't getting better anytime soon. He's again making the rounds, arguing that there's a chance that bigger cable operators could similarly embrace the idea of giving up on video as margins tighten. And if they stop caring about video (either by dropping pricey channels or raising rates), it's only going to accelerate the cord cutting trend :
""If larger MSOs follow their smaller peers in concluding that video is no longer worth defending, then subscriber declines would almost certainly accelerate, perhaps radically so,"" Moffett wrote. ""And that, in turn, would force programmers to be even more aggressive in licensing their content to OTT services, sealing the deal. The industry as we know it today could, or would, simply unravel. ""
This is an industry that responded to increased streaming competition by doubling down on all of its very worst impulses, especially raising rates. As such, a semi-collapse of the sector could probably be a good thing. Most specifically by curing many cable and broadcast executives of the false belief that the traditional, bloated cable bundle is going to live forever, and that cord cutting is just this weird, overhyped trend that stops once Millennials procreate more . A collapse would send a very clear message that heated video competition is the new normal and adaptation is essential.
That said, giant cable operators like Comcast NBC Universal have a secret weapon in this fight: their monopoly over broadband. Moffett has been pointing out for a long time that "" video just doesn't matter "" anymore if you're a cable TV provider. With tight margins and hot competition in video, all the money is going to be in broadband moving forward:
""That in turn has diminished the value of a pay TV subscriber versus a broadband customer. Moffett estimated that the market values a video customer at a multiple of about 2 times cash flow, while a broadband subscriber is attached a value of between 12 and 13 times cash flow. “Video just doesn’t matter much anymore,” Moffett said.""
Moffett doesn't clearly illustrate in his research notes is why broadband is so profitable. It's so profitable because in many areas it remains a natural monopoly dominated by just a few major players like Comcast or Charter (Spectrum). This monopoly control provides a secret weapon in the video wars. Thanks to no competition, these companies can impose arbitrary and unnecessary usage caps and overage fees , which drives up the price of not just broadband...but of using streaming competitors. Companies like AT&T remove these restrictions if you use their own streaming services . In short, they hope to win by dominating the pipe, then tilting the playing field to dominate the content.
Between their attacks on FCC oversight (including net neutrality) and these natural monopolies, many of the bigger companies will be protected for some time from the financial cost of increased video competition. But ultimately the entire market is going to need to be dramatically reshaped as traditional, bloated and expensive cable TV channel bundles die thanks to a little thing called competition. Avoiding the financial hit on the video side of the equation is not going to be avoidable for many of these companies, no matter how hard they tried to convince themselves the cord cutting trend wasn't a serious threat .
While that greater video competition will be a good thing for consumers as a universe of companies battle it out, consumers will ultimately be paying for the evolution courtesy of higher broadband bills and weird net neutrality violations, thanks to a broken US broadband market and regulatory capture problem neither party has historically been interested in trying to fix."

CAPITAL IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT LIKE RACE,handbill.us,theaveeditor,04-02-2019,2019,4,http://handbill.us/2019/04/02/capital-is-a-social-construct-like-race/,"UW CAPITAL IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT LIKE RACE I am befuddled. This morning I was reading about capital and about the world debt. The debt is something like 200 trillion dollars. What is that debt? Who owns the debt?
I am also befuddled by ideas like “people of color.” American politics seems to have defined itself in term of something called race. Immigration is bad because people who speak spanish are brown. Is Spanish a race? What is race? Who defines my race?
Then I figured it out, world debt is a social construct like race!
Every time someone tries to explain race to me, they explain it is a “social construct.” Skin color doesn’t matter until someone decides black people smell bad. Hell, skin color itself does not define race because somehow being Hispanic or Jewish gets you a racial quality and if you do not have that quality you get “white privilege.” The liberal community has decided that Jews are white, another social construct. In India they have a caste system very much like American racism. Brahmins get to be at the top and Dalit at the bottom .. just like white folks and black folks in the USA! Of course when they come here, Brahmins become people of color.
Problem is, I can not find a definition of a social construct. Is there some way to figure out what races are? If so maybe we could just refine race out of the vocabulary. The same problem happened for me fifty years ago in college when I read Marx. What is capital? Like race, there is no real definition of capital. As Marx explained .. or as well as I understood .. capital is a social construct, an agreement that we all have to recognize that someone owns the rights to buy and sell stuff. Jeff Bezos has, a very big amount of capital.
Economists and bankers define capital so well that it seems real .. just like race. The US can borrow lots of money because everyone knows we are worth it! Like race, that works as long as everyone agrees."

Trump Seeks Dershowitz Help with Kushner’s Failed Middle East Peace Plan,www.politicususa.com,Leo Vidal,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politicususa.com/2019/04/03/trump-seeks-dershowitz-help-with-kushners-failed-middle-east-peace-plan.html,"Trump Seeks Dershowitz Help with Kushner’s Failed Middle East Peace Plan 245 Subscribe Print Flipboard
In 2017 Donald Trump put his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of creating a plan to bring peace to the Middle East. It didn’t seem to matter to the president that the greatest diplomats in history couldn’t accomplish this objective, and Jared had absolutely no experience in international diplomacy.
Let’s call Trump’s illogical move “nepotism at its finest.”
And now, after two years on the job, Kushner still has not released anything resembling a comprehensive peace plan that Trump had promised. So in desperation Trump has brought in one of his biggest defenders, Alan Dershowitz, to help out with the difficult process.
Who knew that peace in the Middle East could be so hard to accomplish?
According to a new Daily Beast report Dershowitz has discussed the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians with several different Trump administration officials. They include Kushner, special envoy Jason Greenblatt and Ambassador David Friedman.
In one of his first controversial moves, Dershowitz says that he advised the administration to formally recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Doing this would violate the international norm of not recognizing claims of territories that were seized during wars.
“I compared the Golan Heights to a captured battleship,” Dershowitz said. ‘You don’t give back a battleship you’ve captured in a defensive war.”
Despite being asked for his advice, however, Dershowitz says he still doesn’t know what exactly is in Kushner’s peace plan (if one even exists).
“It changes all the time,” he said. “I’m not privy to the specifics, the current specifics, but mostly it’s been one-way conversations—that is, they ask for my advice. They don’t tell me their secrets. They just ask me for my advice, and I give it to them.” Jared Kushner Doesn’t Know What He Is Doing
One thing obvious from the two years of the Trump presidency is that Donald Trump has not hired “the best people” as he had promised to do.
The fact that he hired his unqualified son-in-law for such a difficult and high-profile job as bringing peace to the Middle East shows how clueless he is.
Just as troubling as hiring family members is his practice of hiring only people who have praised him on television. Alan Dershowitz has been a regular on Fox News for years, and has always defended Donald Trump against his critics.
It is obvious that neither Donald Trump, Jared Kushner , nor Alan Dershowitz have a Middle East peace plan. The fact that they are pretending to have one is just one more example of how they blatantly lie to the American people — and to the world."

Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski couldn’t believe Donald Trump’s false claims made yesterday — and many times before — that his father Fred was born in Germany. In fact Fred Trump was born in the Bronx, in New York City, in 1905.
During today’s show Brzezinski played a series of video clips showing the numerous times that the president misrepresented the birthplace of his father. Like many others, she expressed disbelief that the President of the United States doesn’t know what country his own father was born in.
“You’re a birther — how do you not know where your parents were born?” Brzezinski exclaimed. “How can you get that wrong so many times? I’m just — it’s vexing.”
The Morning Joe co-host then asked the other panelists if they could offer any explanation for what caused Trump to make his bizarre claims.
“I was born in Germany, so I can speak to this,” said a Morning Joe guest, author Mark Leibovich. “No, I mean, it is curious. It is not kind of a standard variety lie, necessarily. What do you gain from it?”
“He has these asides,” Leibovich continued. “‘I’m German, my father was German.’ Something you can drop into a conversation. It’s almost as if he wants it lyrically, the phrase, to include a kind of, you know, falsehood in a weird way. I don’t know, I don’t quite know where it gets him or what he is trying to do.”
MSNBC contributor Elise Jordan said it was one of the many bizarre tics the president demonstrates on a daily basis.
“I don’t think we’ve ever seen anyone on the world stage with such a five-minute window of attention span,” she said, “where if he thinks in the moment saying his father was German, a blatant lie, is going to gain him praise, he’ll do it.” Trump is Such a Pathological Liar That He Often Doesn’t Know He Is Lying
When you watch the video clips that Mika Brzezinski played today it becomes apparent that Donald Trump doesn’t even know that he is lying about his father’s birth country. Telling falsehoods is so commonplace to the president that it has become second nature. He does it automatically, without even being aware of it.
He also may be senile, and suffering from dementia.
Donald Trump poses a danger to America because of his unstable mental state , and because he lies so often, about everything.
But perhaps a bigger danger is the fact that so many people — including his supporters who plan to vote for him — are willing to accept his lies.
When the truth doesn’t matter in politics and government, then we know we are in real trouble. Hopefully the frightening reign of Donald Trump will end soon and we can restore the importance of Truth in the operations of the United States government."
"Hillsborough, FL custodians and teachers rally against privatization",www.fightbacknews.org,Fight Back,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.fightbacknews.org/2019/4/3/hillsborough-fl-custodians-and-teachers-rally-against-privatization,"Hillsborough, FL custodians and teachers rally against privatization By Bill Aiman | Public Sector Unions Hillsborough, FL rally against privatization. (HCPS)
Tampa, FL - Over 40 custodians, teachers and concerned community members rallied outside the Hillsborough County School Board meeting, April 2, to stop plans to privatize the custodial staff at all Hillsborough County Public Schools (HCPS). The rally was hosted by the Hillsborough State Employee Federation and Hillsborough County Teachers Association. Chants at the rally included “It’s time to stop the greed, give custodians what they need!” and “Up up with education, down down with privatization!”
The Hillsborough County School Board (HCSB) claims there are currently no plans to contract out custodial services at this time, but just last month they sent out request for proposals to a number of bidders. There is no requirement that the potential company negotiate a new contract with the union. The push for privatization is a clear attempt by HCSB to bust the union.
Now, custodians are some of the lowest paid workers at HCPS, making $24,000 a year. By hiring a third party contractor with the intention to “lower costs,” workers in HCPS will face cuts to hours, benefits and salary.
“It’s going to devastate a large portion of our community,” said Hillsborough State Employee Federation (HSEF) president Iran Alicea. “90% of the employees affected by this are minorities. 61% of these employees that are affected are women. The school district champions itself as the largest employer in the county of minorities and women, yet they are trying to devastate the whole community.”
The school board is attempting to justify the push for privatization by claiming a report compiled by a third party consulting firm, known as the “Gibson Report,” recommends privatizing the custodial staff as a cost saving measure. This, however, is simply not true.
The report only recommends centralizing custodial staff for the county, giving schools the ability to “focus more on academic needs at the schools.” The report goes on to state that centralization will “require additional zone supervision, investments in equipment, and an increase of staff in the custodian substitute pool.” Nowhere does it say privatization is required.
“We would like to see the district come to the table and discuss this. They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this report that states we should centralize our custodial staff, not privatize,” continued Alicea. “With the hundreds of thousands of dollars, the district has spent for this report, they’re not even implementing it.”
The rally ended with county employees providing comments to HCSB against the privatization effort. The Hillsborough State Employee Federation and the Hillsborough County Teachers Association are planning for another rally in May at the next school board meeting.

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— Top Republicans in Congress and the administration are urging President Donald Trump to drop his threat to shut off the Southern border, warning of dire trade and economic consequences. But the president said his border security agenda is more important.
— Senate Democrats introduced a new disaster aid proposal to provide funding for Midwestern states like Iowa and Nebraska dealing with catastrophic flooding, but the broader relief effort remains stalled in Congress. A legislative fix for farmers whose uninsured, stored grains were ruined by the floodwaters could be in the mix when negotiations continue on a final package.
— As Washington and Tokyo gear up for formal trade talks, there’s a growing sense among trade analysts the Trump administration might push for a multi-stage agreement that could hand the president a relatively quick win on agriculture — and potentially avoid the need for congressional ratification.
HAPPY WEDNESDAY, APRIL 3! we’re still not convinced that Brunchables is real and not just an April Fools’ joke. Send tips to rmccrimmon@politico.com and @ryanmccrimmon TRUMP ALLIES PUSH BACK ON BORDER THREAT: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and White House economic advisers Larry Kudlow and Kevin Hassett are among the growing number of Republican lawmakers and officials urging the president not to make good on his threat to slam shut the U.S.-Mexico border.
“Closing down the border would have potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country, and I would hope we would not be doing that,” McConnell said Tuesday, a rare public rebuke of Trump by the Kentucky Republican.
Kudlow and Hassett have shared data with Trump detailing the potential damage to GDP growth , and White House aides are scrambling to find ways to contain the economic fallout if Trump decides to pull the trigger — like closing the border to cars but allowing access for commercial vehicles.
POTUS’ priorities: Trump appears resistant to the arguments against a closure and willing to take the economic hit for the sake of advancing his border security agenda — much like his government shutdown threats in December.
— “Sure, it will have a negative effect on the economy,” he told reporters Tuesday. “But to me, trading is very important, the borders are very important, but security is what is most important.”
House Democrats, meanwhile, are considering holding a vote on Trump’s border proposal to put Republican lawmakers on the spot.
Speaking of economic headwinds: The WTO’s yearly forecast , released Tuesday, projected global trade in 2019 will grow at the slowest pace in three years, as continued trade tension clouds the international outlook, Pro Trade’s Adam Behsudi reports .
DEMOCRATS RAISE DISASTER AID STAKES: Senate Democrats on Tuesday filed a $16.7 billion amendment to the House-passed disaster aid bill, H.R. 268 (116) , that would add an extra $2.5 billion to address recent catastrophic flooding in states like Iowa and Nebraska and tornadoes in the Southeast, Pro Budget’s Caitlin Emma reports .
The move comes after Democrats got an earful on Monday from Republicans for voting against the Senate GOP plan, which would make the flood-stricken Midwestern communities eligible for aid.
Grain coverage fix? Lawmakers like Sen. Chuck Grassley are also looking for a legislative solution to help growers in the Midwest whose stored grains — which aren’t eligible for crop insurance — were swamped by the floodwaters. Grassley said he’s discussed the issue with sponsors of the disaster aid package and with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, your host reported .
TRADE CORNER USMCA URGENCY? DEPENDS WHO YOU ASK: Two lawmakers with major sway over Trump’s trade agenda — Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Grassley, the Senate Finance chairman — described very different levels of urgency for ratifying the new North American trade pact, highlighting the deal’s uncertain fate on the Hill.
Your move, Mexico: In a live interview with POLITICO Playbook, Pelosi made clear the won’t be brought to the House floor for a vote until Mexico overhauls its labor laws to protect workers’ rights, Pro Trade’s Sabrina Rodriguez reports .
“We have to see the evidence of what’s happening, not only that they pass the bill [in Mexico], but that they implement the policy,” she said, adding that USMCA implementation will “take some time.”
The ratification process already faces delays as Trump has yet to remove tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Canada and Mexico. Lawmakers, business groups and officials from Canada and Mexico have emphasized that lifting the duties is critical to ratifying the deal in all three countries.
Timing up north: Grassley said the tariffs need to be resolved quickly in order to ratify the trade pact before Canada’s Parliament adjourns in June. “I don’t know why it’s taken him so long to realize he’s got a victory at hand. Just take these tariffs off,” he said of Trump.
HOW TRUMP COULD DEAL WITH JAPAN WITHOUT CONGRESS: As the U.S. and Japan approach formal trade talks, there are signs the Trump administration might take a two-step approach to strike a narrower deal centered on agriculture — and potentially avoid the congressional ratification process — former Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Bruce Hirsh writes for POLITICO’s The Agenda.
Farm focus: Hirsh points out that during a Senate Finance Committee hearing last month, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said it will “take a while to get an entire [free trade agreement], but my own view has been that we have to take care of the agricultural part of it and some others so it’s balanced at an earlier stage.”
Skeptics of that approach say trade negotiators will have a hard time persuading stakeholders to defer their policy priorities until later stages of negotiations. On the other hand, there are ag issues Trump could address in an initial agreement with Japan — like lowering tariffs on farm goods — that wouldn’t require congressional approval.
A bilateral deal with Tokyo is seen as crucial to helping U.S. exporters — especially farmers and ranchers — make up for Japanese market access they lost after Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in 2017.

HIGHER EDUCATION FEW BORROWERS GET PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS ON SECOND SHOT: The vast majority of individuals who applied for the second chance at public service loan forgiveness that Congress created last year were again denied the benefit, according to new Education Department data.
— Congress set aside a combined $700 million over the past two fiscal years to help tens of thousands of borrowers who failed to qualify for forgiveness because they selected the wrong repayment plan. But as of last week, the Education Department said it had approved 262 borrowers under the temporary program — amounting to just $10.6 million of discharged loan debt.
— Of the 9,820 applications the department reviewed, 1,184 remain pending and 8,374 were rejected. The applications were most frequently rejected because borrowers had not met the requirement of making 10 years of loan payments, the department said. The data was provided in response to a request by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), who faulted the Trump administration for its implementation of the program. Michael Stratford has the full story.

K-12 STATES COULD DO BETTER WITH DATA, REPORT SAYS: States have made investments in better report cards, but they all have work to do to ensure these resources provide parents and the public with clear information about the outcomes of students and schools, according to a Data Quality Campaign report released today.
— The report, “Show Me the Data,” aggregates how states are sharing information with their communities as they report on new accountability systems required by the Every Student Succeeds Act for the first time this year. The group’s researchers reviewed school report cards from all 50 states, D.C. and Puerto Rico, and found that while the report cards are easier to find and use, they're still not easy to understand.
— In response to the findings, the Council of Chief State School Officers said states have made “significant progress” in recent years to improve report cards and faulted the report for not capturing updates to report cards since January.
— “Unfortunately, the recent report from Data Quality Campaign does not accurately capture what is currently happening in states or the progress they have made,” the group said in a statement. “It misses any updates made to state report cards since January, and does not account for how each state has worked with stakeholders to define and display specific measures within state accountability and reporting systems. CCSSO will continue to support states to improve their report cards so they best serve students, parents and educators.”

Non-proliferation and International Stability - GOV.UK,www.gov.uk,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/non-proliferation-and-international-stability,"2 April 2019 (Transcript of the speech, exactly as it was delivered)
Thank you, Mr President.
As we embark on another review cycle for the Non-proliferation treaty, it is important that we as the Security Council, charged with the maintenance of international peace and security, take a step back and consider the contribution made by the NPT to international stability. For the past 50 years, the NPT has minimised the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and provided the framework for significant nuclear disarmament. To take the United Kingdom’s own example, we have more than halved the number of warheads since the height of the Cold War.
Of course, the NPT has not been about prohibition. It has also provided the framework to develop secure, safe, peaceful uses for nuclear energy globally. This ensures the international community can have confidence in the safety of civilian nuclear energy.
But where proliferation does occur, the NPT also provides the framework for this Council’s action to contain it. Under the JCPOA, Iran is subjected to a rigorous programme of inspections made possible by the architecture underpinning the NPT. While this Council continues to demand that North Korea dismantle its nuclear programme, the verification of that will ultimately need to be conducted consistent with the NPT.
As we approach another Review Conference, we should keep in mind that there is more that unites us than our differences, and that we all agree we should strengthen the NPT going forward. The United Kingdom is committed to working with all partners to securing a positive outcome to the Review Conferences. This this means resolving the Chairmanship, as well as agreeing an agenda for the RevCon in 2020, at the Third PrepCom.
Mr President, despite these challenges, it is important that we continue to demonstrate progress on disarmament in a way that strengthens all of our security. This is why the United Kingdom is working on developing disarmament verification solutions, particularly with the United States, Sweden and Norway in the Quad. Establishing an effective verification regime will be vital if we are to realise our long-term goal of multilateral nuclear disarmament. States will need to have confidence that a nuclear-armed state has dismantled its warheads and that, crucially, this is done in a way that makes us safer, rather than spreading nuclear knowledge.
This work has demonstrated that Non-Nuclear Weapon States can play an important role in the development of nuclear disarmament verification while preventing proliferation. We encourage all states to fully participate in this process to continue to grow capacity for verification worldwide – and very much welcome France and Germany’s joint verification exercise scheduled for later this year.
Mr President, we must all continue to promote the step-by-step approach, and work for universalisation of the Non-proliferation treaty; early entry into force of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; and promote the early commencement and conclusions of negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty in the Conference on Disarmament.
Let me set out some of the steps the United Kingdom is taking to help support a successful Review Conference outcome:
We will be submitting a draft Implementation Report to the PrepCom, setting out how we have implemented the NPT this review cycle, and we encourage all states to do the same.
We intend to use our coordinator role of the P5 process to continue the excellent work that has taken place under Chinese leadership, including continuing the P5’s dialogue with all signatories.
We will remain a strong supporter of the IAEA and all the work it does, including efforts related to Technical Cooperation. The UK has made significant extra-budgetary contributions to support the refurbishment of the Seibersdorf laboratories (including just over 1 million euros between 2016 and 2018)
We are pleased to have signed a new Voluntary Offer Agreement and Additional Protocol with the IAEA in June 2018 and the Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018 which enables the UK to establish a domestic nuclear safeguards regime.
We continue to regard the Additional Protocol as the gold standard of safeguards and urge those states who are yet to have done so to agree and ratify these agreements with the IAEA. We strongly support the State Level Concept.
Mr President, I would also note the echoing silence on compliance issues from some of the states which are most eager to promote the Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty, a treaty that lacks any concrete provisions for verifying compliance. The UK will not support, sign or ratify this treaty.
Mr President, We should not underestimate the challenges facing the Non-proliferation treaty – themselves an indication of the challenges facing international security. Any meaningful discussion on disarmament must take into account the wider security environment. We all have a responsibility to work towards a safer, more stable world, in which those states with nuclear weapons feel able to relinquish them, and this is where the United Nations Security Council must make its own contribution to the NPT. That must involve remaining resolute in our determination to fully disarm North Korea, and to prevent the escalation of conflicts. And we must give our full political support to the continuation of the NPT process and an agreed, consensus-based outcome to the upcoming review conference.
Thank you Mr President."
Freshman Democrats grill Lighthizer on USMCA,www.politico.com,politico.com,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2019/04/03/freshman-democrats-grill-lighthizer-on-usmca-420781,"With help from Adam Behsudi and Doug Palmer U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer seems to have backtracked on his willingness to address USMCA’s pharma provisions but is still ready to “cut a deal” on overall changes, according to freshman House Democrats.
— House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave her clearest indication yet that USMCA text must change to garner Democratic support, but others in the caucus differ on how to accomplish that.
— U.S. and Chinese officials are still pushing for a deal in meetings in Washington this week, but sticking points such as Trump’s tariffs and enforcement remain.
IT'S WEDNESDAY, APRIL 3! sure wouldn’t mind hopping on a flight by herself to Italy right about now. Got any interesting travel situations or midweek trade news to share? Let me know: srodriguez@politico.com or @sabrod123 .
Driving the Day FRESHMAN DEMOCRATS GRILL LIGHTHIZER ON USMCA: The U.S. trade chief on Tuesday walked freshman Democrats through the Trump administration’s view of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and some of them left the meeting unsatisfied with how he’s going to handle their concerns blocking them from backing the deal.
Tensions over pharma: Freshmen exiting the meeting all echoed that the issue of pharmaceuticals took up the biggest chunk of time. House Democrats have become increasingly vocal about concerns that intellectual property protections in USMCA would lock in high prescription drug prices and make it harder for lawmakers to deliver on their campaign promise to tackle high drug prices.
Rep. Susan Wild (Pa.) described the meeting as “contentious,” adding that Lighthizer was “steadfast” that there would be no changes to those provisions, saying it was “non-negotiable.” That marks a shift for Lighthizer, who in a meeting with the House Democratic caucus last month indicated that pharmaceuticals was a “legitimate issue” that could be addressed in the implementing legislation, according to an aide who was present.
“I don’t understand why it has to be put in since [Lighthizer] has admitted neither Mexico or Canada have requested it,” said Rep. Donna Shalala (Fla.).
Steel, aluminum concerns: Rep. Lizzie Fletcher (Texas) told Morning Trade that some of the most “impassioned statements and comments” came from lawmakers upset about the administration’s tariffs on steel and aluminum from Mexico and Canada.
“I’m not sure that there is a satisfactory answer that I’ve heard, that anybody’s heard, about a resolution on the tariffs,” she said.
Room for compromise? Fletcher expressed optimism that the administration is taking Democrats’ issues into consideration. “Overall, it was my sense that the ambassador certainly gave pretty candid responses and talked through, and kind of brainstormed” through lawmakers’ concerns and the administration’s rationale, Fletcher said.
Asked whether Lighthizer expressed flexibility to make changes to USMCA, Rep. Haley Stevens (Mich.) told Morning Trade: “He wants to cut a deal.”
PELOSI WANTS CHANGES TO USMCA TEXT: The speaker said Tuesday at a POLITICO Playbook event that any fixes to the new NAFTA’s enforcement language must be reflected in the text of the agreement, not the implementing legislation. She said the implementing bill “only bears on how we act. It doesn’t have to bear on how all three countries act.”
“There’s a compromise brewing on that,” said Rep. Bill Pascrell on whether the deal will be reopened to satisfy Democrats’ concerns or dealt with through implementing legislation. The New Jersey Democrat said any changes “must be in the major context of the bill, not put in some annex out in left field.” However, he shied away from saying that would involve a major renegotiation of the agreement.
“As I understand it, that would be my opinion, we don’t have to reinvent the wheel,” he said, adding that Canada and Mexico would have to agree. “We can’t have an agreement with ourselves.”
Rep. Ron Kind (Wis.) was a little less circumspect: “There are ways of accomplishing the same objectives without having to open up the entire agreement because things can get dicey pretty quickly if you start to open up and start to renegotiate. Then suddenly it becomes a free-for-all.”
But freshman Democrats see it differently: “Our view is that there is substantial precedent for reopening agreements when it’s helpful to passage in the Congress. We’ve done it before,” said Rep. Tom Malinowski (N.J.) following the meeting with Lighthizer. He referred to biologics as an issue that would have to be changed. “It should be possible to do that without reopening the whole thing. One way or another it has to be fixed.”
Canada says: Canadian envoy David MacNaughton told a gathering of New Democrat Coalition lawmakers on Tuesday that Ottawa’s official position is not to reopen any part of the deal. But he also told lawmakers that Canada wasn’t particularly happy with the biologics provisions, according to sources in the room.
Different ways to get there: There are other ways to make the changes Democrats want besides reopening USMCA, some congressional aides and trade experts told Morning Trade. One aide close to the process said all options are on the table, including side letters that would effectively amend the agreement. The real question is whether the administration will support the alterations.
BLUMENAUER’S MESSAGE TO NEW DEMS: House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee Chairman Earl Blumenauer dropped by a meeting of the New Democrat Coalition to talk about USMCA’s path to approval. He made clear that he was not interested in a deal that would only get 30 Democrats — a direct rebuke of his Rep. Vern Buchanan ’s (R-Fla.) view that the administration could get the agreement approved with only that many Democrats. He also said changes are necessary, particularly to its biologics provisions, according to sources in the room.
TRUMP WARNED NOT TO CLOSE BORDER: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Pelosi agreed Tuesday that closing the southern U.S. border to stop migrants from entering the U.S. was a bad idea that would backfire on the U.S. economy. But Trump reiterated he was prepared to carry out that threat if he believes Mexico is not doing enough to help with the problem and he can’t get a deal with Congress on immigration reform.
Top officials at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called the potential move “incredibly destructive,” while the Center for Automotive Research warned it would shut down the U.S. automotive industry within days. The Plastics Industry Association said even a temporary closure would put jobs at risk. “Global competitors would no doubt capitalize on the opportunity to convert our customers to more stable suppliers overseas,” the group said.
Over at the White House, top economic advisors Kevin Hassett and Larry Kudlow showered papers and data on Trump, hoping to convince him that economic growth could slow down even if he shut down the border for just one day. But the president seemed unswayed. ""We're going to have security in this country. That is more important than trade,"" Trump said. Nancy Cook and Andrew Restuccia have more .
U.S.-CHINA TALKS: NOW COMES THE HARD PART: U.S. and Chinese negotiators are unlikely to announce this week that they have reached a final deal. But depending on how much progress they make on two “tricky” issues involving the lifting of Trump’s tariffs and the enforcement of the pact, they could announce they have reached agreement on the broad contours of a deal and set a date for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet in late April, Myron Brilliant, executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told reporters on Tuesday.
China is unlikely to agree to the U.S. demand that it be able to unilaterally enforce the agreement unless Trump drops his tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, either all at once or in stages that Beijing is willing to accept, Brilliant said. Read more here .
USMCA CAMPAIGN HITS THE ROAD: A coalition of agriculture commodity groups, known as Farmers for Free Trade, is taking its campaign for USMCA passage on the road with a two-week trip from Pennsylvania to North Dakota in a 25-foot RV. The group has fought Trump’s tariffs, which have invited retaliation that has disproportionately hit American farmers. Still, they fully back efforts to ratify the deal his administration negotiated to replace NAFTA.
“This tour will provide an on-the-ground, up-close look at how American agriculture needs trade with Canada and Mexico to survive,” Angela Hofmann, co-founder of group, said in a statement.
The RV, emblazoned with facts and messages about agricultural trade with Mexico and Canada, will stop in Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota and North Dakota during April’s two-week congressional recess.
 The Trump administration looks to bypass Congress on trade with Japan, a former USTR official writes for POLITICO.

Navy vet flips red Trump suburb to win seat in Pennsylvania Senate,shareblue.com,Dan Desai Martin,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://shareblue.com/navy-veteran-flips-trump-district-pennsylvania/,"Home Local Navy vet flips red Trump suburb to win seat in Pennsylvania Senate Pam Iovino, Democratic state Senator-elect for the Pennsylvania 37th District. (Michael M. Santiago/Post-Gazette via AP) Navy vet flips red Trump suburb to win seat in Pennsylvania Senate By 1781
Republicans continue to lose ground in Pennsylvania.
Pam Iovino, a Democrat and a Navy veteran, won a special election in suburban Pennsylvania last night by flipping a district in an area Trump carried in 2016.
The race for a key state senate seat was fought in the suburbs of Pittsburgh and captured national attention as the ""most important race of the cycle thus far,"" according to PoliticsPA , a leading Pennsylvania political outlet.
D. Raja, a wealthy Republican businessman, conceded just after 9:30 p.m. last night, after unofficial results showed him losing by about 4 points. Raja even had help from the Trump family — Donald Trump Jr. recorded a robocall to rally support for him.
But in the end, Iovino prevailed, running on progressive issues like a $15 minimum wage and with support from local unions.
The loss for Republicans in Pennsylvania should begin to feel normal at this point.
In the 2018 midterms, Democrats gained three more seats in the House of Representatives, held on to a hotly contested U.S. Senate seat, and kept control of the governor's mansion.
Before the results came out, NBC News called the race ""the first major bellwether race since the 2018 midterms,"" and said a victory for Democrats would foreshadow trouble for Trump in 2020, who narrowly carried Pennsylvania in 2016.
Pennsylvania is used to playing the role of bellwether. In the spring of 2018, Rep. Conor Lamb (D-PA) won a special election for a U.S. House of Representatives seat deep in the heart of Trump country. At the time, Republicans tried to brush off the importance of the victory, while Democrats said it foreshadowed enthusiasm for that fall's midterm elections.
In the end, Republicans were wrong, as Democrats won historic victories across the country in November 2018 and regained control of the House for the first time in almost a decade.
Iovino's win may be a national bellwether, but it is also a key victory for Democrats in Pennsylvania. Her win cuts the advantage Republicans hold in the state senate to a slim 26-22 advantage. In 2020, half the the state's Senate seats will be up for grabs, and Democrats only need to flip three to gain control of the chamber.

— Turkey’s plan to buy a Russian air defense system will likely come up at NATO foreign minister meetings today and tomorrow.
— The Air Force has, once again, halted deliveries of Boeing KC-46 tankers due to debris found in the aircraft.
HAPPY WEDNESDAY , where we're dbrown@politico.com @dave_brown24
Budget LIFTING CAPS: House Democrats on Tuesday unveiled a proposal to raise caps on defense and non-defense spending, resulting in topline budgets of $733 billion in fiscal 2020 and $749 billion the following year for national defense, writes POLITICO’s Caitlin Emma.
Overseas Contingency Operations, which isn't subject to the caps, would be limited to $69 billion both years.
House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said he will support the bill, but that the funding levels could go lower.
""Personally, I think the defense budget can live with less,"" Smith told our colleague Connor O’Brien, adding, ""I'm not going to oppose $733 [billion].""
What’s next: The House Budget Committee will mark up the bill this afternoon.

FEARS OF A CLIFF: “A looming battle between President Donald Trump and Democrats over government spending and the debt limit could make the 35-day government shutdown look like a blip,” POLITICO’s Sarah Ferris reports .
Driving the Day NATO MEETINGS BEGIN: Today, NATO foreign ministers gather for meetings hosted by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Expect Turkey’s plan to buy a Russian missile system to come up, a senior State Department official told reporters in a preview of the meetings, per Reuters.
“The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to preview the meeting of NATO foreign ministers, said the gathering would discuss all elements of the military threat posed by Russia, including in the Black Sea, as well as the Afghan peace process and members’ budget contributions to the alliance.
“The official said the NATO allies would seek to agree on a package of measures to bolster NATO’s military presence in the Black Sea, which has become a flashpoint with Moscow over its seizure of Ukrainian ships last year.”
This morning at 11, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg addresses a joint session of Congress , at the invitation of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Major Leader Mitch McConnell .
Also today , Stoltenberg and Vice President Mike Pence speak at the day-long NATO Engages summit held by The Atlantic Council, the German Marshall Fund and the Munich Security Conference. The agenda is here .
TURKEY NOMINEE SPEAKS OUT: “The United States should deny the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter to Turkey if it gets the S-400 air defense system from Russia, the nominee to lead U.S. forces in Europe told Congress” Tuesday, writes O’Brien.
Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, who would also serve as NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander, testified a day after the Pentagon halted delivery of F-35 parts to Turkey due to its purchase of the Russian system.
Also Tuesday , Acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan said he is confident that Washington and Ankara could make a deal on Patriot missile systems as an alternative to the S-400, O’Brien reports .
""I expect them to be delivered,"" Shanahan said, according to a pool report. ""I am very confident in the Patriot proposal that we've delivered to Turkey, its availability, it's pricing, and very importantly, the industrial participation that comes along with the Patriot system.""
Washington’s offer to sell Patriots expired at the end of March, but a DoD official tells Al-Monitor “we have flexibility” on timing.
“Another official said Turkey would also have the opportunity to have an effective air defense system until the batteries are delivered in 2024, but did not elaborate on what the US would provide in the interim.”
Meanwhile, Turkey’s economy takes a hit, Reuters reports : “The lira dropped nearly 3 percent on Tuesday after the United States halted delivery of equipment related to a Turkish order of F-35 fighter planes, warning Ankara’s insistence on buying Russian defense systems risked triggering sanctions.”

— Florida's Republican senators want to remind acting Interior Secretary David Bernhardt they're serious about keeping their state's waters off limits to offshore drilling. The two senators declined to explicitly commit to supporting Bernhardt's nomination when asked by POLITICO.
— EPA Wheeler is back on the Hill today to defend the president's steep budget cuts for his agency.
WELCOME TO WEDNESDAY! EPA's Andrew Wheeler was the first to correctly name former President James Monroe, who garnered a whopping 99.6 percent of the vote in his 1820 reelection bid. For today: Who is the most recent House lawmaker to switch political parties? MARKING UP PARIS: The House E&C Committee today marks up legislation, H.R. 9 (116) , to block President Donald Trump's plan to withdraw the U.S. from the landmark Paris climate accord. Rep. Paul Tonko , chairman of the Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee, told reporters to expect ""some amendments."" Republican Rep. Bill Flores , for one, will introduce the Green New Deal as a substitute amendment .
Republicans are smarting over E&C Chairman Frank Pallone 's departure from regular order, since Democrats didn't hold hearings on the bill, nor did they consider it in subcommittee.
""I'm sure he's being forced to do something he would rather not do,"" Rep. John Shimkus , the subcommittee's ranking member, told reporters. ""He's a chairman, yeah, but he's not the speaker."" Democrats scoffed at the idea they were moving too quickly. ""We lost a decade, so the attempt here is to go at kind of an aggressive pace,"" Tonko said.
Happier talk: Both Tonko and Shimkus expressed an openness to work together on some of the smaller, incremental bills aimed at combating climate change on topics like energy efficiency, weatherization and grid modernization. ""John Shimkus is interested in doing some of that important stuff that's short-term, medium-term on the agenda. And Greg Walden expressed an interest. I'm encouraged by that,"" Tonko said. Shimkus also said Tonko's principles for climate change legislation were ""fine"" and ""I didn't say 'gag me.'""
Weighing in: Pallone said Tuesday during a separate hearing that the legislation wouldn't be the only bill to address the issue. ""I'd like to move legislation that will support state and local government efforts to address climate change and give members on both sides of the aisle an opportunity to help communities save money, create jobs and cut their greenhouse gas emissions,"" he said.
If you go: Today's markup begins at 9:30 a.m. in 2123 Rayburn, but expect to stick around — the climate legislation will be the last to come up during the lengthy markup, an aide told ME.
ALSO ON THE HILL ON TAP TODAY: Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz will officially unveil his ""Green Real Deal"" proposal this afternoon as a counter resolution to Democrats' Green New Deal. Catch up on the details from the draft proposal obtained by POLITICO here .
DRILLING IN: Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke told Florida's then-Gov. Rick Scott he'd take the state's coastal waters "" off the table "" from new drilling in early 2018. Now Scott's a senator, of course, and he and fellow Florida GOP Sen. Marco Rubio are keeping up the pressure for the same commitment from Bernhardt, Pro's Ben Lefebvre reports .
""I've been very clear to let the White House know where I stand,"" Scott told POLITICO. Asked whether he would support Bernhardt's nomination without assurances on the issue, he replied, ""I told them this is very important to me.""
Rubio also declined to say how he would vote on Bernhardt but said: ""I'm not talking about it until I meet with him first. I don't even know if that's his decision to make.""
IN HIS WHEELHOUSE: Wheeler is back on the Hill today. This time he'll face questions from Senate appropriators over the president's budget request that calls for a nearly one-third cut to EPA's funding for fiscal 2020. Interior-Environment subcommittee ranking member Tom Udall is expected to press Wheeler on the administration's ""devastating"" cuts to EPA, as well as Wheeler's own decision-making and statements on climate change.
""I'm tired of the now-commonplace responses from representatives of this administration in our budget hearings,"" Udall plans to say, according to excerpts from his opening statement shared with ME. ""We hear repeatedly, year after year, that they would be, 'Happy to work with Congress on final spending levels.' It's a wink and the nod that the budget request isn't really real. But that makes a mockery of our process.""
— He'll be back: The House E&C's Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee will hold its own hearing on EPA's budget with Wheeler on April 9.

MAIL CALL! House Natural Resources Chairman Raúl Grijalva and Oversight Subcommittee Chairman T.J. Cox sent a letter to appropriators Tuesday requesting a $2.5 million boost to Interior's Office of the Inspector General in light of a ""growing need to address oversight.""
GOING NUCLEAR: Rubio and Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez are concerned over the Trump administration's approval of six so-called Part 810 authorizations for U.S. nuclear companies to work in Saudi Arabia, Pro's Zack Colman reports . In a letter to Energy Secretary Rick Perry, the senators said they have ""deep concerns"" about the authorizations for U.S. firms to export civil nuclear technology and services to Saudi Arabia. They request Perry hand over ""specific contents"" of the approvals, including company names and what it allows them to do.
AND THE WATERS CALM: The path forward for the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan got significantly smoother Tuesday evening when the river's largest user signaled it won't oppose authorizing legislation introduced in both houses of Congress with broad bipartisan support. The Imperial Irrigation District has refused to sign onto the deal without $200 million in federal funding to deal with the Salton Sea's environmental problems. But in a statement Board President Erik Ortega said ""Congress stood with the Salton Sea"" by altering the bill to maintain federal environmental protections and that the district ""remains committed to the DCP process.""
THIRD TIME'S A CHARM? Barry Myers' nomination for NOAA's top job is before the Senate Commerce Committee again today as the panel marks up a spate of nominees. Trump first nominated Myers in October 2017, re-nominating him twice more since then.
The former CEO of AccuWeather has faced objections due to concerns that he'd limit the kinds of products that the National Weather Service offers to the public, and following reports his company paid a $290,000 settlement related to sexual harassment.
AROUND THE AGENCIES DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING: Trump spoke last night at a National Republican Congressional Committee dinner, where he criticized windmills, falsely claiming that ""they say the noise causes cancer."" Watch .
EXXON WINS OUT ON CLIMATE DISCLOSURE: The SEC granted Exxon Mobil permission Tuesday to block a petition seeking a vote by shareholders on new climate change disclosures at the company, Pro's Patrick Temple-West reports . The SEC said the proposal from the New York State Common Retirement Fund and the Church of England would ""micromanage the company by seeking to impose specific methods for implementing complex policies in place of the ongoing judgments of management as overseen by its board of directors.""
5th CIRCUIT KEEPS FROG CASE HOPPING BACK TO TRIAL COURT: The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday snubbed the Fish and Wildlife Service in the ongoing challenge to the critical habitat designation for the dusky gopher frog, currently back in that court after a Supreme Court reversal.
FWS last week asked the appellate court to remand the designation for reconsideration while keeping it in place for now. But a three-judge panel on the 5th Circuit on Tuesday said it would punt the matter down to the federal judge in Louisiana who initially handled the case for further proceedings. However, the panel left the door open to that lower court judge remanding the habitat designation back to FWS.
IG REVIEWING BERNHARDT PROBE REQUEST: Interior's deputy IG is reviewing a request from watchdog group Campaign for Accountability for an investigation into Bernhardt and his relationship with his former lobbying client, Westlands Water District, according to a letter released by CfA Tuesday.

Opening of an Israeli embassy in Rwanda reflects deepening ties and cooperation between the two countries,ejpress.org,Yossi Lempkowicz,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://ejpress.org/opening-of-an-israeli-embassy-in-rwanda-reflects-deepening-ties-and-cooperation-between-the-two-countries/," Opening of an Israeli embassy in Rwanda reflects deepening ties and cooperation between the two countries Others Opening of an Israeli embassy in Rwanda reflects deepening ties and cooperation between the two countries By Yossi Lempkowicz April 3, The inauguration of the Israeli embassy in Kigali, brings the total number of Israeli embassies in Sub-Saharan Africa to twelve. KIGALI—Israel has opened an embassy in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, an opening which reflects the unprecedented cooperation and ties between the two countries.
While Israel and Rwanda re-established diplomatic ties in 1994, the inauguration of the embassy marks the first time that Israel will maintain a resident ambassador in Kigali.
Since 1994, Israeli-Rwandan relations have grown in nearly every field, from agriculture, to public health to tourism.
Israel and Rwanda share many similarities and goals. Both countries have thrived in the face of adversity, rebuilding in the aftermath of tragedy.
In recent years, there has been an increase in high-level state visits between the two countries. In 2016, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Rwanda and in 2017, Rwandan President Paul Kagame visited Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Kagame also met in Nairobi in November of 2017.
“The cooperation between our countries is thriving in many fields, including technology, agriculture, energy and security. We appreciate what Israel has to offer us in these areas and in other areas, and we are very happy to work with you.”- said President Kageme in 2017.
On Monday, Israel’s Ambassador to Rwanda, Ron Adam and the head of MASHAV , – Israel’s Agency for International Development Cooperation, Gil Haskel, inaugurated the Rwanda-Israel Horticulture Center of Excellence in Kigali. The Center of Excellence which is a joint project of MASHAV and the Rwandan Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources, will train local farmers in Israeli agro-technologies and methods. The center is the first of its kind in Africa.
Since 1994, more than 500 Rwandans have participated in MASHAV agricultural courses.
In the coming months, Rwanda’s National air carrier, Rwandan Air will launch direct flights between Tel Aviv and Kigali, increasing business and tourism ties between the two countries.
This milestone will not only bridge between the Israeli and Rwandan people, but will connect Israel to the larger African continent and help further strengthen ties between Israel and other African nations, the Israeli foreign ministry said.
The inauguration of the Israeli embassy in Kigali, brings the total number of Israeli embassies in Sub-Saharan Africa to twelve.
Israel’s relationship with the African continent began in the years following Israel’s independence. When many African countries including Rwanda established independence in the early 1960s, Israel which was a young country at the time, viewed these countries as partners and was eager to share its experiences in development and capacity building.
More than six decades later, ties between Israel and the African continent continue to reach new heights. Since 2016, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has traveled to Africa four times and Israel has established official diplomatic relations with Chad and Guinea (Conakry). In addition, four African countries, Rwanda, Zambia, Tanzania and South Sudan have inaugurated embassies in Israel in recent years.

Don’t forget to follow us @MorningTech . SENATORS BULLISH ON ROBOCALL BILL — The two senators behind a widely backed bill to curtail unwanted robocalls expect the measure to clear the full chamber after facing a markup before the Senate Commerce Committee today. The TRACED Act , co-sponsored by Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.), would allow the FCC to impose penalties of up to $10,000 per robocall and extend the period the agency can take enforcement action to three years after a call is made. “We think there is a real deterrent if you have the threat of criminal prosecution,” Thune told Fox News on Tuesday . Spokespeople for both Thune and Markey said they are optimistic about the markup and any future floor vote.
— Gone without a TRACED: Markey and consumer protection advocates will rally in favor of the measure at a Consumer Reports event on Capitol Hill this afternoon. “This onslaught of robocalls has rattled consumers’ confidence in their mobile devices,” Markey is expected to say, according to prepared remarks shared with MT. “Robocalls are a menace.” As of late Tuesday, the bill had 22 co-sponsors , including Senate Commerce Chairman Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) and consumer protection subcommittee Chair Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and ranking member Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).
ALSO: NET NEUTRALITY FACES COMMITTEE VOTE — Democrats’ Save the Internet Act, H.R. 1644 , which would revive Obama-era net neutrality rules, is up for a House Energy and Commerce Committee vote this morning ahead of a likely House floor vote next week. As John reports this morning , the caucus seems to be coalescing under pressure from leadership, with everyone from more senior holdouts to junior progressives on board (41 of the 59 freshman Democrats are signed onto the bill so far, out of 181 total co-sponsors). “It’s probably a generational thing,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), one such freshman lawmaker, told POLITICO.
— Who’s not on board so far: any Republicans , who side with broadband providers concerned about heavy government regulation. Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), ranking member on E&C, said to expect three GOP counterproposals filed as amendments and “probably some others” this morning. “This doesn’t have the feel of being a very bipartisan effort,” Walden told John on Tuesday, predicting the partisan nature may hurt the measure’s overall prospects.
— One sliver of bipartisanship? Key lawmakers were negotiating Tuesday on whether they could agree to a bipartisan amendment exempting small broadband providers from the net neutrality rules’ transparency reporting requirements. In previous deals, lawmakers set an exemption for ISPs with fewer than 250,000 subscribers, but now Democrats ""want to drop the [subscriber] numbers dramatically"" for those exempted ISPs, Walden lamented. Telecom subcommittee chair Mike Doyle (D-Pa.) confirmed negotiations Tuesday on possible bipartisan accord: “We’re talking to see if that’s possible.”
FIRST IN MT: TALK 230 TO ME — E-commerce trade group NetChoice is ramping up its defense of a law that shields companies like Google and Facebook from lawsuits over content on their platforms. The new initiative, called Protect Online Voices, is part of the right-leaning association’s effort to challenge critics who argue tech firms no longer deserve the broad immunity afforded by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The campaign has debuted as a website with information about the law and statements from advocacy groups and lawmakers who back Section 230, including Democrats Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.) and Rep. Ro Khanna (Calif). It will supplement lobbying that NetChoice and other groups already have underway on the Hill.
— The internet industry is hustling to defend Section 230 after Congress passed a law last year making websites liable for facilitating sex trafficking. Both Democrats and Republicans have flirted with additional changes to the law to, for instance, make internet companies more accountable for online opioid sales or restrict them from censoring political speech. Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel at NetChoice, argues that the law is what empowers companies to remove problematic material in the first place. “Before we consider doing anything to undermine that, I think it’s important for people to know what it is,” he said.
PAI, J-RO ON DECK BEFORE HOUSE APPROPRIATORS — Tune in at 1:30 p.m. for the FCC’s fiscal year 2020 budget hearing before the House Appropriations Financial Services Subcommittee. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai will testify about the agency’s airwaves and broadband efforts, while Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel is ready with harsher words : “So many people think that Washington is rigged against them. It saddens me that with this budget and with the actions of the FCC during the past two years—it appears they are right.”
KENNEDY SIDES WITH UTILITIES ON AIRWAVES FIGHT — Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.), who chairs the appropriations subcommittee determining FCC funding, wrote to Pai this week to complain about the agency’s proceeding aimed at determining whether the 6 GHz band of wireless spectrum can be shared. Kennedy is “concerned” the FCC notice “does not adequately balance the public interest in protecting” utilities, he told Pai.
— And will Kennedy summon Pai for a budget review hearing? “We’re going to probably have a hearing, but I haven’t made a decision,” Kennedy told John on Tuesday.
YOU NEVER GIVE ME YOUR MONEY — The Semiconductor Industry Association today is unveiling a set of policy recommendations it says will help the U.S. stay ahead in the global chip market and make strides with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, quantum computing and 5G. The blueprint asks for billions in federal funding to further innovative scientific research, nurture the workforce through STEM education and promote free trade and open markets overseas. “Underlying all these transformative technologies are semiconductors,” the group’s president and CEO, John Neuffer, told MT. “We’ve been in the lead for the last 50 years, and we want to make sure for the next 50 years we’re also in the lead.""
— Dozens of representatives from the group’s member companies will meet to discuss the policy outline today with lawmakers including Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho). The push comes amid growing concern about technological competition abroad, particularly from China, and heightened focus on the U.S. maintaining its place as the frontrunner. “While the rest of the world is ramping up its public investments in basic research, in the United States, it’s going the other direction; it’s been stumbling along, flat or negative for the last couple of decades,” Neuffer said.

"UN General Assembly adopts measure condemning anti-Semitism, Islamophobia",ejpress.org,Yossi Lempkowicz,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://ejpress.org/un-general-assembly-adopts-measure-condemning-anti-semitism-islamophobia/," UN General Assembly adopts measure condemning anti-Semitism, Islamophobia Others UN General Assembly adopts measure condemning anti-Semitism, Islamophobia By Yossi Lempkowicz April 3, The original version of the resolution only referred to Islamophobia; anti-Semitism was added after efforts by Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon. By JNS
The U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution on Tuesday condemning anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.
The resolution, which was adopted in a consensus vote, comes in the wake of the attack on two New Zealand mosques on March 15.
According to Israeli Mission to the United Nations, the original version of the resolution only referred to Islamophobia. But after efforts by Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon, with the support of many U.N. member states, a proposal was amended to include condemnation of anti-Semitism.
Danon said that “the memory of history seems to be fading with time, but our diplomatic efforts have shown that we will not allow the international community to remain silent while a wave of anti-Semitism spreads throughout the world.”
He continued, saying “this is an Israeli achievement at the U.N. and a crushing loss to the forces of hatred.”
However, “it is very unfortunate that we had to fight to include anti-Semitism in the draft resolution. I remind the world that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination in their land and being anti-Israel is no different from anti-Semitism. The time has come for the world to act uncompromisingly against hatred and anti-Semitism, and to ignore those, both inside and outside the United Nations, seek to undermine these efforts,” he said.

— The endless fight over Obamacare has obscured the major health care problem that worries Americans the most: the costs.
— A Pelosi aide says Democrats aren’t negotiating drug pricing bills with the White House , but instead working on their own package.

Disaster Relief in an Era of Extreme Weather: Join POLITICO on Wednesday, April 24, for a high-level conversation on how extreme weather is prompting a renewed look at disaster relief and response in Washington and in affected communities.
Driving the Day HOUSE COMMITTEE COMES TOGETHER ON DRUG PRICES — The full Energy and Commerce committee convenes this morning to mark up bills aimed at curbing high drug costs and strengthening the Affordable Care Act. Even though the health subcommittee sparred over the drug legislation recently, a Republican committee staffer tells PULSE that all six of the drug bills are likely to pass after bipartisan talks.
The drug legislation notably includes measures banning pay-for-delay agreements between branded and generic drugmakers, H.R. 1499 (116), and limiting branded manufacturers’ ability to withhold drug samples to generic makers, H.R. 965 (116) .
— But the ACA bills are up for a fight. The other pack of Democrat-led legislation — which ranges from restoring funding for Obamacare outreach to reversing Trump administration efforts to expand skimpier short-term plans — likely won't get GOP support today.
SENATE GOP FORCED TRUMP REVERSAL ON OBAMACARE REPEAL — President Donald Trump retreated this week from a push to introduce an Obamacare alternative before 2020 after an aggressive lobbying effort by Senate Republicans, who warned in a series of phone calls the effort could sink the party in the election, POLITICO's Eliana Johnson and Burgess Everett report .
Republicans seemed relieved that they were no longer expected to scramble on a plan that would never get a vote in a Democratic House and again expose their divisions over health care. ""That’s the only realistic way to move forward,"" Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri told POLITICO's Alice Miranda Ollstein.
— But Democrats don’t plan to let Republicans off that easy. The House will vote today on a resolution condemning Trump's decision last week to fully support a lawsuit that would entirely invalidate the ACA. The vote could put pressure a handful of swing district Republicans. At least one, moderate Rep. Tom Reed of New York, plans to vote with Democrats, his office tells Adam Cancryn.

HEALTH COSTS Obamacare fight obscures America’s real health care crisis — The ongoing debate has centered so far on partisan battles to protect patients with pre-existing conditions and lower insurance premiums — largely ignoring the elephant in the room, medical costs that have decimated family budgets nationwide and turned U.S. health care into a $3.7 trillion behemoth, writes Joanne Kenen.
Democrats want to improve Obamacare with more subsidies that shift costs to the taxpayer while Republicans are creating lower-cost alternatives that could push costs to older and sicker people. And yet neither approach gets at the underlying problem – reducing costs for both ordinary people and the health care burden on the overall U.S. economy.
There's been some bipartisan movement on drug costs and surprise medical bills. Those two issues have been ""a way the public glimpses true health care costs,” said Melinda Buntin of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. “But it has people focused only on that part of the solution.” Read more here.
IN CONGRESS Top Pelosi aide insists: No drug negotiations with White House — A top aide to Speaker Nancy Pelosi told progressive Democrats Tuesday that party leadership is not negotiating with the White House on drug pricing — just keeping the administration apprised of their work, reports Adam Cancryn.
Rep. Pramila Jayapal said Wendell Primus, Pelosi’s senior health policy adviser, ""was very clear"" in the meeting that top Democrats are working on a proposal to present to their own party — not the White House.
— Progressive Caucus members urged Primus to craft a bold drug pricing proposal along the lines of legislation authored by Rep. Lloyd Doggett , which would allow direct Medicare negotiation and empower the government to break a company’s monopoly on a drug if it refuses to negotiate. But Jayapal said she’s unsure whether leadership is on board.
— Progressives also confronted Primus on Medicare for All, a day after POLITICO reported he called the effort an unhelpful distraction during a November closed-door meeting with health policy groups. Some left that meeting with the impression he wanted them to raise public concerns about the single-payer plan's risks and downsides.
""I made it clear that I was not happy,” said Jayapal, author of the single-payer legislation. “I think it’s really inappropriate for staff representing the Speaker’s office to be undercutting members of our caucus.”
During the meeting, Primus told progressive members that his remarks were mischaracterized, and that Medicare for All was just a small part of his November discussion with health policy groups, according to Jayapal. More here .
EYE ON FDA Scott Gottlieb makes his final Hill appearance — The departing FDA commissioner testifies one last time before the House Appropriations health subcommittee to discuss the FDA’s fiscal 2020 budget — one of few health agencies that got a proposed boost in the White House’s plan.
Gottlieb told POLITICO last week that he expects to discuss e-cigarettes this morning. Since lawmakers pressed him on the issue in a February hearing, FDA has launched long-awaited draft guidance to restrict flavored vapors, and the White House proposed a $100 million user fee from the e-cigarette industry.
— He’s also likely to talk opioids, including the FDA’s plans to encourage new addiction therapies and tamp down on illegal sales, according to a prepared statement . In an earlier hearing with Senate appropriators, he pushed Congress to give FDA the authority to change its opioid approval standards in the wake of the agency's decision to greenlight Dsuvia, the super-potent fentanyl pill, a move its expert adviser and health advocates publicly criticized.
MEDICAID Senate approves Medicaid funding extensions — The Senate passed by voice vote a package extending funding to continue a Medicaid demonstration for behavioral health clinics and certain Medicaid programs, some of which saw funding lapse at the end of March . It also adds civil monetary penalties against drugmakers who knowingly misclassify treatments in the Medicaid drug rebate program.
THE STATE OF MARIJUANA Democrats race to embrace legal weed — Nearly every Democrat in the sprawling 2020 presidential field has embraced marijuana legalization – and not just for medicinal purposes. The near-universal backing is a stark contrast to recent presidential campaigns, when legalization was a fringe issue that seldom surfaced on the trail or during debates.
The change is driven by the rapid spread of legal cannabis markets , reports Paul Demko. Ten states and the District of Columbia have full legalization, and another 23 states permit medicinal uses with permission from a doctor. Sales topped $8 billion last year and could hit $80 billion by 2030, according to Cowen Equity Research.
“We're very fortunate to have a number of candidates not only be right on the issue, but to be aggressively putting the issue front and center,” said Justin Strekal, policy director for NORML, the pro-marijuana advocacy group, which gives an “A” rating to more than half of the Democratic presidential field. “The sky does not fall when marijuana is legalized for adult consumption.” More here .
AROUND THE NATION Texas Senate approves Religious Freedom Bill — The legislation, TX SB17 (19R), prohibits state licensing agencies, including those that oversee health care providers, from limiting the ability of professionals to deny services based on their religious beliefs. An amendment passed Tuesday that would exempt first responders from the bill.
But critics still say that the bill would create confusion and potentially conflict with other federal legislation prohibiting discrimination. During Tuesday’s floor debate, senators didn't get clear answers to their questions about whether it would allow doctors to refuse to treat the ingrown toenail of a gay patient and allow pharmacists to refuse to dispense birth control.

Another sizzling day for news. Here’s what to keep track of:
— VA faces scrutiny over IT: Congress is getting frustrated by continuing IT mishaps at the Department of Veterans Affairs, with lawmakers pressing department tech officials on the agency’s plans.
— FDA mulling new tech: FDA unveiled some new ideas on artificial intelligence and discussing how to crack down on online opioids sales.
— New push on Part 2 overhaul: A bipartisan, bicameral group of legislators are offering a new legislative overhaul of 42 CFR Part 2, a federal statute governing the confidentiality of substance use treatment records.
But first, the jump.
eHealth tweet of the day: Stephanie Springer @stephaniekays [reacting to this NYT article on the business practices of direct-to-consumer telemedicine companies that provide drugs] “‘people self-diagnose and select the drug they want, then enter some personal health and credit card information.’ What could go wrong?”
WEDNESDAY: Your correspondent’s curiosity has been piqued by all the stories on these direct-to-consumer startups connecting patients to certain prescriptions (e.g. ED drugs), sometimes on an off-label basis.

Driving the Day VA FACES SCRUTINY OVER IT — The Department of Veterans Affairs’ tech operations got a thorough turn under the congressional eye Tuesday, with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle scrutinizing the department during a hearing of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.
Committee members are frustrated by the slow pace of government activity to set up an joint Defense-VA project office to hash out differences over the two agencies’ respective EHR implementations. Legislators are circulating a draft bill to clarify how the two departments settle their differences, Jim Banks (R-Ind.) said during the hearing.
The GAO says the EHR project is “already facing serious challenges” due to unclear accountability. ""If they can't agree on how to adjudicate differences, they are going to fail a fourth time at integrating their systems,"" a GAO official testified.
Meanwhile, a digital decision tool meant to assist clinicians in determining whether veterans are eligible to get community care won’t be ready by the program's June 6 launch date. An agency official said the tool was not essential for implementing the community care program.
The hearing got off to an discordant start when the committee’s members noted, to their displeasure, that the department didn't send CIO James Gferer or a deputy.
INSIDE THE HUMPHREY BUILDING FDA MULLING NEW TECH — Elsewhere, FDA is rolling out some new tech initiatives.
— New AI white paper: The agency is trying to figure out how to regulate artificial intelligence in medicine. In a new white paper Tuesday, the agency notes that advanced AI might be able to update itself in the future.
While it’s a potentially powerful approach — the agency contemplates software that gradually trains itself to better spot cancerous skin lesions — it’s also a tricky one. Traditionally the agency approves a product and substantial revisions require additional clearance. Software updating itself poses a tricky problem, and the agency is soliciting views about how it should scrutinize such products. (One possibility: The agency is thinking about requiring a “predetermined change control plans,” which specifies how the product might evolve over time.)
Initial reaction was positive, with most industry sources professing they were happy the agency was beginning the process. ACT | The App Association communications director Ashley Durkin-Rixey said the organization was encouraged by the agency’s announcement and was happy the institution name-checked some of its other initiatives, like the software pre-certification pilot.
Not everyone was wholly pleased. Epstein Becker Green lawyer Bradley Merrill Thompson generally agreed it was positive that the agency was considering the subject at all. But he worried that the agency was “becoming really good at coming up with ideas and not so good about carrying through with them.”
In particular. he flagged inconsistencies — whether the process would require draft guidance or new legislative authority — in the agency’s materials that suggested its strategy wasn’t entirely clear.

— What about social media drug sales? Meanwhile, the agency held a summit focused on online opioid sales Tuesday. While the event was closed to the public, we did hear from one speaker trawling social media to learn about the methods some entrepreneurial sorts use to push illegal opioids.
University of California-San Diego researcher Timothy Mackey used machine learning to flag the sites illegally selling opioids, based on the text displayed in public social media posts. His team built an algorithm that could separate those posts out from a million or so other tweets or Instagram posts; occasionally they shared the “online pharmacy” sites they identified with the FDA and DEA.
Mackey said he’s noticed posts advertising illicit drugs are becoming less overt as social media platforms remove them. Sellers now rarely publish their own posts, but they reach potential customer instead by posting coded phrases like “xanax angel” in the comments, he added.
His team also uses machine learning analysis on public posts describing drug use. He said helps them understand what substances people are using, if they find them too expensive, or if they’re combining them with other substances.
NEW PUSH ON PART 2 OVERHAUL — A bipartisan, bicameral group of legislators is going to try again on a 42 CFR Part 2 overhaul. In a bill introduced Tuesday, lawmakers outline their plan to modify the federal statute requiring explicit patient consent to share substance use treatment records.
For treatment, payment, and operations purposes, patient data would be covered by HIPAA standards, but the bill would bar use of the records in civil or criminal proceedings, among other requirements.
While the bill has a long list of co-sponsoring legislators — including Reps. Earl Blumenauer and Markwayne Mullin in the House, and Joe Manchin and Shelley Moore Capito in the Senate – it’s unclear whether it’ll surmount the obstacles that have blocked previous versions of the bill. Last year, the bill was blocked by concerns from Senate HELP Committee ranking member Patty Murray .
But the obstacles may be steeper now. The House flipped in 2018, which brought Rep. Frank Pallone to the top of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Pallone opposed the bill in its previous incarnation.
Joel White, the executive director of the Opioid Safety Alliance, praised the bill for its potential to let data flow more freely to providers who might need it in making treatment and prescription decisions.

$100M MORE WOULD MULTIPLY FTC PRIVACY STAFFERS ALMOST TENFOLD — Federal Trade Commission chairman Joe Simons told lawmakers the agency could hire between 160 and 360 new privacy and security staffers — that is, if given an extra $50 million to 100 million in annual funding, our POLITICO colleague Cristiano Lima reports.
Simons noted this in a response letter to House Energy and Commerce chairman Frank Pallone and consumer protection subcommittee chairwoman Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.); the FTC currently has about 40 staffers dedicated to privacy and security. The pair had previously asked the agency to discuss how such a funding boost would change the agency’s work.
HHS INSPECTOR GENERAL DEPARTING — Daniel Levinson will be leaving the agency on May 31, a spokesperson told us Tuesday. The Office of Inspector General will have enforcement responsibility for information blocking violations.
The office will be led on an acting basis by Joanne Chiedi, the agency’s principal deputy inspector general.
MOVEMENT ON SDOH IDENTIFIERS — UnitedHealthcare and the American Medical Association are attempting to standardize how data about the so-called “social determinants of health” are collected and processed, the two announced Tuesday.
The two groups are advocating for the establishment of ICD-10 codes related to social determinants that could trigger referrals to social or public services. Those codes are used for recording diagnoses and other patient data.

“Both the White House’s Kevin Hassett and Larry Kudlow have shared economic papers and data with Trump over the last 36 hours, illustrating the way economic growth could slow down even if the president shut down the border for just one day — not to mention the effect on the flow of goods, raw materials, and the U.S. supply chain.”
Inside the White House — Officials frantically spent the day Tuesday “searching for ways to limit the economic impact of shutting the border, according to two senior administration officials and one Republican close to the White House. One possibility involved closing the border to cars but allowing commercial trucks to continue to pass through. Officials stressed, however, that no final decisions had yet been made.”
Trump not swayed — Trump did not seem swayed by his advisers’ economic arguments: “Sure, it will have a negative effect on the economy,” Trump told reporters … “But to me, trading is very important, the borders are very important, but security is what is most important. I mean, we have to have security.”
Inside Biden-world — Per a source close to former vice president Joe Biden’s inner circle: “Joe told them yesterday to put out the word that it’s full steam ahead and yes, they expected this and expect more to come … They thought they were ready but know now that they were not. They are a bit overwhelmed but very clear headed and self aware.”

QUICK FIX Story Continued Below
— The House Ways and Means Committee cleared both its IRS overhaul and retirement security measure on Tuesday. Now what?
— Tax extenders might not have been a part of that markup, but Democratic tax writers are still putting in a lot of work on the expired tax breaks.
— Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, is going to bat for a yearly tax of investment income.
WELCOME TO WEDNESDAY, where we’ve decided to imitate the Bryce Harper bat flip whenever we knock a morning newsletter out of the park.
How about a little spiking of the football: Today marks 46 years since a Motorola engineer named Marty Cooper made what is basically acknowledged as the first cell phone call — to a Bell Laboratories engineer named Joel Engel, a rival trying to make the same breakthrough.
Please send your tips, feedback or even corrections here, though you don’t have to rub it in.

Driving the Day GOT SOME BILLS THROUGH: Both the IRS and retirement measures advanced Ways and Means by voice vote — fitting given that the basic thrust of those bills has a history of bipartisan support.
So with the markup done, how quickly could the proposals get voted on by the full House? When the IRS bill was released, supporters speculated that it could be teed up for a floor vote timed for Tax Day. As it happens, the House is scheduled to be in Washington next week, and then out of town the following two weeks — leading supporters to suggest a vote could be in the offing as soon as Monday.
Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal (D-Mass.) told reporters after Tuesday’s markup that he would talk with Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) about getting the bills on the floor schedule. A senior Democratic aide would only tell Morning Tax that the measures haven’t been scheduled for floor consideration yet.
For whatever it’s worth: The retirement savings measure might have passed by voice vote, but there was definitely some grumbling from GOP tax writers about certain provisions. The Heritage Foundation also released a primer calling the bill a mixed bag, saying it hiked taxes on middle-class savers but also expanded the ways in which people could sock away money for retirement.
SEMI-REGULAR EXTENDERS UPDATE: Ways and Means Democrats huddled Tuesday afternoon to discuss what to do with the expired batch of tax breaks, but it seems they fell well short of a breakthrough. “Same song, second verse,” Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) told Aaron after the meeting.
And while Democratic tax writers were pretty tight-lipped coming out of the meeting, their issues in finding a path forward for extenders haven’t really changed — concerns about restoring the tax breaks yet again without offsets, and that the collection of incentives favor businesses and the rich more than the lower rungs of the income ladder. (This is one of the reasons for the chatter about tacking refundable tax credit expansions to an extenders package.)
TAKING ON THE WEALTHY, FROM ANOTHER ANGLE: This isn’t the first time Wyden has called for a mark-to-market approach to taxing capital gains — though his last effort, back in 2017, was focused more narrowly on derivatives.
Wyden still has to release lots more details about his new proposal — a white paper is forthcoming — but this version definitely seems to be bigger and broader. His spokeswoman said on Twitter that the plan would be aimed at the top 0.1 percent, and told Morning Tax that the plan would have exemptions for personal residences and retirement accounts while applying broadly to other tradeable and nontradeable assets. As your Morning Tax author noted, Wyden’s proposal is just the latest in a slew of Democratic tax plans aimed at the wealthy — and it’s fair to say his mark-to-market approach would have its share of administrative challenges, an issue that experts say also faces Sen. Elizabeth Warren ’s wealth tax.
LET’S GET TOGETHER: A group of Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee is banding together to do something about one of their least favorite parts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 1 (115) — the $10,000 cap on deductions for state and local taxes, as Pro Tax’s Aaron Lorenzo reported.
The working group’s first meeting is today, as members game out ways to ease the sting of the SALT cap, up to and including full repeal. And there’s considerable interest among House Democratic tax writers, about a dozen of whom are expected to attend today’s meeting. (Though also recall: There are plenty of Republicans who are fans of the SALT limits, and not a lot of GOP lawmakers anymore representing areas hurt by the cap.)
For whatever it’s worth: Tax March and Americans for Tax Fairness are out with new polling that finds that around three in four likely voters support higher taxes on the rich.
TALKING WAGES, CONT’D: A spokeswoman for the White House Council of Economic Advisers took issue with Morning Tax for reporting that government data last year had showed that inflation was all but erasing wage growth — noting that the Bureau of Economic Analysis found that inflation-adjusted wages grew by 1.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018. (Data on worker wages this year has been pretty good , too, though there’s still some debate about just how good.)
INTERNATIONAL UPDATE GONNA PUT YOU TO WORK IF YOU’RE STILL HERE: The European Commission ordered the United Kingdom on Tuesday to claw back revenues lost because London offered illegal tax incentives to multinational corporations, The Financial Times reports. The timing aspect: The U.K. is currently slated to leave the European Union without an exit deal on April 12, though the other 27 members can offer an extension that would push Brexit back. The British government would have to comply with the Brussels ruling that the country’s tax policies offered illegal state aid unless there actually is a no-deal Brexit.
The British tax scheme in question was meant to keep controlled foreign corporations from engaging in offshore shenanigans, but Brussels found that it gave an unfair advantage to certain companies. It’s unclear how much in taxes the U.K. will need to seek from companies, but it could amount to hundreds of millions of pounds.
STATE NEWS DIME A GALLON: Mike DeWine, Ohio’s GOP governor, is getting a gas tax increase , Cincinnati.com reports — just not as big as what he originally wanted. Ohio lawmakers passed a measure that would increase the gas tax by 10.5 cents per gallon, well short of the 18 cents per gallon initially requested by DeWine. The governor is expected to sign the two-year transportation bill today — and, once the gas tax hike goes into effect in July, the state will have the 10th-highest rate in the country, according to the Tax Foundation.

Almost 37 years after Sgt. Zachary Baumel went missing in action during the Battle of Sultan Yacoub in the 1982 Lebanon War, his body has been returned to Israel for burial.Baumel’s remains were repatriated via a third country several days ago aboard an El Al flight, following an operation by Israeli intelligence agencies. He was identified by his DNA at the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute, as well as by Chief IDF Rabbi Brig.-Gen. Eyal Karim, IDF Spokesman Brig.-Gen. Ronen Manelis said on Wednesday.The head of the Manpower Directorate, Maj.-Gen. Moti Almoz, personally informed the Baumel family that their son’s remains had been identified. His body was handed over to family members on Wednesday afternoon. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu thanked Israel’s intelligence community for its “tremendous efforts” in bringing Baumel back to Israel and said that the military also recovered his tzitzit (religious fringed garment) along with his tank jumpsuit.“He was a very devoted Zionist – this Zionism led him into the battle in which he fell,” Netanyahu said during a press conference. “He was considered missing for 37 years. For all those years, the State of Israel invested immense resources to resolve the riddle of his fate.”Recalling his interactions with Baumel’s father, Netanyahu said that “many times, Yona told me in tears that he had one prayer – to find Zachary before he passes away.”Yona Baumel passed away in 2009 at the age of 81, without ever learning the fate of his son.“From here in Jerusalem, we say, ‘May his memory be a blessing forever,’” Netanyahu concluded.The Battle of Sultan Yacoub between the IDF and the Syrian army took place on the sixth day of the First Lebanon War in June 1982 in the Bekaa Valley.At the end of the battle, the battalion and additional forces had suffered 20 dead and more than 30 wounded, and six soldiers were missing. Eight IDF tanks also fell into Syrian hands, two of which had three missing IDF soldiers who had been involved in two separate incidents about three kilometers apart: Sgt. Yehuda Katz, a gunner in one tank crew, and Baumel and Sgt. Zvi Feldman in another tank.The fates of the other three soldiers – Ariel Lieberman, commander Hezi Shai and Zohar Lipschitz – were discovered later.Lieberman and Shai were returned to Israel alive in 1985 via a prisoner exchange deal that took place three years later, while the remains of Lipschitz, who was killed in the battle and buried in Syria, were returned to Israel in 1986.“This was a long-term effort by the intelligence community and the Missing Persons Division, during which various operational activities were carried out to locate the missing soldiers,” the military said, adding that the IDF is “committed to continuing the efforts to locate Sgt. Yehuda Katz, Sgt. Tzvika Feldman, all the missing soldiers and captives, and all fallen IDF soldiers whose burial places are unknown.”While Feldman was in the same tank as Baumel when he was killed, Manelis would not comment on whether the body of Feldman would soon be found.According to Channel 13, nearly a dozen other bodies were brought to Israel in the operation to retrieve the remains of the three missing soldiers. While authorities have completed checking almost all bodies and have confirmed that they are not Feldman and Katz, there is still one left to be analyzed. President Reuven Rivlin extended his condolences to the Baumel family, saying that after 37 “unbearable years of painful waiting, of questions and doubts,” Baumel has been “brought home to Israel.”“On this difficult, moving and sad day, our thoughts are with the Baumel family, crying and hurting with them, as they bring their son Zachary to eternal rest in our country, our land,” he said.“I thank the IDF and the whole Israeli intelligence community for their commitment, bravery and action, day and night, to bring our soldiers and those who fell defending the country and the people home. We will not cease until all our soldiers have returned home... We go to battle together, and together we return from it,” he added.IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi commented on Baumel’s repatriation during a ceremony marking the change of the Northern Command, saying that “on the shoulders of IDF commanders, whom I lead, there is a great obligation to take care of every soldier who joins the IDF and swears allegiance to Israel.”“This was a multi-year effort, during which various studies and operations were carried out to locate the missing persons. The culmination of the effort was a series of operations led by the Intelligence Branch, which led to the identification and return of Sgt. Baumel.”Manelis wouldn’t say where Baumel had been buried for all these years. But in September, Russia claimed that its military worked with Israel on an operation to locate the remains of fallen IDF soldiers that were in Syrian territory, which had been under the control of Islamic State.“Israel appealed to Russia with a request for help finding the remains of Israeli servicemen located at specific coordinates in Syria. The search was organized after Russia agreed to the operation with our Syrian partners,” said Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj.-Gen. Igor Konashenkov.Several months earlier, in May, an official from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command claimed that ISIS terrorists had excavated graves in the Jewish cemetery of Damascus, where it had been rumored that the bodies had been buried.There was no prisoner exchange, Manelis said, explaining that it was an operational mission carried out by Military Intelligence.According to the military, the negotiation process between Israel and the PLO in 1993 formed “the basis for an intelligence breakthrough” regarding the burial place of the three missing soldiers.“In November 1993, half of a dog tag that belonged to the late Sgt. Zachary Baumel was handed over to the late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. This finding, along with partial information provided by [PLO chairman Yasser] Arafat, constituted a real and primary source of progress in relation to locating the place of burial of the missing persons,” the IDF said. a This process continued in the second half of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, in the intensive and joint work of a special investigation team established in the Manpower Directorate, which led to the obtaining of reliable and up-to-date information, which allowed the IDF to formulate an intelligence assessment regarding Baumel’s location.The operation to return Baumel’s remains was led by Col. A. of the Intelligence Branch and had been planned in recent months, Manelis said, adding that the operation culminated a week ago.His body landed in Israel several days ago.“We are not saying where his body was found. This operation proves that we never abandoned soldiers missing from Sultan Yacoub. The families know that we will continue to make every effort to bring their sons home,” Manelis said.According to the military, the families of other missing IDF soldiers – including Israel Air Force navigator Ron Arad, who has been missing in Lebanon since 1986, and Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul, who have been missing in Gaza since Operation Protective Edge in the 2014 war – were also told that Baumel’s remains had been returned.“Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Aviv Kochavi, and IDF commanders and soldiers embrace all the families, including the Baumel, Feldman and Katz families, in these moments,” the military said. Baumel will be buried Thursday, April 4 at 7 p.m. at Mount Herzl Military Cemetery in Jerusalem.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez erupted on Tuesday and devolved into a pretty hypocritical attack on the Trump administration.
During a House hearing, Ocasio-Cortez began her remarks by citing “news reports” suggesting that White House officials used WhatsApp to discuss classified information.
SPECIAL OFFER: Free Trump 2020 Hat While Supplies Last
She didn’t provide any sources and proof that the media reports are true, but Ocasio-Cortez used her time to weirdly suggest White House officials may put “nuclear codes on Instagram.”
“Every day that we go on without getting to the bottom of this matter is a day that we are putting hundreds if not potentially thousands of Americans at risk. I mean, really, what is next, putting nuclear codes in Instagram DMs?!? This is ridiculous,” Ocasio-Cortez yelled while flapping her arms all over the place.
“We have to get to the bottom of this. In order to do that, we have to issue subpoenas because people in this administration are not cooperating,” she added.

— CSPAN (@cspan) April 2, 2019
Again, there is no proof that White House officials discussed classified and/or sensitive information on WhatsApp, which is an encrypted app.
But her comments are even more laughable given she was just hit with a complaint to the Federal Election Commission over her use of social media.
NATIONWIDE POLL: Was Obama The Worst President In History?
Ocasio-Cortez was hit with a FEC complaint that accuses her of using government resources for campaign purposes.
It appears that Ocasio-Cortez’s U.S. House of Representatives Instagram account is linked to her official campaign account, which features a video of her on the House floor and a place for supporters to donate money to her re-election fund.
As detailed by The Daily Caller, that is not permitted:
A Washington, D.C.-based ethics group is claiming that New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s social media usage violates House ethics rules against using taxpayer resources for political purposes.
Ocasio-Cortez’s political Instagram account contains direct links to her House Instagram account and includes a link for political contributions, alongside posts of official video footage on the House floor, according to a complaint Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) plans to file Thursday with the Office of Congressional Ethics. The group claims these actions violate House ethics rules.
“In a way, it’s a straight forward complaint,” Kendra Arnold, executive director of FACT, told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “Broadly speaking, the rules clearly define that politics and government works cannot overlap. There are reasons for that: mostly because we don’t want our taxpayer dollars going toward campaigns.” FACT is a nonprofit group whose past president was Matthew Whitaker, an attorney who served as President Donald Trump’s acting attorney general in 2018 and 2019.
She’s only been in Congress for three months, but Ocasio-Cortez has already been slapped with three ethics complaints over allegations that she violated congressional rules, some of which may have been illegal. "
Australian lawmaker censured after blaming Muslims for New Zealand mosques shootings,thehill.com,afolley@thehill.com (Aris Folley),04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/international/437104-australian-lawmaker-censured-by-colleagues-after-blaming-muslims-for-new,"Australian lawmaker censured after blaming Muslims for New Zealand mosque shootings By Aris Folley - 04/03/19 09:12 AM EDT
A right-wing Australian senator was formally censured by his colleagues in the nation's Senate on Wednesday after he sparked international outrage last month by blaming shootings at two mosques in New Zealand on Muslims.
According to the BBC , Sen. Fraser Anning earned bipartisan condemnation on Wednesday for his ""inflammatory and divisive"" comments in the wake of the Christchurch terror attack that left 50 people dead. ADVERTISEMENT
Anning reportedly called the Australian Senate’s move to censure him, which marks the fifth time the legislature has done taken such action in the past decade, an “attack on free speech.”
The decision by his colleagues came in response to remarks he made on the day of the March 15 attack on mosques in Christchurch.
“I am utterly opposed to any form of violence within our community, and I totally condemn the actions of the gunman,” the far-right independent politician wrote in a statement at the time.
“However, whilst this kind of violent vigilantism can never be justified, what it highlights is the growing fear within our community, both in Australia and New Zealand, of the increasing Muslim presence.”
“The real cause of bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place,” he added.
The Queensland senator also went on to say he believed the “truth is that Islam is not like any other faith. It is the religious equivalent of fascism. And just because the followers of this savage belief were not the killers in this instance, does not make them blameless.”
Anning's colleagues wrote in the censure that Anning sought to ""attribute blame to victims of a horrific crime and to vilify people on the basis of religion” with the inflammatory comments, according to the BBC.
Although the censure does not reportedly carry any practical punishment for Anning, the move is regarded as an official condemnation.
According to the international news agency, lawmakers in the country can only be removed from office if they have been convicted of a crime, hold any other office, are dual citizens, or have gone bankrupt, among a number of reasons."
Algerian president resigns amid student demonstrations,thehill.com,zbudryk@thehill.com (Zack Budryk),04-02-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/international/middle-east-north-africa/436992-algerian-president-resigns-amid-student,"Algerian president resigns amid student demonstrations By Zack Budryk - 04/02/19 03:49 PM EDT
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika announced his resignation Tuesday after two decades in power and weeks of mass protests, according to the BBC, citing state news agency APS.
— APS | وأج (@APS_DZ) April 2, 2019
Bouteflika, 82, came to power in 1999 but has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013. His announcement that he would seek a fifth term in the country’s April elections sparked wide-scale demonstrations. ADVERTISEMENT
Bouteflika had initially pledged on Monday not to run for a fifth term and leave office by April 28. Opposition parties and protesting students did not accept the offer and demanded his immediate resignation. Earlier today, the Algerian Defense Ministry called on Bouteflika to leave his post “immediately”, saying “there is no more time to waste” on the constitutional process to have Bouteflika removed from office, according to the Associated Press.
The Algerian president is seen by his opponents as subservient to his close circle of advisers, including his younger brother Said and army chief of staff Ahmed Gaid Salah, according to the New York Times.
“The youth today don’t want a fifth term,” Omar Belhouchet, editor of the Algerian newspaper El Watan, told the Times. “They are fed up with this authoritarian regime which is stifling people, which is pushing its own citizens to die in the Mediterranean.” Most Popular"
Theresa May calls for Brexit extension as Parliament fails to approve deal,thehill.com,jbowden@thehill.com (John Bowden),04-02-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/international/436949-theresa-may-calls-for-brexit-extension-as-parliament-fails-to-approve,"Theresa May calls for Brexit extension as Parliament fails to approve deal By John Bowden - 04/02/19 01:40 PM EDT
British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday called for the European Union (EU) to grant the United Kingdom more time to negotiate an exit from the multinational trading bloc after Parliament narrowly defeated four Brexit plans.
""We will need a further extension of Article 50, one that is as short as possible, and which ends once we pass a deal,"" May told reporters, referring to part of the treaty of the European Union covering member withdrawals. ""We need to be clear what such an extension is for: to ensure that we leave in a timely and orderly way."" ""We will need a further extension of article 50, one that is as short as possible,"" Theresa May says pic.twitter.com/VX0BkWiPgZ — TicToc by Bloomberg (@tictoc) April 2, 2019 ADVERTISEMENT
If the EU approves an extension of Article 50, lawmakers could spend several more weeks hammering out a deal.
U.K. lawmakers on Monday defeated four more plans for the U.K. to leave the EU. One measure, which failed by just a few votes, would have kept Britain in a customs union with EU countries.
The ruling Conservative Party's chief whip resigned on Monday, pledging to join a caucus of independent lawmakers frustrated with parliamentary gridlock and accusing his own party of being unwilling to negotiate.
""I have failed, chiefly, because my party refuses to compromise,"" Nick Boles said. ""I regret, therefore, to announce that I can no longer sit for this party.""
The British Parliament has been engulfed in tense negotiations ahead of a Brexit deadline later this month. Most Popular"
New Zealand officially introduces bill banning guns used in mosque attack,thehill.com,afolley@thehill.com (Aris Folley),04-02-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/international/436885-new-zealand-officially-introduces-bill-banning-guns-used-in-mosque,"New Zealand officially introduces bill banning guns used in mosque attack By Aris Folley - 04/02/19 10:28 AM EDT
The New Zealand government introduced legislation on Monday that would ban the types of weapons used by the gunman in a terror attack that targeted two mosques in Christchurch last month and left 50 people dead.
The bill’s introduction marks the next step in passing gun control legislation that was announced by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern in the days following last month's terror attack. At the time, Ardern said that the country would soon ban ""every semi-automatic weapon used in the terrorist attack.”
Police Minister Stuart Nash, who introduced the Arms (Prohibited Firearms, Magazines, and Parts) Amendment Bill, said that the law would take effect on April 12 if politicians pass the legislation, as expected, according to The Associated Press . ADVERTISEMENT
""This will mean that within four weeks of the Christchurch terrorist attack, New Zealand will have passed legislation banning all military-style semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles,"" Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters told local media this week.
The bill reportedly has bipartisan support and could possibly pass unanimously among the 120 lawmakers in the country’s Parliament.
“These are guns that are designed to kill people,” Nash said.
Nash said one of the weapons used in the Christchurch terror attack was an AR-15-style rifle. He also said the shooter was able to legally purchase semi-automatic guns and high-capacity magazines under the country’s current legislation and used them to create military-style arms.
Each of the weapons used in the shooting would be banned under the legislation, Nash said.
According to The Associated Press, the new bill would make it illegal for people in New Zealand to own parts that can be used to construct weapons prohibited under the ban.
The measure would also reportedly ban semi-automatic shotguns that can be used with detachable magazines or those capable of holding more than five cartridges. Most Popular"
"'The Border's There for a Reason': Lawrence Jones Asks Texans About Illegal Immigration, Trump's Wall Insider",insider.foxnews.com,Fox News Insider,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://insider.foxnews.com/2019/04/03/lawrence-jones-asks-texans-about-border-crisis-illegal-immigration-trumps-wall,"by Fox News Insider
Fox News contributor Lawrence Jones hit the streets of Austin, Texas, to ask people about the crisis at the southern border, and if they agree with President Trump that it's a national emergency or if they agree with Democrats that it's ""manufactured.""
Jones spoke to one woman and noted that 2020 presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke has said he not only opposes Trump's long-promised border wall, he also would tear down the existing border barrier in El Paso if given the chance.
""We need to keep the walls up. If people want to come here, they can come legally,"" she responded.
A man agreed that it would be a ""huge mistake"" for the U.S. not to enforce its borders and immigration laws.
""We put borders up to secure the country and secure Texas and secure the sovereignty of the United States. So I think the border's there for a reason,"" another man said. ""I think the borders are being overwhelmed right now. And it's overtaxing the citizens of Texas and it's overtaxing the citizens of the United States.""
Several respondents, however, agreed with O'Rourke, with one man saying, ""They should tear down the wall altogether,"" and a woman echoing other Democratic lawmakers by disputing the notion that there is a crisis at the border.
Another man said some type of border fencing is a good idea, but he believes the debate over the wall has become far too politicized.
As for Trump's threat to close the southern border if Mexico fails to do more to stop the flow of migrants, one man said it's an ""extreme"" proposal.
""But if it needs to be done, let's do it. Let's do it,"" he added.

The Pentagon’s decision to stop the delivery of equipment related to the F-35 stealth fighter jet to Turkey due to Ankara’s decision to purchase the Russian-made S-400 air defense system will allow Israel to keep it’s aerial superiority in the Middle East.Washington’s move follows repeated warnings both from the United States and NATO allies to Ankara that buying the Russian system alongside the Lockheed Martin-produced jets would threaten the security of the F-35s by learning how to spot and track it. Israel, which also has fragile relations with Turkey, currently has 14 F-35 Adir jets and is expected to receive a total of 50 planes to make two full squadrons by 2024.According to foreign reports, Israel has already quietly tested ways to defeat the advanced Russian air defense system, participating in several joint drills with the Greek Air Force over the island of Crete where one system is stationed. The drills have reportedly allowed Israeli warplanes to gather data on how the advanced system may be blinded or fooled.But there are fears that the radar on the S-400 systems bought by Turkey, which has entered into a sort of alliance with Russia and has been in close cooperation with Iran, could learn the weak spots in the jet and make it less able to evade Russian weapons in the future.The top uniformed officer in NATO and the head of American forces in Europe, General Curtis Scaparrotti warned in March during testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee that Ankara’s purchase of the S-400 presents a problem for not only the F-35 but to all American aircraft.“My best military advice would be that we don’t then follow through with the F-35: flying it or working with an ally that is working with Russian systems, particularly air defense systems, with one of our most advanced technological capabilities,” Scaparrotti was quoted by Defense News as saying.Built by Lockheed Martin, the jets have an extremely low radar signature allowing them to operate undetected deep inside enemy territory as well as to evade advanced missile defense systems like the S-300 and S-400.The already fragile relations between Israel and Turkey have been increasingly strained in recent months as Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a vocal critic of Israel’s policy toward the Palestinians, has intensified his rhetoric.Israeli officials have voiced concern over Turkey’s purchasing of the jets, with one senior defense official quoted by Haaretz in August as saying that Israel would like to be the only country in the Middle East with the F-35 in order to keep its qualitative military edge and out of fears that the jet’s capabilities would be leaked to enemy countries.Ceng Sagnic from the Moshe Dayan Center in Tel Aviv told The Jerusalem Post that while Moscow might be “hesitant” to share the knowledge of the jet which might be gained by its S-400, it couldn’t be ruled out.“Moscow would definitely be hesitant to share the military “secrets” it has obtained with a third party. But in the event of a major dispute in the region or a potentially expanded Moscow-Tehran alliance, transfer of knowledge on US weapon systems to Tehran can well be a topic of discussion,” he said.According to Sagnic, it is impossible to estimate the extent of Ankara’s “cloudy relations” with Moscow.“The presence of both F-35s and S-400s can also come with a similar outcome itself. If Turkey had purchased F-35s from the US and S-400s from Russia, the situation would partially resemble Greece – where the coincidental presence of S-300 systems allowed, according to foreign reports, NATO and Israel to carefully study these weapons,” he said, adding that “in the case of Turkey, although it would stay a member of NATO, the future extent of its relations with Russia cannot be estimated and Ankara could well remain pressured by Moscow to allow such studies. Given that Turkey is and will be a country of crises – and therefore is mostly prone to Russian pressure – the possibility increases even further.”Israel became the first air force outside the United States to declare Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of the jet in 2017. Last year, IAF chief Maj.-Gen. Amikam Norkin announced that Israel has struck targets in the Middle East with the F-35 Adir jet twice, making the Jewish state the first country to use the stealth fighter in a combat role in the region.According to Sagnic, “Turkey must be seriously thinking that Israel may be behind the cancellation of the F-35 deal in order to preserve its air superiority. However, for the domestic politics, Ankara needs a “usual suspect” to blame, as blaming the US cannot be enough to explain the disruption in one the biggest weapons agreement Turkey has signed.”As a Level-3 partner in the multinational F-35 program, Turkey invested over $1 billion on the jet, with several local companies producing components for the aircraft including fuselages and cockpit screens such as Alp Aviation, AYESAS, Kale Aviation, Kale Pratt & Whitney and Turkish Aerospace Industries.Turkish defense companies also produce high-end SOM-J missiles for the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program and Turkey is Europe’s maintenance and repair center for F-35 fighter aircraft manufactured under the JSF plan.Ankara took delivery of its first F-35 in June at a ceremony in Texas and the country plans to purchase 100 stealth jets in the coming years. Turkish pilots have already been learning to fly the jet training alongside US pilots at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. Ankara is holding onto hope that the two more jets expected to be handed over this month will actually be delivered.

Mitch McConnell pushes forward with rule change to speed lower-level confirmations,whatdidyousay.org,Jerry Broussard,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://whatdidyousay.org/2019/04/02/mitch-mcconnell-pushes-forward-with-rule-change-to-speed-lower-level-confirmations/,"Reported by William A.

No change for SCOTUS, Appeals Court, Cabinet and senior nominees, “[b]ut for most other nominations – for the hundreds of lower-level nominations that every new president makes – post-cloture debate time would be reduced from 30 hours to 2 hours.”
Mitch McConnell has been a bad boy (in the eyes of Democrats) according to my email inbox: PFAW Statement on McConnell’s Threatened Rules Change: A Naked Power Grab Based on Lies and Distortions
WASHINGTON — In response to Mitch McConnell’s threat to break the Senate’s rules yet again in order to expedite GOP efforts to confirm as many of Donald Trump’s nominees as possible, People For the American Way Executive Vice President Marge Baker issued the following statement: “There’s literally no one in the world with less credibility to accuse Democrats of obstructing the confirmation process than Mitch McConnell. His latest effort to break the Senate’s rules is a naked power grab based on lies and distortions. By attempting to speed up Republicans’ confirmation machine, Senator McConnell is trying to ensure that nominees to lifetime seats on the federal bench receive as little scrutiny as possible. That’s not because of Democratic obstruction—the Senate has confirmed almost the same number of district court nominees for Donald Trump as it did for President Obama, and far more circuit court nominees. It’s because time and again these nominees have been shown to be embarrassingly unfit. But Senator McConnell’s answer isn’t to find better nominees; it’s just to make sure there’s less transparency for the entire process. “Judicial nominees, if confirmed, serve for life. And several of the nominees awaiting votes have frighteningly extreme records when it comes to opposing reproductive freedom, attacking the rights of LGBTQ people, undermining voting rights, and enabling torture. Rushing these nominees through the process would be profoundly irresponsible.” …
So what’s all the hysteria about?
McConnell is finally doing what has been threatened for over a year, to reduce floor “ debate ” time to get around Democrat obstruction where they invoke 30 hours of debate even for non-controversial non-debatable nominees. That drags out the process interminably.
McConnell explained the problem in a Politico Op-Ed, Time to Stop the Democrats’ Obstruction :
It took six months of partisan delays — and several railroad accidents — before Democrats let the Senate confirm a federal railroad administrator, even though none of them actually voted against the nominee in the end.
It’s been 354 days and counting in Senate purgatory for the president’s nominee to head the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Two-hundred eighty-seven days and counting for the under secretary of state for management. Noncontroversial lower court nominees have languished for weeks and weeks — for no discernible reason — before they, too, were confirmed unanimously. These are just a few examples of the historic obstruction Senate Democrats have visited upon President Trump’s nominees for two years and counting.
Since January 2017, for the first time in memory, a minority has exploited procedure to systematically obstruct a president from staffing up his administration. This new, across-the-board obstruction is unfair to the president and, more importantly, to the American people. Left unchecked, it is guaranteed to create an unsustainable precedent that would see every future presidency of either party obstructed in the same mindless way.
The Senate needs to restore normalcy. And this week, we will vote to do just that….
… in President Trump’s first two years? We had to hold a stunning 128 cloture votes to advance nominations. Our Democratic colleagues made the Senate jump over five times as many hurdles as in the equivalent periods in the Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations combined….
The all-encompassing, systematic nature of this obstruction is not part of the Senate’s important tradition of minority rights. It is a new departure from that tradition.
Here is McConnell’s statement , made on the floor of the Senate, in part: “So today, I am filing cloture on a resolution that takes that bipartisan effort as its blueprint. This resolution from Senator Blunt and Senator Lankford would implement very similar steps and make them a permanent part of the Senate going forward. The Supreme Court, circuit courts, cabinet-level executive positions, and certain independent boards and commissions would not change. “But for most other nominations – for the hundreds of lower-level nominations that every new president makes – post-cloture debate time would be reduced from 30 hours to 2 hours. This would keep the floor moving. It would facilitate more efficient consent agreements. And most importantly, it would allow the administration — finally, two years into its tenure — to staff numerous important positions that remain unfilled, with nominees who have been languishing. “This resolution has come up through regular order, through the Rules Committee. And next week, we will vote on it. It deserves the same kind of bipartisan vote that Sen. Schumer and Sen. Reid’s proposal received back during the Obama Administration. I understand that many of my Democratic colleagues have indicated they would be all for this reform as long as it doesn’t go into effect until 2021, when they obviously hope someone else might be in the White House. But they’re reluctant to support it now. “Give me a break. That is unfair on its face. My Democratic colleagues were more than happy to support a similar proposal in 2013 under President Obama. They whisper in our ears privately that they’d support it now if it took effect in 2021. But they can’t support it now, especially under these unprecedented circumstances, simply because we have a Republican president. So look, fair is fair. Members of this body should only support reforms that they would be ready to support in the minority as they are in the majority. Put another way, if my side is in the minority two years from now, I don’t think this will be unfair – it will not disadvantage us in the wake of a new Democratic president. This is a change the institution needs, a change the institution made already basically with a two-year experiment when President Obama was in office. This is a reform that every member should embrace — when their party controls the White House and when it does not control the White House.
This should help speed along the process, particularly for judicial nominees. There remain many empty seats to fill, and Republicans want as many as possible filled prior to the 2020 election, just in case.
Here are the numbers on vacancies from Carrie Severino as of March 25, 2019:
Current and known future vacancies: 167
Courts of Appeals: 10
Pending nominees for current and known future vacancies: 66
Courts of Appeals: 6"

"WATCH: Trump mocks AOC, the Democrats, and their Green New Deal! – The Right Scoop",therightscoop.com,The Right Scoop,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://therightscoop.com/watch-trump-mocks-aoc-the-democrats-and-their-green-new-deal/,"Twitter
Trump gave a speech last night to the NRCC where he took a jab at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, her Green New Deal and all the petrified Democrats supporting it.
In the speech Trump referred to AOC as “a young bartender” before calling her Green New Deal the “craziest thing”. And he then mocked Democrats for supporting it, suggesting that they are all petrified of the 29-year-old bartender.
Watch:
Trump told Republicans not to be too hard on the Green New Deal though because he doesn’t want Democrats to “knock it out” before they get to run against it.
Trump thus said he’s calling it a “wonderful thing”.
According to the Washington Times Trump also told the crowd (not in this clip) that “if they beat me with the Green New Deal, I deserve to lose.” "

Trump Refers to AOC As the 'Young Bartender',townhall.com,Leah Barkoukis,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2019/04/03/trumps-aoc-comments-n2544184,"Trump Refers to AOC As the 'Young Bartender' Share Share Tweet Source: AP Photo/Susan Walsh
President Trump mocked Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her Green New Deal on Tuesday, referring to the New York democratic socialist as the “young bartender.”
""The Green New Deal, done by a young bartender, 29 years old,"" he told GOP House lawmakers at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner. ""A young bartender, wonderful young woman.”
He continued: ""The Green New Deal. The first time I heard it I said, 'That’s the craziest thing.' You have senators that are professionals that you guys know that have been there for a long time. White hair, everything perfect, and they’re standing behind her shaking. They’re petrified of her.""
Trump told the audience he didn’t want to knock the resolution too much since he hoped to campaign against it in 2020—a point he’s made about the Green New Deal before.
“You look at this Green New Deal — it’s the most preposterous thing,” Trump said during an interview with Fox Business last month. “Now I don’t want to knock it too much right now because I really hope they keep going forward with it, frankly, because I think it’s going to be very easy to beat.” Recommended With Mueller Hopes Gone, So Goes Progressive Unity Victor Davis Hanson
Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts introduced the resolution in February, promising a “massive transformation of our society.” The resolution called for retrofitting every building in America to be energy efficient, eliminating cars, air travel, and fossil fuel and nuclear energy, as well as guaranteeing jobs, among other radical proposals.
The resolution was roundly defeated in the Senate last month, with 57 nays and 43 present votes. Not a single senator voted in favor of the Green New Deal. "

Populism Has Been Around For Generations,www.occidentaldissent.com,Hunter Wallace,04-03-2019,2019,4,http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2019/04/03/populism-has-been-around-for-generations/,"Colin Liddell has written a stinging article on the alt-right .
As I have explained, I am on the road so this will be a very brief response. I can only type this out through my smartphone.
1.) Voted for Gore in 2000. I disliked George W. Bush before he was president.
2.) Discovered Pat Buchanan in 2001.
3.) Voted for Kerry in 2004 out of sheer hatred of George W. Bush over Iraq.
4.) Supported Ron Paul in the Republican primary in 2008 because of his America First foreign policy.
5.) Voted Constitution Party in 2008. Refused to support neocon John McCain over Obama.
6.) Supported Ron Paul again in 2012.
7.) Urged Northern readers to vote for Mitt Romney as a shit test in 2012. Voted for Constitution Party in 2012.
8.) Voted for Trump in 2016 in the primary and general election over the MAGA agenda.
9.) Voting for Yang in 2020 over UBI, student loans, health care, infrastructure, postal banking, democracy dollars and other good economic policies.
Now, if I had been older in the 1990s, I would have gladly voted for Pat Buchanan in 1992 and 1996 because I am simply a populist and nationalist voter . I would have voted for George Wallace in all his presidential campaigns and as governor of Alabama. My in-laws fell in love working on the Wallace campaigns. George Wallace himself was from where I am from in Alabama.
Alabama and the Deep South has a long history of being a hotbed of populism: Theodore “The Man” Bilbo of Mississippi, Huey “The Kingfish” Long of Louisiana, George Wallace of Alabama, Tom Watson of Georgia, etc.
There have always been Southerners who have combined a sense of economic fairness with social conservatism and fiery rhetoric.
This political orientation has been called different things at different times throughout history. The “alt-right” label is merely an ephemeral manifestation among Millennials of this enduring populist political tendency. This was especially true after the 1890s and during the first half of the 20th century when it was out in the open and not submerged underneath mainstream conservatism in the GOP as it has been since the Reagan days.

House panel votes to subpoena Mueller report | TheHill,thehill.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/437102-house-panel-votes-to-subpoena-mueller-report,"Donald (Don) F. McGahn House panel to vote Wednesday on authorizing subpoena for Mueller report Ex-White House ethics chief compares Ivanka, Kushner security clearances to college admissions scandal Dem compares college cheating scandal to Ivanka, Jared's security clearance MORE and his former deputy, Ann Donaldson. Nadler has suggested they failed to meet the committee's demands for documents issued in March. Collins asserted Wednesday that they have cooperated with the probe or signaled willingness to cooperate, and he accused Nadler of targeting them because of their proximity to Trump. Democrats authorized the subpoena for Mueller's report after the Justice Department did not meet an April 2 deadline set by six Democratic chairmen for sending it to Congress. So far, Congress has only received a four-page summary of the report from Barr. The attorney general told lawmakers late last week that officials were on track to prepare a version of the report by mid-April that would be released publicly and sent to Capitol Hill. In a letter to Nadler and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin Graham Mueller's unsatisfying report and its endangering summary Mueller handed Democrats their next line of attack against Trump Trump raises pressure on Dems to back disaster aid bill threatened by Puerto Rico fight MORE (R-S.C.) on Friday, Barr wrote that the public version of the report would be scrubbed of sensitive national security information that could compromise sources and methods, grand jury material, information that could impact ongoing investigations and “information that would unduly infringe on the personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties.” Unsatisfied with Barr’s commitments, House Democrats have demanded the immediate release of Mueller’s entire report — with no redactions — to Congress. They’ve also demanded Barr testify before Congress as soon as possible to explain his decisions with respect to Mueller’s report. Barr has offered to testify before both the House and Senate panels in early May. Mueller delivered his confidential closing documentation to Barr, ending his investigation less than two weeks ago. Days later, Barr laid out Mueller’s core findings in a letter to Congress, revealing that the special counsel did not charge members of Trump’s campaign with conspiring with the Russian government. Mueller also did not come to a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice; however, Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein Rod Jay Rosenstein Mueller's unsatisfying report and its endangering summary Mueller handed Democrats their next line of attack against Trump House panel to vote Wednesday on authorizing subpoena for Mueller report MORE determined themselves that there was not sufficient evidence to accuse the president of obstructing the probe. Trump and his Republican allies have seized on Barr’s letter as exonerating the commander in chief. Meanwhile, Democrats have increasingly raised questions about Barr’s determination and his ability to be a neutral arbiter over the investigation, and have clamored for the release of Mueller’s report. “This committee has a job to do,” Nadler said at Wednesday's meeting. ""The Constitution charges Congress with holding the president accountable for alleged official misconduct. That job requires us to evaluate the evidence for ourselves — not the attorney general’s summary, not a substantially redacted synopsis, but the full report and the underlying evidence.” Nadler cited the investigations into former presidents Clinton and Nixon as reasons for Barr to release grand jury material to Congress, noting Congress obtained grand jury information produced during the Ken Starr and Watergate probes. “This subpoena authorization gives this committee the ability to compel production of the full report and related documents if the attorney general departs from these and other precedents and refuses to produce to Congress the complete record of special counsel Mueller’s investigation,” Nadler said. ADVERTISEMENT Republicans, however, said Nadler’s demands amounted to asking Barr to violate the law, noting that federal rules prohibit the public release of grand jury material unless there is a court order allowing their release. “In my opinion, the Democrats are asking Attorney General Barr to violate the law,” said Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.). “It’s obvious to me that this is just a continuation of an attempt to undermine the president of the United States” “For the last two years, members on this committee have said that there has been collusion with the Trump administration and President Trump with Russia to undermine the 2016 election. And, as revealed in the summary, this is absolutely not true,” Lesko said. Lawmakers also tussled over past independent counsel investigations, including the Starr probe that eventually unearthed that Clinton was having an affair with intern Monica Lewinsky. GOP lawmakers joined the president in arguing that Judiciary Democrats like Nadler fought against certain information in the Starr report becoming public, suggesting he is treating the probes differently. Nadler dismissed these claims, stating that the fight was to keep lewd details of the president’s sexual affairs private, not information that related to national security. Obtaining the full Mueller report, he argues, is a fight for information regarding an attack on the rule of law. “We need a full accounting of the president's actions in order for us to do our work,” he argued. While Trump and Republicans have called for Mueller's report to be released, the president has dismissed the subpoena effort as a “waste of time” and suggested Democrats were playing “politics at a very low level."" ""So, there’s no collusion. The attorney general now and the deputy attorney general ruled no obstruction. They said no obstruction,"" Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with the head of NATO. ""Now we’re going to start this process all over again?"" Trump added. ""I think it’s a disgrace. These are just Democrats that want to try and demean this country, and it shouldn’t be allowed."" He has also said that Nadler and other Democrats will never be satisfied no matter how much information is provided. --Updated at 11:58 a.m."

When the Barr letter on the Mueller came out and the House asked for the full report, Trump and the White House said put the whole thing out there. He said it not once, but several times. Now all at once Trump has flip flopped on the issue and says that we should move on. So what do you think, should the whole report be given to the House committees? I think it should for no other reason than to have this whole thing over and our representatives will know the full extent of the probe and its conclusions. 672 Re: Another Trump flip flop? What a surprise; another walk-back from the Great Orange Hope; it's in fine company with the repeal of ACA (now due post-2020), the non-appearance of the 10% middle class tax cut, Mexico's cheque, the Muslim ban and border closure. I guess it was only to be expected. Yes, the report in it's entirety (allowing for genuinely legitimate redactions), must be released. A worrying aspect is the 'peripherals' Barr mentioned in letter#2. Nobody is specifically mentioned, and it seems dangerously open-ended. A get-out-of-jail card for Trump, perhaps?

My whole question is if the report exonerates Trump and his family, why try to keep others from seeing the report. I will bet you that Trump and the GOP leaders have seen the whole report and are working with Barr to redact anything pointing a finger at anyone in the White House or the Trump family. Also, after they kill this report, they will go after the investigations into the trump businesses and his foundation."

What's Behind Bitcoin's Surge: Derivative Traders Believe They Know The Answer | Zero Hedge,www.zerohedge.com,,04-03-2019,2019,4,https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2019-04-03/whats-behind-bitcoins-surge-derivative-traders-believe-they-know-answer,"0 SHARES
With cryptos soaring sharply just after midnight Eastern on April 2, and continuing their impressive ascent since then, with most tokens rising above their 200DMAs for the first time in a year, one question still puzzles traders: what catalyzed the surge.
While we previously presented various potential triggers for the buying spree, the puzzle remains, with some so-called experts even boldly suggesting the move which has added tens of billions in market cap to the crypto space, was due to a tweet by a so-called ""prominent"" contrarian on crypto who turned bullish (spoiler: that had nothing to do with it).
Addressing this issue, the crypto derivatives traders behind sk3w.com looked at the internals of the move, and concluded that the surge higher appears to have been driven by a very large short squeeze in a low liquidity backdrop. Specifically, they point out that between 5.30 and 6.30 a.m London time when the bulk of the upward move took place, nearly $500 MM of buyer order liquidations took place on Bitmex - the largest futures platform - in the space of one hour.
Putting the move in its proper context, here is the action in the last three months in terms of liquidation activity on Bitmex. Clearly something or someone got spooked, and was forced to cover (perhaps in connection with the CBOE's recent decision to end bitcoin futures trading).
Once the squeeze got rolling, market makers widening prices and forced buy orders pushed the price higher by $1,000 in one hour - with the bid/ask for 1,000 bitcoin exploding from 5% to nearly 25% on Coinbase, as liquidity collapsed in what was a clear foreced buy in (On the chart below, Coinbase is the only physical exchange, the others are derivatives).
And another observation from the Sk3w deriv traders: yesterday was the largest session of the year for the bitcoin market and the so-called perpetual swaps - its most liquid derivatives instruments. Bitmex and Bitflyer each traded $5BN+.
To summarize: a massive forced squeeze which tripped the derivative market, and which judging by the action this morning, is still continuing.
Meanwhile, for those curious what the recent surge means for the future of crypto prices, with both spot up and vol up, the probability of Bitcoin rising above $10,000 by September is now 11%, vs 4.2% last week. Tags"
