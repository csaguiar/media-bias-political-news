Lisa Olson spoke about how difficult it has been for her family to cope with the lingering effects of the trauma.
Wilfredo Lee/AP Families of Parkland school shooting victims are filing at least 22 lawsuits against Broward County's school board, sheriff's office and more, alleging they failed to prevent the attack that left 17 people dead and another 17 injured.
Attorneys representing families of those who were killed or wounded at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14, 2018, argue several organizations and individuals were responsible for the massacre. In addition to the school district and sheriff's office, other targets in the lawsuits, announced Wednesday, are Henderson Behavioral Health, which provided mental health services to confessed shooter Nikolas Cruz; former Stoneman Douglas security guard Andrew Medina, who was the first to see Cruz on campus but did not call a ""code red"" lockdown; and former Broward Sheriff's Office Deputy Scot Peterson, the school resource officer who hid during the shooting rather than entering the school building to confront the shooter.

The attorneys said the families have been working over the 14 months since the shooting to reach a settlement — a fund that would provide millions in compensation for each family. But the lawyers say the school board has been lobbying against legislation at the state Capitol, where lawmakers are now holding their annual session.
A spokeswoman for the school board refuted the assertion that the district has lobbied against the legislation creating a compensation fund for families.
Parkland School Shooting, One Year Later 'We Live With It Every Day': Parkland Community Marks 1 Year Since Massacre National Suicides In Parkland Leave Community In Shock Chief Public Information Officer Kathy Koch said in a statement the district hired a firm that helped to write the legislation and has been lobbying in favor of it. She said the district consulted families when conceptualizing the fund. The school board voted to include the legislation on its official list of priorities for the 2019 legislative session.
As for the lawsuits, both the school board and the sheriff's office responded that they do not comment on litigation.
Joseph DiRuzzo, an attorney who represents Peterson, said he is confident that the lawsuits ""lack merit,"" and he plans to fight them ""vigorously."" The attorney representing Medina declined to comment.
One of the plaintiffs is Mitchell Dworet, who said he is in a ""very unique position"" because one of his sons was killed and the other was injured.
Mental Health Dealing With Trauma After A Mass Shooting — Over The Long Term ""My son is Nicholas Dworet. He was killed in the third room,"" Dworet said. ""My other son is Alexander Dworet. He was in the first room. He was injured, he saw children killed and he lost his brother. This is a life sentence for me. It's every day.
This is not normal. This is not right. There were failures. I want to be in court. I want to see who, what, where, how, why.
Mitchell Dworet
""I want accountability. I'm not going away. I'm in for the long haul,"" Dworet said. ""This is not normal. This is not right. There were failures. I want to be in court. I want to see who, what, where, how, why.""
Lisa Olson — whose son, William, was shot and survived — also spoke Wednesday about how difficult it has been for her family to cope with the lingering effects of the trauma.
""My son didn't go to school today. He couldn't, and we have many days like that now,"" Olson said.
""It's a daily struggle,"" she said. Referring to the survivors, she said: ""They are not the people they were before Feb. 14.""
Another plaintiff is Lori Alhadeff, whose daughter, Alyssa, was killed. Alhadeff was elected to the Broward School Board last November.
When asked about Alhadeff's potential conflict of interest — she is apparently participating in lawsuits against the school board on which she sits — her attorney, Bob Kelley, said: ""She obviously cannot be involved in any kind of discussion about a settlement or resolution of this case.""
Under Florida law, the legislature must approve any local government settlements that exceed $300,000. The process of passing these bills often takes years, and many are never approved. State Sen. Lauren Book, a Broward County Democrat, filed three bills this session that would create compensation funds for families of Parkland shooting victims.
The attorneys representing the families said these bills could be used to ensure approval of the settlement during this legislative session, which ends May 3, if the parties reach an agreement in time.
Kelley said it's not too late to reach a settlement and pass a bill this session, if the school board and other parties are willing to negotiate.
""There's still three weeks left in the legislative session, and everybody knows that almost everything happens at the very last minute, on the very last night, in the very last hour of the legislative session,"" Kelley said. ""So they still have an opportunity to do the right thing by these families ... and all these lawsuits could be dismissed.""
Without a settlement, the lawyers predict the lawsuits could take years to resolve, cost millions of dollars and require survivors of the shooting to provide depositions.
Kelley argued it's more financially responsible for local governments to settle.
""Why would they go out and spend millions of dollars on attorneys' fees to defend cases that they know they're going to lose? And that the verdicts that the juries are going to return are going to be far and above anything that these people would take to settle these things?
""They do have a fiduciary duty, and they're not fulfilling it,"" he said.
The attorneys didn't specify how much money the families are seeking in compensation."

Amazon Independent Booksellers A mention of the Secret Service today might conjure up images of unsmiling men and women wearing sunglasses and dark suits, surrounding the president, perhaps discreetly touching their earpieces once in a while.
Or if you're a history buff, your thoughts might turn to 19th-century lawmen hot on the trail of counterfeiters. (Investigating financial crimes is still part of the agency's purview.)
But for a period of time toward the latter years of Reconstruction, the Secret Service took on another kind of mission: infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan, the white supremacist hate group that was founded in the months following the end of the Civil War. The operation that sought to end the Klan's terror campaigns were spearheaded by a man named Hiram C. Whitley, the subject of a fascinating new book, Freedom's Detective, by Washington Post editorial writer and former editor of the New Republic Charles Lane.
Whitley was perhaps the biggest thorn in the side of the early Klan, which likely came as a surprise to those who knew him in his early years. Born in 1832 in Maine, he started his career as a saloon owner with questionable business ethics; after being caught up in a scandal, he left New England for Lawrence, Kansas, in 1857. It was there that he was arrested for kidnapping after ambushing a convoy of white abolitionists and free black men, women and children on their way north, hoping to escape the ""slave hunters"" who had taken to terrorizing African Americans in the town.
After being kicked out of Kansas, the ""now-admitted betrayer and kidnapper of abolitionist whites and freedom-bound blacks"" found himself in Louisiana, where he managed to find work as a spy for the Union army. To be sure, it was a sea change for Whitley, as Lane readily admits:
""Whitley's amoral attitude toward the great issues of slavery and equality, so evident in his slave-hunting in Kansas ... seemed to be evolving. The cruelty inflicted on enslaved people in Louisiana was so ugly that it could shock even his conscience, and, in one case, spur him to action.""
Whitley reinvented himself as a law enforcement expert, and it turned out he was good at it, thanks in no small part to his instinctive understanding of psychology — as Lane writes, ""[H]e had developed a thoroughly jaded view of human nature, and how it could be manipulated to his advantage, honestly if possible — but through deception if necessary, and convenient."" He eventually earned a spot as one of the Secret Service's first directors, tracking down counterfeiters using a mix of ""deception, or force, [and] his own undeniable charm.""
Whitley's talents came in handy when the government decided it needed a group of lawmen to infiltrate a new terrorist organization that had sprung up in the South. ""The Ku Klux Klan began as a club for half a dozen bored Confederate Army veterans in tiny Pulaski, Tennessee,"" Lane writes. ""As the Republican plan for Reconstruction took hold, however, Klan 'dens' mutated into white supremacist vigilante groups targeting African Americans, Freedmen's Bureau officials, and white Republicans."" Whitley led a dazzlingly complex mission to penetrate the secret society, which resulted in an impressive number of white supremacists jailed for murder and conspiracy. (Sadly, but predictably, many of them didn't stay in prison for long.)
Lane's account of Whitley's infiltration of the Klan is endlessly gripping, and he recounts it with an impressive narrative tension. He also does an excellent job placing the operation in historical context, chronicling the racism and resentment that built up in the South following the end of the Civil War. It can be difficult, though necessary, to read his descriptions of the Klan's reign of terror, but Lane is careful not to sensationalize the inhuman violence that was the group's stock-in-trade.
He's also careful not to lionize Whitley, who was, to say the least, a flawed person. ""He could be a con artist, and a bully,"" Lane writes, ""and those aspects of his character had gotten him into one tight spot after another, then helped get him out."" They would also bring about his downfall — Whitley's time in government was ended by a scandal so unnecessary and harebrained, it almost defies belief.
The best history books are often the most unexpected ones, stories of relatively obscure people who changed society in some way, big or small. Whitley certainly isn't a household name, and never was, but his vision of the Secret Service as a national investigative force dedicated to rooting out a variety of crimes helped make the agency what it is today. Lane proves himself to be an excellent researcher and writer, and Freedom's Detective is a captivating account of a flawed but remarkable man."

Veronica G. Cardenas/Texas Public Radio Hugh Fitzsimmons is a rancher and writer. He raises bison at the Shape Ranch in the southwestern part of Dimmit County, about 10 miles away from the Mexican border, north of Laredo, Texas. He considers his ranch a world apart from the two nations divided by the Rio Grande.
""[It is] another country — that's what this borderland is all about. It is not the United States, and it is not Mexico. It is a transitional land,"" he said.
Fitzsimmons grew up on the ranch. He said one thing you should never do is come to someone's home after dark.
Several years ago, someone did exactly that. It was a cold and rainy night.
That's what I want to see a candidate talk about. Let the good people in, keep the bad people out. How complicated is that?
Hugh Fitzsimmons, Texas rancher
""I had a shotgun with me, and I leveled the shotgun at him when I opened the door, asked him what he wanted, and he said 'just water' was all he wanted,"" he said. ""I looked him in the eye and I thought to myself, 'This man is not going to bring me any harm.' ""
Fitzsimmons lowered his shotgun. He remembers that at that moment, the man fell to the ground and began crying.
""It became starkly apparent to me at that time that we don't take the time to really put ourselves in each other's shoes,"" he said.
Texas Public Radio YouTube It's a bright sunny Tuesday morning, and Fitzsimmons is ready for a drive. He had heard from one of his employees that migrants left behind some of their belongings in a thicket.
After a few minutes of driving past rows of olive trees, he arrived at the spot, stepped from the truck and walked towards the debris. Fitzsimmons walked slowly and steadily, keeping an eye out for any rattlesnakes, and towards a pile of discarded backpacks, clothes, toiletries and other items left behind by migrants.
When asked if he gets nervous walking alone on his thousands of acres of ranch land, he joked, ""I do, but my Colt-45 does not.""
""Once they make it across [the border] and they jettison all of this, then they will try to get picked up on the county road,"" he explained.
This isn't the first time Fitzsimmons has come across piles of discarded items left behind by migrants on his property. He said he's even seen syringes among the debris.

Fitzsimmons reviewed the pile, then walked back to his truck and drove home.
Fitzsimmons said he's not a fan of the idea of having a border wall. He wants the government to implement a guest worker program for migrants. He considers that to be a real solution to the immigration issue.

New Mexico May Become Temporary Storage Site For Nuclear Waste,www.npr.org,"Tommy Taylor, director of oil and gas development, Fasken Oil and Ranch",04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/709600915/new-mexico-is-divided-over-the-perfect-site-to-store-nation-s-nuclear-waste?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image A 1,000-acre patch of southeast New Mexico desert may offer a temporary solution to the nation's longstanding nuclear waste problem.

Nathan Rott/NPR Thirty-five miles out of Carlsbad, in the pancake-flat desert of southeast New Mexico, there's a patch of scrub-covered dirt that may offer a fix — albeit temporarily — to one of the nation's most vexing and expensive environmental problems: What to do with our nuclear waste?
Despite more than 50 years of searching and billions of dollars spent, the federal government still hasn't been able to identify a permanent repository for nuclear material. No state seems to want it.
So instead, dozens of states are stuck with it. More than 80,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel, a still-radioactive byproduct of nuclear power generation, is spread across the country at power plants and sites in 35 states.
The issue has dogged politicians for decades. Energy Secretary Rick Perry recently described the situation as a ""logjam."" But some hope that this remote, rural corner of New Mexico may present a breakthrough.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering a proposal by Holtec International, a private U.S.-based company, to build a massive consolidated interim storage facility for spent nuclear fuel on that patch of desert. It could eventually hold up to 100,000 metric tons of the material, storing it until a permanent repository is found.

Courtesy of Holtec International The bid has support from a group of local officials, drawn by the promise of tax revenues, high-paying jobs and a stable source of income.
The same appears to be true in Washington, D.C., where lawmakers are anxious to find a solution and have indicated an openness to change laws, making it easier for private companies to manage nuclear fuel.
But familiar challenges persist.
A broad coalition of local and national groups opposes the plan, as does the state's new governor. They're worried about transporting the nuclear waste and the environmental impacts of storing it.
""Why should we be the ones to take this negative project on and put up with the consequences?"" says Rose Gardner, a florist who lives 35 miles from the proposed site. ""We didn't get any of the nuclear generated electricity. We're not even involved.""

Nathan Rott/NPR An expensive and expansive problem
The question of what to do with spent nuclear fuel has plagued the U.S. since before the nation's first commercial nuclear power plant was even running .
In 1982 Congress got involved, passing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act , which called for the development of repositories for the nation's high-level nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel.
Five years later, it narrowed those efforts, focusing on a single area 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas: Yucca Mountain.
The federal government has spent billions of dollars assessing the viability of a deep underground storage facility there. For decades, Yucca looked like the destination for nuclear waste.

toggle caption Department of Energy But efforts to move that project forward were stifled by local opposition. Stuck at an impasse, and under pressure from then-Senate Majority Leader and Nevadan Harry Reid, the Obama administration scrapped funding for the site in 2009 .
The Trump administration has called for funding to revive the Yucca Mountain project, but local resistance remains and Nevada lawmakers have dug in their heels.
In the meantime, spent nuclear fuel continues to build up at scores of power plants around the country, at facilities that weren't designed to store it.
The problem with this is two-fold.
For one, it's expensive. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act said that the Department of Energy would find a permanent home for utilities' nuclear waste by 1998. It didn't. So now, the Department of Energy pays utility companies more than $2 million a day to store that nuclear waste on-site. That's taxpayer money.
The other problem is public safety.
More than 1 in 3 Americans lives within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant , according to Columbia University. Many of those plants are now storing spent nuclear fuel on coastlines or near rivers, areas that are more prone to flooding and natural disasters.

Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images ""There's no question, from a safety perspective, from a risk perspective, from an economic perspective, consolidated interim storage makes a lot of sense,"" says John Heaton, a former New Mexico state legislator who's part of a group trying to bring the facility to the state. ""We're in a seismically stable, dry place. It's more or less a perfect site.""
Don't put this in an oil field. That's a bad idea. Certainly not the biggest oil field the United States has.
Tommy Taylor, director of oil and gas development, Fasken Oil and Ranch
A ""consent-based"" approach
In 2010, fresh off its decision to end funding for Yucca Mountain, the Obama administration commissioned a blue ribbon panel to look at America's nuclear waste problem.
One of its top recommendations was to authorize and establish consolidated interim storage facilities. But to avoid another-Yucca like impasse, it also recommended using a new ""consent-based approach"" when finding a location.
""We believe this type of approach can provide the flexibility and sustain the public trust and confidence needed to see controversial facilities through to completion,"" the report said .
Energy Waste, Families Left Behind As Nuclear Plants Close The Two-Way Organic Cat Litter Chief Suspect In Nuclear Waste Accident But figuring out how to define that consent, and then getting it from various communities, industries and interests, will be difficult.
Ranchers and dairy producers in New Mexico worry about what impact the Holtec facility would have on their industry, real or perceived. There's a fear that consumers wouldn't want to buy beef or milk from a place that's also home to the nation's biggest collection of nuclear material.
There are also concerns from some in the region's biggest industry: oil and gas. The proposed site is in the Permian Basin, one of the busiest oil fields in the world.

""[But] don't put this in an oil field. That's a bad idea. Certainly not the biggest oil field the United States has.""
Taylor feels the same way about another proposed interim storage facility in the Permian Basin, near the Texas-New Mexico border. That proposal, by Texas-based Waste Control and Storage Services, is also being considered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
""My specialty is drilling wells,"" Taylor says. ""We use the best technology we have, the best materials we can get, and the best tools. And even though you're trying to do the best you can — still, things happen.""
The companies behind both proposals insist that the projects would be safe. Advocates for the Holtec proposal say that the amount of radiation coming off of one of the storage containers the company plans to use is about the same as a microwave.
""This isn't some Homer Simpson green sludge that's going to leak out and who know's what's going to happen, people with three-eyes and that sort of thing,"" says Jason Shirley, a Carlsbad City Council member, who was skeptical himself before seeing a video of a Holtec storage container surviving a mock missile strike. ""When I'm able to explain this and educate people, they support it.""

Pump-jacks bob among the houses, and the streets are jammed with traffic from the surrounding oil fields.
Down a quiet side street, Rose Gardner, an opponent of both proposals, is taking three grandchildren for a walk.

Nathan Rott/NPR There is a history here, though, of nuclear projects that she's well aware of.
Twenty years ago, nearby, the U.S. government built the country's only deep-underground storage facility for radioactive material, the Waste Isolation Pilot Project. It's designed to store lower-level nuclear waste from research laboratories and weapons facilities around the country.
A similar debate played out before the construction of that facility. Supporters touted the jobs and income it would bring. Opponents worried about safety. And there have been issues .
New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is mindful of those and is unequivocal in her feelings about Holtec's proposal.
""There's nobody that's been able to demonstrate to me that there isn't risk here,"" she says. ""There is risk. We need to be clear about that. I don't think it's the right decision for the state.""
Back at the proposed site for Holtec's interim storage facility, a sign lies on its side, uprooted from the ground and punctured with bullet holes.
Asked if it should be seen as an indication of the plan's local support, former state legislator John Heaton laughs.
""You know how it is in the Wild West,"" he says. ""People with guns can't resist putting holes in any sign anywhere.""

The Tymoshenko brief
The political consulting of that era is the origin of the legal troubles for Craig and Skadden: Manafort helped arrange for Ukraine's then-pro-Russian government to hire the law firm at the time the regime was Manafort's client. A 'Toothless' Old Law Could Have New Fangs, Thanks To Robert Mueller
Skadden was tasked with preparing a report defending the Ukrainian prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.
The case against her was considered thin and she was widely viewed as the victim of a kangaroo trial designed to punish a political enemy of the government. That's why Ukraine's then-President Viktor Yanukovych likely wanted his consultant, Manafort, to try to rehabilitate the case against her and the image of Ukraine in the West.
To so do, Manafort sought the services of Skadden and its well-connected attorneys. The firm wrote a report validating the Tymoshenko prosecution .
At the time, Manafort and the team of American lawyers and lobbyists working on the account never registered their activities with the Justice Department.
Justice Department lawyer Andrew Weissmann, part of the team that prosecuted Manafort, later told a sentencing judge that ""this deliberate effort to obscure the facts undermines our political discourse.""
Tymoshenko later was freed from prison after a popular uprising that drove Yanukovych from office. He fled to exile in Russia. That also meant the end of lucrative business for Manafort and Gates. Paul Manafort Sentenced To 3.5 More Years In Prison; New State Indictment Announced
The laws they broke in response to the withering of their Ukraine income became the subject of separate criminal cases.
Manafort has been sentenced to about 7 1/2 years in federal prison for his Ukraine-connected crimes and others; Gates has pleaded guilty to federal charges but has been cooperating with investigators and has not yet been sentenced.
Craig's defense preparations
Craig appears to have been expecting action by prosecutors for some time; he retained attorney Taylor in the autumn of last year.
Taylor had largely been silent about Craig's case until Wednesday; he reportedly said around the time he was hired that Craig hadn't had any requirement to register under FARA.
According to the indictment released on Thursday, the FARA unit told Craig he didn't need to register because of its ""reliance on Craig's representations and having been misled by Craig.""
Craig has been a top player in Democratic politics for many years. He joined the administration of President Bill Clinton to help with the impeachment case brought by Republicans in Congress and then later became White House counsel to President Barack Obama.
As the top lawyer in that era, he dealt with Obama's attempts to close the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and other controversial counterterrorism issues."

Prosecutors allege that Avenatti — who most famously represented Stormy Daniels in the adult film actress's case against President Trump — stole millions of dollars from his clients.
Those clients include ""Client 1,"" a man who is paraplegic and who won a $4 million settlement from Los Angeles County. Prosecutors allege Avenatti drained money from the man's trust account and used the money to finance a coffee business and pay other expenses.
""More than four years later, Client 1 is still waiting to receive his portion of the settlement,"" U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said at a press conference in Los Angeles.
Politics Attorney Michael Avenatti, Sometime Scourge To Trump, Now Faces Federal Charges According to court documents, prosecutors said Avenatti would occasionally send Client 1 ""advance"" payments that didn't exceed $1,900. He also allegedly undermined his paraplegic client's attempt to buy a house and jeopardized his Social Security payments by failing to file paperwork.
Avenatti denied the allegations in posts on Twitter . ""I am entitled to a FULL presumption of innocence and am confident that justice will be done once ALL of the facts are known,"" he wrote. ""I intend to fully fight all charges and plead NOT GUILTY. I look forward to the entire truth being known as opposed to a one-sided version meant to sideline me.""
In addition to Client 1, Hanna said, Avenatti followed a similar pattern with four other clients.
""Mr. Avenatti received the money on behalf of clients, and simply took the money to finance his businesses and personal expenses,"" Hanna said. In one of those instances, he said, Avenatti took some $2.5 million of a client's settlement money and put it toward a private jet.
Avenatti is also accused of failing to pay income taxes — in fact, the federal probe that led to Thursday's indictment began as an IRS investigation in Sept. 2016, as officials were trying to collect debts from Avenatti's coffee business, Tully's Coffee.
Prosecutors also accuse Avenatti of filing fraudulent applications to a bank in Mississippi, to obtain $4.1 million in loans and making false statements when his firm was facing bankruptcy proceedings.
The alleged crimes ""are all linked to one another because money generated from one set of crimes appears in the other sets – typically in the form of payments to lull victims and to prevent Mr. Avenatti's financial house of cards from collapsing,"" said Hanna.
Avenatti is scheduled to be arraigned on April 29 in federal court in Orange County, Calif., the prosecutor's office said.
In March, Avenatti was arrested in New York on separate federal charges and then freed on $300,000 bond.

Celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti, who is already accused of federal financial crimes, has been indicted on 36 counts of embezzlement and fraud by a California federal grand jury, U.S. prosecutors announced Thursday.
If Avenatti is found guilty of all charges in the new indictment, he could be sentenced to a maximum of 335 years in prison.
The lawyer had a rapid rise to fame, most prominently representing Stormy Daniels in the adult film actress's case against President Trump. He was a regular guest on cable news programs and even floated a Democratic presidential campaign, during which he told crowds: ""I say, 'When they go low, we hit harder.' ""
Now prosecutors allege that Avenatti stole millions of dollars from his clients.
Those clients include ""Client 1,"" a man who is paraplegic and who won a $4 million settlement from Los Angeles County. Prosecutors allege Avenatti drained money from the man's trust account and used the money to finance a coffee business and pay other expenses.
""More than four years later, Client 1 is still waiting to receive his portion of the settlement,"" U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said at a news conference in Los Angeles.
Politics Attorney Michael Avenatti, Sometime Scourge To Trump, Now Faces Federal Charges According to court documents, prosecutors say Avenatti would occasionally send Client 1 ""advance"" payments that didn't exceed $1,900. He also allegedly undermined his paraplegic client's attempt to buy a house and jeopardized his Social Security payments by failing to file paperwork.
In an emailed statement, law firm Greenberg Gross LLP identified Client 1 as a man named Geoffrey Johnson.
""Mr. Johnson is the victim of an appalling fraud perpetrated by the one person who owed him loyalty and honesty most of all: his own lawyer,"" said attorney Josh Robbins. ""Mr. Avenatti stole millions of dollars that were meant to compensate Mr. Johnson for a devastating injury, spent it on his own lavish lifestyle, then lied about it to Mr. Johnson for years to cover his tracks. His actions have left Mr. Johnson destitute.""
Avenatti denied the allegations in posts on Twitter . ""I am entitled to a FULL presumption of innocence and am confident that justice will be done once ALL of the facts are known,"" he wrote. ""I intend to fully fight all charges and plead NOT GUILTY. I look forward to the entire truth being known as opposed to a one-sided version meant to sideline me.""

""Mr. Avenatti received the money on behalf of clients and simply took the money to finance his businesses and personal expenses,"" Hanna said. In one of those instances, he said, Avenatti took some $2.5 million of a client's settlement money and put it toward a private jet.
""As an attorney, holding your clients' money in trust is one of your highest duties. It is Lawyer 101: You do not steal your clients' money,"" said Hanna.
Avenatti is accused of failing to pay income taxes — in fact, the federal probe that led to Thursday's indictment began as an IRS investigation in September 2016 as officials were trying to collect debts from Avenatti's coffee business, Tully's Coffee.
""The indictment paints the picture of an individual who began to run afoul with the IRS nearly a decade ago,"" Ryan Korner, acting special agent in charge with the IRS' Criminal Investigation division, told reporters.
Prosecutors also accuse Avenatti of filing fraudulent applications to a bank in Mississippi to obtain $4.1 million in loans and making false statements when his firm was facing bankruptcy proceedings.
The alleged crimes ""are all linked to one another because money generated from one set of crimes appears in the other sets — typically in the form of payments to lull victims and to prevent Mr. Avenatti's financial house of cards from collapsing,"" said Hanna.
Avenatti is scheduled to be arraigned on April 29 in federal court in Orange County, Calif., the prosecutor's office said.
In March, Avenatti was arrested in New York on separate federal charges and then freed on $300,000 bond.
As NPR's Carrie Johnson reported , authorities ""say he tried to extract more than $20 million from shoe giant Nike by threatening to use his ability to attract public attention if the company failed to meet his financial demands.""
After the charges were announced last month, Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, said in a statement that she was ""saddened but not shocked.""
""I made the decision more than a month ago to terminate Michael's services after discovering that he had dealt with me extremely dishonestly and there will be more announcements to come,"" she said."

NASA/NOAA GOES Project Interstates were closed for hundreds of miles in the Midwest and Plains Thursday, as a ""bomb cyclone"" brought a major winter storm to states in those regions. Some towns that just days ago were experiencing sunshine and temperate weather are now under 1 or 2 feet of snow.
Most of Nebraska and South Dakota remained under a blizzard warning Thursday afternoon, as snow continued to cause dangerous conditions. Minnesota, Wisconsin and much of Michigan's Upper Peninsula face a winter storm warning. Eastern North Dakota is under a flood warning.
Parts of South Dakota have seen up to 18 inches of snow, and ""thunder snow"" — snow that falls along with the crash of thunder and the flash of lightning — was also reported in the central part of the state. ""It's essentially a thunderstorm, but it's cold enough for snow,"" Mike Connelly, a weather service meteorologist, told the Associated Press.
This morning, Hwy 59 south of Fulda (southwest Minnesota) closed after a stretch of power lines fell. Our supervisor shot this video with a dash-mounted camera while assessing the damage. https://t.co/yhtPwRf2sU for closure updates. @mndotscentral pic.twitter.com/B3IG8Ih47L
— MnDOT (@MnDOTnews) April 11, 2019 Minnesota has faced snowfall rates of up to 2 inches per hour. Hundreds of schools canceled classes Thursday. More than 200 accidents were reported throughout the state. A video from the Minnesota Department of Transportation shows every power line down along a length of Highway 59 near Fulda, in the southeastern side of the state.
In Minnesota, the bad weather will continue through Friday, with winds gusting to more than 50 mph, according to the National Weather Service.
Some of the snow might be tinted orange, the Twin Cities NWS said . ""The color is likely due to dust that was blown by high winds all the way from west Texas.""
Whiteout conditions were reported Wednesday night northeast of Denver to the Nebraska state line, Colorado Public Radio reported . Some major roads were closed for hundreds of miles because of poor visibility and blowing snow. Colorado DOT closed 150 miles of Interstate 76, and Interstate 70 was closed between Kansas and the Denver metro area, CPR said.
In Nebraska, Interstate 80 and Highway 30 were closed on Thursday morning between Lexington and Wyoming — a distance of about 200 miles.
As NPR's Bill Chappell reported , ""the storm came ashore from the Pacific Ocean on Sunday and Monday, bringing heavy rainfall and floods to Oregon"" and leading to evacuations there.
Snow in April is ""certainly not unheard of"" in many of the areas hit by this blizzard, but ""this storm is a big one, and not just for April, but any time of year,"" said Ian Livingston, a forecaster at the Washington Post .

Guidance On The Words 'Apprehended' And 'Arrested' When Covering Border Crossings,www.npr.org,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/memmos/2019/04/11/712379756/guidance-on-the-words-apprehended-and-arrested-when-covering-border-crossings,"Guidance On The Words 'Apprehended' And 'Arrested' When Covering Border Crossings Facebook
There's an important footnote with U.S. Customs and Border Protection's data . It states that:
""Apprehensions refers to the physical control or temporary detainment of a person who is not lawfully in the U.S. which may or may not result in an arrest.""
Most of the people CBP counts in its data are listed under the heading ""apprehensions.""
Don't simply say, then, that those who have crossed the southern border and been detained have been ""arrested."" Not everyone has been, or will be, charged with a crime. The best practice is to use ""apprehended"" or ""detained"" as the action words when reporting broadly about what is happening to people. Save ""arrested"" for those times when we drill down into the data.
About that data:
When reporting on the recent surge of migrants, many of whom are seeking asylum, there are two categories. As mentioned, the biggest category is migrants who are apprehended after crossing the border between official ports of entry without authorization. The second category is migrants who presented themselves at ports of entry without documentation and were deemed ""inadmissible.""
When referring to the total (the two categories added together), we should say more than 100,000 were ""taken into custody"" or ""detained,"" and we can refer to the migrants as ""unauthorized."" There's more guidance on the language around immigration in this earlier post . Facebook"

Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images Performers rehearse in January 2018 for the controversial Hungarian State Opera production of George Gershwin's opera Porgy and Bess .
Attila Kisbenedek/AFP/Getty Images In January 2018, the Hungarian State Opera in Budapest was widely criticized for staging the George Gershwin opera Porgy and Bess — whose story wrestles with racism, drug abuse and poverty — with a predominantly white cast, despite the fact that the Gershwin estate requires performances to feature an all-black cast.
Now, the Hungarian production is back for another series of performances of Porgy this month — and its nearly all-white cast was reportedly asked to sign testimonials saying that they were African-American.
The Hungarian news website Index said that it had obtained the statement, and published it last Friday. According to Index, it reads: ""African-American origin and consciousness are an integral part of my identity. That's why I am especially pleased to be able to play George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess ."" The Hungarian television network ATV reported that a majority of the cast — 15 out 28 performers— signed the statement.
The request for such an affidavit was allegedly made by the company's general director, Szilveszter Ókovács.
The 1935 opera was a collaboration between three white creators, with music by George Gershwin and a libretto by Ira Gershwin and novelist DuBose Heyward (who had written the 1925 novel Porgy , from which the opera was adapted). It was created for black performers — and when it licenses the work, the Gershwin estate specifically stipulates that any performances feature an all-black cast. (According to Hungarian media, the performers are reportedly using photocopied music.)
The performances in Budapest, which continue through next Wednesday night, bear a disclaimer of sorts on the opera company's website and in the venue: ""The manner in which this production of Porgy and Bess is being produced is unauthorized and is contrary to the requirements for the presentation of the work.""
Index approached Ókovács about the race affidavit. He responded with a lengthy set of questions of his own, including: ""What is the color of all black cast on the Pantone scale? One [ sic ] of Barack Obama's grandparents was 'white': would he think he would be right in Porgy and Bess ? Can you do that at all? ... George Gershwin, [from] a Ukrainian Jewish family migrating to America, would not be allowed on the stage of his own work because of his skin color and / or origin and with reference to him. Do you find this okay? ... Do you not think that this whole rotten and odorous provision should be ignored by all opera houses?""
For the Hungarian production, director András Almási-Tóth moved the opera's setting to an airplane hangar, with the characters shifted to be refugees from an unnamed place and crisis.
YouTube ""This piece [has] almost disappeared from the world of opera for the well-known legal restrictions,"" Almási-Tóth said in a promotional trailer for the production posted in January 2018. ""Now we will have a sort of non-replica production, as we do not need to have an all-black cast."" On the Hungarian opera company's website, there is a small section marked ""The critics respond,"" with a Quote: from a single Hungarian reviewer, who argues, in essence, that Porgy is too important — and, oddly, ""melodious"" — to have its performances restricted to black artists.
In New York, the Metropolitan Opera will open its 2019-20 season in September with a new production of Porgy -- the work's first presentation at the house in almost three decades. The Met is hiring an all-black chorus for the Porgy performances; its regular chorus currently includes six black singers out of about 81 total. ""Certainly it's more complicated, but it's worth the complications because it's such a great piece,"" Met general manager Peter Gelb told the AP. There's a complex history there, too: George Gershwin turned down a Met commission for Porgy and Bess in 1935, because the New York company wanted to use its white chorus singers performing in blackface. Instead, the work premiered in Boston before moving to Broadway.
Last June, the Hungarian State Opera canceled 15 performances of Billy Elliot , the musical about a young boy growing up in an English coal-mining community who dreams of becoming a ballet dancer. Just before the show was scheduled to start its run, an article in the conservative newspaper Magyar Idők called the show ""pointed and unrestrained gay propaganda.""
The paper is aligned with the government of the country's nationalist, hard-right prime minister Viktor Orban; according to the BBC , the same newspaper has published attacks against a variety of ""liberal, globalist and cosmopolitan ideas"" that it says is encoded in a variety of Hungarian media platforms and institutions, including the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the official state news agency. The Billy Elliot production was also overseen by Ókovács."

Several 2020 Democratic candidates support Medicare for All, but what would that proposal look like in action?
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
If there's a single issue that's defining the Democratic field of 2020 presidential candidates, it's health care, Medicare for All, to be precise.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KAMALA HARRIS: I believe the solution - and I'm - and I'm - actually feel very strongly about this - is that we need to have Medicare for All
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ELIZABETH WARREN: Medicare for All is all about...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BETO O'ROURKE: The best way to get there is by having Medicare for All.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BERNIE SANDERS: The strengths of a Medicare for All program...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: That's why I am for Medicare for All.
SHAPIRO: When Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders unveiled his 2020 Medicare plan for all this week, several other Democratic presidential candidates stood alongside him.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
SANDERS: The American people want and we are going to deliver a Medicare for All single-payer system.
SHAPIRO: So what would that system look like? NPR's health policy correspondent Alison Kodjak is here to talk us through that. Hi, Alison.
ALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.
SHAPIRO: Start with a bit of history. Where did the idea of Medicare for All begin?
KODJAK: So the idea of, like, a government-funded, universal health coverage goes way back to the Depression. Franklin Delano Roosevelt convened a committee on economic security in the midst of that economic crisis, and they advocated not only Social Security, but they wanted to include national health insurance in the system. That program failed because of opposition mostly from doctors.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
FRANKLIN D ROOSEVELT: We can never insure 100 percent of the population against 100 percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection.
KODJAK: Thirty years later, Medicare was passed into law.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: President and Mrs. Johnson and Vice President Humphrey arrive for ceremonies that will make the Medicare bill a part of Social Security coverage.
KODJAK: It didn't cover everybody either. It only covered retirees.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The new bill expands the 30-year-old Social Security program to provide hospital care, nursing home care, home nursing service and outpatient treatment for those over 65.
KODJAK: So universal coverage, the idea of it, has been on the table for, in one form or another, ever since the 1930s.
SHAPIRO: So, in the present day, when we hear all these Democratic presidential candidates talk about Medicare for All, what does that proposal they're talking about right now mean?
KODJAK: That proposal that came out this week, it would eliminate private health insurance altogether, have the government be the single payer for people's health care. Everybody would get coverage. Hospitals, if they're private now, would stay private. Doctors would remain in the private sector. But the government would be the sole payer of health care, and everybody would get insurance.
SHAPIRO: And what would that mean for patients, especially people like you and I who get coverage through our employer right now?
KODJAK: Well, we'd no longer get coverage through our employer. We'd get it through this government health insurance plan. The benefits might be much more generous than we have now. We wouldn't have to pay part of the premium. There would be no copayments under this plan.
But that's a big sticking point. How do you pay for that? It would have to be through tax increases of some sort because it would increase government spending. The one thing to keep in mind is that we already pay a huge amount for health care in this country, almost $4 trillion a year.
So you're paying one way or another. Your private insurance is expensive. An average family plan provided through employers is about $20,000 dollars a year. And that often includes copayments and deductibles.
SHAPIRO: That's a lot of money going to the insurance companies.
KODJAK: Sure is.
SHAPIRO: What happens to them under this plan?
KODJAK: Well, that's the big question. Senator Sanders was asked about it earlier today on CBS.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
SANDERS: Under Medicare for All, we cover all basic health care needs. I suppose if you want to make yourself look a little bit more beautiful, you want to work on that nose, your ears, they can do that.
ED O'KEEFE: So basically Blue Cross Blue Shield would be reduced to nose jobs.
SANDERS: Something like that.
KODJAK: Yeah. So if that's the case, the insurance industry, as it stands now, would shrink quite a lot. Today, about 540,000 people work in health insurance. Now, some of those people would probably get jobs with the government, but it would be a big disruption.
SHAPIRO: Yeah. And health care is about 18 percent of the U.S. GDP. So we're talking about a huge shake-up for the economy. What are the implications of that drastic of a change to the system?
KODJAK: Yeah, it is a huge part of the economy. Most economists don't really see that as a good thing, that we shouldn't be spending that much on health insurance and health care in this country. So one goal of moving to a single-payer plan like this would be to make the system less expensive. There'd be no profit motive. There'd be fewer administrative costs. Perhaps we would pay doctors or hospitals less for procedures and care. And so if that succeeded, it might cut costs, which economists would applaud. But again, there would be losers, and it would be hugely disruptive to the economy.
SHAPIRO: You mentioned Senator Sanders. Which other 2020 candidates support this and which are not so sure?
KODJAK: Well, at his side in the announcement were Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Senator Elizabeth Warren. Cory Booker has been behind it. So has Kamala Harris. Amy Klobuchar, who's running, has said that she would rather see incremental progress on the Affordable Care Act, protect what we have now and make it better. And there are a lot of others who stand with her and say we should just stick with what we have and improve it.

NYC Restaurant Comes Under Criticism After Marking Itself as 'Clean Chinese Food' : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712409117/nyc-restaurant-comes-under-criticism-after-marking-itself-as-clean-chinese-food,"NYC Restaurant Comes Under Criticism After Marking Itself as 'Clean Chinese Food' NYC Restaurant Comes Under Criticism After Marking Itself as 'Clean Chinese Food' Embed Embed
A new restaurant in New York City is catching a lot of heat for marketing itself as ""clean Chinese food."" San Francisco Chronicle restaurant critic Soleil Ho talks about why with NPR's Ailsa Chang.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
A new Chinese restaurant that opened in New York City is catching a lot of heat for marketing itself as so-called clean Chinese food. The place is called Lucky Lee's, and the chef and owner is Arielle Haspel, a nutritionist. She said she wanted to celebrate the Chinese food she and her Jewish family grew up with, but without the gluten, refined sugar or additives she found in a lot of the Chinese food she's eaten. For example, she posted this about the dish lo mein on Instagram - you said it makes you feel bloated and icky the next day, well, wait until you slurp up our high lo mein.
With us now to talk about all of this is restaurant critic Soleil Ho of the San Francisco Chronicle. Welcome.
SOLEIL HO: Hi.
CHANG: So just to be clear, this outrage, it isn't just about the fact that some white people are selling Chinese food, right? It's way more complicated than that.
HO: Absolutely. It's not about white people cooking Chinese food. I think people who talk and think a lot about cultural appropriation are really careful with our words because the conversation tends to get boiled down to that, but that's not the problem.
CHANG: So what kind of stereotypes about Chinese food is Lucky Lee's accused of trafficking in?
HO: When you use the language of clean when you talk about food, I think it's logical to think about what isn't clean, right? Like, what are you opposing? What are you going against? And so the flip side of clean is dirty.
CHANG: Right.
HO: It's untrustworthy. It's greasy. But that's a stereotype of Chinese restaurants and Asian food that reflects a lot of stereotypes about the people as well, that they're untrustworthy, that they're dirty, that you don't know if they're going to sneak dog meat into your meal, right? That sort of thing.
CHANG: Exactly. And also, a lot of those stereotypes about Chinese food that we're talking about are about Americanized Chinese food. You know, like, that it's greasy or overly sweet. We're talking about dishes like lo mein, kung pao chicken, sweet and sour pork. That's not real Chinese food.
HO: Yeah. I mean, it's food that was adapted by the people who started these restaurants, these working class Chinese immigrants, to fit the market they were in, right? When you think about Joyce Chen, for instance, who was this historic really important figure in Chinese-American cuisine, she brought Northern Chinese food to Boston, to New England. And she was often called the Julia Child of Chinese food. She called dumplings Peking ravioli to fit the market...
CHANG: Yeah.
HO: ...Because so many of her customers were Italians. And so, you know, that is part of the cycle of acclimation, of assimilation and really, at the bottom line, trying to sell your food so your kids can go to college.
CHANG: Right, immigrants trying to survive, so they cater to American palates.
HO: Yes.
CHANG: Now, when someone who is white makes food from a non-white culture, what is the difference between culinary appropriation and simply culinary appreciation? Where's the line?
HO: To me - and this sounds so simple, but it's not - it's respect. So do you respect the people who came before you who blazed the trail, who made it so everyone knows what a pot sticker is? You know what I mean? Or are you disrespecting those people and saying what they've made is garbage, that their struggles and their lives don't mean anything to you?
And so that's a really dramatic juxtaposition, but I do think that that is the difference. Because the actual act of cooking the food that doesn't belong to you, that, in a vacuum, is fine. But when you think about these bigger systemic issues that keep people out of the same opportunities that you have, you know, that's where you have to start thinking, OK, what can I do that's proactive that actually shares the wealth that's been so sequestered along racial lines for so long?
CHANG: Soleil Ho is the restaurant critic for the San Francisco Chronicle. Thank you very much for joining us.

Justice Department Charges WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange : NPR,www.npr.org,Ryan Lucas,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712409064/justice-department-charges-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange,"Justice Department Charges WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange Justice Department Charges WikiLeaks Founder Julian Assange Embed Embed
After years of anticipation, the Justice Department is charging Julian Assange. He is in custody in London after being ejected from Ecuador's embassy there.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
All right, here to talk through all of this now is NPR's justice reporter Ryan Lucas. Hey, Ryan.
RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Hi there.
CHANG: So what more can you tell us about the indictment today?
LUCAS: Well, Assange has been charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. In layman's terms, what that means is a computer-hacking conspiracy. The indictment alleges that back in March of 2010, Assange agreed to help the then-U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning break a password to Defense Department computers. That would have given Manning access to more classified documents and communications and also would have allowed her to kind of hide her tracks.
The indictment does not say whether Assange and Manning ever succeeded in this, but Manning of course served jail time over this massive leak of classified information.
CHANG: Right. And we've had hints that Assange could face criminal charges here in the U.S., right?
LUCAS: That's right. He was in the crosshairs of the Justice Department during the Obama administration. So this goes back many years. The Obama Justice Department considered bringing charges. Ultimately it did not. That was at least in part because WikiLeaks does a lot of things that news organizations do. There were concerns about what sort of precedent bringing charges against WikiLeaks...
CHANG: Yeah.
LUCAS: ...Might set. That's why I think that this computer hacking conspiracy charge today is interesting. It's narrow. It's not about the publication of leaked information or espionage. It seems to kind of sidestep the press freedom issues and First Amendment concerns.
CHANG: Right. It's very narrow. So the charge against Assange is not related in any way to 2016 or the Russia investigation, right?
LUCAS: No.
CHANG: OK.
LUCAS: No. This is not related to that. Wikileaks did, as you have noted, play a very big role in the 2016 U.S. election. We can all remember how it published the Democratic emails that the U.S. government says were hacked by Russia, passed on to WikiLeaks.
Special counsel Robert Mueller's team has alleged that WikiLeaks discussed actually with Russian intelligence operations the best time to publish those hacked emails in order to influence the election. It's unclear whether WikiLeaks knew that it was actually dealing with Russian intelligence.
But the bottom line for your question, no, the indictment does not address WikiLeaks' role in the 2016 election. All of that said, the U.S. government's frustrations with WikiLeaks go back well before 2016.
CHANG: Now, there are a lot of people out there who think of WikiLeaks as journalism. How would you characterize the U.S. government's view of WikiLeaks?
LUCAS: Well, the strongest thing that we've heard out of a U.S. government official that I can recall about Wikileaks and Assange came from Mike Pompeo back when he was CIA director. Here's how he described WikiLeaks.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MIKE POMPEO: It's time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is - a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia.
LUCAS: And there is a long list of things that WikiLeaks has published over the years that has angered the U.S. government. That includes the massive leaks of documents on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that Manning was a part of. There's leaks of State Department diplomatic cables, of course WikiLeaks' role in the 2016 election. Even more recently, though, WikiLeaks has published CIA documents about the agency's hacking tools.
American officials have argued for a long time that the leaks that WikiLeaks has been a part of have harmed U.S. national security. And they say that Wikileaks overwhelmingly focuses on the U.S. government, that it does not put the same sort of scrutiny on other governments, particularly authoritarian ones such as Russia. Pompeo, in his speech back in 2017 when he was CIA director - he even went so far as to accuse Wikileaks of being supported by authoritarian countries.
CHANG: Wow. I mean, that said, WikiLeaks does have a lot of supporters around the entire world.
LUCAS: Absolutely, absolutely. And what WikiLeaks' supporters say is that the organization is exposing government wrongdoing; it is shining a spotlight on government secrets. And what they argue is that in this regard, WikiLeaks really isn't any different than a media organization.
Assange's lawyer here in the U.S., Barry Pollack - he hit on that point today. And we're likely to hear this a lot as this case proceeds. What he said was that the charge against Assange boils down to encouraging a source, to provide information and then trying to protect that source. And he says that journalists around the world should be deeply troubled by the criminal charges against Assange.
CHANG: All right, so what happens next in this case?
LUCAS: Well, Assange is in the custody of British authorities at the moment. The Justice Department is working with them to get him extradited here to the U.S. And the Justice Department has until mid-June to present the materials to support their effort to get him over here. Assange's lawyer in the U.K. has said he will fight this. And so we're going to have to wait for this to play out.
CHANG: All right, that's NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas. Thanks, Ryan.

Sudan's military deposed longtime ruler Omar al-Bashir. His ouster comes after months of demonstrations by Sudanese angered by a spike in the cost of living and broad anti-government protests.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
After nearly 30 years in power, Sudan's autocratic leader is out in a military coup. Sudan's defense minister announced the news on state TV.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORING)
AHMED AWAD IBN AUF: (Foreign language spoken).
SHAPIRO: He said President Omar al-Bashir had been arrested, and the army would oversee a two-year transition period. This follows months of unprecedented demonstrations seeking his ouster. NPR's Eyder Peralta joins us now with the latest. Hi, Eyder.
EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.
SHAPIRO: First, just tell us what happened today.
PERALTA: So for a few days, now thousands of protesters have been camping near President Omar al-Bashir's palace. They were calling for his ouster. And today, people woke up to military songs on state TV. Tanks started rolling across the streets of the capital Khartoum, and troops surrounded the presidential palace. And at that point, everyone sort of figured out what was happening, and they flooded the streets.
It was absolute elation. Thousands of people - young people, old people, kids - they poured out onto the streets. They sang. They chanted. They flashed the victory sign. And hours later, the country's defense minister came on state TV. He was wearing his military uniform. And he read a statement. This was a classic coup d'etat. President Omar al-Bashir had been arrested and thrown out of power by his own military.
And it's really worth pausing on that, Ari, because Omar al-Bashir has been just one of the most ruthless tyrants on the African continent. In the '90s, the U.S. accused him of giving Osama bin Laden a place to hide. And at home, his security forces acted with just unrestrained violence. He tried to extinguish a rebellion in the south with a bloody war. And he was charged with war crimes, with genocide, for what his military did in Darfur.
Omar al-Bashir has the distinction of being the only sitting president to have had a warrant out for his arrest from the International Criminal Court. So his demise is big. This is a historic moment for the continent and the Arab world.
SHAPIRO: And do you know where he is? Is he likely to be brought to justice?
PERALTA: We don't, actually. All the military has said is that he is under arrest, quote, ""someplace safe."" But where he is has not been revealed.
SHAPIRO: As we said, this comes after months of anti-government protests. What are the protesters you've talked to today saying about this?
PERALTA: They were looking for the regime to fall. They wanted to oust the whole government and all of its affiliated security forces. I spoke to Dalia al-Rubaie (ph), a member of one of the opposition parties. And she says one of their demands is for the military to hand over power to a civilian transitional government. And this coup just means that the same ruling party, the NCP, is still in charge. Let's listen to a bit of what she told me.
DALIA AL-RUBI: It's completely unacceptable. You know, the assumption that people will actually believe that this is not another face of the NCP is really quite insulting. And they're underestimating the knowledge and awareness and commitment of the people in the streets and their convictions for change.
PERALTA: So she says protesters will stay on the streets.
SHAPIRO: And there's going to be this two-year interim government. What does the future hold for Sudan?
PERALTA: I think the stage is set for some kind of confrontation between protesters and the military because, you know, the military says there will be a three-month state of emergency. And they say there is now a night time curfew.
So will the protesters defy the curfew? Will the military continue to allow mass protests? Or, you know, will they react violently, as they have in the very recent past? That's hard to tell. But I think what we know for sure is that this coup against Omar al-Bashir has not resolved the political crisis in Sudan.
SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Eyder Peralta. Thank you so much, Eyder.

Julian Assange, founder of Wikileaks, was arrested in London Thursday. He is charged with a single count of conspiracy related to the release of secret U.S. government documents in 2010.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
For nearly seven years, WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange has been holed up in Ecuador's Embassy in London. That ended earlier today when Assange was forcibly taken into custody and dragged out of the embassy by London police. U.S. authorities are charging him with conspiring to break into a government computer and stealing classified documents, documents he later posted. NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik walks us through Assange's legacy and the surprising reach of his influence.
DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: As a candidate, Donald Trump told voters he loved WikiLeaks - loved them - in 2016 as it dumped thousands of emails sent by top Democrats online and damaged Hillary Clinton's campaign in the process.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: This WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable. It tells you the inner-heart. You've got to read it.
FOLKENFLIK: Questioned by reporters today. The love was gone.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: I know nothing about WikiLeaks. It's not my thing. And I know there is something having to do with Julian Assange. I...
FOLKENFLIK: Earlier today, British police dragged Assange out of the Ecuadorian Embassy, his look disheveled, his beard long and white and as unkempt as David Letterman's. You'll hear Assange's voice here.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JULIAN ASSANGE: They must resist. The U.K. will resist. Resist this (inaudible) by the Trump administration.
FOLKENFLIK: For years, WikiLeaks has posted big caches of information often causing uproars and calls for government reform. Now Assange finds himself dubbed a narcissist by a British judge who says Assange violated his bail terms there. Assange appears likely to be extradited to face charges here in the United States, saying that he conspired with a source in 2010 to hack into secret government accounts to gain access to classified military records.
Nine years ago, I did a story for NPR to ask the question - was Assange an activist and whistleblower, or was he a journalist? Assange gave himself the journalistic title of editor-in-chief. Here's Glenn Greenwald, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and frequent critic of the U.S. national security establishment. He spoke to NPR earlier today.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
GLENN GREENWALD: Prosecuting Julian Assange in connection with publishing secret documents that showed U.S. war crimes is one of the gravest threats to press freedom possibly imaginable.
FOLKENFLIK: Some American officials contend Assange is a criminal. Here's what we know. Assange is a 47-year-old Australian, basically an anarchist deeply distrusting of authority, even more deeply critical of U.S. secrets and the consequences of U.S. military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning served seven years in jail for her role in giving more than 700,000 secret documents and records to WikiLeaks, but she would not testify against the group or Assange. And WikiLeaks influenced a raft of digital document leaks, national security leaks that toppled governments, set journalistic agendas and defined political debates around the world...
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Our breaking news this evening - his name is Edward Snowden. He's an American former CIA employee and computer technician. Today he came out as the leaker of classified NSA documents that spell out a secret surveillance program.
FOLKENFLIK: ...And financial scandal known as the Panama Papers, implicating politicians and business leaders.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: The leak of more than 11 million records is the largest in the history of journalism. The material was analyzed for a year by more than 370 journalists from over 40 countries.
FOLKENFLIK: In those cases, leakers worked with established news organizations which vetted and verified the information they posted. During the 2016 campaign, WikiLeaks posted the emails from the Democrats on its own authority. And Assange suggested the leaks came from a slain Democratic staffer named Seth Rich, killed in summer 2016.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ASSANGE: We don't comment on who our sources are.
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Then why make the suggestion about a young guy being shot in the streets of Washington?
ASSANGE: Because we have to understand how high the stakes are in the United States.
FOLKENFLIK: Assange's remarks in that Dutch TV interview and elsewhere were shown to be deeply misleading. U.S. intelligence chiefs and a Senate panel have concluded that the Russians were behind the hacks and that they ensured WikiLeaks got the Democratic documents - though that's not related to the charge he would face here in the United States. A journalist, an activist, a whistleblower, a tool of foreign powers - all questions unlikely to be settled in court. David Folkenflik, NPR News, New York. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Whistleblower Protection Act Has Earned Bipartisan Support In The Last 30 Years,www.npr.org,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712409109/whistleblower-protection-act-has-earned-bipartisan-support-in-the-last-30-years,"The law providing legal protection for whistleblowers passed 30 years ago and lawmakers from both parties agree those willing to come forward to report abuse or misdeeds are needed for accountability.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
The question of whether Julian Assange is a whistleblower may not be easy to answer, but there are many cases where the situation is much clearer, people who came forward to report abuse or misdeeds.
This week marks 30 years of a law that shields those who speak out from retaliation. It's called the Whistleblower Protection Act. NPR's Tim Mak reports the number of people exposing government wrongdoing has gone up and so has bipartisan support for protecting them.
TIM MAK, BYLINE: When you become a whistleblower, it feels like the whole world turns against you. You could lose your entire career for speaking out.
ROBERT MACLEAN: Everybody in my neighborhood and my family thought I was insane and I was fighting a futile fight.
MAK: That's how it felt for Robert MacLean, a federal air marshal who, in 2003, told the public that the TSA canceled air marshal coverage on long-haul flights to cover budget shortfalls.
MACLEAN: It's infuriating because you know what the truth is, and the officials know what the truth is. But they're going to ignore you.
MAK: The TSA reversed its position, but it also fired him for releasing information about threats to U.S. aviation. MacLean fought it, winning a Supreme Court battle for reinstatement in 2015. Then he was fired again this year. Despite the risks, whistleblowers are key sources for Congressional and federal government watchdogs to uncover internal wrongdoing.
TOM DEVINE: The common characteristic is that they have to act on their knowledge in order to be true to themselves.
MAK: As the legal director of the Government Accountability Project, a nonpartisan law firm that aids whistleblowers, Tom Devine has worked with about 7,000 over 40 years. He helps whistleblowers by providing them a legal defense and says he sees one common trait in their motivations for going public.
T DEVINE: If they don't, what they concealed is something that'll be haunting them like a cancer in their soul for the rest of their lives, particularly if there's some consequences from them not speaking out.
MAK: And more are choosing to speak out. The number of whistleblowers in federal agencies have increased dramatically over the last 30 years. The Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency unrelated to special counsel Robert Mueller, is tasked with protecting federal whistleblowers from retaliation.
In 1988, the office received just 120 whistleblower disclosures. Last year, the OSC received 1,559 new cases, the fifth year they've received more than 1,500.
T DEVINE: When I first came to the Government Accountability Project, whistleblowers were generally considered nutty or traitors, you know, betraying their colleagues.
MAK: That's Tom Devine again, who says they're now being hailed as a check on government abuses. And as the cultural view towards whistleblowers have changed, so had the legal protections, which have been updated over the past 30 years and most recently in 2012.
Congressman Gerry Connolly, who chairs the oversight subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the law, says it's essential for keeping government honest.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
GERRY CONNOLLY: I'm glad we have it. I think it is an important tool in accountability.
MAK: At a time where left and right can't seem to agree on legislative priorities or even which topics are worthy of congressional investigation, they both agree on whistleblower protection but for different reasons. Pete Sepp from the conservative National Taxpayers Union explains it this way.
PETE SEPP: As a fiscal conservative, whistleblower protection means taxpayer protection.
MAK: And here's Shanna Devine from the progressive advocacy group Public Citizen.
SHANNA DEVINE: Whistleblowers are the public's eyes and ears to abuses of power that betray the public trust.
MAK: This consensus is a strong assurance of keeping or even strengthening these safeguards in years to come. Tim Mak, NPR News, Washington.

House Democrats Gather For Annual Retreat Ahead Of 100-Day Mark For New Congress,www.npr.org,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712409095/house-democrats-gather-for-annual-retreat-ahead-of-100-day-mark-for-new-congress,"The new Congress is about to hit the first 100 days milestone. A new Democratic House majority means a divided Washington with new voices, big debates and mixed results.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
House Democrats have left Washington for suburban Virginia, where they're holding their annual retreat right now. Their new majority in the House ended Republican control of Washington, and now they're about to mark 100 days in power.
Here to talk about what the Democrats have accomplished so far is NPR congressional correspondent Susan Davis. She's at the retreat right now. Hey, Sue.
SUSAN DAVIS, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.
CHANG: So as we're nearing this 100-day mark, what would you say House Democrats have to show for themselves so far?
DAVIS: Well, I think the days of Rose Garden signing ceremonies are over for now in Washington.
(LAUGHTER)
DAVIS: If you're talking about legislation that has become law, the most significant achievement is probably the spending bill that ended the longest government shutdown in history.
CHANG: Yeah.
DAVIS: But that has also led to a fight over a national emergency declaration that has put Democrats on - well, on a long-term fight with the president. So I'm not sure anyone's really out there calling that a clear win for the new majority.
But with divided government, I think Democrats see a lot of their purpose is about creating a contrast with the president and with the Republican Party. And when - if you look at the legislation that they are - have already passed and are soon to pass, it does kind of tell you a story in that one of the throughlines in this agenda is the Democratic Party is really advocating for a much bigger role for the federal government in day-to-day life here. They've done things from past bills to make Election Day a federal holiday, to create automatic voter registration, to mandate federal mandates for equal pay for women. Legislation coming down the pike soon are bills for a federal minimum wage, to increase it to up to $15 an hour.
I also think if you look at the big-idea, philosophical debates the Democratic Party is having right now - Medicare for All, the Green New Deal - it's the kind of thing that reminds people that the Democratic Party is, you know - it's a party of bigger government. That's not a new idea, but in 2019, I think they're a lot less unapologetic about that fact.
CHANG: Yeah. But at the same time, this idea of bigger government, I mean, hasn't that opened Democrats up to more attacks from Republicans and from President Trump, that they're advancing, quote, unquote, ""socialist policies?""
DAVIS: Yes, so you hear that line of attack over and over and over. That is a preview of every Republican attack ad you're probably going to hear in the 2020 battleground races for...
CHANG: Right.
DAVIS: ...The House. I did talk to Rhode Island Democratic Congressman David Cicilline. He's a member of leadership, and I asked him about the socialism attack line that Republicans are lodging about their agenda. And this is what he said.
DAVID CICILLINE: You know, they made those same arguments when Social Security and Medicare were created. It's socialism. You know, it's just an argument that's - they're pulling up from the past.
DAVIS: You know, Democrats just call this line of attack absurd. I talked to many of them today that say they just don't think they're going to be vulnerable to it. And they don't think it will work in 2020.
CHANG: I mean, there is such an ideological divide between Democrats and President Trump. And you mentioned, you know, there's a lot of bills they're introducing that aren't expected to go anywhere. Do you think they can find any common ground?
DAVIS: You know, there's low expectations. But that's always good to have low expectations when we're talking about Congress these days.
CHANG: (Laughter).
DAVIS: I talked to a lot of Democrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, today who - the two things that everyone's going to point to to say the potential for success in this Congress is legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs and potentially, again, an infrastructure bill - the long-promised infrastructure bill of the...
CHANG: Oh, yes.
DAVIS: ...Trump administration. You know, in theory Democrats and Republicans share the end goal here. But when you start to ask about how it would get done, you can see why you should be skeptical. When you ask Democrats about things like infrastructure, and you say, OK, well, how do you want to pay for it? They say, oh, well, we'll roll back the Trump tax cuts. And you have to ask yourself, is it realistic to think that President Trump is going to cut deals that involve rolling back his biggest domestic achievement? That's probably not realistic.
I also think you have to remember in the course of this Congress, one of the big stories is the dozens of investigations that are running into the president, his finances, his family, his administration. And the president - you know, even at the State of the Union he brought this up - he's kind of made it clear that he's not going to be willing to cut deals if he feels like Congress is attacking him or, as he said, if there's going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.
CHANG: I mean, speaking of cutting deals, he will have to be cutting those deals with Speaker Nancy Pelosi. How would you describe their relationship right now?
DAVIS: You know, it's been confrontational from the start. I think that's going to set the expectation for the tone here. You know, Pelosi has told us, and she told us today, that she is talking on the phone with Donald Trump. They've been having conversations about the drug bills and infrastructure bills.
CHANG: OK.
DAVIS: She says she's going to be optimistic. She has a record of cutting deals with Republican presidents.
CHANG: All right.
DAVIS: She did with George W. Bush. We'll see what happens.
CHANG: And we'll have to end it there. NPR's Susan Davis. Thanks, Sue.
DAVIS: You're welcome.

Former Secretary Of Defense Leon Panetta Discusses Arrest Of Julian Assange,www.npr.org,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712409071/former-secretary-of-defense-leon-panetta-discusses-arrest-of-julian-assange,"Former Secretary Of Defense Leon Panetta Discusses Arrest Of Julian Assange Former Secretary Of Defense Leon Panetta Discusses Arrest Of Julian Assange Embed Embed
NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Leon Panetta, former secretary of defense and CIA director under President Obama, about the arrest of Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
We're joined now by Leon Panetta. He was former defense secretary and CIA director. Secretary Panetta, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
LEON PANETTA: Good to be with you.
SHAPIRO: What was your reaction when you saw the news today of Assange's arrest?
PANETTA: Well, my reaction was that it's time to basically proceed with the indictment against Assange. You know, he spent seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, and he has avoided prosecution for the alleged taking of classified information. So I think it's probably time for Assange to face our judicial system and find out whether or not he bears responsibility for the taking of those classified documents. It could be a very interesting court case in which you'd have to decide the issue of whether or not this really was a journalistic effort or whether it really was the stealing of classified information.
SHAPIRO: You, of course - you've come down on the latter side of that, saying that this is stealing of classified information. How do you view Assange's legacy now that he is finally in custody?
PANETTA: Well, there's no question that what was involved here was probably the largest compromise of classified information in history. And when you combine that with the release of material by Snowden, it has had a pretty significant impact on both the sources and methods that were used in the intelligence community to be able to gather information. So I think that as a result of that and as a result of the impact of releasing this classified information that he ought to be subject to the laws of the United States and face our system of justice. He'll have the opportunity to present his defense, but it's pretty clear that we need to have him face the indictment that has been rendered by our court system in this country.
SHAPIRO: When you were in government, you were very critical of Assange's behavior. From the perspective of where you sit now as a civilian, is there any part of you that admires the scale of what he was able to accomplish?
PANETTA: Well, there's no question that there was a huge amount of attention, particularly to WikiLeaks and the impact of WikiLeaks on the 2016 election. There's no question that as a result of the information that he was able to release, it had a huge impact in terms of our politics, and it had a huge impact in terms of our intelligence community. And, you know, there's no question, as well, that there obviously was some relationship and coordination with Russia in dispersing this information.
So I think there are a lot of important issues here that need to be looked at because in the end, if we care about classified information, if we care about what our intelligence people are doing to try to derive that kind of classified information, then I think it's important that we decide whether or not somebody has the right, on his own, to not only gather that kind of information, but release it. That's an important issue that I think the courts need to look at.
SHAPIRO: I'd like to read you something that Edward Snowden, the former NSA employee who leaked classified material to WikiLeaks - something Snowden tweeted today. He wrote, images of Ecuador's ambassador inviting the U.K. secret police into the embassy to drag a publisher of, like it or not, award-winning journalism out of the building are going to end up in the history books. Assange's critics may cheer, but this is a dark moment for press freedom, Snowden wrote. How do you respond to that?
PANETTA: Well, frankly, I don't have a lot of appreciation for Snowden, who is hiding in Russia and sitting there in a country that doesn't recognize press freedom or the rights that we have in this country and somehow using that argument to defend Assange. If Snowden wants to talk about the rights that we provide in this country, he ought to be brave enough to come here to the United States to face justice along with Assange.
SHAPIRO: You know, Assange's arrest does not necessarily mean the end of WikiLeaks. Do you think this is a final chapter, or do you think the organization will continue?
PANETTA: No, I suspect that, as Churchill said, this is not the end. And it's probably not even the beginning of the end, but it may be the end of the beginning. And I think there's a lot more that we're going to see about WikiLeaks and its impact.
SHAPIRO: Secretary Leon Panetta, former director of the CIA and former secretary of defense. Thanks so much.
PANETTA: OK. You're welcome. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

In a recent cover story for The Atlantic , writer David Frum argues that the political logjam on immigration has led to the radicalization of politics, and the rise of authoritarian ideas.
Too little immigration, and you freeze your country out of the modern world. Too much, or the wrong kind, and you overstress your social-insurance system—and possibly upend your democracy. Choose well, and you build a stronger, richer country for both newcomers and the long-settled. Choose badly, and you aggravate inequality and inflame intergroup hostility. How we choose will shape the future that will in its turn shape us.
He challenges the country to address the questions at the heart of the immigration debate: How many people should we let in to America? And who should those people be?
We talk with Frum about his piece.
We also speak with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas, who has written extensively about his experience as an undocumented immigrant to this country, and founded the media and culture organization Define American.
Here's part of what he wrote for The New York Times in 2011 about his life and career:
There are believed to be 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. We're not always who you think we are. Some pick your strawberries or care for your children. Some are in high school or college. And some, it turns out, write news articles you might read. I grew up here. This is my home. Yet even though I think of myself as an American and consider America my country, my country doesn't think of me as one of its own. Facebook"

Eli Joshua Adé/Universal Pictures Marsai Martin is a star.
If you've seen her as Diane, the younger daughter on ABC's Black-ish , you might already know. Diane is wise, wily, funny and a step ahead of her twin brother, Jack. And while scripts work wonders, you cannot create a character like Diane around an actress who wasn't yet ten years old when she was cast in the role unless the actress in question has the chops for it. Martin's first starring role in a film comes in Little , where she holds the screen opposite comedy powerhouses Issa Rae and Regina Hall. What's more, everyone involved in promoting the movie says it was her idea — which she pitched when she was ten. Now, at 14, she's an executive producer on the film.
The premise of Little is a variation on the body-swap comedy that boomed in the 1980s. Here, we begin with Martin as Jordan Sanders, a 13-year-old who suffers humiliation and swears to never be taken advantage of again. Next thing you know, we flash forward a couple of decades and she's grown up to be Jordan Sanders, a 38-year-old tech boss and nasty bully played by Hall. Jordan is awful to everyone, particularly her long suffering assistant April, played by Rae. A little bit of magic ensues, and one morning, Jordan wakes up to find that she is back in her 13-year-old body, making most of the film a two-hander starring Rae and Martin. As a child, Jordan can't run her company, she can't drive her car, she can't hit on attractive men, and she doesn't fit into any of her beautiful clothes. She tells April her secret, and the two set out to navigate the world for however long it takes for the spell to be somehow broken.
Movies Meet Marsai Martin, The Youngest Executive Producer In Hollywood There's not a lot to the story; it amounts to ""don't be a bully"" and ""love your inner child."" Will Jordan learn to be kinder? Of course. Will she warm up to April? Of course. These are the things you already know. What drives the success or failure of the film is the comedy and the performances.
There are moments when Little fulfills its promise: Martin and Rae play off each other beautifully, Rae is as funny as she is on Insecure and as charming as she is in everything, and Martin is the rare child actor who brings not a bit of preciousness to her performance. Every time someone calls tween Jordan cute or adorable, it clangs wonderfully, because Martin is playing the role with nothing cute or adorable intended. Although they don't particularly resemble each other physically, Martin consistently brings to mind the character we met when Hall played her. They have the same way of talking and standing and insisting, and it never seems implausible that this is the same character in a different body. That's hard to do. It's one of the things that doesn't work in Shazam! , in fact.
Unfortunately, the film needs more comedy and more consistency in the comedy it has. When it's funny, it's really funny, but it's not funny frequently enough. The script comes from both the director, Tina Gordon, and from Tracy Oliver, who worked on Girls Trip . Gordon was one of the writers on Drumline , which means between the two of them, these women have great credentials. But the laughs needed to come faster without quite so much pleasant but unremarkable plot execution.
It would also not feel right not to mention that the film contains a startling transphobic joke early on that feels utterly out of step with the generally ""you go be you and be kind!"" tone. While we are meeting adult Jordan and learning how mean she is, there's a moment when she gets back at a neighbor she doesn't like by calling the neighbor's daughter a boy. When the confused neighbor corrects her, she says, ""Oh, I get it. He's transitioning ."" And then she sarcastically acts accepting about trans kids as a dig at the mother. Why anyone thought it would seem funny to have Jordan be cruel in this specific way — it's the first joke I can remember that relies for its punch on the idea that all parents know deep down that having your child called trans would be a very humiliating insult — is hard to imagine. One joke this ugly goes a long way to sour an entire movie, particularly one that purports to be in favor of being yourself. (Jordan does a lot of amends-making late in the movie, but notably, not for this.)
The fact remains that Martin has an ability, almost as specific as a party trick, to seem precisely like an adult in the body of a child. She can pull off straight dramatic acting such that behind her eyes, you can see an adult — you can specifically see Regina Hall. She is, again, a star. But with a story this rote, the comedy is everything. And the comedy isn't quite there, even if the central performance is really something to look at.

One Man's Quest To Protect A Rare Kind Of Hazelnut Tree : NPR,www.npr.org,Stacey Vanek Smith,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712409240/one-mans-quest-to-change-americas-presence-in-the-global-hazelnut-industry,"The hazelnut business is in a bind. Demand is rising, supply is tight, and a deadly fungal disease is constraining production. But one man may have found a solution.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Demand for hazelnuts is on the rise globally. That's due in no small part to the popularity of products like Nutella. But the U.S. has remained a relatively small player in the global hazelnut industry. Darius Rafieyan and Stacey Vanek Smith of the podcast The Indicator From Planet Money brings us this story of one man's decades-long quest to change that.
DARIUS RAFIEYAN, BYLINE: I first met biologist Tom Molnar in his office at the Rutgers University Ornamental Field Lab. He was surrounded by these big plastic bins just filled with thousands upon thousands of hazelnuts.
TOM MOLNAR: For example, here's one that has ridges and lumps. And to me, that's kind of an ugly looking hazelnut.
STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: Hazelnuts have a problem. More than 70 percent of the world's hazelnuts come from one place - come from Turkey. And that, of course, leaves Nutella lovers everywhere very vulnerable.
RAFIEYAN: The United States does have a small hazelnut industry in Oregon, but that doesn't come close to meeting global demand. The East Coast would be perfect for growing these trees, but there's one big problem.
MOLNAR: We would have had a hazelnut industry in the northeast if it wasn't for Eastern filbert blight.
RAFIEYAN: Eastern filbert blight - it's a fungal disease. It's native to North America. And it grows beneath the bark of hazelnut trees.
MOLNAR: So as we look down in here, you'll see that there's little pustules. So those are like little mushrooms. Those are the fruiting bodies, where the spores will actually be ejected from and spread to other trees.
RAFIEYAN: This fungus has been Tom's sworn nemesis for 23 years.
VANEK SMITH: Hazelnuts are this kind of miracle crop. They can grow without irrigation, without chemical fertilizers or pesticides. The only problem they needed to solve was Eastern filbert blight.
RAFIEYAN: And so Tom figured that somewhere out there the gene for disease resistance that he needed was hiding. So he set out to find that gene. For seven years, Tom traveled all over the native hazelnut range collecting specimens. And this was not your typical horticultural fieldwork. Once, while crossing into Ukraine with 80 pounds of nuts in his suitcase, he even got shaken down by the local police.
MOLNAR: They start screaming at me. They have guns. And this is silly, but at the same time, I had a suitcase full of all the nuts that I so desperately did not want to lose.
RAFIEYAN: But you were more worried about the nuts than the money.
MOLNAR: I was very nervous about the nuts. Those were my babies.
RAFIEYAN: After years of collecting all this genetic material, he came back to New Jersey, and he got to work breeding.
VANEK SMITH: Eventually, after years of failures, Tom did it. He created a tree strong enough to resist the blight.
RAFIEYAN: Does he have a name?
MOLNAR: Seven twenty-five (laughter). This is H3RZP25. So we call him 725.
VANEK SMITH: Tom sees this as the start of a whole new industry on the East Coast.
RAFIEYAN: If it takes off, that could make Tom a very, very rich man. But, you know, he says he didn't spend 20 years of his life sifting through hazelnuts just for the money.
MOLNAR: Ever since I was young, I wanted to do something that had a positive impact beyond just my individual life. And I think that's what drew me to tree breeding. Plants can sort of live on forever. So if you select the right variety, that could be around way after you're gone. But maybe your grandchildren can grow that in your yard and think about that, you know, their grandfather actually selected that plant.
RAFIEYAN: Darius Rafieyan.

How The Trump Administration's Transgender Troop Ban Is Affecting One Military Family : NPR,www.npr.org,Lauren Hodges,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/711229419/how-the-trump-administrations-transgender-troop-ban-is-affecting-one-military-fa,"How The Trump Administration's Transgender Troop Ban Is Affecting One Military Family How The Trump Administration's Transgender Troop Ban Is Affecting One Military Family Embed Embed

Lt. Col. Bree ""B"" Fram left a doctor's office on April 2. Presenting that day as Bryan, the name given to them at birth, B should have been relieved.
""Overall, it's a good thing,"" said B. ""It just didn't feel great to have to do it on someone else's timeline other than my own.""
""It"" was an official diagnosis of gender dysphoria. As a transgender member of the military, B had to secure the diagnosis by April 12 in order to continue serving openly.
That's when the Trump administration's new policy on transgender military service takes effect. It effectively bans transgender people from joining the military. The more than 14,000 already serving will be allowed to do so openly, so long as they have that formal diagnosis of gender dysphoria filed by the deadline. If not, they must serve under the gender assigned them at birth - or leave the armed forces.
President Trump first announced the ban in July 2017. After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017 ....Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017 ....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017
B, who is in the Air Force, met that deadline when a civilian doctor in Ithaca, New York secured their diagnosis. But B's personal journey of identity — shared with their wife Peg — is far from finished.
""I realize that I'm scared,"" Peg said. ""It's accelerated everything so quickly...all of a sudden, we're being forced to make this choice that I don't think we were quite at yet.""
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines gender dysphoria as ""a difference between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, and significant distress or problems functioning.""
B says that language, specifically the term ""distressed,"" was a major disincentive in deciding whether to get the diagnosis — that the idea of having such a medical designation in their employment file is painful, especially when being transgender has never affected their job performance.
And for Peg, making the diagnosis official at this point was unwelcome. She just wasn't ready.
""I have my own journey to deal with,"" she says. ""I met Bryan. I fell in love with Bryan. I married Bryan. We had kids. We moved on. Bree has come into our lives but it's almost like bringing a new person in. It challenges everything from my sexuality to my femininity. And that is a hard thing for me to deal with on a daily basis, let alone have someone come up to me and say 'deal with it faster.' ""
Not that Peg isn't grateful that the diagnosis came through, mere days before the deadline. She remembers what it was like to live what she calls an ""edited life"" before the Obama administration announced it would allow transgender people in the military in 2016 .
They have two kids, six and ten, who see their dad's gender identity as ""business as usual."" But Peg says the family spent years hiding B's gender dysphoria, afraid it would destroy their military career.

In Bethel, Alaska, record warm temperatures mean a frozen river that serves as an ice road is melting early. That's been deadly for some, and is leaving others unable to travel.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Now we take you to southwest Alaska, where in winter, frozen rivers are an important means of transportation. They're called ice roads. But this spring has seen record-breaking warm temperatures, and the ice roads are melting early. That is having devastating consequences. Krysti Shallenberger of Alaska's Energy Desk reports.
KRYSTI SHALLENBERGER, BYLINE: Bethel residents woke up to a warning earlier this month to stop driving on the frozen Kuskokwim River.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
MARK LEARY: Last night, our worst fears were realized.
SHALLENBERGER: That's Bethel search and rescue volunteer Mark Leary talking on KYUK radio's morning show. He along with a handful of other volunteers had just rescued three men who had been traveling on all-terrain vehicles and fell through thin ice. The rescuers crept very slowly over the weak ice, surrounded by open water and tethered to a safety line. One of them fell through, but he managed to pull himself out. In the end, they were not able to save two other men, who died.
Charles Guest is another volunteer who took part in the rescue.
CHARLES GUEST: As the ice rots more and more, I don't think that we'd be able to pull that off again.
SHALLENBERGER: Historically, ice doesn't get this weak in Bethel until May, but that has changed. This year, it started happening in March. Again, here's Mark Leary.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
LEARY: This is something we haven't experienced before so early and getting bad so fast.
SHALLENBERGER: As the climate warms, Alaska is heating up twice as fast as the global average. This year, Bethel experienced its warmest February and March on record. Now the melting ice is disrupting daily life like subsistence hunting. Most of the people in the region are Alaska Native. Hunting and fishing provides a large part of their diet. John Fitka lives in Tuntutuliak, and usually he's outside on the frozen river hunting seal this time of year. But now...
JOHN FITKA: Trail conditions are just too dangerous to risk it. I did get two small seal. I guess we'll have to make do with what we have (laughter).
SHALLENBERGER: Bethel and surrounding communities are off the road system. In the winter, people traveling to other nearby villages drive on the ice road. In the summer, they travel by boat. It's much cheaper than the only other option - flying. At the Bethel airport, I meet Christopher Ondola on his way back to his village, Tuntutuliak. He usually drives the ice road this time of year, but this time, he's flying even though it's just 44 miles away.
CHRISTOPHER ONDOLA: Yeah. This year, I was just too scared to go anywhere on my snow machine because of the ice.
SHALLENBERGER: The high price of a ticket limits the number of times he can come to Bethel to pick up groceries, fresh produce and wood for his steam bath. Last month, Ondola also lost a friend who drove a snow machine into open water.
ONDOLA: It's just too freaky scary.
SHALLENBERGER: Last week, friends and family attended funeral services for the men who fell through the ice on all-terrain vehicles. Normally they would have driven on the ice road.

Polls opened Thursday, with five weeks of voting. Vendors are cashing in with election-themed fashion, including saris with the prime minister's face.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Polls opened today in India's elections, which will last six weeks. And some savvy vendors are cashing in with election-themed fashion. NPR's Lauren Frayer takes us shopping in Mumbai.
ASHOK KARIYA: Ma'am, this is a Georgette material. A nice material.
LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Like silk or chiffon.
KARIYA: Chiffon.
FRAYER: Ashok Kariya is a sari designer designer who drapes women in luxurious multicolored material. He shows me his newest creation designed exclusively for Indian elections, which are going on right now.
So it's this beautiful sort of shimmering slightly translucent maybe 20 yards of fabric - orange flowers. And then right in the middle there's Prime Minister Modi's face, and he's sort of flexing his muscle like a fist up in the air.
Narendra Modi, who is currently running for a second term as prime minister. The rationale for putting his face on women's clothing, salesman Devang Dhanki tries to explain.
DEVANG DHANKI: Because he's a very popular person in India, so we appreciate him.
FRAYER: What about Rahul Gandhi? Do you have a sari of him?
DHANKI: No, we don't carry a Rahul Gandhi sari.
FRAYER: That's Modi's main challenger in this election. Other shops do stock rival politicians, Rahul and his sister Priyanka Gandhi, but not this shop. And before I know it, I'm enveloped in Modi chiffon.
What do I do? Should I put my hands up in the air? Wrap it around me?
DHANKI: You buy dresses.
FRAYER: But I don't know. I'm a journalist. Am I allowed to wear clothing with a politician's face on it?
DHANKI: You go to the temple. You pray. See, wear this sari, ma'am. You like? That's all.
FRAYER: I look to my fellow female shoppers for guidance.
DOLLY SHAH: It looks very pretty and decent.
FRAYER: Dolly Shah is here with her daughter.
SHAH: We buy many saris to gift somebody because we have a marriage at my uncle's place.
FRAYER: Will you think about buying a Modi sari?
SHAH: No, no, no, no. If we give them Modi saris and they don't like...
FRAYER: You run a risk of offending somebody.
SHAH: Offending, yeah.
FRAYER: Wrong politician.
SHAH: Yeah.
FRAYER: She says that would be a fashion faux pas this election season. Lauren Frayer, NPR News, Mumbai.

NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with the Wilson Center's Jean Lee about where denuclearization negotiations stand between the U.S., South Korea and North Korea.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Let's dig in a little deeper to where relations with North Korea stand in light of today's meeting between President Trump and South Korean President Moon. Jean Lee is back in the studio with us. She's an expert on North Korea at the Wilson Center. Good to have you here.
JEAN LEE: Hello.
SHAPIRO: So tremendous potential, President Trump says - what's your take on his remarks and President Moon's remarks?
LEE: There's some signaling going on here. Really, President Moon was here for 24 hours. He did a - he made a lightning-quick trip here to Washington, D.C., to see what he could do to salvage these negotiations. But what's - you know, regardless of the tough discussions that he and President Trump most likely had about how to define denuclearization, where to ease up on sanctions - if they ease up at all - though, if you take a step back, this is a great signal to Kim Jong Un.
Kim Jong Un certainly was perplexed by what happened in Hanoi. And I imagine he was somewhat anxious about where things stood. So this is a way for those two leaders, A, to show that they're coordinated - President Trump and President Moon - and, also, that there's some room for - to get back to that diplomacy.
SHAPIRO: You're referring to what happened in Hanoi. Those talks between President Trump and Kim Jong Un fell apart, ended prematurely. And since then, we've heard about satellite images showing North Korea reconstructing a satellite launching station. How would you describe what's happened in the U.S.-North Korea relationship since that disastrous meeting in February?
LEE: Absolutely. And that's certainly what should concern us all - that if Kim Jong Un becomes impatient or frustrated by the pace of the diplomacy that he may revert back to a pattern of behavior that has worked well for the North Koreans, and that is bad behavior. And since certainly what we don't want is for North Korea to think - hey, if we have fallen off of President Trump's radar, let's test something to get back on his radar.
So what's good about this meeting today is that it does tell Kim Jong Un - hey, it's still a priority, and we're going to try to get back to diplomacy. It's going to be tough, but we're still in it.
SHAPIRO: How would you characterize the last couple of months in the relationship between South Korea and North Korea? I know this - the North pulled out of a liaison office with South Korea that was supposed to improve communication between these two countries. Where do things stand?
LEE: It's been tough for the South Koreans. Or I should say for the South Korean president because he's gotten the cold shoulder from Kim Jong Un. And you know, that's very typical. It's something that I think President Moon knows not to react to too abruptly because this is how the relationship with North Korea goes. It ebbs, and it flows.
I think, in some sense, Kim Jong Un is punishing President Moon for perhaps not bending President Trump's ear enough on easing up on sanctions. So they like to play that kind of a game. They do want to put pressure wherever they can. So I think that this summit was important in telling Kim Jong Un - hey, you can't divide us; we are going to work together on this.
SHAPIRO: And do you see the U.S. and South Korea as speaking in one voice on the issue of North Korea, or do you think there is any daylight between them?
LEE: They've got, perhaps, different timelines on how this is all going to happen. But I do think that, regardless of what their differences are behind closed doors, they absolutely need to stand together if they want this to have the outcome that we're all envisioning.
SHAPIRO: Different timelines meaning South Korea may be a little more patient and President Trump might want a quicker victory here.
LEE: Well, I think they have different ideas. Remember that South Koreans are the ones who are in the path of any destruction that could be wrought by a test or any provocation. And so they're looking at the long game. They want peace on the Korean Peninsula, and they may have a different calculation for how they're going to get there.
And as we heard earlier, there's certainly some suggestion that President Moon may pressure President Trump to allow some of these inter-Korean economic projects, and that could weaken maximum pressure. So they may have different ideas about how to get it - get to this point where they have...
SHAPIRO: How to balance out the carrots and the sticks.
LEE: Exactly.
SHAPIRO: Yeah. Jean Lee, North Korea expert with the Wilson Center, thanks for coming into the studio today.
LEE: Thank you so much.

toggle caption Mark Rogers/Lionsgate Aw, crap: David Harbour stars in the 2019 reboot of Hellboy.
Mark Rogers/Lionsgate Hellboy, despite its colon-free title, is actually the fifth movie starring the good-guy demon hero (if you count the two animated films that featured the same cast as the live-action films made by monsteur auteur Guillermo del Toro in 2004 and 2008) and it's even more exhausting than this sentence.
Pity. The blue-collar, crimson-skinned agent of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense — basically a more inclusive version of the Men in Black, with a more casual dress code — is a marvelous character on the page. And because filmmaker del Toro has at least as much affection for 1930s serials and monster movies and European folklore as cartoonist Mike Mignola (Hellboy's creator) does, his two adaptations of Mignola's comics were revered. But like most del Toro films they were only moderate box office successes, and the profligate profitability of Marvel movies in the subsequent decade (Hellboy is a creator-owned specimen of IP, outside the Disney megalith) demanded that someone try to tap that rich vein again.
The Week's Best Stories From NPR Books Spooky Puppets, Slow Pacing In 'Catechism' In 'Hellboy,' A Supernatural Smackdown With Soul Englishman Neil Marshall would appear to be a sterling candidate: He made a trio of well-regarded low-budget genre flicks and directed two episodes of Game of Thrones, including ""Blackwater,"" which featured the climactic battle of the series' second season . The chaotic, repetitive movie he's given us here calls into question not just his competence but his taste. He's de-emphasized the warmth del Toro brought to the material and amped up the limb-rending and especially the eye-piercing a hundredfold. This is clearly a calculated decision; with the majority of comic book films sticking to PG-13 levels of genocide, all this gristle and viscera has at least a chance of making Hellboy '19 feel distinct. But the gore is deployed too indiscriminately to provoke anything other than bored revulsion, offering neither a sense of threat nor comic punctuation, the way it does in, say, the Evil Dead movies.
The flying entrails aren't the only element that feels hacky. Marshall scores most of his big set pieces with soundalike selections of ersatz blooze-rock. (The last one uses Mötley Crüe's 1989 jock jam ""Kickstart My Heart,"" saving the best for last, I guess.) He has apparently directed star David Harbour — replacing Ron Perlman as the demon with the red and extremely rocky right hand — to elongate his line readings like Point Break -era Keanu Reeves whenever he wishes to convey irritation, which is most of the time. Maybe the actor is just trying to be heard under all that monster makeup. Harbour, a pleasingly idiosyncratic performer on Stranger Things and in the Bond flick Quantum of Solace, does not possess Perlman's long-honed talent for conveying complex emotion through latex.
The rest of the cast is fine. Its biggest get is Ian McShane, doomed for all eternity to lend his profane tenor to stuff that is not as good as Deadwood, who plays Trevor Bruttenholm, the cranky paranormal scholar who found baby demon Hellboy in 1944 and raised him as his own son. (There's a line of dialogue about some kind of spell that makes both characters age slowly.) Milla Jovovich plays a witch who was dismembered and buried in several different coffins by King Arthur, only to rise again in the 21st century to bring about Armageddon by... copulating with Hellboy, I think. If Jovovich was ever on set as the same time as the other actors, it doesn't feel that way. Daniel Dae Kim replaced Ed Skrein as special forces soldier and undead were-jaguar Ben Daimo— a character of Japanese-American extraction — during pre-production, after complaints of whitewashing. Texan Sasha Lane plays BPRD agent Alice Monaghan, whom Hellboy rescued from abduction by malevolent fairies when she was just a baby. There's an attempt to give the later two an esprit de corps with Hellboy, but the movie never pauses long enough between monster battles for any of its character work to stick. We have to hurry up and get to the destruction or London, and then the undestruction of London. It all feels weightless and reversible, which makes it feel endless.
Some of Mignola's most memorable Hellboy stories have been short ones — like ""The Corpse,"" which presented the rescue of little Alice depicted in flashback in the new movie — so it's fitting, I guess, that this movie features exactly two terrific sequences that could be carved out and presented as shorts. In one of them, Hellboy consults Baba Yaga, a rotting, crab-like witch who lives in a house mounted on giant Ostrich legs. Her domicile is the most arresting image in the movie, but Baba Yaga's tactile appearance and otherworldly way of scurrying about the frame lingered with me, too. And Hellboy's re-introduction, wherein he must recover a fugitive BPRD agent from a Tijuana sports venue where his target is participating in a lucha libre match, plays like a cold open from a Bond flick — a witty, self-aware sequence that sets a tempo the film's remaining 105 minutes can't meet.
Much of the appeal of Mignola's comics lies is in his angular, heavy-ink style, which in addition to conjuring mood and atmosphere, makes the gnarly stuff less gross to look at. (Other artists who've drawn the character, like Duncan Fegredo, have followed Mignola's example.) Rendering all this stuff in photorealistic CGI does not necessarily add value. If we have to have more Hellboy movies and del Toro isn't going to make them, maybe they should be shot in black and white.

Amr Alfiky/NPR Lt. Col. Bree ""B"" Fram left a doctor's office on April 2. Presenting that day as Bryan, the name given to them at birth, B should have been relieved.
""Overall, it's a good thing,"" said B. ""It just didn't feel great to have to do it on someone else's timeline other than my own.""
""It"" was an official diagnosis of gender dysphoria. As a transgender member of the military, B had to secure the diagnosis by April 12 in order to continue serving openly.
That's when the Trump administration's new policy on transgender military service takes effect. It effectively bans transgender people from joining the military. The more than 14,000 already serving will be allowed to do so openly, so long as they have that formal diagnosis of gender dysphoria filed by the deadline. If not, they must serve under the gender assigned them at birth - or leave the armed forces.
President Trump first announced the ban in July 2017.
After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017 ....Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017 ....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2017 B, who is in the Air Force, met that deadline when a civilian doctor in Ithaca, New York secured their diagnosis. But B's personal journey of identity — shared with their wife Peg — is far from finished.
""I realize that I'm scared,"" Peg said. ""It's accelerated everything so quickly...all of a sudden, we're being forced to make this choice that I don't think we were quite at yet.""
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines gender dysphoria as ""a difference between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, and significant distress or problems functioning.""
B says that language, specifically the term ""distressed,"" was a major disincentive in deciding whether to get the diagnosis — that the idea of having such a medical designation in their employment file is painful, especially when being transgender has never affected their job performance.
And for Peg, making the diagnosis official at this point was unwelcome. She just wasn't ready.
""I have my own journey to deal with,"" she says. ""I met Bryan. I fell in love with Bryan. I married Bryan. We had kids. We moved on. Bree has come into our lives but it's almost like bringing a new person in. It challenges everything from my sexuality to my femininity. And that is a hard thing for me to deal with on a daily basis, let alone have someone come up to me and say 'deal with it faster.' ""
Not that Peg isn't grateful that the diagnosis came through, mere days before the deadline. She remembers what it was like to live what she calls an ""edited life"" before the Obama administration announced it would allow transgender people in the military in 2016 .
They have two kids, six and ten, who see their dad's gender identity as ""business as usual."" But Peg says the family spent years hiding B's gender dysphoria, afraid it would destroy their military career.
B remembers, too — and doesn't want transgender troops who missed the deadline, current and future, to go through that. A week after the doctor's appointment, the Fram family traveled to Washington so B could meet with members of Congress and talk about the Trump administration's ban. B told lawmakers how much harder it is to serve when forced to stay in the closet...or, in the case of those who don't get the diagnosis in time, forced back into the closet.
In contrast, when allowed to serve openly, B says:
""You don't have to have this filter in your brain that has to sit between your thoughts and the words or actions that come out of you...you can reach your full potential.""
So why not take that potential elsewhere? Leave the military for a job where the policy doesn't affect B and their family?
""I have so much invested in the military,"" says B. ""The reasons why I joined haven't changed...I joined right after September 11th. That had a profound impact on me and my ability to give back,"" adding that the military is where they found purpose.
That's what's at stake for the service members who didn't manage to get a diagnosis in time. B works with SPART*A , an organization that represents active duty transgender service members. The group was working with several people trying to file their paperwork up until the last minute.

Donald Stahl/Gunpowder & Sky The films of Alex Ross Perry thrive on discord, whether their rancor is couched in the high-falutin' language and privilege of literary comedy, as in Listen Up Philip , or festering in the hothouse confinement of Queen of Earth . Even Perry's last film, the uncharacteristically subdued slice-of-life Golden Exits , positioned itself as a subtle challenge for audiences to get on its wavelength. His work occasionally tips into out-and-out misanthropy, but really his instinct is to engage in the pricklier extremes of human nature, when we drop our guards, dispose of all politesse, and just let 'er rip.
In that respect, it was perhaps inevitable that Perry would get around to making a thrillingly unvarnished film about a punk singer, specifically one in the throes of addiction and mental illness. And it was also inevitable that he would skip past the rise-and-fall arc of a Behind-The-Music biopic and start right with the low point, when gold records and Spin covers are several years in the past and just getting through a show at all is a minor miracle. In Her Smell , Perry offers scraps of home-movie footage to reveal the riot grrrl trio Something She in better times, but it's there mostly to contrast with how far the band's lead singer, Becky Something (Elisabeth Moss), has brought them all down. It also helps explain why anyone remains in her orbit.
Movie Reviews 'Vox Lux' Is Too Much — And That's What Makes It So Invigorating The audience has no such comfort. Though the film sprawls out over 135 minutes, there are only about five extended setpieces in it, when the characters are breathing each other's stale air and we're stuck in there with them. Against the ambient thrum of feedback, the first and most difficult sequence takes place backstage after a Something She show, when Becky's anxiety and addiction are most easily triggered. As she rants and raves incoherently, other figures come into view: Her bandmates Marielle (Agyness Deyn) and Ali (Gayle Rankin), who are wearily familiar with her excesses but visibly frustrated by them; her manager Howard (Eric Stoltz), who's startling to lose the music empire her music built for him; and her ex Danny (Dan Stevens), who brings in the baby daughter she's too screwed-up to mother. The child is her salvation, but it might not be enough.
The industry itself will not wait on her, either. In the next setpiece, she's listlessly gobbling up studio time that's been reserved for another pop-punk band (Cara Delevingne, Ashley Benson and Dylan Gelula) — emphasis on the pop — that's primed to record radio-ready hits without the hassle. The younger women worship Becky, who's been imagined here as a Courtney Love type leading a less sturdy Sleater-Kinney trio, but their inevitable role is to replace her rather than reinvigorate her. The suspense here isn't whether Becky is going to hit bottom, but whether she has the will to pick herself up and make amends with the many people she's damaged — not least of all herself.
Like most finely crafted punk singles, the film builds a hard shell around a gooey center, tucking a big emotional (and even sentimental) hook around repellent blasts of feedback and distortion. There are times through Her Smell when it hardly seems worth tolerating Becky's tantrums, which Perry and Moss, working together for the fourth straight time, render with a messy disregard for how viewers might feel about her. Perhaps they'll see in her a favorite artist who'd fallen on hard times and sympathize, or perhaps they'll simply be exasperated by her ugly intransigence. It's the truth of Becky's behavior that matters most to the filmmakers, and there's integrity in that.
For all its deliberate rough edges, however, Her Smell is a journey through hell and back that feels more gratifying for being difficult. In order for Becky to arrive at any kind of peaceful place in her life, however fragile and impermanent that might be, she has to contend with the personal demons that hold her down and distance her from those most willing to help. Perry and Moss are not content to frame Becky as a rock-star burnout who partied hard, left some wreckage behind, and walked away with a memoir and a reunion tour. They're shooting for something more visceral and real, and infinitely more earned."
Review: Elle Fanning Enters A Singing Competition And Shows 'Teen Spirit',www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/711834543/teen-spirit-smells-like-a-quirky-beguiling-hit,"Enlarge this image Teen Spirit stars Elle Fanning as Violet, a girl from the Isle of Wight with dreams of being a pop star. Bleeker Street Media Bleeker Street Media Teen Spirit stars Elle Fanning as Violet, a girl from the Isle of Wight with dreams of being a pop star.
Bleeker Street Media The terrific young actress Elle Fanning has a still, otherworldly beauty and a quizzical air, as if she just wafted in from some other planet and was baffled by the odd ways of Earth. A wise old soul in a supermodel's body, Fanning might not be the intuitive choice to play an unpopular high school girl with songbird ambitions and no threads to match. Turns out she can sing, dance and handle dialogue in both Brit and Polish — all while projecting a chronically introverted Cinderella vibe, with a wild side yearning to break free.
In Teen Spirit , a confident directing debut by actor Max Minghella ( The Handmaid's Tale ), we meet Fanning's Violet marooned at the poverty-stricken butt end of England's scenic Isle of Wight, tending to goats while secretly performing for a smattering of indifferent barflies in a down-at-heel local pub. Mean girls abound in class; the school choir fails to satisfy; and Violet's harried Polish mother (Agnieszka Grochowska) isn't exactly on board for her daughter's decision to audition for a local song competition. Discouraged, Violet is ready to give up when an unlikely fairy godfather materializes in the amply-bellied form of Vlad (a very good Zlatko Buric), a washed-up opera singer in acute need of spiritual redemption and income, not necessarily in that order.
Movie Reviews A Wounded Union Soldier In A House Of Southern Women: 'The Beguiled' Movie Reviews London Calling (Occupants Of Interplanetary Craft): 'How To Talk To Girls At Parties' Vlad has smashed his own life to rubble, but in the way of teen dramas he will prove solid in ways that go way beyond teaching Violet how to breathe through a stanza. Others will help her out with her stage presence as much as with her unhelpful fantasies about a father whose absence she can fill up with demonization or with hero worship. True to genre, Violet faces down the usual array of bullies and cheaters; a handsome jerk who threatens to derail her focus; a slick music biz packager waving an iffy contract and nimbly played against type by Rebecca Hall.
Still, what Teen Spirit lacks in original premise it makes up for with skillfully mounted ambiance that adds up to a beguiling calling card for Minghella, who comes in blessed with killer cinematic genes. His father was the late Anthony Minghella ( The English Patient and Truly, Madly, Deeply ), and Max harnesses his dad's gift for breathing romance into the dreariest habitat, which he retools into his own generational idiom with music-video energy and an eclectic soundtrack, by turns jaunty and wistful, that stretches from Annie Lennox to Ariana Grande and Katy Perry.
It's Fanning, though, who retains the sweetness of this heavily-trodden teen fable without ever tipping it over into cloying goo. Now 21 years old, Fanning has been acting since she was three years old. In vastly divergent roles such as the poorly mothered British teen in Sally Potter's Ginger & Rosa (2012), feisty Princess Aurora in Robert Stromberg's 2014 Maleficent , and a sexed-up minx in Sofia Coppola's 2017 The Beguiled , Fanning has always exuded a signature restrained gravity that hints at much internal ado. Here, too, she pays out an ambiguity that keeps us wondering, and not a little anxious, about the inner tensions that both stymie this young woman and propel her forward from shy caterpillar to resplendent butterfly.
Always on her own terms, Violet releases the necessary exhibitionist in her slowly and with something approaching reluctance. She's a winner, but the movie leaves us with just enough openness in Violet's destiny to make me imagine what depth Fanning might bring to a movie about a pop star trying to deal with flaming out rather than winning. Vox Lux , perhaps, only without the shouting."
"Review: Hell, No To The Chaotic, Repetitive, Hard-R Hellboy",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/711810486/hellboy-hell-no,"Enlarge this image Aw, crap: David Harbour stars in the 2019 reboot of Hellboy. Mark Rogers/Lionsgate Mark Rogers/Lionsgate Aw, crap: David Harbour stars in the 2019 reboot of Hellboy.
Mark Rogers/Lionsgate Hellboy, despite its colon-free title, is actually the fifth movie starring the good-guy demon hero (if you count the two animated films that featured the same cast as the live-action films made by monsteur auteur Guillermo del Toro in 2004 and 2008) and it's even more exhausting than this sentence.
Pity. The blue-collar, crimson-skinned agent of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense — basically a more inclusive version of the Men in Black, with a more casual dress code — is a marvelous character on the page. And because filmmaker del Toro has at least as much affection for 1930s serials and monster movies and European folklore as cartoonist Mike Mignola (Hellboy's creator) does, his two adaptations of Mignola's comics were revered. But like most del Toro films they were only moderate box office successes, and the profligate profitability of Marvel movies in the subsequent decade (Hellboy is a creator-owned specimen of IP, outside the Disney megalith) demanded that someone try to tap that rich vein again.
The Week's Best Stories From NPR Books Spooky Puppets, Slow Pacing In 'Catechism' In 'Hellboy,' A Supernatural Smackdown With Soul Englishman Neil Marshall would appear to be a sterling candidate: He made a trio of well-regarded low-budget genre flicks and directed two episodes of Game of Thrones, including ""Blackwater,"" which featured the climactic battle of the series' second season . The chaotic, repetitive movie he's given us here calls into question not just his competence but his taste. He's de-emphasized the warmth del Toro brought to the material and amped up the limb-rending and especially the eye-piercing a hundredfold. This is clearly a calculated decision; with the majority of comic book films sticking to PG-13 levels of genocide, all this gristle and viscera has at least a chance of making Hellboy '19 feel distinct. But the gore is deployed too indiscriminately to provoke anything other than bored revulsion, offering neither a sense of threat nor comic punctuation, the way it does in, say, the Evil Dead movies.
The flying entrails aren't the only element that feels hacky. Marshall scores most of his big set pieces with soundalike selections of ersatz blooze-rock. (The last one uses Mötley Crüe's 1989 jock jam ""Kickstart My Heart,"" saving the best for last, I guess.) He has apparently directed star David Harbour — replacing Ron Perlman as the demon with the red and extremely rocky right hand — to elongate his line readings like Point Break -era Keanu Reeves whenever he wishes to convey irritation, which is most of the time. Maybe the actor is just trying to be heard under all that monster makeup. Harbour, a pleasingly idiosyncratic performer on Stranger Things and in the Bond flick Quantum of Solace, does not possess Perlman's long-honed talent for conveying complex emotion through latex.
The rest of the cast is fine. Its biggest get is Ian McShane, doomed for all eternity to lend his profane tenor to stuff that is not as good as Deadwood, who plays Trevor Bruttenholm, the cranky paranormal scholar who found baby demon Hellboy in 1944 and raised him as his own son. (There's a line of dialogue about some kind of spell that makes both characters age slowly.) Milla Jovovich plays a witch who was dismembered and buried in several different coffins by King Arthur, only to rise again in the 21st century to bring about Armageddon by... copulating with Hellboy, I think. If Jovovich was ever on set as the same time as the other actors, it doesn't feel that way. Daniel Dae Kim replaced Ed Skrein as special forces soldier and undead were-jaguar Ben Daimo— a character of Japanese-American extraction — during pre-production, after complaints of whitewashing. Texan Sasha Lane plays BPRD agent Alice Monaghan, whom Hellboy rescued from abduction by malevolent fairies when she was just a baby. There's an attempt to give the later two an esprit de corps with Hellboy, but the movie never pauses long enough between monster battles for any of its character work to stick. We have to hurry up and get to the destruction of London, and then the undestruction of London. It all feels weightless and reversible, which makes it feel endless.
Some of Mignola's most memorable Hellboy stories have been short ones — like ""The Corpse,"" which presented the rescue of little Alice depicted in flashback in the new movie — so it's fitting, I guess, that this movie features exactly two terrific sequences that could be carved out and presented as shorts. In one of them, Hellboy consults Baba Yaga, a rotting, crab-like witch who lives in a house mounted on giant Ostrich legs. Her domicile is the most arresting image in the movie, but Baba Yaga's tactile appearance and otherworldly way of scurrying about the frame lingered with me, too. And Hellboy's re-introduction, wherein he must recover a fugitive BPRD agent from a Tijuana sports venue where his target is participating in a lucha libre match, plays like a cold open from a Bond flick — a witty, self-aware sequence that sets a tempo the film's remaining 105 minutes can't meet.
Much of the appeal of Mignola's comics lies is in his angular, heavy-ink style, which in addition to conjuring mood and atmosphere, makes the gnarly stuff less gross to look at. (Other artists who've drawn the character, like Duncan Fegredo, have followed Mignola's example.) Rendering all this stuff in photorealistic CGI does not necessarily add value. If we have to have more Hellboy movies and del Toro isn't going to make them, maybe they should be shot in black and white."

toggle caption Bai Linghai/Kino Lorber Jue Huang stars in Long Day's Journey Into Night, which features an extended 3D sequence.
Bai Linghai/Kino Lorber A haunted loner searches for a mysterious woman. That film-noir staple is the plot of Long Day's Journey Into Night — to the extent that this woozy, mesmerizing reverie has a plot. Chinese writer-director Bi Gan's second feature is primarily an autobiographical mood piece.
The movie's protagonist is Luo (Huang Jue), who packs a gun and a tough-guy resume. But he's a poetic sort of hooligan, inclined to muse in voiceover about dreams, memories — and their cousin, the movies. He's looking for beautiful Wan Quiwen ( Lust, Caution star Tang Wei), although there are hints that he's also wondering about his long-unseen mother.
Movie Reviews In The Brutal Animated Film 'Have A Nice Day,' Nobody Does Bi grew up in Kaili, a subtropical city in southwest China that appears in both his features. He was raised by his father while his mother worked in a distant location. This history is crucial to the director's films, although it's filtered through his cinematic enthusiasms. Journey's humid ambiance may reflect Kaili's climate, but the movie's flooded interiors and dripping sounds also recall Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker , which Bi has acknowledged as a major influence.
Bi's 2015 Kaili Blues culminated in an unbroken 41-minute traveling shot. This time, the concluding single-shot sequence runs 55 minutes, and is meant to be seen in 3D. (I was unable to view the 3D version.)
Where Kaili Blues 's coda is clearly set in the real world, Journey 's final sequence is more surreal. Killing time in a bedraggled theater, Luo dons 3D glasses. Next thing he knows, he's in a mine like the one where an old friend was killed. After a ping-pong match, a boy leads him out of the tunnel and to a carnival in a dilapidated industrial site.
It's night, and the shadows are deep. Clocks and watches, as in Kaili Blues , don't keep real time. Repeatedly, Luo finds himself cornered or locked in. The camera is freewheeling — and even briefly airborne — but he is not.
In a pool hall near the karaoke stage, Luo meets someone who may be Wan Quiwen. ""I'm not the woman you think I am,"" she says. Well, of course.
Her identity will remain a enigma. So, too, that of an older woman (Sylvia Chang) who appears briefly. Bi takes a few cues from the detective genre, but he's not intent on solving the case.
What matters is what has already happened, even if it can't be precisely recalled, not what transpires in front of the camera. The wisp of a story is really just the occasion for impressionistic musing and evocative picturing.
Exquisitely shot by three cinematographers, Journey doesn't attempt to simulate Luo's subjective view of the events. But the film (whose Chinese title is Last Evenings on Earth ) does regularly highlight the limitations of human vision. Light is reflected, refracted and diffused. The camera peers through glass — including the wire-reinforced window of a prison visitor's booth — and the murkily transparent vinyl of a night-market partition.
Appropriately, when the camera finally stops moving, it comes to rest on a light source. Journey 's stately waltz of movement and illumination ends by contemplating a flickering glow."
Trump And South Korean President Moon Jae-In Meet To Discuss Talks With North Korea,www.npr.org,Ayesha Rascoe,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712409184/trump-and-south-korean-president-moon-jae-in-meet-to-discuss-talks-with-north-ko,"Trump And South Korean President Moon Jae-In Meet To Discuss Talks With North Korea Trump And South Korean President Moon Jae-In Meet To Discuss Talks With North Korea Embed Embed
President Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met Thursday to discuss the path forward on talks with North Korea.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
President Trump is distancing himself from Julian Assange's organization WikiLeaks.
(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)
UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Mr. President, do you still love WikiLeaks?
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I know nothing about WikiLeaks. It's not my thing.
CHANG: That's the president today answering questions at the White House. But there was a time during the 2016 election when Trump embraced the group known for leaking government and personal information from political figures.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: They got it all down, folks - WikiLeaks.
I love reading those WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks.
CHANG: So there has been a clear shift in the president's attitude towards WikiLeaks. And NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe joins us now to talk about it. Hi, Ayesha.
AYESHA RASCOE, BYLINE: Hello.
CHANG: All right, so 2016, the president loves WikiLeaks. 2019, he knows nothing about it. What is going on here?
RASCOE: So in the time between that, he became president, and now he deals with leaks every day.
CHANG: Right.
RASCOE: So his administration has been the subject of a number of leaks to the media - significant ones, details of calls Trump had with foreign leaders, conversations he's had in the Oval Office. All of this has been leaked. So with that big kind of uptick, what we've heard from Trump is complaints saying, you need to go after these people releasing government information; they need to be prosecuted.
When it comes to WikiLeaks in particular, Mike Pompeo, when he was Trump's head of the CIA, actually called WikiLeaks a hostile intelligence service. Of course before that, Pompeo, also during the 2016 campaign, repeatedly cited emails released by WikiLeaks to attack Hillary Clinton.
So you have this dynamic where Trump and others use the leaks when they were kind of beneficial to them but have now taken a different position. Now, back in 2017, Trump defended this change in posture, basically saying that the Democrats' emails that were released were not classified information and so that it was different when he was talking about those emails.
CHANG: Now, what did the special counsel investigation reveal about connections between people in Trump's orbit, like Roger Stone, and WikiLeaks?
RASCOE: Yeah, so the special counsel's full report obviously has not been released yet.
CHANG: Sure.
RASCOE: But we do know that a longtime associate of Trump's, Roger Stone - he was indicted under that probe. And that indictment alleged that Stone was in regular contact with WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign around times when emails were being released. And so that really kind of touches on this kind of larger issue at play because there are questions of WikiLeaks' connections to Russia and the 2016 election. So at this time, it's really not that surprising that Trump wants to put a lot of space between himself and any issue related to WikiLeaks.
CHANG: Yeah. So obviously all of this overshadowed a meeting between President Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the White House today. And can you just very briefly tell us what did they say about North Korea?
RASCOE: So basically they - both men had very positive things to say about each other, and they both expressed optimism about the future of North Korea and denuclearization. Here's what Trump said.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: I can speak for myself, and I think I can speak for President Moon. We think that North Korea has tremendous potential and - really, potential under the leadership of Kim Jong Un. Let's see how it all works out.
RASCOE: So Trump is saying that he's optimistic, but he also said right now he's not planning to lift any sanctions on North Korea at this point even to allow these kind of joint economic projects between the North and the South, which is what Moon had kind of wanted. So he's saying that he's not ready to do that just yet.
CHANG: All right, that's NPR's Ayeshe Rascoe. Thanks, Ayesha.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:
After seven years inside Ecuador's embassy in London, Julian Assange was thrown out today.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
British police took him into custody, paving the way for his extradition to the U.S. The Justice Department has charged him with conspiracy related to the leak of national security information. While some have hailed Assange for exposing government secrets, others say he has put U.S. missions and staff at grave risk. We'll hear more about that in a few minutes.
CHANG: But first, let's understand why Assange took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in the first place. We're joined now from London by NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton. Welcome.
OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE: Greetings.
CHANG: So it has been a pretty dramatic day in London for Assange. Can you just briefly describe what has happened today?
QUIST-ARCTON: At about 10 o'clock local time, the British police arrived at the Ecuador embassy, where you say he's been since 2012. And invited in by the Ecuadorian government, they half-led, half-carried Julian Assange who's looking gaunt, frail, with a huge white beard out of the embassy. He was shouting, this is unlawful. This is unlawful. And they bundled him into a waiting van.
CHANG: Can we just rewind the clock seven years? I mean, what was the co-founder of WikiLeaks doing taking up refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London in the first place?
QUIST-ARCTON: Julian Assange was accused of rape and molestation in Sweden, which was seeking his extradition. So in 2012, he was in court in Britain, and he was out on bail. Now, he jumped bail, so to speak, and he literally ducked into the Ecuador Embassy. And he has been there ever since.
CHANG: So he has spent seven years inside an embassy. I mean, and his movements have been restricted for the past several years. How did he cope?
QUIST-ARCTON: Initially, pretty well. I mean, we used to see Julian Assange on the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy speaking - almost holding court. Then, he was very confident. He was confident because the then-president of Ecuador was a friend of his. He made one of these pronouncements from the embassy balcony back in 2012. Have a listen.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JULIAN ASSANGE: Six months ago, 185 days ago, I entered this building. It has become my home, my office and my refuge. Thanks to the principled stance of the Ecuadorian government and the support of its people, I am safe in this embassy to speak to you.
CHANG: Yeah, it sounds like he felt very safe at the time. When did that start to change?
QUIST-ARCTON: Sweden eventually dropped the sexual violence charges against Assange. But last year, we learned that the U.S. administration was probably preparing criminal charges against Assange. Now, this was when his name was accidentally leaked in a document filed in an unrelated case.
Also the Ecuadorian administration change and the new president, Lenin Moreno, is not at all sympathetic to Assange, who he says has not only violated the terms of his political asylum, but that he has been leaking with WikiLeaks things about the president himself and about Ecuador, which is hosting him - so asylum revoked...
CHANG: Wow.
QUIST-ARCTON: ...British police in.
CHANG: Where does all of this leave Julian Assange now?
QUIST-ARCTON: Right now, in jail, remanded in custody. He will face court over the jumping-bail charges in the British court but also possible extradition to the US. Jennifer Robinson, who is one of Assange's lawyers, says heck no. This must not happen.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JENNIFER ROBINSON: This sets a dangerous precedent for all media organizations and journalists in Europe and elsewhere around the world. This precedent means that any journalist can be extradited for prosecution in the United States for having published truthful information about the United States.
QUIST-ARCTON: So she says she visited Julian Assange in jail today, and he thanks all his supporters. And, you know, he has a lot of supporters. And then you have those who see Julian Assange and WikiLeaks as a menace.
CHANG: That's NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton in London. Thank you, Ofeibea.
QUIST-ARCTON: Always a pleasure. Thank you.

Pope Benedict Breaks 6-Year Silence To Comment On Clergy Sex Abuse Scandal,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712409110/pope-benedict-breaks-6-year-silence-to-comment-on-clergy-sex-abuse-scandal,"Enlarge this image Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI arrives at St Peter's basilica in 2015.

Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI has broken six years of relative silence with the release of an outspoken letter on the clergy sex abuse scandal. Benedict's analysis differs significantly from that of his successor, Pope Francis, and thus leaves the world's Catholics with contrasting papal perspectives on the greatest crisis facing Roman Catholicism today.
In his 6,000-word essay, published Thursday in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera , with an English translation by the Catholic News Agency, Benedict blames the epidemic of clergy sex abuse largely on a collapse of moral standards in the 1960s and the subsequent failure of Catholic leaders to uphold traditional church teaching.
Religion Pope Issues New Edict Requiring Vatican Officials To Report Sex Abuse Allegations ""It could be said,"" Benedict writes, ""that in the 20 years from 1960 to 1980, the previously normative standards regarding sexuality collapsed entirely."" Among the changes, in Benedict's view, was that pedophilia became seen as ""allowed and appropriate,"" and pornography became widespread and accepted. The priesthood, meanwhile, fell into crisis.
""Catholic moral theology,"" Benedict writes, ""suffered a collapse that rendered the Church defenseless against these changes in society. ... [T]here could no longer be anything that constituted an absolute good, any more than anything fundamentally evil; (there could be) only relative moral judgments. There no longer was the (absolute) good, but only the relatively better, contingent on the moment and on circumstances.""
Though Benedict stops short of blaming gay priests for the epidemic of minor abuse, as some have , he claims that ""homosexual cliques"" were established ""more or less openly"" in Catholic seminaries, thus changing the seminary climate in such a way as to contribute to a breakdown in the preparation of priests for their ministry.
Benedict has espoused similar views previously, both as a cardinal and as pope, but in the six years since stepping into ""emeritus"" status, he has largely kept silent and let Pope Francis speak for the church. Francis has argued that the clergy abuse crisis is rooted in a culture of clericalism, where priests and bishops became so elevated that their word and authority dominate over the experience of the people they serve, thus contributing to a lack of accountability. He has expressed a more tolerant view of homosexuality.
In his letter, Benedict says he asked Francis in advance whether he would consider publication of the letter ""appropriate,"" and at no time does he suggest any criticism of the Francis papacy. He says he was motivated to write his letter by the recent Rome summit on clergy abuse, convened by Francis, and that he intended his comments to be ""a helpful contribution."" At the end of his letter, he thanks Francis ""for everything he does to show us, again and again the light of God, which has not disappeared, even today.""
Religion As Catholic Sex Abuse Crisis Deepens, Conservative Circles Blame Gay Priests Austen Ivereigh, a Francis biographer and frequent commentator on Vatican issues, argued in a response to the Benedict letter that it should not be taken as an attack on Francis and that ""on the fundamentals,"" the two popes have much in common.
It is, nevertheless, remarkable to have two popes speaking simultaneously on the most divisive issue facing the church, and Benedict's letter may well raise concerns that the Vatican can no longer speak with a single voice.
In his book The Pope: Francis, Benedict, and the Decision That Shook the World , Anthony McCarten highlights the consequence of having two living popes. ""For every papal pronouncement,"" he writes, ""there walks and breathes the rebuttal, the living counterargument—invalidating it.""
With two papal perspectives on the clergy abuse crisis now available, Catholics may feel free to choose between them, leaving neither one with the authority a papal position would normally carry."

The WikiLeaks disclosures started an intense debate about their impact. Supporters of Julian Assange said these were U.S. government secrets that needed to become public. The national security community argued that they could cause real harm, especially at a time when the U.S. was at war in Iraq and Afghanistan. NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre looks at the state of that debate today.
GREG MYRE, BYLINE: So how much damage did Julian Assange do to U.S. national security? Here's P.J. Crowley, the State Department spokesman back when the WikiLeaks story erupted in 2010.
P J CROWLEY: Julian Assange has said many times that nobody was harmed by WikiLeaks. That's not true.
MYRE: Consider three broad areas affected to varying degrees by the WikiLeaks dumps - The military, the intelligence community and U.S. diplomacy. Crowley, who's also a retired Air Force colonel, says those most at risk from the disclosures were civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq who were secretly passing on information to the U.S. military.
CROWLEY: A number of people went into hiding. A number of people had to move, particularly those civilians in war zones who had told soldiers about movements of Taliban and al-Qaida. No doubt, some of those people were harmed when their identities were compromised.
MYRE: WikiLeaks has made multiple disclosures over the past decade. They included one in March 2017, when the group released what it said were CIA technical documents on a range of spying techniques. This revealed ways that a state-of-the-art television could serve as a listening device even when it was turned off. Larry Pfeiffer, a former CIA chief of staff, says these kinds of breaches can impose long-term costs, though they can be difficult to quantify.
LARRY PFEIFFER: It informs the potential enemies of a technique we use that they can now build up countermeasures against.
MYRE: And Pfeiffer, speaking via Skype, says the spy agency may be forced to go back to the drawing board.
PFEIFFER: Once invalidated, it now creates situations where the U.S. intel community is going to have to expend resources, both dollars and people, to develop new methods.
MYRE: On the diplomatic front, WikiLeaks shared many examples of U.S. diplomats writing in unflattering terms about foreign leaders, causing the U.S. plenty of embarrassment. More importantly, says Scott Anderson, a former State Department lawyer who served in Iraq in 2012 and 2013, some of these countries have vulnerable opposition leaders and human rights activists. Their private, sensitive discussions with U.S. diplomats suddenly became very public.
SCOTT ANDERSON: That can really chill the ability of those American personnel to build those sorts of relationships and have frank conversations with their contacts when their contacts are worried that information is not as secure as people thought they were.
MYRE: Anderson notes that the U.S. still has a program to bring Afghans and Iraqis to the U.S. in return for help they provided and the danger they still face. P.J. Crowley points to the impact of leaks that upset the former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
CROWLEY: We had one ambassador in Libya. We had to remove him from his post because he was directly threatened by Moammar Gadhafi's thugs.
MYRE: Some countries, Crowley adds, took a bemused approach to the disclosures.
CROWLEY: Another foreign minister told the secretary of state - don't worry about it; you should see what we report about you.
MYRE: Shortly after the WikiLeaks case broke in 2010, then-Defense Secretary Bob Gates offered this philosophical take.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BOB GATES: The fact is, governments deal with the United States because it's in their interest - not because they like us, not because they trust us and not because they believe we can keep secrets. Is this embarrassing? Yes. Is it awkward? Yes. Consequences for U.S. foreign policy? I think fairly modest.
MYRE: Three years later, Edward Snowden leaked even more explosive material from the National Security Agency. WikiLeaks helped Snowden flee to Russia.

Eugene Hoshiko/AP The U.S. Navy is set to drop all criminal charges against two officers following the fatal collision that killed seven sailors aboard the USS Fitzgerald as the destroyer was on a secret mission.
The decision ends a years-long legal battle in which the Navy blamed Cmdr. Bryce Benson and Lt. Natalie Combs, among others , for what it determined was an ""avoidable"" accident caused, in part, by numerous leadership failures. But the move is also likely to end their naval careers.
A statement issued Wednesday explained that Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson recommended the negligence charges against the officers be withdrawn and dismissed.
""This decision is in the best interest of the Navy, the families of the Fitzgerald Sailors, and the procedural rights of the accused officers,"" the statement reads. ""Both officers were previously dismissed from their jobs and received non-judicial punishment.""
Additionally, the statement says Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer will issue letters of censure to Benson and Combs. The letters carry no legal weight but are used within the military to publicly shame service members.
""The cases are being dismissed for legal reasons that impede the continued prosecution of either officer,"" the Navy explained in letters sent to the families of the seven sailors who died in the collision with a cargo ship, USNI News reported.

""To be clear, Lt. Combs was fully prepared to defend and defeat the charges brought against her,"" Sheldon said. ""She was not responsible for setting an operational tempo that undercut staffing and training, that allowed for the ship to move with 'degraded' radar and that put sailors at extreme risk aboard the USS Fitzgerald.""

The $1.8 billion destroyer , manned by a 300-member crew, had been steaming on a secret mission to the South China Sea when it was struck by the cargo ship, more than three times its size. The resulting gash from the strike was bigger than a semitruck. Hundreds of tons of water flooded into the warship, leaving seven sailors dead in their berthing compartments.
Benson was the ship's commanding officer at the time. Combs served as the tactical action officer.

Israeli Spacecraft Beresheet Crashes Attempting Moon Landing,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712430942/israeli-robotic-moon-landing-fails-in-final-descent,"People in the Israeli city of Netanya watching images taken by the camera of the Israel Beresheet spacecraft of the moon surface before it crashed.

The unmanned Israeli spacecraft Beresheet, a privately funded mission, failed upon its final descent to the moon Thursday, dashing hopes of joining the ranks of global superpowers in successfully landing on the lunar surface.
The Beresheet lost its main engine and communications with Israeli support technicians in the final minutes of its scheduled moon landing.
The SpaceIL craft ""definitely crashed on the surface of the moon,"" said general manager of the space division of Israel Aerospace Industries, Doron Opher as quoted by the Associated Press. He said scientists are trying to determine what caused the engine failure, dooming the spacecraft to travel too quickly to land safely.
The robotic moon lander was built by the non-profit SpaceIL and state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries.
""We will try again,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, vowing to make a successful moon landing in the next two years.
Space programs in only three nations — the U.S., Russia and China — have successfully landed spacecraft on the moon.
The Beresheet was launched from Cape Canaveral with the aid of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in February. Beresheet is Hebrew for ""in the beginning.""
The failed landing was viewed nationwide in Israel and the U.S. space agency NASA also broadcast the landing mission live on its dedicated TV channels, as well as online.
""While NASA regrets the end of the SpaceIL mission without a successful lunar landing of the Beresheet lander, we congratulate SpaceIL, the Israel Aerospace Industries and the state of Israel on the incredible accomplishment of sending the first privately funded mission into lunar orbit,"" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine in a statement . ""Every attempt to reach new milestones holds opportunities for us to learn, adjust and progress. I have no doubt that Israel and SpaceIL will continue to explore and I look forward to celebrating their future achievements."""

For judges of the second annual Aspen Words Literary Prize , there was little question who ought to walk away with the award. In the end, in fact, the decision was unanimous: The panel picked An American Marriage , by Tayari Jones.
""It's a book for the long haul,"" writer Samrat Upadhyay told NPR. Upadhyay, a finalist for last year's prize , chaired this year's panel of judges. And he said that with An American Marriage , Jones managed to craft a novel that's ""going to have a place in the literary imagination for a long time.""
The award, which the nonprofit literary organization Aspen Words doles out in partnership with NPR, offers $35,000 for an exemplary work that deploys fiction to grapple with difficult social issues.
""So many of us who want to write and engage with the issues of the day, we're encouraged not to. We're told that that's not what real art does,"" Jones said Thursday at the Morgan Library in New York City, where she accepted the prize. ""And an award like this, I think it encourages all of us to keep following the strength of our convictions.""
Along with Jones, four other finalists entered the ceremony Thursday at the Morgan Library in New York City with an opportunity to win : Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, David Chariandy, Jennifer Clement and Tommy Orange.

Courtesy of Aspen Words Before the winner was announced, the five writers — self-described by Jones as the ""class of 2019"" -- gathered side by side at center stage to discuss their works in detail with NPR's Renee Montagne. You can watch that conversation in full by clicking right here or just streaming the video below.
YouTube Though all five writers produced ""amazing books,"" to borrow Upadhyay's phrasing, he said there was just something about Jones' fourth novel that left the judges floored.
In the book, a young African-American couple struggles to maintain love and loyalty even as the husband is locked away for a crime he didn't commit. Hanging over this love story are the pervasive effects of mass incarceration and racial discrimination.
""It tackles the issue of incarceration of minorities, especially for blacks,"" he said. ""But it's not hitting you over the head with it. It brings [the issue] to a very personal level and it talks about the damage it does to other institutions, like the institution of marriage, and to love.""
Book News & Features EXCLUSIVE: Aspen Words Literary Prize Unveils Its Finalists Code Switch An American Marriage: Redefining The American Love Story As Jones explained, she did not set out to make a point with her novel, necessarily: She set out simply to tell the truth, because ""the point is in the truth.""
""Every true story is in the service of justice. You don't have to aim at justice. You just aim for the truth,"" Jones told NPR backstage after the event. ""There's hope, and there's a satisfaction in reading a work that is substantial, that has ambition and a work that has a certain kind of — well, how do you say this? A work that wants a better future.""
During their conversation with Montagne, Jones' fellow finalists spoke of much the same ambition in their own fiction. Chariandy, for one, wanted to bring a spotlight to underrepresented poor immigrant communities outside Toronto in his novel Brother — and, at once, transcend the kinds of expectations that kept them pushed to the margins.
""I wanted, in this book, to tell a story about the unappreciated beauty and life of that place, even when it's a story about loss and unjust circumstances,"" he said onstage. ""For me, it was extremely important to pay homage to the beauty, creativity, resilience of young men who feel seen by people outside the communities as threats, but who are braving every day great acts of tenderness and love.""
#AspenLitPrize finalist Tommy Orange on hope in literature: ""What I love about art is its possibility for transformation, both for the artist and the person experiencing the art."" (He adds that reading Camus' THE STRANGER left him so hopeless, he fell asleep).
— NPR Books (@nprbooks) April 11, 2019 Adjei-Brenyah, like Jones, wrestled with issues of race in his fiction, but he did so in radically different ways. His collection Friday Black deployed stories of dystopia and fantasy to, in the words of critic Lily Meyer , turn over ""ideas about racism, about classism and capitalism, about the apocalypse, and, most of all, about the corrosive power of belief.""
On Thursday, Adjei-Brenyah noted that fiction — and his surreal twist on the form, in particular — allows him the space to tackle such a tall task.
""I write the world I want. You know, if something I need for a story doesn't exist, I'll make it,"" he said. ""This space, the premise, whatever I create, is sort of like a machine to squeeze just as much as I can out of my characters. And that squeezing, that pressure I put on them becomes the story, and hopefully something meaningful happens.""
""Why do I turn to fiction?"" asks #AspenLitPrize finalist David Chariandy. ""It's the power of the question, what if?""
— NPR Books (@nprbooks) April 11, 2019 Orange and Clement placed similar pressures on their own characters.
Orange's debut novel, There There , centers on the underrepresented lives of Native Americans who reside in cities — people, in Orange's words , who know ""the sound of the freeway better than [they] do rivers."" And both Clement's Gun Love brings a spotlight to bear on characters long elbowed to the margins of American society — characters confined by their class and income level and wondering whether transcending those limitations is even possible.
Ultimately, along with its possibilities for change, for hope and recognition, Jones said there's something else crucial that fiction offers.
""I feel that I am most myself when I am in that space of imagination. I believe in what we're talking about — that we write and try to make an impact and further conversations — but also,"" she said, ""writing for me is a space of great pleasure. I think that sometimes gets lost, particularly with writers of color: the idea that art and literature is a site of joy and enjoyment."""

""This legislation is blatantly unconstitutional and we will fight to the bitter end to ensure that this bill is permanently blocked,"" said ACLU of Ohio legal director Freda Levenson in a statement .
The group plans to sue on behalf of Pre-Term Cleveland, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio and the Women's Med Center of Dayton.
We will fight to the bitter end to ensure that this bill is permanently blocked. Freda Levenson, ACLU of Ohio
But DeWine and lawmakers said they aren't dissuaded by the threat of legal action. Since taking office in January, DeWine had said he planned to sign whichever version of the heartbeat bill ended up on his desk.
""Will there be a lawsuit? Yeah, we are counting on it,"" said state Rep. Ron Hood on Wednesday. ""We're counting on it. We're excited about it.""
Anti-abortion groups such as Ohio Right To Life say they intend the heartbeat bill to trigger a U.S. Supreme Court case striking down the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. That case legalized abortion up until viability, usually at 22-24 weeks.
""If this is what it takes, we will see you at the Supreme Court,"" said Planned Parenthood of Ohio President Iris Harvey at a rally Wednesday outside the Statehouse.
The Ohio Senate originally passed the bill last month. The Republican-led House Health Committee then made several changes before sending it to the House floor, where it passed by party-line vote.
Beyond changing the name, the Ohio House version allows for the use of transvaginal ultrasounds to detect a fetal heartbeat even earlier in a pregnancy.
The bill institutes criminal penalties for doctors who violate the law. Doctors who perform abortions after detecting a heartbeat would face a fifth-degree felony and up to a year in prison. The legislation also allows the State Medical Board to take disciplinary actions against doctors found in violation and impose penalties of up to $20,000.
After hearing testimony from lawmakers and advocates, the Ohio House passed the bill Wednesday afternoon, 56-40, and the Ohio Senate quickly followed to affirm the changes, 18-12.
""Pro-life Ohio thanks Governor DeWine for taking a courageous stand on behalf of unborn children with beating hearts,"" said Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis in a statement .
Currently, Ohio prohibits abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and lawmakers in 2018 passed a law banning the ""dilation and evacuation"" method of abortion used most commonly after 12 weeks of pregnancy. The latter was blocked from taking effect by a federal judge in March.
The Ohio Senate in March passed another bill requiring the burial or cremation of fetal remains. The bill is now being considered in the Ohio House.
Legislators attempted several times before to pass the heartbeat bill, but the legislation was twice vetoed by former Gov. John Kasich, who warned it would prove costly for the state to defend in court."
Death Penalty In New Hampshire Voted Down By State Senate : NPR,www.npr.org,Matthew S.

New Hampshire is poised to become the 21st state to abolish the death penalty.
The state Senate voted 17-6 Thursday to end capital punishment, adding its voice to the state House which voted for repeal last month by a vote of 279-88. The bill changes the penalty for capital murder to a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.
The state's Republican governor, Chris Sununu, has threatened a veto. But with more than two-thirds majority support in both chambers, the legislature could override a veto, making New Hampshire the final state in New England to repeal the death penalty.
""As I get older I realized for a fact we're actually all on death row and it's just a matter of time before our names get called,"" said Republican state Sen. Harold French, who voted for repeal. ""When my name gets called, I'm going to go before the Lord with a huge basket full of regrets and misdeeds, just like you will. But I tell you what won't be in that basket of misdeeds. ... I did not turn a deaf ear to those who came and took the time to speak to us to get rid of the death penalty,"" he said, according to the Associated Press.
There is one man currently on New Hampshire's death row and he may not benefit from the measure. The repeal bill won't apply retroactively to Michael K. Addison, who was convicted of the 2006 killing of Manchester police officer Michael Briggs.
But capital punishment supporters worry that once the state abolishes the death penalty, the judicial system will be loath to apply it to Addison. ""The day that this passes and is signed into law, Mr. Addison's sentence will be converted to life in prison,"" said state Sen. Sharon Carson, according to the AP.
As New Hampshire Public Radio reports, Briggs's widow, Laura, opposed the push to abolish the death penalty. ""It's not about an eye for an eye or revenge,"" she said. ""It's about protecting our society from evil people that do evil things.""
It's been 80 years since New Hampshire last executed someone, when in 1939, Howard Long was hanged after he molested four children and killed two of them, including a 10-year-old boy.
The state's lawmakers have voted to repeal the death penalty twice this century – once in 2000, and once in 2018 — but in each case the governor vetoed the bill, the New York Times reported. Last year the state Senate failed to muster the 16 votes needed to override the veto. This time, the Senate has the numbers.

"McConnell Says GOP 2020 Strategy Is To Be ""Firewall"" Against Socialism : NPR",www.npr.org,Kelsey Snell,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712427498/mcconnells-2020-plan-cast-gop-as-firewall-against-socialism,"Enlarge this image Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks to reporters at the Capitol Tuesday. J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., speaks to reporters at the Capitol Tuesday.
J. Scott Applewhite/AP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says the path to GOP success in 2020 is running ""to be the firewall that saves the country from socialism.""
McConnell told reporters Thursday that he is advising all Republican Senate candidates to run on offense by casting themselves as the only alternative to Democrats who want to drive the country to the left.
""You add up things like packing the Supreme Court, getting rid of the electoral college, the Green New Deal, and Medicare for none and you have a prescription of turning America into something it never has been and never should be,"" McConnell said. ""So we intend to be on the offense in running our races.""
McConnell said Republicans running for Senate can also ""paint your own picture of what your service has meant to your constituents"" — a plan that involves highlighting the Senate's work on criminal justice reform and combating the opioid crisis.
Left-leaning policies discussed by Democrats on the presidential campaign trail will help form the foundation of GOP attacks on Democrats running for other offices as well.
""My experience in politics has been that very few voters come out and vote and say thank you,"" McConnell said. ""They generally are looking for what the deficiencies are on one side or another and I think what we're seeing in the Democratic presidential primaries, gives us a sense of what we should be against in 2020.""
Shots - Health News As Sanders Calls For 'Medicare-For-All,' A Twist On That Plan Gains Traction The top Senate GOP leader said his party can learn a lesson from the 2018 election when it lost control of the House of Representatives. He said a 2020 campaign needs to repair major losses among women and college graduates to regain ground with critical suburban voters.
""We did very poorly in the suburbs, which cost us the House,"" he said. ""To give you a sense of that the gender issue, we lost women by four points in 2014 — about typical you know in a successful year for us. We lost women by 19 in '18 and we lost college graduates for the first time in my memory. That is not a path to political success.""
Politics Senate Blocks Green New Deal, But Climate Change Emerges As Key 2020 Issue That plan of attack isn't preventing McConnell from pursuing some bipartisan agreements in the many months ahead next year's elections. McConnell says he has a good working relationship with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and he has high hopes that the two can work together to reach a two-year budget agreement in the near future.
He announced plans earlier this week to work with Pelosi and the White House on a bipartisan deal to prevent a government shutdown later this year.
""We're each enabling at the staff level people to begin to discuss what we're going to do,"" McConnell said. ""And we have to do it together.""
Pelosi and McConnell hope to avoid a repeat of the 35-day partial government shutdown that started before Christmas last year and dragged on until January 25 of this year. One way to avoid that is for party leaders to reach a deal on a spending package that satisfies a majority of members in the middle, even if it alienates progressives and conservatives on the fringes of each party.
""The only thing possible is a bipartisan agreement that probably in the end the most liberal members of her party don't vote for and most conservative members of my party don't vote for,"" McConnell said. ""But it gives us some semblance of a way to have a normal appropriations process.""
The words of encouragement about a deal weren't without a dig at Pelosi's political predicament in managing her new, ideologically diverse majority. McConnell compared liberal House Democrats — many of whom tried to force votes on liberal issues like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal and threatened to vote against a budget bill to push for greater domestic spending — to the divisive House Freedom Caucus that fractured the GOP in previous years.
""I was almost tempted to call up my good friend the speaker and say 'congratulations you've got a Freedom Caucus on your hands,' "" McConnell joked. ""And she clearly does."""
Death Penalty In New Hampshire Voted Down By State Senate : NPR,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712457692/new-hampshire-poised-to-eliminate-death-penalty?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Republican Gov.

toggle caption Charles Krupa/AP Republican Gov. Chris Sununu waves during his inauguration ceremony at the State House in Concord, N.H., this January.
Charles Krupa/AP New Hampshire is poised to become the 21st state to abolish the death penalty.
The state Senate voted 17-6 Thursday to end capital punishment, adding its voice to the state House which voted for repeal last month by a vote of 279-88. The bill changes the penalty for capital murder to a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole.
The state's Republican governor, Chris Sununu, has threatened a veto. But with more than two-thirds majority support in both chambers, the legislature could override a veto, making New Hampshire the final state in New England to repeal the death penalty.
""As I get older I realized for a fact we're actually all on death row and it's just a matter of time before our names get called,"" said Republican state Sen. Harold French, who voted for repeal. ""When my name gets called, I'm going to go before the Lord with a huge basket full of regrets and misdeeds, just like you will. But I tell you what won't be in that basket of misdeeds. ... I did not turn a deaf ear to those who came and took the time to speak to us to get rid of the death penalty,"" he said, according to the Associated Press.
There is one man currently on New Hampshire's death row and he may not benefit from the measure. The repeal bill won't apply retroactively to Michael K. Addison, who was convicted of the 2006 killing of Manchester police officer Michael Briggs.
But capital punishment supporters worry that once the state abolishes the death penalty, the judicial system will be loath to apply it to Addison. ""The day that this passes and is signed into law, Mr. Addison's sentence will be converted to life in prison,"" said state Sen. Sharon Carson, according to the AP.
As New Hampshire Public Radio reports, Briggs's widow, Laura, opposed the push to abolish the death penalty. ""It's not about an eye for an eye or revenge,"" she said. ""It's about protecting our society from evil people that do evil things.""
It's been 80 years since New Hampshire last executed someone, when in 1939, Howard Long was hanged after he molested four children and killed two of them, including a 10-year-old boy.
The state's lawmakers have voted to repeal the death penalty twice this century – once in 2000, and once in 2018 — but in each case the governor vetoed the bill, the New York Times reported. Last year the state Senate failed to muster the 16 votes needed to override the veto. This time, the Senate has the numbers.
""Governor Sununu continues to stand with crime victims, members of the law enforcement community, and advocates for justice in opposing a repeal of the death penalty,"" his office said in a statement, according to the Washington Post .
Once the bill is signed by the House speaker, Senate president and secretary of state, Gov. Sununu will have five business days to either veto the bill, sign it or let it become law without a signature, the Union Leader reports."
Thousands Gather In LA For Nipsey Hussle's Memorial Service And Procession,www.npr.org,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712243221/thousands-gather-in-la-for-nipsey-hussles-memorial-service-and-procession,"Nearly 20,000 people gathered at LA's Staples Center to honor deceased rapper Nipsey Hussle in a public memorial service following his shooting death on March 31.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Roughly 20,000 people packed the Staples Center in Los Angeles today to honor the life of Nipsey Hussle. The 33-year-old musician and community activist was shot and killed 11 days ago right outside the clothing store he owned. NPR's Mandalit del Barco is with us from the Staples Center. Hey.
MANDALIT DEL BARCO, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa.
CHANG: So this memorial service - I know it's ended. And I understand it's followed by a procession.
DEL BARCO: That's right. I'm outside the Staples Center. It was a three-hour memorial, sold out. And imagine 20,000 people making noise for Nipsey Hussle.
CHANG: Yeah.
DEL BARCO: And the procession is winding through the streets of South LA for 25 miles through...
CHANG: Wow.
DEL BARCO: ...The Crenshaw neighborhood past the Marathon clothing store he owned and where he was shot and killed. And it ends up at a funeral home.
CHANG: Now, I know his family and his friends spoke during the service, and they shared a lot about what kind of person Nipsey Hussle was. How did they remember him?
DEL BARCO: Well, you know, the memorial started with reading a letter from President Barack Obama, who praised him as a symbol of hope. There was a eulogy from the Nation of Islam minister Louis Farrakhan and a performance by Stevie Wonder, who called for gun control and an end to violence. His parents were here to honor him, and others talked about how much he helped the community he came from. Here's his girlfriend Lauren London, her 9-year-old son Cameron Carter and Nipsey's brother Samuel Asghedom.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
LAUREN LONDON: I love you beyond this Earth. And until we meet again, the marathon continues.
(CHEERING)
CAMERON CARTER: In the morning, Ermias would say respect at the window. So on my count of three, I want everybody to yell respect. Three, two, one...
UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: Respect.
SAMIEL ASGHEDOM: Never let the pressure sway you from doing what you want to do. You never let anything - the politics - stop you from coming around and staying around. And I hope everybody knows that that's what bro did. Bro stayed, and he died on Crenshaw and Slauson.
DEL BARCO: Another well-known rapper from LA, Snoop Dogg, was also here to eulogize his friend.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
SNOOP DOGG: The late, great neighborhood Nip - rest in peace, cuz - Nipsey.
DEL BARCO: Snoop Dogg saluted Nipsey, and he also threw him gang signs to his coffin. The memorial's program had remarks by Kendrick Lamar, Issa Rae, Michael B. Jordan and LeBron James.
CHANG: So for our listeners who don't know a lot about Nipsey Hussle, can you just remind us? Why was he so beloved in Los Angeles and elsewhere?
DEL BARCO: Well, you know, his real name was Ermias Asghedom. He was 33 years old. He never left his neighborhood. And after running the streets with the Rollin' 60s, which is a set of the Crips, he made a career starting with mixed tapes. And he got so big that his album ""Victory Lap"" was nominated for a Grammy.
But he was also known as an entrepreneur. He had a brand - the Marathon brand - a clothing store, a studio. He also was a community activist. One of the things he did was renovate a basketball court at an elementary school. And he had an art project called Destination Crenshaw. He was really well-known in the neighborhood and worldwide.
CHANG: Looking back on the whole day, were there any other highlights that stayed with you?
DEL BARCO: There were a lot of highlights. But I think maybe one of them - why don't we just go out with Stevie Wonder?
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
STEVIE WONDER: (Singing) Would you know my name if I saw you in heaven?
CHANG: That is Mandalit del Barco reporting from Los Angeles, Calif. Thanks, Mandalit.
DEL BARCO: Thanks, Ailsa.

The City of Chicago on Thursday filed a civil complaint against actor Jussie Smollett trying to recoup the cost of his complaint to police that he'd been the subject of a racist and homophobic attack.
Police say he falsely reported that on Jan. 29 he was physically attacked in downtown Chicago by two masked individuals. Investigators later said Smollett staged that attack with the help of two acquaintances.
Smollett was arrested on Feb. 21 and a 16-count indictment was returned on March 7.
But less than 3 weeks later, prosecutors abruptly dropped the charges after the actor, who starred in the Fox TV series Empire , agreed to forfeit his $10,000 bond and performed community service.
Smollett has consistently denied that he faked the attack. But the City of Chicago and its police department maintain that he did and in the complaint, the city is asking for a jury trial ""to recover civil penalties, statutory treble damages, and attorney's fees and costs arising from the Defendant's false statements to the City.""

Teresa Crawford/AP hide caption toggle caption Teresa Crawford/AP Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, right, and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson held a news conference on March 26 to protest the dropping of charges against Smollett. Teresa Crawford/AP
The complaint outlines the allegations against Smollett in detail, citing text messages, GPS records and statements made to police by his alleged accomplices. The complaint says Smollett ""knowingly made numerous false statements of material fact"" and is asking for a civil penalty of $1000 for each of those statements.
In addition, the complaint states that the Chicago Police Department incurred $130, 106.15 in overtime pay and the complaint is asking for triple that amount in damages plus ""litigation and collection costs, and attorneys' fees.""
A spokesperson for Smollett declined to comment at the time this story was filed. Correction April 12, 2019

The Democratic-led Illinois Senate voted Thursday to compel President Trump to release five years' worth of his personal income tax returns or be barred from appearing on the state's presidential ballot next year.
The state is joining a movement of other Democratic states that aims to force the president to open up his personal finances by releasing his tax returns, something he stubbornly has refused to do and reiterated again this week.
During contentious floor debate in the Illinois statehouse, Trump's name wasn't mentioned once by the legislation's sponsor, state Sen. Tony Munoz, a Chicago Democrat who insisted he merely is trying to shed more transparency on the presidential campaign.
""If you want to run for vice president or president of the United States, hey, what's wrong with providing your tax returns for the past five years?"" Munoz asked his colleagues ahead of the Senate's 36-19 vote in favor of his bill.
""If you've got nothing to hide, you shouldn't worry about anything,"" he continued. ""That's how I see it."" Article continues below
Since before Trump was elected in 2016, Democrats have been trying to pressure him to release his tax returns in hopes of illuminating possible business relationships or sources of income from foreign powers, including Russia.
Last week, House Democrats in Washington made a formal demand to the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department for access to Trump's taxes, but a congressional deadline to produce the documents passed without action by Trump's administration.
Simultaneously, in New York state, Democrats in Albany have sought to work around the White House's intransigence on the issue by trying to gain access to Trump's state income tax returns.
The move in Illinois Thursday drew complaints from Republicans, who insisted the tax demand in order to qualify for the state ballot was unconstitutional and selectively avoided other officeholders, including the state's newly installed billionaire governor, Democrat JB Pritzker.
""This is quite frankly, with all due respect to the sponsor, an embarrassing waste of the Senate's time,"" said state Sen. Dale Righter, R-Mattoon, whose home county handed Trump 60 percent of the vote in 2016.
""This is being pushed by a far-leftist organization from the city of Chicago that wants to be able to get up and chirp about the president of the United States,"" Righter said. ""We ought to be better than this.""
Righter's reference was to several local affiliates of Indivisible, an anti-Trump organization. The Indivisible groups filed slips of support for Munoz's legislation ahead of Thursday's floor vote.
The measure now moves to the Illinois House, which like the Senate is heavily controlled by Democrats. Pritzker has not taken a public position on the bill.
Similar legislation is in play in 17 other statehouses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

What To Know About Israel's Elections,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781501/what-to-know-about-israels-elections?station=KXJZ_FM,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is dogged by corruption allegations but could be re-elected as the country votes Tuesday. His main challenger is a retired general promising clean government.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
There is a very important election taking place in Israel this week, and Israelis are faced with a central question - whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should continue to lead the country after a decade in power. He's facing corruption allegations, but there is a good chance he'll still get re-elected. And in these final days of the campaign, he has pledged a dramatic policy change that has profound implications. He says he will annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, which could make it almost impossible to create a viable independent Palestinian state. NPR's Daniel Estrin has more from Jerusalem.
(CHEERING)
DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Netanyahu greeted a crowd of supporters this weekend with a warning.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: (Foreign language spoken).
ESTRIN: ""The right-wing government is in danger,"" he said. ""If I don't win, a left-wing government will come to power."" Netanyahu is fighting his toughest race yet. The police have recommended corruption charges against Netanyahu for backroom dealings with businessmen. An indictment could come within months. And Netanyahu is facing a formidable challenger, former military chief of staff Benny Gantz. He wants to replace Netanyahu after 10 years in power.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BENNY GANTZ: I think Benjamin Netanyahu have done a lot for the country, but as we say, enough is enough.
(APPLAUSE)
ESTRIN: Gantz is new to politics, but he's teamed up with other former military generals to compete with Netanyahu's reputation as Mr. Security. Gantz's Blue and White Party is named after the colors of the Israeli flag, and he's run on a message of unifying the country. Gantz accuses Netanyahu of inciting against Israel's Palestinian-Arab citizens and embracing extremists by forging a political alliance with the far-right Jewish Power Party. Gantz has also suggested Netanyahu was behind a propaganda network of fake Twitter accounts, though Israel's election commissioner found no evidence of that. For his part, Netanyahu has waged an aggressive campaign on social media.
(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Foreign language spoken).
ESTRIN: This video on Netanyahu's Facebook page shows a split screen. On one side are Gantz and his political partner, a TV anchorman turned politician. They're branded as dangerous and inexperienced. On the other side of the screen, Netanyahu and President Trump. Netanyahu has been campaigning on his close ties with Trump. Netanyahu's party also put out a video it later apologized for - showing a military graveyard and claiming Gantz would lead a reckless left-wing government and cause hundreds of deaths. Netanyahu's campaign has also portrayed Gantz as mentally unstable, and Netanyahu calls the corruption allegations against him a left-wing media witch hunt. Israeli political analyst Reuven Hazan.
REUVEN HAZAN: Netanyahu will stop at nothing, and I would not want to oppose him because he is very, very good at campaigning.
ESTRIN: Israeli political journalist Tal Shalev summed up the campaign in a panel of The Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
TAL SHALEV: For the first time, one could say there was a real alternative for Netanyahu, but the Blue and White Party didn't hurt Netanyahu.
ESTRIN: And neither did the corruption allegations against him, she says. Polls show Gantz hasn't succeeded in wooing enough voters away from Netanyahu's traditional allies, right-wing parties, which are predicted to win a slight majority of the votes. Netanyahu could then form a government with those right-wing parties. Many of them are pushing for Israel to annex Jewish settlements in lands Palestinians demand for their own state. In a TV interview Saturday night, Netanyahu pledged he would do so if he wins.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
NETANYAHU: (Foreign language spoken).
ESTRIN: He said, ""will we go to the next phase? The answer is yes. We will go to the next phase to extend Israeli sovereignty."" The race is close. Some right-wing parties could choose an alliance with Gantz, crowning him prime minister. Polls show there are still many undecided voters, like Sarit Tepper. She doesn't want to vote for Netanyahu but doesn't know who'd be better.
SARIT TEPPER: I have nothing to compare to, so it's very difficult to say. It's a difficult country. No one else ever tried to be his place for a while now. People - other people try, but no one succeeded.
ESTRIN: The vote is on Tuesday. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Jerusalem.

The Man Who Keeps Fenway Park Running,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781529/the-man-who-keeps-fenway-park-running?station=KXJZ_FM,"Who has the toughest job in baseball? Maybe Donnie Gardiner, the facilities superintendent at Fenway Park. He's responsible for getting the 107-year-old ballpark ready for the Red Sox home opener.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
So who has the toughest job in baseball? It might just be Donnie Gardiner. He's the facility superintendent at Fenway Park in Boston. That means he makes sure that the oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball keeps running. Shira Springer of member station WBUR visited Gardiner as he got ready for another Red Sox season.
DONNIE GARDINER: Come on in. Welcome to Fenway.
SHIRA SPRINGER, BYLINE: Donnie Gardiner greets me at Gate D, then quickly walks to the visitors' clubhouse. He doesn't want to waste time, not with the Red Sox home opener fast approaching.
GARDINER: We have city inspections we have to worry about. We have construction we have to finish up. We have just all kinds of things going on right now.
SPRINGER: When you step into the visitors' clubhouse, you see what he means.
(SOUNDBITE OF CONSTRUCTION TOOLS RUNNING)
SPRINGER: Workers are installing walls, putting ceilings back together, painting, sanding, sawing, hammering. As Gardiner moves from the new whirlpool room to the new training room to the new video coaching room, he gets updates and gives advice.
GARDINER: Now we’ve just got to see if we can find some room up there to change the filters.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: It'll be close. We'll get them in.
GARDINER: Everything's been close.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I would wait on this because I don't know where we're going to cut the line. But I think we're going to cut the line.
SPRINGER: The same thing happens when he visits the Red Sox clubhouse area and checks on manager Alex Cora's new larger office and other upgrades. Teams have outgrown Fenway's cozy clubhouses. So there's always plenty of work to do for the Red Sox and the visitors.
GARDINER: I'm not playing one side over the other. Whatever we do for one, we do for the other.
SPRINGER: Donnie Gardiner is 5-foot-3 and a soft-spoken but commanding presence in the clubhouses. It's clear he knows how to handle the unpredictable challenges that come with renovating a 107-year-old ballpark. He should. He's worked there for three decades.
GARDINER: You know, everything we've done to this place has not taken away from the allure of the park. The feel is still there. This building has a feel to it. I mean, it does for me personally. You know, I've touched every inch of this place at one time or another.
SPRINGER: And with a footprint as small as Fenway's, every inch matters. Gardiner likes to say he plays a game of inches. He's constantly figuring out how to make the best use of limited space, especially in the clubhouse areas. Sometimes he's also working around brass waterlines that have stood the test of time. And during offseason renovations, sometimes he's uncovering remnants from Fenway's past.
GARDINER: When we ripped up the concourse a few years ago, we were - it was like an archeological dig, you know, finding the old nip bottles, old shoes. And the place was, I'm assuming, heated by coal because we found a lot of coal ash out in centerfield.
SPRINGER: When the ballpark reopens for business each season, Gardiner's focus shifts from renovations to preventative maintenance.
GARDINER: Game days are actually easier for the most part. If we do our job right, the building runs itself.
SPRINGER: But before the games begin again, there's a lot to do - turn on the water to concession stands, test generators, check emergency lighting, finish the construction in both clubhouses. The punch list goes on and on. And Gardiner's busy staying on top of it all.
GARDINER: It's unlike any other building. It's not Joe's Pizza. It's not a high-rise. It's not a supermarket. It's a very unique building. And the way it's used is very unique. And that's what I love about it. I'd get bored anywhere else.
SPRINGER: Even if that means putting in 100-hour weeks and occasionally sleeping in his office. One thing Donnie Gardiner doesn't do - watch the Red Sox play. He's too busy monitoring what's happening off the field. For NPR News, I'm Shira Springer in Boston.

Juno Flies By Jupiter,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781522/juno-flies-by-jupiter?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro asks NASA scientist Steven Levin about the spacecraft Juno's latest Jupiter fly-by, occurring this weekend.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
It's time for another entry to Lulu's Log, stardate April 7, 2019, where we explore matters of space, the stars and the universe.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And explore is the right word today as the spacecraft Juno makes another flyby of Jupiter. Juno launched in 2011, took five years to get to Jupiter and has been orbiting that planet since 2016, making occasional flybys like the one this weekend. Steven Levin is a Juno project scientist with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. And we're catching up with him at a conference in Vienna, Austria.
Good morning.
STEVEN LEVIN: Good morning.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: What are you looking for this time in this flyby?
LEVIN: So this particular flyby is actually an unusual one. We're turning sideways. So as we come down the planet from north to south, the spacecraft is rotating so that all the instruments look east to west.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And why is that important?
LEVIN: So that's important because, in particular for the microwave radiometer instrument, by looking across, we'll get a three-dimensional picture so we get a very different view of Jupiter's atmosphere. It's a little tricky because our solar rays are not pointed at the sun for a couple of hours while we do that, so that's why we don't do this all the time. But it'll give us a completely different perspective of Jupiter for that instrument.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And what are you hoping to find? Or do you know?
LEVIN: We're trying to understand Jupiter's atmosphere. We're interested in what it's made out of - how much water there is, how much ammonia there is, what the structure is. And so far, what we've found has been quite a puzzle. It's asymmetric. It's got a feature at the equator that looks different from everything off the equator. We see weather variations.
So now when we look sideways, we'll learn about some of those weather variations. We'll learn about how things might be varying with longitude instead of latitude. We thought Jupiter would be cylindrically symmetric. But Jupiter has surprised us in a lot of ways, and that could be one of them. And then we'll also get - I hope - a really nice 3D map of a strip of Jupiter.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Why is Jupiter so mysterious? And why has it been so difficult to sort of understand what it is like there?
LEVIN: Well, to start with, before the spacecraft got there, Jupiter's a mystery because all we're seeing from Earth is the tops of the clouds. It's this giant planet. We've been studying it for centuries, but you can't see the interior. So when we got there with the spacecraft, we were all prepared to do a lot of measurements to learn about the interior of Jupiter. And basically, every way in which we looked at it threw us a curveball, showed us a surprise.
So we used gravity science. We measured how fast the spacecraft falls to learn about the interior. And we find that the dense core that we expected to find in the center of Jupiter is there, but it's not quite so small. It's larger, and there may be a second one. And we find that the belts and zones that we see go a few thousand kilometers deep. So Jupiter has been a surprise. And basically, we're re-learning the lesson that scientists learn all the time, which is every time you look at something in a new way, you find a surprise.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And why is that important other than just curiosity? I mean, what can Jupiter tell us about Earth?
LEVIN: Jupiter can tell us about the formation of the solar system. You have to remember when you're thinking about this that Jupiter is not just the largest planet in the solar system. It's more than twice the mass of all the others combined, and it formed first. So if you want to understand, how did the planets form? - well, in some sense, they formed as the leftovers from Jupiter. So you really need to understand how Jupiter formed.
But to understand how it's formed, you need to know what it's made out of, in particular, water is really important because it probably formed from icy planetesimals. And you want to know, did they form really cold or closer to the sun than Jupiter is now or further out? But you want to know about the heavy metals as well - the heavier elements that sunk to the center of Jupiter and make its core. So by trying to understand how this one giant planet formed, we can learn a lot about how the whole solar system formed and, of course, about how the Earth formed and where we came from.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Steven Levin, a project scientist with the Juno mission. Thank you so much.
LEVIN: Oh, my pleasure.

Mueller Report: Understanding Redactions,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781515/mueller-report-understanding-redactions?station=KXJZ_FM,"Lawmakers anxiously await the Mueller report, but there's a catch: redactions. Greg Brower, formerly the FBI's chief liaison to Congress, discusses with Lulu Garcia-Navarro what might be blacked out.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
Attorney General William Barr has promised lawmakers the long-awaited Mueller report, but, of course, there's a catch - redactions. House Democrats and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler wants to see the report without those big blocks of blacked-out text, but Barr wants to remove sensitive information. Greg Brower is the former assistant director for the Office of Congressional Affairs at the FBI. So he's done some redacting, it's safe to say, in his time. And he joins me now in the studio. Welcome.
GREG BROWER: Good morning.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. So what kinds of information would Barr want to redact? And is he obliged to redact it? Or is it really up to him?
BROWER: Well, yes and no. There are four basic categories. The first would be information in the report that might invade the privacy of individuals, perhaps minor players who were really under investigation and who are not public figures. Secondly, there is classified information that is likely to be in the report. That's a more serious matter. But Congress is used to dealing with hearing classified briefings that the public doesn't necessarily get. The third category would be grand jury information that is governed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6. And that's also a complicated matter that is currently a matter of a lot of debate. And then finally, in a very serious and difficult to deal with - a type of information is information relating to ongoing investigations that the Department of Justice may still have ongoing - and that information about cannot be made public.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So as a journalist, I've seen whole documents that were almost totally big, black bars. What's the typical level of redaction for Congress to receive? I mean, are they expected to get the full Mueller report or, you know, or something that might look like you have no idea what's in it?
BROWER: Well, I think in terms of Congress's expectation, I think it's clear they're expecting to see everything. And in fact, there was a recent vote - as you know - in the House of Representatives - 420 to nothing to supporting the full disclosure of the report. But the devil is in the details, of course. Congress is used to, as I said, receiving information in a classified setting, classified briefings. Not every member of Congress typically receives that information. The intelligence committees in both the House and the Senate are used to receiving classified briefings. And then for the highest level of classified information, the so-called Gang of Eight regularly receives briefings of classified information.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: There has been some speculation that Mueller wrote his report with the intention that not a lot of it would have to be redacted, that it was going to be written in a manner so that it could be delivered almost wholesale, at least to Congress. What do you think about that? Do you think that that might be true?
BROWER: I think it might be true. And in fact, if you look to a recent example from 2017, when the intelligence community created a document known as the intelligence community assessment, which was essentially a report on the efforts by the Russian government to interfere in the election, there was a classified version and an unclassified version. And so the idea that Mueller and his team could create a version of its report that is not really going to have to be redacted much is certainly possible.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So if that's the case and if there are redactions - we don't know how many redactions there'll be. But this is a process that is taking a bit of time. So clearly, something is going on. Will that then have to be fought over? I mean, will Congress come back and say, we want to see different portions of this?
BROWER: That is likely to be the case and certainly appears to be shaping up as a fight. I think the toughest part and the part that's been receiving a lot of attention in the last few days is the grand jury information piece of this. That is something that - there is a precedent for grand jury information to be released. That's typically done when the Department of Justice does not object to the release of such information. That was the case in the so-called Haldeman decision in the Watergate era.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Under Nixon?
BROWER: Under Nixon. And that could be the case here if they - if the department decided that it would not object to the release of grand jury information, that would simplify at least that piece of it.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: We only have a few seconds left, but I am going to ask you this question. There is a concern, of course, that Barr's redactions will be politically motivated - there's been a lot of discussion about that - and that they will be aimed at protecting the president. Is that a concern that you share?
BROWER: Well, I - I'd like to not share that concern, frankly. And I implicitly trust the new attorney general to do the right thing in this context. But the March 24 letter that he put out was very confusing. And that has led to a lot of belief that he, perhaps, is acting for political reasons. I'd like to think that's not the case.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Greg Brower, former FBI liaison to Congress. Thanks very much.
BROWER: Thank you.

Reacting To The LDS Church's Latest LGBT Policy Change,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781508/reacting-to-the-lds-churchs-latest-lgbt-policy-change?station=KXJZ_FM,"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints reversed a controversial policy about children of same-sex couples being baptized. NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro speaks with Jamison Manwaring.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
This past week, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced it will reverse a controversial policy that labeled couples in same-sex marriages apostates, saying they had turned their backs on the church. It also banned their children from being blessed or baptized until they turned 18. Jason (ph) Manwaring is gay, and he grew up in the LDS Church. He took a painful step back from the church after that policy went into effect in 2015. But now he's feeling some relief.
JAMISON MANWARING: Yeah, I was - I'm - was and still am cautiously optimistic about the change. When the policy was put in effect 3 1/2 years ago, it had a very negative impact. But it's good news, right? It doesn't change the pain that was caused for people and the angst and the anxiety in families. But, you know, we want to look forward, and that's how I view it.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: You talked about the policy change in a Facebook video and let's listen.
(SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)
MANWARING: This morning's announcement is certainly not an announcement of support for LGBT people, a support - an announcement of support that you should come out and that you should be feel - you should feel welcome being gay at church. It isn't because the church still does not believe that you can be in a gay relationship, a same-sex relationship and be at one with the church policy and essentially at one with God, that that does not work, is not possible.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what other steps do you hope the church will take to fully support the LGBTQ community?
MANWARING: Well, it isn't a place today where I feel comfortable as an out gay man. The teachings that are there from a spiritual level have benefited me a lot throughout my life. But when it comes to this specific issue, even though this is improvement over a policy against gay folks, they're - it is certainly not affirming of gay families. And that's something that, you know, when you think of a 15 or 16-year-old - in fact, I have a nephew who's in high school who has recently come out, and his family was active in their local congregation. It's a very difficult environment for a gay person, young and old, still today to be an active participant in the church.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Leaving the leadership aside, are you finding that the Mormon church community is becoming more receptive to people of the LGBTQ community?
MANWARING: I really do. So my partner and I had been quite involved in my congregation. And when the policy was announced and that really began to sink in and my partner and I were discussing what that meant to us, we had several folks in my neighborhood, in my congregation reached out and and said, you know, we love you being here, and we don't want you to go anywhere. And that is - that's what I miss, quite frankly, is the community of Latter-day Saints who have that sort of love. And I have never personally felt unwelcome as a gay person in my congregation. But the policies that flow from headquarters are a different story.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: The original policy in 2015 prevented the children of those marriages, same-sex marriages, from being blessed or baptized until they turned 18. One of the things that you've always talked about is wanting a family of your own. So how does this change inform your thinking on that now?
MANWARING: Yeah. You know, I - when the policy was announced, it was a challenge for me because I - it clearly said to me that I would not be welcome raising children in the church. And I have - since that time, I've been to many churches, other churches, trying to find a spiritual home for myself and for my future family. And so this doesn't mean that I come back, you know, Sunday with my shirt and tie on ready to re-engage. I'm not ready for that yet. But I want to kind of wait and see, and I'm cautiously hopeful that they will find a way to allow and to support and affirm gay folks - youth, adults and families - in the church.
And I'll speak for myself. I want to be close to God. I want to follow and live a life where I can feel his presence and direction. And if I have a family, I want to be able to have support in doing that from the church community. So I don't think that this change changes everything for me today, but I remain optimistic that as people continue to be open, that that understanding and that that love will increase for people like myself.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was Jamison Manwaring. Thank you very much for being with us.
MANWARING: Thank you for having me.

College Campus Tries Out Robot Delivery,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781494/college-campus-tries-out-robot-delivery?station=KXJZ_FM,"At George Mason University in Northern Virginia, a fleet of autonomous robots roam the sidewalks delivering pizza, doughnuts and coffee to students.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
Delivery robots have been popping up in high-end hotels. Now they are making their way to a younger clientele. Patrick Madden of member station WAMU reports from one university in Northern Virginia.
PATRICK MADDEN, BYLINE: George Mason University looks like any other big college campus - tall buildings, dorms, green grass and wide sidewalks where streams of students make their way to classes, except here on this campus, there's something not so ordinary - robots.
STARSHIP DELIVERY ROBOT: Hello. Here's your delivery.
MADDEN: This is one of several dozen Starship food delivery robots here on campus. Picture a cooler on wheels that resembles R2-D2, if you're a ""Star Wars"" fan. This one was kind enough to bring me doughnuts and coffee.
STARSHIP DELIVERY ROBOT: Thank you. Have a nice day.
MADDEN: For the students at George Mason, these little robots are a trip.
GRACE PERREIRA-PLAZA: I think it's pretty cool and kind of adorable to be honest.
MADDEN: Twenty-year-old student Grace Perreira-Plaza says, at first, students were obsessed with these little bots, taking pictures, selfies, dressing them up for the holidays. Now...
PERREIRA-PLAZA: We find it actually a little bit normal now just seeing them go by. It's like, oh, there they are.
MADDEN: George Mason University says it's the first college in the U.S. to incorporate robots into its student dining plan. The school is partnering with food-service provider Sodexo for the program. It works like this. Instead of, say, walking to the campus Dunkin' Donuts or the Subway sandwich shop, you can place that order from an app, and the robot will bring it to you anywhere on campus. Mark Kraner, head of the school's retail operations, says, when he was first approached about the idea, he couldn't resist.
MARK KRANER: This is going to be a fun ride. We knew the students would just jump all over it.
MADDEN: For the robots, perhaps, the biggest hurdle has been crossing the main road that cuts through campus. But these robots are able to adapt and learn.
KRANER: Working with their algorithms that if they see a student start across the road, they'll be right behind them. So they are learning.
MADDEN: The company behind these robots, Starship Technologies, is planning to roll out these robotic food delivery systems at other schools and corporate campuses. Mark Touhy, an executive at Starship, says the goal of this technology is to save people time.
MARK TOUHY: I think, like most technologies, they'll quickly become taken for granted and just a part of our everyday lives.
MADDEN: And that's basically what happened at George Mason. The college students don't seem to bat an eye when these things scooter along delivering coffee and doughnuts.
STARSHIP DELIVERY ROBOT: I'm a Starship delivery robot.
MADDEN: For the rest of us, it might take some time getting used to. For NPR News, I'm Patrick Madden.

Shell Withdraws From Oil Lobby Group,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781487/shell-withdraws-from-oil-lobby-group?station=KXJZ_FM,"Royal Dutch Shell is withdrawing from an oil lobbying group because of disagreements about environmental policy. NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro speaks with Amy Harder of Axios about the move.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
When you think of groups who are working to fight climate change, you probably don't think of big oil companies. But this past week, Royal Dutch Shell said it's withdrawing from a D.C.-based oil lobbying group because of disagreements about environmental policy. Amy Harder, who covers energy for Axios, tells us how that decision got made.
AMY HARDER: Shell said last year - under pressure from investors, I should note - that it was going to do a review of all its memberships of trade associations around the world. And it found that one was wholly misaligned with its positions on climate change, namely that Shell supports acting on climate change and pricing carbon emissions. And it found that a D.C.-based membership group that represents oil and gas refineries specifically did not align with that. So it is not going to renew its membership, but it did keep its membership in all others, including, notably, the American Petroleum Institute, which really is the most influential trade group here in Washington on these issues.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: When you say that they did it because under pressure, what kind of pressure?
HARDER: Well, the investor angle in this broader story of what oil and gas companies are doing on climate change is really important because investors are becoming more activist, and there's this process called shareholder democracy where investors urge companies to do things. And so it's a little bit wonky, but it's incredibly important because it ends up with things like this, which is a commitment to review its trade associations. And to my knowledge, no other oil and gas company has really committed to doing this. So Shell could be an outlier, or it could be the beginning of a trend.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I think some people might find it surprising that a company like Shell is being vocal about climate change.
HARDER: The big picture is that for a very long time - for the next several decades at least - Shell will remain an oil and gas fossil fuel company. But they're starting to see the writing on the wall with this energy transition happening around the world. And they want to make sure that they stay profitable and relevant. But I think there's a lot of nuance and details that can get glossed over. And one important one is that their investments in this space and their work in this space such as leaving one trade group but staying in, you know, more than a dozen others, you know, is likely not going to be enough for a lot of really activist environmentalists who want wholesale changes at these companies. But what these companies say is that we are, you know, a publicly traded company with investors, and we do need to return a profit for these investors. So these companies are really trying to strike a balance there.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you expect other companies to follow suit, or will this put pressure on some of these trade organizations to change their position on climate change?
HARDER: Shell is certainly one of the most progressive big oil companies in this space, but it's not the only one. One interesting trend that I'm looking at is to what degree there's a growing division between European companies and American companies. The American companies are far more cautious because just the culture in America is a lot different than that in Europe, which is - you know, it has a big climate policy across the continent. Its people are a little bit more progressive in this area than America. So that's the backdrop. There is, however, a trend here in Washington with both Exxon and ConocoPhillips actually funding a carbon tax advocacy campaign. They're actually urging Congress to pass a carbon tax. So I think that's significant, even if they haven't taken these other steps that say Shell has to remove their memberships from some of these groups.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Amy Harder of Axios, thank you so much.
HARDER: Thank you.

What's Been Learned About Genocide Since Rwanda,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781480/whats-been-learned-about-genocide-since-rwanda?station=KXJZ_FM,"NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro talks with David Simon, who directs the Genocide Studies Program at Yale University, on the 25th anniversary of the start of Rwanda's genocide.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
Over 100 days in 1994, 800,000 people died in Rwanda. The genocide began 25 years ago on today's date - members of the Hutu majority killing minority Tutsis and moderate Hutu en masse. It was a never-again moment for the world. And yet the world has not lived up to that promise. David Simon directs the Genocide Studies Program at Yale. He's in Rwanda now at a memorial conference, and he joins us. Good morning.
DAVID SIMON: Good morning.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: What are you hearing there at the conference? What are they saying at this particular moment?
SIMON: Well, for Rwanda, it's a - a moment like this is a moment to look back and mourn the dead. But when they look back at 1994, they remain, I think, justifiably very angry at the way the world, especially in the form of the United Nations but also the French in particular, let them down. And that still reverberates in 2019.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah. Are the lessons of the Rwandan genocide 25 years later different than they were immediately afterward or even a few years afterward? I mean, do we know much more about genocide?
SIMON: Absolutely. I think we do know a lot more. You know, it's easy to say that because genocide persists, we haven't learned the lessons of Rwanda. But the things that we have learned has led to the development of things like early warning systems and national and international institutions. So for example, the Atrocities Prevention Board in the U.S. or the United Nations Office for the Prevention of Genocide did not exist in 1994 and do now in trying to urge people into action.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And so what are the big lessons that we haven't learned?
SIMON: In Rwanda, France's connections to the genocidal regime, in the United States, fear of a Somalia-like quagmire that could have endangered U.S. troops, together led the Security Council to vote actually to pull peacekeepers out of Rwanda after the genocide had started rather than sending more in. So the lesson that we should have learned is that we have to - and those powerful countries in particular - have to privilege human protection over national interests.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And yet we see, at this particular moment in time, isolationism on the rise. We see it in Brexit. We see it here in the United States. Does that make the fight against genocide more difficult?
SIMON: Oh, I think it absolutely does. There's been a lot of progress in the last 25 years, including the creation of their doctrine that's called Responsibility to Protect, which says that the United Nations has a responsibility to protect the people of a country when their own states fail to do so. What happens if that multilateralism falls apart is that we start to question those powers that do intervene. You start to question their motives in those instances where multilateralism falters.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's David Simon, director of Yale's Genocide Studies Program. Thank you very much.
SIMON: Thank you, Lulu.

"Sunday Politics: Trump And Mexico, Biden",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710781463/sunday-politics-trump-and-mexico-biden?station=KXJZ_FM,"President Trump threatens more tariffs on Mexico over the influx of migrants crossing the border, while Joe Biden responded to women's allegations of inappropriate touching.
LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:
President Trump was at the U.S. southern border again. He continued to advocate for building more wall, kept up his threat to close the border at some point and even talked about levying more tariffs on Mexico.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Trading is very important. The borders are very important. But security is what is most important, and we have to have security.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Joining me now to break this down and discuss the rest of the political news of the day is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
Good morning, Mara.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: All right. President Trump has backed off his threat to close the border. But at the same time, he did something else that was interesting. He threatened tariffs on Mexico at the same time that his administration is trying to build support for his trade deal that is replacing NAFTA. Doesn't this run counter to one another?
LIASSON: It certainly does. He's threatening tariffs on Mexico if Mexico doesn't do what he wants them to do, which is stop the tide of migrants and drugs at the border. But he just signed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement the renegotiated NAFTA, which says you can't do that. You can't put tariffs on Canada or Mexico. And this is what Trump said about that.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: This will supersede USMCA. USMCA's a great deal, and it's very good for Mexico. But this will supersede USMCA.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So that's the United-States-Mexico-Canada agreement. Why is he doing this?
LIASSON: Well, USMCA certainly is a huge accomplishment for him. He's talked about it that way. But it shows that he loves tariffs. He said, I'm a tariff man. Of course, that raises the question, why sign a free trade agreement that prohibits tariffs if you like them so much? - but also the more important issue that immigration and appealing to xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment is a signature issue for Trump. He thinks it's very important to his base. He used it in 2016. He'll use it again in 2020. That's why he was in Calexico, Mexico, this past Friday, saying this.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: The system is full - can't take you anymore, whether it's asylum, whether it's anything you want. It's illegal immigration - can't take you anymore. We can't take you. Our country is full.
LIASSON: Of course, that's not true. The U.S. is facing a looming labor shortage. And it goes against the entire idea of America, which was built on immigration. The president has even mocked asylum-seekers, suggesting that he doesn't believe anyone could be fleeing for their lives from Central America. As far as he's concerned, asylum is a kind of scam.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Switching gears, I want to talk about former Vice President Biden. He's having his own #MeToo moment. President Trump was relatively restrained about it at first. But that did not last long.
LIASSON: No, it didn't. At first, he waved off questions, saying that he didn't really want to answer the questions about Biden. That lasted about a day or two. Then he retweeted a video from a pro-Trump PAC that doctored Biden's apology video, showed Biden popping up in the background - cartoonish head putting his hands on the real Biden's shoulders. And so he has waded into a new chapter with a new enemy and foil, somebody he wants to denigrate and make fun of.
Biden, for the first time, got into the Twitter wars, tweeted in response to that, quote, ""I see you are on the job and presidential as always."" So as we know, Biden is widely expected to get into the race later this month, probably after Easter. We know how the pundit class and the Twitterverse (ph) responded to his #MeToo moment. They don't think he's handled it very well. What we don't know is what Democratic voters are going to think about Biden.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thank you.
LIASSON: Thank you.

Hundreds Of Migrants Released In The Rio Grande Valley,www.npr.org,"Jack White, director, Good Neighbor Settlement House",04-07-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/07/710366095/shelters-and-city-governments-scramble-to-help-migrants-in-the-rio-grande-valley?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Good Neighbor Settlement House in Brownsville, Texas, is helping recently released migrants by offering them a meal, shower and some new clothes before journeying up north to await their day in immigration court.

toggle caption Eric Gay/AP Good Neighbor Settlement House in Brownsville, Texas, is helping recently released migrants by offering them a meal, shower and some new clothes before journeying up north to await their day in immigration court.
Eric Gay/AP More than 76,000 people were apprehended or surrendered on the Southern border in February and administration officials project that number would surpass 100,000 for March.
The highest number of crossings are taking place in Texas' Rio Grande Valley.
The Good Neighbor Settlement House, a homeless shelter in Brownsville, Texas, is now also being used to house migrants released from U.S. Customs and Border Protection custody. They normally help a couple dozen migrants a day, but recently the numbers shot up to more than 400 a day.
We don't intend to back off of the mission we embrace. They can keep sending them, we're going to serve them.
Jack White, director, Good Neighbor Settlement House
The migrants are brought here for a short period of time and can shower, eat and get some clean clothes. Volunteers help migrants work out travel arrangements so they can meet up with relatives or sponsors in other parts of the country while they await their day in immigration court.
All along the Texas border, cities are dealing with an unprecedented influx of migrants.

toggle caption Reynaldo Leanos Jr./Texas Public Radio Migrants line up inside Good Neighborhood Settlement House in Brownsville, Texas, as they are about to board a vehicle and head to a local airport.
Reynaldo Leanos Jr./Texas Public Radio The shelter started their Refugee Respite Program in August at the request of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley. Jack White, the director of Good Neighbor, says he's recently seen a spike in numbers and they are no longer receiving advance notice from CBP when migrants are being released.
Still, White says, they're dealing with it.
""Will it be hard?"" asked White. ""Yes, but we don't intend to back off of the mission we embrace. They can keep sending them, we're going to serve them.""
Migrants usually arrive at the shelter with some documentation about relatives or sponsors to contact to arrange shelter while they await their immigration court proceedings — that wait can take months, even years, because of the huge backlog of cases.
But Marianela Ramirez-Watson, the director for the Refugee Respite Program, says last weekend they ran into a new problem.
""A group of people showed up without their paperwork and so the minute we caught it we called CBP and they said, 'Oh my gosh, they weren't supposed to send that bus yet,' "" said Ramirez-Watson. ""Some confusion when you're dealing with as many people as they are.""
While local organizations, like Good Neighbor, handle the releases, the Trump administration continues to call on Congress to change immigration laws to stave off what they consider a national emergency at the border.
But César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández says the real crisis isn't with people asking for asylum, it's with the immigration system itself.
García Hernández is an associate professor of law at the University of Denver and a Rio Grande Valley native. He said it's important to point out that this administration has already made some changes in an effort to limit the number of asylum-seekers.
""[In the past] a person could make a claim, a successful claim for asylum based on abuse by a violent spouse. Or because of violence being inflicted by the gangs that are destabilizing much of Central America,"" said García Hernández. ""The Trump administration has made it almost impossible to make those claims.""
Still, the asylum-seekers keep coming.
As Good Neighbor braces for more, Brownsville's mayor, Tony Martinez, said his city has adapted to the challenge pretty well. Martinez said CBP said to expect nearly 6,000 migrants across the Rio Grande Valley this week.
""I've been in situations where there is no way to control something, whether it's a health problem, or otherwise, and you really feel helpless and overwhelmed and you're at your wits' ends,"" said Martinez. ""Here, because of the community coming together, we lift each other's heart to meet the occasion.""
Meanwhile, CBP announced Thursday that construction of 13 miles of new border wall in the Rio Grande Valley will begin this month."
Ohio's 6-Week Abortion Ban Becomes Law; Opponents Will Sue,www.npr.org,"Gov. Mike DeWine, Ohio",04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712455980/a-bill-banning-most-abortions-becomes-law-in-ohio?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed the ""heartbeat bill"" one day after it passed the Republican-led General Assembly. Paul Vernon/AP Paul Vernon/AP Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed the ""heartbeat bill"" one day after it passed the Republican-led General Assembly.
Paul Vernon/AP The six-week abortion ban known as the ""heartbeat bill"" is now law in Ohio. That makes Ohio the sixth state in the nation to attempt to outlaw abortions at the point a fetal heartbeat can be detected.
Gov. Mike DeWine signed the bill Thursday afternoon, just one day after it passed the Republican-led General Assembly. The law is slated to take effect in 90 days, unless blocked by a federal judge.
Now known as the ""Human Rights Protection Act,"" SB 23 outlaws abortions as early as five or six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women know they're pregnant. It is one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country.
The bill does include an exception to save the life of the woman, but no exceptions for cases of rape or incest.
Government's role should be to protect life from the beginning to the end.
Gov. Mike DeWine, Ohio
""The essential function of government is to protect the most vulnerable among us, those who don't have a voice,"" DeWine said as he signed the bill. ""Government's role should be to protect life from the beginning to the end.""
Federal judges in Kentucky and Iowa have blocked the laws or struck them down as unconstitutional. Another bill in Georgia has yet to be signed by the governor.
DeWine's signature will set off a lengthy legal fight. The ACLU of Ohio announced it will sue to stop the law, which the group says ""virtually bans all abortion care.""
Law Federal Judge Blocks North Carolina Ban On Abortions Later Than 20 Weeks National Trump's Overhaul Of Federal Family Planning Program Faces Multiple Lawsuits ""This legislation is blatantly unconstitutional and we will fight to the bitter end to ensure that this bill is permanently blocked,"" said ACLU of Ohio legal director Freda Levenson in a statement .
The group plans to sue on behalf of Pre-Term Cleveland, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio, Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio and the Women's Med Center of Dayton.
We will fight to the bitter end to ensure that this bill is permanently blocked.
Freda Levenson, ACLU of Ohio
But DeWine and lawmakers said they aren't dissuaded by the threat of legal action. Since taking office in January, DeWine had said he planned to sign whichever version of the heartbeat bill ended up on his desk.
""Will there be a lawsuit? Yeah, we are counting on it,"" said state Rep. Ron Hood on Wednesday. ""We're counting on it. We're excited about it.""
Anti-abortion groups such as Ohio Right To Life say they intend the heartbeat bill to trigger a U.S. Supreme Court case striking down the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. That case legalized abortion up until viability, usually at 22-24 weeks.
""If this is what it takes, we will see you at the Supreme Court,"" said Planned Parenthood of Ohio President Iris Harvey at a rally Wednesday outside the Statehouse.
The Ohio Senate originally passed the bill last month. The Republican-led House Health Committee then made several changes before sending it to the House floor, where it passed by party-line vote.
Beyond changing the name, the Ohio House version allows for the use of transvaginal ultrasounds to detect a fetal heartbeat even earlier in a pregnancy.
The bill institutes criminal penalties for doctors who violate the law. Doctors who perform abortions after detecting a heartbeat would face a fifth-degree felony and up to a year in prison. The legislation also allows the State Medical Board to take disciplinary actions against doctors found in violation and impose penalties of up to $20,000.
After hearing testimony from lawmakers and advocates, the Ohio House passed the bill Wednesday afternoon, 56-40, and the Ohio Senate quickly followed to affirm the changes, 18-12.
""Pro-life Ohio thanks Governor DeWine for taking a courageous stand on behalf of unborn children with beating hearts,"" said Ohio Right to Life President Mike Gonidakis in a statement .
Currently, Ohio prohibits abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, and lawmakers in 2018 passed a law banning the ""dilation and evacuation"" method of abortion used most commonly after 12 weeks of pregnancy. The latter was blocked from taking effect by a federal judge in March.
The Ohio Senate in March passed another bill requiring the burial or cremation of fetal remains. The bill is now being considered in the Ohio House.
Legislators attempted several times before to pass the heartbeat bill, but the legislation was twice vetoed by former Gov. John Kasich, who warned it would prove costly for the state to defend in court."
Pope Benedict Breaks 6-Year Silence To Comment On Clergy Sex Abuse Scandal,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712409110/pope-benedict-breaks-6-year-silence-to-comment-on-clergy-sex-abuse-scandal?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI arrives at St Peter's basilica in 2015.

Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI has broken six years of relative silence with the release of an outspoken letter on the clergy sex abuse scandal. Benedict's analysis differs significantly from that of his successor, Pope Francis, and thus leaves the world's Catholics with contrasting papal perspectives on the greatest crisis facing Roman Catholicism today.
In his 6,000-word essay, published Thursday in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera , with an English translation by the Catholic News Agency, Benedict blames the epidemic of clergy sex abuse largely on a collapse of moral standards in the 1960s and the subsequent failure of Catholic leaders to uphold traditional church teaching.
Religion Pope Issues New Edict Requiring Vatican Officials To Report Sex Abuse Allegations ""It could be said,"" Benedict writes, ""that in the 20 years from 1960 to 1980, the previously normative standards regarding sexuality collapsed entirely."" Among the changes, in Benedict's view, was that pedophilia became seen as ""allowed and appropriate,"" and pornography became widespread and accepted. The priesthood, meanwhile, fell into crisis.
""Catholic moral theology,"" Benedict writes, ""suffered a collapse that rendered the Church defenseless against these changes in society. ... [T]here could no longer be anything that constituted an absolute good, any more than anything fundamentally evil; (there could be) only relative moral judgments. There no longer was the (absolute) good, but only the relatively better, contingent on the moment and on circumstances.""
Though Benedict stops short of blaming gay priests for the epidemic of minor abuse, as some have , he claims that ""homosexual cliques"" were established ""more or less openly"" in Catholic seminaries, thus changing the seminary climate in such a way as to contribute to a breakdown in the preparation of priests for their ministry.
Benedict has espoused similar views previously, both as a cardinal and as pope, but in the six years since stepping into ""emeritus"" status, he has largely kept silent and let Pope Francis speak for the church. Francis has argued that the clergy abuse crisis is rooted in a culture of clericalism, where priests and bishops became so elevated that their word and authority dominate over the experience of the people they serve, thus contributing to a lack of accountability. He has expressed a more tolerant view of homosexuality.
In his letter, Benedict says he asked Francis in advance whether he would consider publication of the letter ""appropriate,"" and at no time does he suggest any criticism of the Francis papacy. He says he was motivated to write his letter by the recent Rome summit on clergy abuse, convened by Francis, and that he intended his comments to be ""a helpful contribution."" At the end of his letter, he thanks Francis ""for everything he does to show us, again and again the light of God, which has not disappeared, even today.""
Religion As Catholic Sex Abuse Crisis Deepens, Conservative Circles Blame Gay Priests Austen Ivereigh, a Francis biographer and frequent commentator on Vatican issues, argued in a response to the Benedict letter that it should not be taken as an attack on Francis and that ""on the fundamentals,"" the two popes have much in common.
It is, nevertheless, remarkable to have two popes speaking simultaneously on the most divisive issue facing the church, and Benedict's letter may well raise concerns that the Vatican can no longer speak with a single voice.
In his book The Pope: Francis, Benedict, and the Decision That Shook the World , Anthony McCarten highlights the consequence of having two living popes. ""For every papal pronouncement,"" he writes, ""there walks and breathes the rebuttal, the living counterargument—invalidating it.""
With two papal perspectives on the clergy abuse crisis now available, Catholics may feel free to choose between them, leaving neither one with the authority a papal position would normally carry."
Michael Avenatti Indicted For Allegedly Stealing Paraplegic Client's Settlement Money,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/11/712269305/michael-avenatti-indicted-for-allegedly-stealing-paraplegic-clients-settlement-m?station=KXJZ_FM,"Enlarge this image Attorney Michael Avenatti, shown here arriving in federal court this month, is accused of stealing millions of dollars from clients, among other charges.

Jae C. Hong/AP Updated at 6:06 p.m. ET
Celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti, who is already accused of federal financial crimes, has been indicted on 36 counts of embezzlement and fraud by a California federal grand jury, U.S. prosecutors announced Thursday.
If Avenatti is found guilty of all charges in the new indictment, he could be sentenced to a maximum of 335 years in prison.
The lawyer had a rapid rise to fame, most prominently representing Stormy Daniels in the adult film actress's case against President Trump. He was a regular guest on cable news programs and even floated a Democratic presidential campaign, during which he told crowds: ""I say, 'When they go low, we hit harder.' ""
Now prosecutors allege that Avenatti stole millions of dollars from his clients.
Those clients include ""Client 1,"" a man who is paraplegic and who won a $4 million settlement from Los Angeles County. Prosecutors allege Avenatti drained money from the man's trust account and used the money to finance a coffee business and pay other expenses.
""More than four years later, Client 1 is still waiting to receive his portion of the settlement,"" U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna said at a news conference in Los Angeles.
Politics Attorney Michael Avenatti, Sometime Scourge To Trump, Now Faces Federal Charges According to court documents, prosecutors say Avenatti would occasionally send Client 1 ""advance"" payments that didn't exceed $1,900. He also allegedly undermined his paraplegic client's attempt to buy a house and jeopardized his Social Security payments by failing to file paperwork.
In an emailed statement, law firm Greenberg Gross LLP identified Client 1 as a man named Geoffrey Johnson.
""Mr. Johnson is the victim of an appalling fraud perpetrated by the one person who owed him loyalty and honesty most of all: his own lawyer,"" said attorney Josh Robbins. ""Mr. Avenatti stole millions of dollars that were meant to compensate Mr. Johnson for a devastating injury, spent it on his own lavish lifestyle, then lied about it to Mr. Johnson for years to cover his tracks. His actions have left Mr. Johnson destitute.""
Avenatti denied the allegations in posts on Twitter . ""I am entitled to a FULL presumption of innocence and am confident that justice will be done once ALL of the facts are known,"" he wrote. ""I intend to fully fight all charges and plead NOT GUILTY. I look forward to the entire truth being known as opposed to a one-sided version meant to sideline me.""
In addition to Client 1, Hanna said, Avenatti followed a similar pattern with four other clients.
""Mr. Avenatti received the money on behalf of clients and simply took the money to finance his businesses and personal expenses,"" Hanna said. In one of those instances, he said, Avenatti took some $2.5 million of a client's settlement money and put it toward a private jet.
""As an attorney, holding your clients' money in trust is one of your highest duties. It is Lawyer 101: You do not steal your clients' money,"" said Hanna.
Avenatti is accused of failing to pay income taxes — in fact, the federal probe that led to Thursday's indictment began as an IRS investigation in September 2016 as officials were trying to collect debts from Avenatti's coffee business, Tully's Coffee.
""The indictment paints the picture of an individual who began to run afoul with the IRS nearly a decade ago,"" Ryan Korner, acting special agent in charge with the IRS' Criminal Investigation division, told reporters.
Prosecutors also accuse Avenatti of filing fraudulent applications to a bank in Mississippi to obtain $4.1 million in loans and making false statements when his firm was facing bankruptcy proceedings.
The alleged crimes ""are all linked to one another because money generated from one set of crimes appears in the other sets — typically in the form of payments to lull victims and to prevent Mr. Avenatti's financial house of cards from collapsing,"" said Hanna.
Avenatti is scheduled to be arraigned on April 29 in federal court in Orange County, Calif., the prosecutor's office said.
In March, Avenatti was arrested in New York on separate federal charges and then freed on $300,000 bond.
As NPR's Carrie Johnson reported , authorities ""say he tried to extract more than $20 million from shoe giant Nike by threatening to use his ability to attract public attention if the company failed to meet his financial demands.""
After the charges were announced last month, Daniels, whose given name is Stephanie Clifford, said in a statement that she was ""saddened but not shocked.""
""I made the decision more than a month ago to terminate Michael's services after discovering that he had dealt with me extremely dishonestly and there will be more announcements to come,"" she said."

Mark Wilson/Getty Images Congressional Democrats are embroiled in the fight to try to compel the release of President Trump's tax returns , which he continues to decline to do. But with the deadline to file taxes coming Monday, it's Democratic candidates who are in the spotlight.
As Democrats try to grab the higher ground on transparency with regard to their personal finances, so far only three of the almost 20 Democratic candidates have released their 2018 returns as of Thursday night.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York have released them. Gillibrand was the first to do so. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has also released 12 years of taxes through 2017 so far. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is pledging to release his by Monday. Kamala Harris, Beto O'Rourke, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker and others have indicated they will release them but haven't been specific about when.
Politics 3 Reasons We Care About Politicians' Taxes ""I've put out 11 years of my tax returns, because no one should ever have to guess who their elected officials are working for,"" Warren said Wednesday . ""Doing this should be law.""
But it's not law. It's merely been a 40-year custom, and another precedent that Trump broke as a candidate and as president. To some, it may seem nosy and superficial to want to see every cent someone running for office has made, but to many others, there are good reasons to care. Here are three things that voters often look for, as your author wrote about in 2016 :
1. Conflicts of interest: Where does their money come from, and could that influence the kind of policy they try to implement as president for the rest of us?
2. How charitable are they? Most of these candidates are far wealthier than the average American. The median U.S. household income as of 2017 was just shy of $58,000 a year . Expect everyone running to make more than that, so how much do they give to charity, and what does it say about their priorities depending on who they give to?
3. Are they like us — or do they bend the rules? There are lots of candidates over the years who have been creative about how to reduce their tax rates, using various tax deductions and loopholes. Do they pay a rate that is commensurate with most Americans? President Trump said during a 2016 presidential debate that if it's true he hasn't paid federal income taxes in some years, "" that makes me smart .""
The history
Candidates have released tax returns for all those years prior as a way of being transparent. Rumors had circulated for years about Richard Nixon's campaign expenses, wealthy backers and an effort to game the tax system in the 1950s and then again in the 1970s. (This was separate from the Watergate investigation.)
Trying to tamp down the criticism, he released four years of tax returns in 1973, and he had a congressional committee review them. That committee found he owed almost $500,000 in back taxes and interest (more than $2 million in today's terms).
Since then, it has become routine for presidential candidates to release their taxes. Candidates do so to try to reassure the public that there is nothing untoward hidden away and to be on the level about any potential conflicts.
They are, after all, seeking to hold power in arguably the most public and influential office with the loudest microphone in the world. At any time, a president can command an audience on any subject he or she wishes.
Trump's taxes
Despite pressure to release his, Trump has declined to, first as a candidate and now as president. He's the first president since Nixon not to release them. Trump has said that he continues to be under audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason for not releasing his taxes — despite there being no prohibition from releasing them even if under audit.
Politics How Donald Trump Lost $916 Million Leaked tax documents during the 2016 campaign showed Trump incurred almost $1 billion in losses that might have allowed him to not pay taxes for almost two decades.
Democratic House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal of Massachusetts formally requested six years of Trump's tax returns. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin missed a deadline Neal set. Mnuchin cited the need for more time to consult with the Justice Department.
Mnuchin also questioned the ""constitutional scope of congressional investigative authority"" and ""purpose"" versus the ""constitutional rights of American citizens.""
Politics Key House Democrat Formally Asks For Trump's Tax Returns The Democratic field
Sanders, an independent from Vermont running as a Democrat for president, has landed in the spotlight about his not-yet-released tax returns, partially because of the irony that the candidate who has routinely lambasted the millionaires and billionaires is now, himself, a millionaire.
Sanders has routinely been ranked as one of the less-wealthy members of Congress — that is until he caught fire in his 2016 campaign. His 2017 Senate financial disclosure shows he was able to cash in on that bid. His book, Where We Go From Here , helped him make slightly more than $1 million overall for the year. That income included more than $880,000 from book royalties .
The self-avowed democratic socialist's reaction to his newfound wealth was rather ... capitalistic.
""I wrote a bestselling book,"" he told The New York Times . ""If you write a bestselling book, you can be a millionaire, too.""
Sanders' earnings were a nearly fivefold increase from 2014, when he and his wife, Jane, made just under $206,000 combined, according to tax returns Sanders released during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Netflix Who would want to date someone named ""Brooks Rattigan""?
It sounds like a jerk who makes furniture. It sounds like a corrupt law firm. It sounds like a preppy mobster. It sounds like an announcement of the two competitors who will face off in the final match of a wrestling tournament in a town whose population was built only by reproduction between and among people who rowed crew in college.
And yet this is the name of the hero of the new perfectly OK Netflix teenage romcom, The Perfect Date . Based on the book The Stand-In by Steve Bloom, it's written by Bloom and Randall Green. (A trivia note: way back in 1985, Bloom wrote the screenplay of The Sure Thing , one of the best young-person romantic comedies ever.) And the star, announced in March of 2018 months before he was an OH MY GOD level streaming romcom idol, is To All The Boys I've Loved Before 's Noah Centineo, now Hashtag-Peter-Kavinsky to many of the tweens who follow you on Instagram. (And some of the people who are older than that.)
Centineo plays ... Brooks Rattigan (yikes), a high school senior who desperately wants to get into the Ivy League. He looks up to Michael Jordan, Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, so when he thinks about his bright future, he's thinking mogul thoughts. While working at the sub shop with his romcom-required Gay Best Friend (boys have them now, too!), Brooks learns that ... the cousin of a guy he doesn't like needs an escort to a dance? And the guy is being paid to take his cousin to a dance? I'm sorry, those should be periods. And yet they remain question marks.

toggle caption Netflix Laura Marano plays Celia, the girl who might make a decent human out of Brooks (Noah Centineo).
Netflix Of course, in need of money, a cool car, and extracurriculars (wait, wait, is this going to be an extra — OK, never mind, gotta get past the plot, I hear you), Brooks decides to jump in and take over the job. He'll get paid to take the girl out, he'll be a perfect date, and he'll get to drive the guy's car. Hold on to your military boots, because it turns out the girl he's taking out is Celia Lieberman, who is not the boring zero he's kind of expecting! She is a sort of punky, rebellious misfit who won't wear heels to a dance! Played by Laura Marano, for years one of the leads of Disney's Austin & Ally , Celia is unimpressed by Brooks, and they clash right away. WHAT WILL HAPPEN?
I say all this with love, of course, because this is standard romantic comedy stuff, especially in films made to be devoured by teenagers — and good for them. The '80s and '90s had plenty of properties with similarly classic elements: Clueless, 10 Things I Hate About You , Some Kind Of Wonderful ... nothing wrong with that. And when they're good — as was the case with To All The Boys I've Loved Before last year — they're just an utter delight.
This one is not as good as that, I'm afraid. It spends a little too much time with a very unpleasant version of Brooks, bound to become a better person but not there yet. After he has success taking out Celia, he develops an app (...sure) to offer himself as a fake date. You can pay him to take you to a dance or an event, or you can book him for dating practice (the one girl who needs this is the one fat girl, SIGH COME ON PEOPLE), or you can hire him to be a fake terrible date so that your parents will be more receptive to the much nicer guy you actually like. Whether a high-school student could really get this many girls to pay him, openly, for his company seems questionable, but it allows him to slip in and out of many personas, none of which are genuine. You know, like a guy who's kind of a jerk would do.
There is then a convoluted situation that continues to bring him back to Celia even as he circles his dream girl (Camila Mendes). Celia eventually grows tired of his particular hustle (as you will be by that time), and they have tension, and they have to find a way to get back together.
Pop Culture Happy Hour Here's To The Romantic Comedy Pleasures Of 'To All The Boys I've Loved Before' It's very fortunate that Centineo and Marano do have nice chemistry — which struggles in the early scenes to emerge around the weird writing in which they both seem like unpleasant people who are hard to root for. In the second half, the movie becomes pretty likable, as it gets easier to see that Brooks is approaching his Grip-Getting Moment, in which he will be Getting a Grip, even if involuntarily. There's a kind of genial grooviness to Centineo, even when he's aggravating (no non-aggravating person has ever been this preoccupied by his feelings about Elon Musk), and once Celia is allowed to drift over from ""fighting with him pointlessly because she's someone's version of a punk girl"" to ""likes him but genuinely has his number,"" Marano is solid as well.
This isn't quite going to scratch your romcom itch in a satisfying way. The first act is strangely paced and often rather baffling even grading on a romcom curve (""Why would this person do that, as opposed to doing a very different thing that would seem like a much more likely and much less stupid thing to do?""). Brooks is more annoying in the script than he should ideally be for longer than he should ideally be, with fewer moments in which any warmth really comes through (even though Centineo has it to give in his performance). But by the end, I was essentially on board, and if you're thinking about getting some couch time in this weekend and you're hoping it will be good company for you, it probably will.
(One last one: ""Disgraced financier Brooks Rattigan has been sentenced to 34 years in a minimum-security prison."")"

Christine T. Nguyen /MPR News There may be few occupations considered more romantic than being a lighthouse keeper. Lee Radzak, who will retire Friday after 36 years at the iconic Split Rock Lighthouse on Lake Superior's North Shore, might argue there are few jobs that people misconceive more.
Split Rock has been drawing visitors since the 1920s, when Highway 61 opened. People marvel at the lighthouse standing sentinel on the 160-foot cliff looking out across the breathtaking expanse of Lake Superior.
Lee Radzak moved here in 1983.
""This was a perfect place,"" he said. ""My wife and I just got married a couple of months earlier and we were ripe for a change so it worked out great.""
For lighthouse lovers — and apparently there are a lot — Split Rock seems to evoke solitude, at least based on the questions Radzak has fielded again and again.
""If my wife and I are sitting on the front porch they say, 'Do you live here?' Yes. 'Do you live here year-round?' Yes. 'Oh, it must be lonely!' "" he said. ""And then you want to say, 'Look behind you. There's 50 people standing there listening to you talk, or climbing the steps to the lighthouse.' ""
Split Rock attracts 160,000 visitors every year, about 2,500 a day during the summer. There are far fewer in winter, but they still come, even when the temperature is below zero and the storms blow so hard the spray coats the buildings with ice.
While people often describe him as the lightkeeper, his formal title is historic site manager. Radzak trained as an archaeologist. Split Rock attracted him as an opportunity to focus on one historic site and develop it. There was a lot to learn, starting with the history.
[Lighthouses] represent man's humanity to man and ... that still resonates to people.
Lee Radzak, retiring lighthouse keeper
""As a lighthouse goes, it was kind of a Johnny Come Lately,"" he said. ""It wasn't built until 1909.""
""I was fortunate enough that, back in the 1980s and '90s, that the sons and daughters of the original lighthouse keepers that served in the 1910s and '20s were then in their 80s and 90s, and I had a chance to meet and talk with a lot of those folks, the kids that grew up here back in the early days,"" he said.
In those pre-Highway 61 days there was more solitude.
""There were three families that lived here pretty much on their own, other than some boat traffic going up and down the shore,"" he said. ""And 5 miles to the closest town for their mail.""

Christine T. Nguyen /MPR News They lived in the three houses next to the lighthouse. A boat dropped them off in the spring and picked them up in the fall.
""Some of them had really good photographs,"" he said. ""We got the keepers' logs of what the keepers did every day during their time here. So it's a very well-documented site.""
The Minnesota Historical Society took over the lighthouse after the Coast Guard decommissioned it in 1969.
A 7-foot beam visible for 22 miles
At the top of the lighthouse is what Radzak calls Split Rock's crown jewel — a huge Fresnel lens made by French glassworkers.
""Usually the Coast Guard pulls all the working apparatus out of a lighthouse when it is retired,"" he said. ""But we were fortunate that they knew it would be protected by the state of Minnesota so they left it in place and we still have it here now.""
The keepers lit the lens with a kerosene lamp to warn ships away from the rocky shore. The 252 cut-glass prisms in the lens focused the light into a 7-foot beam visible for 22 miles. On days when they couldn't see, they sounded the foghorns. Using a gas-powered air compressor the horns could be heard 5 miles away.
Reportedly they were so loud up close that they would knock people to their knees if they were foolish enough to walk in front of them.
Commemorating the SS Edmund Fitzgerald
It was Radzak who, in 1985, began the annual tradition of lighting the lantern on Nov. 10, the anniversary of the sinking of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald, a freighter that sank in Lake Superior in 1975 with the loss of its 29 crew members. It is the one time visitors can enter the lamp room while the light is lit. The staff holds a ceremony called the ""Muster of the Last Watch"" where they ring a ship's bell for every member of the crew lost on the Fitzgerald. There can be huge crowds; Radzak says people come from as far away as the East Coast and Texas.
He thinks lighthouses are popular because they exist on the edge — the edge of land and of water. ""And they represent man's humanity to man and trying to protect the people out on the water, and that still resonates to people,"" he said.
""It's huge shoes to fill for sure, for everybody,"" says Karly Fransen, who will fill in as interim manager for the summer season.
Fransen and her family will live in the lighthouse keeper's house. Fransen says she's excited about the summer, but she's not sure if she'll apply for the full position.
""I'm not assuming that I would even be the one that they would choose,"" she said, ""but I'm the only one that gets to have a trial.""
Book News & Features 'Merci Suárez' Wins Newbery Medal, And 'Hello Lighthouse' Draws Caldecott The job will be posted in mid-August. Minnesota Historical Society manager Ben Leonard will lead the search for a replacement.
""Yeah, I think that this job will be probably the hardest job to fill in the historical society,"" he said. ""Because people think about the view, they don't think about the email or the reports or the HR issues, because they aren't romantic.""
Leonard says he's looking for a historian with the patience and skills to manage crowds and to deal with harsh weather — and the occasional bear. But even without a formal posting, the Historical Society is already getting inquiries about the job."

From
As the mayor of South Bend, Ind., Pete Buttigieg says he can bridge the divide between progressives and ""red state"" voters. He is expected to announce he's running for president this weekend.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Pete Buttigieg is expected to officially announce that he is running for president on Sunday. On the campaign trail, Mayor Pete often makes the case that his time as mayor of South Bend, Ind., has prepared him to be president. He said so on this program back in January.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
PETE BUTTIGIEG: We transformed the trajectory of our city. This is a community that was written off as dying at the beginning of this decade. Now it's growing again.
GREENE: Jennifer Weingart from member station WVPE takes a look at just how true that is.
JENNIFER WEINGART, BYLINE: The reality of Pete Buttigieg's South Bend depends on who you are.
JAKE MITCHELL: There is a definite difference in how it used to be versus how it is now.
WEINGART: That's Buttigieg's high school classmate Jake Mitchell.
MITCHELL: It's kind of an intangible feeling. You know, everything seems nicer, cleaner.
WEINGART: Buttigieg was 29 when he was first elected mayor. He was easily re-elected in 2015, but his policies have made some in this once-industrial city feel left out. Lisa DeBerry is a community activist.
LISA DEBERRY: So you've done a lot for downtown, and you're building hotels and apartments that people who are native to this town can't even afford, even the people with college degrees. So it's like, who are you developing that for?
WEINGART: Early in his first term, Buttigieg set a goal to knock down a thousand blighted houses in a thousand days, which the city met. Jack Colwell is a longtime columnist for the South Bend Tribune.
JACK COLWELL: And that certainly helped neighborhoods where there had been these vacant houses. They were drug houses, and gangs use them. There were eyesores.
WEINGART: Most of those neighborhoods are historically minority and lower income. And when the houses started coming down, people like Regina Williams-Preston became politically engaged.
REGINA WILLIAMS-PRESTON: Well, the people rose up and said, hey, we need help out here. Don't knock down our communities. Give us assistance. Give us help. It's our tax dollars. Invest in us.
WEINGART: She's a teacher and a city council member who's running to replace Buttigieg as the mayor of South Bend. She says Buttigieg listened.
WILLIAMS-PRESTON: And that's when we got $2 million worth of investment in home repair and 2 million more dollars invested in new construction for affordable homes.
WEINGART: Another candidate for mayor is Jason Critchlow. He used to be the county Democratic Party chair. He says Buttigieg deserves some credit for turning the city around, but...
JASON CRITCHLOW: I think there is a feeling here that it's disingenuous to pretend that one person had solely to do with any of the progress made here in South Bend. I think there's been literally decades of public servants that have gotten us to where we are today.
WEINGART: Many locals here have always had a sense that South Bend was going to be a stepping stone for Buttigieg's career. But not everyone in South Bend supports his presidential ambitions, says Lisa DeBerry, especially those who were left behind by the city's growth.
DEBERRY: That's like a mother having her own children and not taking care of - and then wants foster children. It's like, no, we're not going to give you more.
WEINGART: Regina Williams-Preston hopes that if he becomes president, Buttigieg would take the lessons he learned in South Bend forward.
WILLIAMS-PRESTON: You could really be, like, the president of the United States one day. And it's up to us - like, the people of South Bend - to make sure you're ready for that task.
WEINGART: Buttigieg was an improbable mayor, and he's hoping that experience will land him in another improbable place - the White House. For NPR News, I'm Jennifer Weingart in South Bend.

Sudan's Military To Oversee 2-Year Transition After President's Ouster,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712607022/sudans-military-to-oversee-2-year-transition-after-presidents-ouster,"After nearly 30 years in power, Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir has been ousted and arrested. Rachel Martin talks to Sudanese activist Dalia El Roubi about this moment in the history of her country.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Sudan's dictator has been forcibly removed by his own military. It happened yesterday morning. Sudan's defense minister appeared on state TV in uniform and announced the news.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
AHMED AWAD IBN AUF: (Foreign language spoken).
MARTIN: He said President Omar al-Bashir was under arrest and that the Sudanese military would oversee a two-year transition period before holding elections. It's the end of an almost 30-year reign for al-Bashir. Dalia el Roubi is with us now from Sudan's capital, Khartoum. She is a member of one of Sudan's opposition parties and has been jailed for her activism against al-Bashir's government. being with us.
DALIA EL ROUBI: Yes. Thank you for having me.
MARTIN: What is the mood in the capital city in particular? Are people clearly tempering their optimism?
EL ROUBI: I think the build-up yesterday to the announcement was filled with so much hope and commitment. And the streets were filled, waiting for the announcement of the defense minister. We were extremely disappointed to hear the announcement because it was, first of all, exemplary of how the regime has no respect for the values of our opinions and our rights, even with the change of Omar al-Bashir because, actually, in essence, we didn't just ask for him to go. We're asking for a whole system to go, and that change has to happen.
For us to be told, after all this time of protest and the best that have occurred - not just in the protest, but in the past 30 years by this regime - and to be told by someone who is actually blacklisted in the U.S. sanctions since 2007 because he was participating in the Darfur war - to be told by this very man that he is here to provide a transitional system or transitional government for the next two years - it's nothing close to what we are demanding.
MARTIN: So al-Bashir is gone, but now the military has stepped in. You say they're just an extension of him. So today, on this day of prayer, on this day of reflection, what is your hope? What happens now?
EL ROUBI: We keep standing, peacefully resisting. We have taken a huge step by getting rid of the head of the regime, but what we are dealing with is an Islamist movement. We have to understand that, as Muslims ourselves, we are fighting against an extreme form of the dictator that claims to be Muslim, and they are not.
We are coming back after 30 years, and the past six days has been a symbol of that. So on - upon reflection, the way forward is that we will continue in the sit-ins until the whole system is gone, the Islamic regime of the government is gone from all of it 'cause these people are a symbol of the brutality which we are against.
MARTIN: A particular woman got a lot of attention and headlines in recent days - became a symbol of the protesters - a young Sudanese woman who was wearing white, standing on a car in front of masses of protesters, reciting poetry. Can you tell us about her and why she became the symbol of the resistance?
EL ROUBI: I think that for us, Alaa Salah was a symbol of, two-thirds of the people in the protests are women. And you can see it. Anyone who's in the sit-ins or sees images - you know, you can see the presence of women of all ages and all backgrounds. What that image did was it kind of summed it up, you know? It was just the right image with the combination of even the woman looking at her and listening to her. The poetry that she has is quoted from a poem by an activist female.
So there was a lot of solidarity in that image. She really was an opportunity for us to really come together and realize that this is a symbol of something that represents all of these memories - you know? - and the symbolism around it.
MARTIN: Dalia El Roubi, a Sudanese opposition activist. She joined us on the line from Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. Dalia, thank you so much for your time.
EL ROUBI: Thank you.

Americans Are Divided Over Whether Transgender People Should Be In The Military,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712607012/americans-are-divided-over-whether-transgender-people-should-be-in-the-military,"Americans Are Divided Over Whether Transgender People Should Be In The Military Americans Are Divided Over Whether Transgender People Should Be In The Military Embed Embed Heard on Morning Edition
The Pentagon is set to enforce a policy Friday banning transgender people from serving in the military. David Greene talks to Delton Daigle of the Schar School of Policy and Government about his poll.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The Pentagon, today, will begin enforcing a new policy that effectively bans transgender people from joining the military. Transgender people already serving will not be affected, like Army Captain Alivia Stehlik. She told us the new restrictions don't reflect what's happening on the ground.
ALIVIA STEHLIK: You know, I just got back from Afghanistan. There is already no question about whether we can serve with distinction in all areas of the world, in all austere environments. But in the meantime, it's going to be a struggle for us to continue. We're going to continue to fight this fight to allow everyone to be able to serve openly.
GREENE: Now, polls show Americans are divided on this issue. A Reuters/Ipsos poll in February shows nearly 60 percent of Americans support transgender people serving. Another poll of current and former military members shows more than 60 percent are opposed. Political scientist Delton Daigle of George Mason University took that survey, along with Smithsonian Magazine and the military newspaper Stars and Stripes.
DELTON DAIGLE: The one that we took, you know, clearly was very focused on the military community. And even while we have a number of civilians - that might be contractors or family members of service members - generally, we would still find them less supportive than as was found in the Ipsos poll.
However, there are differences even within our own poll if we just separate it into those who had served in the military and those who had not. About 53 percent of our non-military respondents were supportive of transgender in the military, compared to about 39 percent of those who had or are currently serving in the military.
GREENE: What was the average age of your polling? I mean, are we talking about a lot of veterans or are there a lot of younger people who might be in the military now?
DAIGLE: The average age in our survey was 62 years old.
GREENE: Oh, I see. So it's an older group.
DAIGLE: It is absolutely an older group.
GREENE: The White House cites concerns, saying that allowing more transgender people in the military would negatively affect unit cohesion. I just wonder, you know, given some of the facts you're telling me about your polling sample - I mean, that there are a lot of older people, a lot of veterans. I mean, can we draw any conclusions about something like that from your data?
DAIGLE: So when you look at the data and you look at support for transgender in the military, it increases the younger people get. In fact, for every 10 years younger, you could think of support increasing by about 3 percent. So the difference between a 70-year-old and a 20-year-old within our sample is about a 15-point difference in their support for transgender in the military.
So the perception of cohesion - or the perception of the risk to cohesion decreases with younger people. So people who are actively serving in the military today, I would infer, you know, are less likely to see it as a problem.
GREENE: And your poll actually asked respondents to write some explanations for their answers. What kinds of things did they write down?
DAIGLE: There are a number of responses that kind of pick up on the buzzwords that the media are using, particularly, you know, the right-wing media, who've been using words like social experiment or social engineering. But there are a number of tangential ones that also kind of might not directly refer to LGBTQ communities or, you know, this particular issue. But you could probably infer that they might be kind of getting at that.
For example, a retired military member said standards drop in order to ensure political correctness, you know, or becoming too soft and overly concerned about hurt feelings and political correctness. So there are a number of responses where you can kind of guess that, you know, today's military and its shifting culture might be having an impact. And, you know, this is probably captured within this broader shift in culture.
GREENE: Delton Daigle is a political scientist at George Mason University Schar School of Public Policy and Government. Thanks so much for joining us.

During astronaut Scott Kelly's nearly year-long space flight on the International Space Station, NASA scientists measured physiological changes in him and his earthbound twin, Mark Kelly.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
OK. Have you ever wondered what happens physically to people when they're in outer space? Like, what actually happens to their bodies? Scientists have shared results from NASA's twin study.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Yeah, for nearly a year, Scott Kelly lived at the International Space Station. Scientists compared samples from him and his earthbound twin brother, Mark.
MARTIN: I talked with Scott Kelly back in 2017, and I asked him about his health.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)
SCOTT KELLY: You know, the symptomatic stuff is fine. I don't have any long-term negative feelings, physically, from being in space. Now, there's the things you can't feel. And hopefully, I will never learn that those are a problem.
GREENE: Those things you can't feel - well, it turns out they are as small as the protective structures at the ends of his chromosomes.
MARTIN: Yeah. These are called telomeres, and normally, they get shorter with age. But what about in space?
SUSAN BAILEY: What we wanted to do was evaluate telomere length in both of the twins before and after so that we could see, you know, where they started and then where they ended.
MARTIN: Susan Bailey was one of the scientists who answered this question. She expected the stresses of space to shorten telomeres quicker.
BAILEY: And, in fact, we saw exactly the opposite thing - that during spaceflight, he had many more long telomeres than he did before he went up. So that really couldn't have been more of a surprise to us.
GREENE: All right. Some other findings - Scott Kelly's gene expression changed, and his immune system went into high alert. His flu shot worked despite all the stress of space. Back on Earth, his body returned to normal within months.
MARTIN: Andrew Feinberg, another scientist who led part of this study, said this is a new chapter in tracking the effects of spaceflight.
ANDREW FEINBERG: I think that this study represents the dawn of the era of human genomics in space.
MARTIN: And the human body, or at least Scott Kelly's, seems pretty resilient. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved.

Sanders' Presidential Campaign To Visit States That Helped Trump In 2016,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606998/sanders-presidential-campaign-to-visit-states-that-helped-trump-in-2016,"Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders kicks off a tour of key states that helped send Trump to the White House. Sanders is trying to convince Democratic voters that he's the best candidate to defeat Trump.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
All right. Today, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is beginning a four-day tour of the key states that helped put President Trump in the White House in 2016. Sanders is campaigning in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, among other states. As NPR's Scott Detrow reports, this is the latest step Sanders is taking to try and convince Democratic voters that he is the candidate best positioned to beat Trump in 2020.
SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Bernie Sanders' campaign manager thinks the increasingly crowded Democratic presidential primary will revolve around two key questions. The first, says Faiz Shakir, is which candidate can best deliver all the changes Democratic voters want? He thinks Sanders is in good shape on that front.
FAIZ SHAKIR: However, I think we have some convincing to do about the case that we are the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump as well.
DETROW: That's despite the fact that Sanders is near the top of the 18-candidate pack when it comes to both fundraising and early poll numbers. A big reason why Shakir thinks Sanders needs to make his case on electability - the perception that Sanders may just be too liberal, too extreme for many voters. That's especially true going into an election where Trump and Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will paint Democrats as socialists.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MITCH MCCONNELL: I never thought in my lifetime we'd have a serious debate about the virtues of capitalism, and we're having that in this country right now. You add up things like - packing the Supreme Court, getting rid of the Electoral College, the Green New Deal and Medicare for none, and you have a prescription for turning America into something it never has been and never should be.
DETROW: Shakir says, as an actual democratic socialist, Sanders would be happy to have that debate. In fact, Shakir says a big focus of these Midwestern stops will be arguing that Sanders' platform could appeal to the voters in the three states that put Trump in the White House.
SHAKIR: He offered a bunch of rhetoric that I think was stolen right out of Bernie Sanders' language. He talked about draining the swamp, about saving Medicare and Social Security, about cutting fair-trade deals.
DETROW: It's not just Sanders who's focused on electability. A lot more than in past years, Democratic voters are saying that simply winning is more important than any single policy. Electability, of course, is a subjective thing, but the ability to win back Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin would probably fit into most Democrats' definition of it. Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke campaigned at Penn State University in the first week of his candidacy.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BETO O'ROURKE: We need to first show up with the humility of acknowledging that I don't know what's important to the Happy Valley - to the students at Penn State until I show up and listen to them.
DETROW: Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar made Wisconsin one of her first campaign stops. Democrats in those three states are welcoming the attention.
GWEN MOORE: I think lesson learned - that you really can't take Wisconsin for granted.
DETROW: That's Wisconsin Congresswoman Gwen Moore. But Moore makes the point that winning back Wisconsin and the rest of the crumbled blue wall goes far beyond the rural white voters that often get the most attention.
MOORE: You can't put all your money into trying to make sure that rural folks get your vote. African-Americans are just like any other voters, they need to be dealt into the game. They need to feel like there is something that they can gain from it as well.
DETROW: Courting black voters is something that Sanders struggled with in 2016, according to many primary exit polls. This time, he's making a point of focusing on racial disparities, like he did last week addressing Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BERNIE SANDERS: So when we talk about disparity, we are talking about the need for more black doctors, more black dentists, more black nurses, more black psychologists.
DETROW: In the year since the tense, bitter 2016 primary, Sanders' platform has been embraced by the mainstream of the Democratic Party. The question for many Democratic voters is whether it can be embraced by the middle of the country too. Scott Detrow, NPR News, Washington.

Assange Faces U.S. Extradition After Years Holed Up In Ecuador's Embassy,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606991/assange-faces-u-s-extradition-after-years-holed-up-in-ecuadors-embassy,"Rachel Martin talks to ex-prosecutor Renato Mariotti about the U.S. charging WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange with conspiring to commit computer intrusion. An extradition hearing is set for May 2.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Today, for the first time in almost seven years, Julian Assange did not wake up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. The co-founder of WikiLeaks is in police custody. A British judge has found him guilty of breaching the terms of his 2012 bail agreement.
Looming even larger, though, an extradition request by the United States, which wants Assange on one charge of conspiracy. So will Julian Assange ever sit in an American courtroom? We're joined now by former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti to work through that question. Renato, thanks for being back on the show.
RENATO MARIOTTI: Thank you.
MARTIN: Let's start with the charge. This is one count of conspiracy connected to the documents that former army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning leaked back in 2010, correct?
MARIOTTI: That's right.
MARTIN: And this is not a charge that he actually helped Chelsea Manning derive this information, it's that there was an attempt to do so. What sentence does that charge carry, that he attempted to help her break into sensitive government databases?
MARIOTTI: So the maximum statutory penalty is five years in prison. But ordinarily, ordinarily, I would expect that he would receive a sentence much below that. The X-factor here is that a judge has the obligation to consider all of the history and characteristics of Mr. Assange, as well as his other conduct. And the reality is, of course, that there are a lot of other reasons why Mr. Assange might receive a larger sentence and that could actually be up to the five years in prison.
MARTIN: What are the other reasons?
MARIOTTI: Well, for example, you know, the judge could consider harm that was caused by Mr. Assange is distribution of classified material. He might consider, or she might consider, the, you know, harm that was caused to the 2016 election.
So, you know, it's possible, for example, that, you know, prosecutors could present a wide variety of information about Mr. Assange that they would only have to prove by a preponderance of the evidence - in other words, by 51 percent - that would potentially sway a judge to increase the sentence but would not, itself, be the offense itself.
MARTIN: Which is interesting because this charge of conspiracy, it does not have anything to do with the WikiLeaks' dump of documents that had a negative effect on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. But you're saying it could affect a sentencing?
MARIOTTI: In fact, the judge would have to consider everything that he or she knew about Mr. Assange. And I'm sure the government would bring all of that to his or her attention.
MARTIN: First Amendment activists have been concerned that the United States might charge Assange with espionage because of the damage that was done by the release of those documents on national security grounds back in 2010. What does it tell you that that did not happen, that the charge was not espionage?
MARIOTTI: It tells me that the United States government was sensitive to that issue, either because they wanted to avoid a court challenge in the United States, or because they were concerned about the precedent that would set, or because the UK would not extradite purely for an offence of that type.
MARTIN: President Trump has had mixed messages about WikiLeaks, I think we can say. This is what the president said yesterday in the Oval Office when he was asked about the arrest of Julian Assange.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I know nothing about WikiLeaks, it's not my thing. And I know there is something having to do with Julian Assange. I've been seeing what's happened with Assange. And that will be a determination, I would imagine, mostly by the attorney general, who's doing an excellent job.
MARTIN: So saying he doesn't know anything about WikiLeaks. But during the 2016 presidential campaign, he heaped a whole lot of praise on the group.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
TRUMP: WikiLeaks, I love WikiLeaks. This WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable, it tells you the inner heart, you got to read it. It's been amazing what's coming out on WikiLeaks.
MARTIN: So the president, there, referring to what we were talking about - all those emails that were leaked from the DNC and John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. So I guess the question to you, Renato, is, legally speaking, how much could an Assange trial here in the U.S. reveal in the larger context of the Mueller investigation?
MARIOTTI: Yeah. I think that there's certainly the possibility that a Assange trial - particularly if the government added more charges - could reveal a lot of detail about Assange's activities. It's also possible that a sentencing of Mr. Assange will reveal a lot. Because, as I mentioned earlier, the government would have, in fact, an obligation - not just the right but an obligation - to inform the court of what they knew about Mr. Assange's activities.
So I think that there's definitely a prospect that all of us are going to learn a lot more about Julian Assange in the years to come, unless Mr. Assange cooperates with the government.
MARTIN: Do you think his extradition to the U.S. is inevitable?
MARIOTTI: I think it would be. It's very hard for me to imagine him not being extradited at this time.
MARTIN: Renato Mariotti is a former federal prosecutor and he joined us on Skype. Renato, thanks so much.
MARIOTTI: Thank you.

Should We Have Empathy For Those We Hate?,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606984/should-we-have-empathy-for-those-we-hate,"The latest episode of NPR's Podcast Invisibilia examines the history of empathy in American culture. In this era of political polarization, empathy has fallen out of fashion.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Empathy can seem like just what's needed in an age of deep polarization, right? But psychologists and neurologists are discovering that empathy can actually have a really dark side.
Here's Invisibilia co-host Hanna Rosin.
HANNA ROSIN, BYLINE: In 1977, a young psychology graduate student named Mark Davis was hunting around for a dissertation topic when he landed on a decent idea. At the time, people were very interested in the concept of empathy, but no one knew precisely how to define it yet.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: So Mark wrote up a list of statements to try and parse out its different dimensions. For example, question number two - read by my colleague from Hidden Brain, Parth Shah.
PARTH SHAH, BYLINE: I often have tender, concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me.
ROSIN: Empathic concern - feeling compassion for people in need. And another question...
SHAH: Before criticizing someone, I try to imagine how I would feel if I were in their place.
ROSIN: That measures perspective taking - imagining the world from someone else's point of view. A list of 28 questions - agree or disagree. And the list was a huge success - used thousands of times by researchers who were tracking the empathy levels of America's youth.
SHAH: I sometimes find it difficult to see things from the other guy's point of view. I sometimes don't feel very sorry for other people when they're having problems. I believe there are two sides to every question, and I try to look at them both. If I'm sure I'm right about something, I don't waste time listening to other people's arguments.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: Is this Sara?
SARA KONRATH: Mmm hmm.
ROSIN: Sara Konrath, a professor Indiana.
KONRATH: I study empathy and altruism.
ROSIN: In 2010, Sara had this idea that she would track down as many studies as she could find that used Mark's list and see if she could find any patterns.
KONRATH: But when I saw the picture - to just see this line declining over time, it was surprising.
ROSIN: A straight slide downwards, starting around 2000, in perspective taking and empathic concern.
KONRATH: We found a 40 percent decline in empathy.
ROSIN: 40 percent.
KONRATH: Yep.
ROSIN: Isn't that a lot?
KONRATH: It feels like a lot.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: What happened to empathy? - because in the '70s, when Mark made that list and when I was growing up, being empathic was something you 100 percent aspired to.
FRITZ BREITHAUPT: Absolutely. That's exactly how I grew up.
ROSIN: This is Fritz Breithaupt, a professor Indiana who wrote a book on empathy. After World War II, social scientists and psychologists started to push this concept of empathy into the culture. The idea was we were either headed for World War III or we were going to have to learn to see the world through each other's eyes.
BREITHAUPT: And that was always the idea - that had the Germans had had more empathy in the 1930s, Hitler would not have happened. The genocide would not have happened. Empathy was kind of seen as the hope against all of these kind of things.
ROSIN: In my elementary school in the '70s, we wrote letters to pretend Russian pen pals in order to teach us to open our hearts to our enemies. Empathy was also big with civil rights activists. The idea was that people with power and privilege were supposed to inhabit the realities of people without power, not from the safe noblesse, oblige distance of pity but from the inside.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: So when did you notice a skepticism about empathy start to creep in?
BREITHAUPT: What I noticed was, indeed - it happened in classrooms. It was students.
ROSIN: Over a decade ago, students just stopped buying the automatic logic of empathy. Like, why should they put themselves in the shoes of someone who was not them, much less someone they thought was harmful?
BREITHAUPT: The good purpose it serves is to empower people who feel victimized by certain other people to say, OK. It's important for me to step up against that - against abuse, about discrimination, about injustice. So...
ROSIN: So it's to refuse to have your strength sapped, essentially.
BREITHAUPT: Yes, exactly, by those other people.
ROSIN: The new rule for empathy is reserve it, not for your, quote, unquote, ""enemies"" but for the people you believe are hurt or you have decided need it the most - for your own team...
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
ROSIN: ...Which is a problem because here's the dirty secret about empathy. Lately, psychologists and neurologists have started to look at how empathy actually works in our brains. And one thing they found, says Fritz...
BREITHAUPT: One of the strongest triggers for human empathy is absolving some kind of conflict between two other parties.
ROSIN: The Super Bowl, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Kavanaugh hearings.
BREITHAUPT: But once they take the side, they're drawn into that perspective. And that leads to strong - very strong empathy and to strong polarization, where, suddenly, you only see this one side and not the other side any longer.
ROSIN: Researchers who study empathy have noticed that it's actually really hard to empathize with people who are different than you are. But set up a conflict, and people get into automatic empathy overdrive with their own team. This is a kind of dynamic that Fritz says might even be motivating terrorists.
BREITHAUPT: Some terrorists - it's not an complete absence of empathy that draws them in. But rather, it's an excess of empathy. They feel the pity. They feel the suffering of their people.
ROSIN: This is why Fritz called his new book ""The Dark Sides Of Empathy"" because there's a point at which empathy starts to look more like tribalism - a way to keep reinforcing your own point of view and blocking out any others. In my generation, we thought of empathy as the big, warm sun, lighting the path to peace for us all. Now it operates like a torch. You shine it on your friends and use it to burn your enemies.
What's the endgame of excluding some people from the possibility of empathy?
BREITHAUPT: Basically, you give up on civil society at that point. You give up on democracy because if you feed into this division more and you let it happen, it will become so strong that it becomes dangerous.
ROSIN: So why aren't you one of these people who say, I'm against empathy? Say the concept is so tainted - like, we've learned so much about it and how it works and how corrupting it can be that it's just not a useful concept.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
BREITHAUPT: I think that empathy still, overall, is the key to all humanity. Without empathy, we would be just alone. I mean, throwing that out would be - well, cutting out 90 percent of what our life is all about.
ROSIN: Empathy in its elemental, basic form - one person looking another in the eye and really seeing them. However we use it - for friends, for enemies - it's the substance that keeps us from spinning out into loneliness - the worst way of being, except for all the others.

Suspect Arrested In Louisiana Black Church Arson Cases,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606960/suspect-arrested-in-louisiana-black-church-arson-cases,"A suspect has been arrested after fires destroyed three historically black churches over 10 days in St. Landry Parish. Rachel Martin talks to Katie Gagliano, a reporter for The Acadiana Advocate .
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Three historically black churches in the state of Louisiana are gone. Fires burned them to the ground over the course of 10 days. And now a 21-year-old, a parish sheriff deputy's son, has been arrested and charged with arson. Louisiana's Governor John Bel Edwards spoke after the arrest.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOHN BEL EDWARDS: I don't know what this young man's motive was. I don't know what was in his heart. But I can say it cannot be justified or rationalized. These were evil acts.
MARTIN: We've got Katie Gagliano with us. She's been reporting the story for the Acadiana Advocate.
Katie, first off, can you just tell us more about these congregations? Are they all close together geographically? Do they have a connection to one another besides being historically black congregations?
KATIE GAGLIANO: Yes. Aside from being historically black congregations, they also are located on rural highways. And that was a connecting factor in the case. They are in two neighboring towns. The churches are all within a couple miles - probably about 15 to 20 minutes of one another.
They play very central roles in their communities. All the congregants I spoke to said that their families have attended these churches for generations. Many of the older members have celebrated all of their religious rights in these churches, including christenings, baptisms, marriages. They're - they have a lot of sentimental and emotional value for these communities.
MARTIN: Yeah. So let's talk about the person who's suspected of being responsible for the fires. What do we know about this man who's been arrested?
GAGLIANO: We know from his online activity he has connections to the black metal movement. This is a subset genre of kind of rock, metal music that was connected to several church burnings by people who were part of the movement in Norway in the 1990s. There are some - certain subsets of the genre that are connected to neo-Nazi and white supremacist movements, though we don't have evidence yet that he was connected to any of those subsets.
MARTIN: I mean, it is hard to hear about church burnings in the South and not conjure up stories of the 1960s and the civil rights movement, when black churches were familiar targets for racist attacks. I mean, how are these congregations navigating all of this right now?
GAGLIANO: Well, obviously, you know, when they and when others have heard that these three churches were all historically black, that is something that people think about. You think of a possible bias motive. They're still trying to determine if that was a reason in these fires.
You know, but the church communities are trying to approach this with as much resilience as possible. The pastors have been talking a lot about keeping the focus on love. Especially because we're still trying to determine motive and cause, a lot of the pastors were saying that they didn't want to create fear in their communities more than there already is.
MARTIN: Right. We've actually got some tape of Reverend Gerald Toussaint, one of the pastors of the churches that was burned down. Let's listen.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
GERALD TOUSSAINT: A lot of people want to make it a hate thing. Well, we don't represent hate. We represent love.
MARTIN: Which is really the only way forward through something like this. Katie Gagliano with the Acadiana Advocate.
Katie, thank you so much for sharing your reporting on this. We appreciate it.
GAGLIANO: Thank you for having me.

A Louisiana deputy sheriff 's son is a suspect in the fires. Sudan's military to oversee a transition after the president is ousted.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So what happens now that the wall has come down? It's a question on the mind of ""Game Of Thrones"" fans, of course, but also Democratic presidential candidates.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Yeah. For the Democrats, it is the so-called blue wall. This is a term used by political scientists to refer to this cluster of Eastern, Western and Midwestern states that have consistently gone blue in recent presidential elections. But in 2016, this happened.
(SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS BROADCAST)
MEGYN KELLY: There's a big ol' call to make right now, and that is Fox News is projecting that Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you to the incredible people of Michigan.
(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""BLOOMBERG DAYBREAK EUROPE"")
DAVID GURA: Some big news here, Megyn - huge news, actually. The AP now projecting that Donald Trump has won the state of Pennsylvania.
MARTIN: So how are 2020 Democratic hopefuls trying to figure out how to win those states back?
GREENE: Well, let's ask NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow who is covering the run up to 2020. Hi there, Scott.
SCOTT DETROW, BYLINE: Good morning, David.
GREENE: Well, let's start with Bernie Sanders. I mean, it sounds like he is one of the candidates who, I mean, is really crafting a lot of his messaging on the idea that he can win these states back, right?
DETROW: Yeah. I think Democrats have more hope than, you know, maybe the North of Westeros in terms of rebuilding this wall.
(LAUGHTER)
DETROW: They're all - all the campaigns are confident that Democrats can win these states again, and that's part of the conversation. There's been this interesting shift where a lot of Democratic voters are really focused on electability - who can best beat Trump, issues aside.
Bernie Sanders is near the top of most of the polls. His campaign realizes still, though, that he needs to make this case that he is the best person to beat Trump. I talked to his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir. And he is arguing that Trump won those states by sounding very Bernie Sanders-like.
FAIZ SHAKIR: He offered a bunch of rhetoric that I think was stolen right out of Bernie Sanders' language. He talked about draining the swamp, about saving Medicare and Social Security, about cutting fair trade deals.
DETROW: So that's an argument Sanders is going to be making as he becomes just the latest Democrat to spend time campaigning in these states even though, of course, none of them are in that early wave of primary states.
GREENE: Right - but still important. And that makes me want to ask you - how important? Like, are - do Democrats - I mean, are they obsessed with the blue wall and really feel like it all comes down to this?
DETROW: Yeah, I think that's a good way to put it. It is dangerous to talk confidently about an election so far away. But if you look at how narrowly Trump won these states - just tens of thousands of votes - I think that most people agree that these are the states that are going to decide 2020.
And again, with so many voters saying - how can you beat Trump? Tell me your political strategy here - you're seeing candidates focus on that. Beto O'Rourke and Amy Klobuchar both visited some of these states in the very first days of their campaign. Kirsten Gillibrand's been to Michigan, as well. Sanders is doing this swing. I think this is going to be a big theme going forward.
GREENE: And Scott, the narrative that kind of took hold was that white, rural voters were really critical - I mean, that they voted for Trump and that Democrats need to win them over to take these states back. Is that what your reporting shows, or is it more complicated?
DETROW: I think it's a lot more complicated. Think about the fact that if Milwaukee and Detroit voters had been just a little bit more enthusiastic about Hillary Clinton - just the tiniest bit more enthusiastic and voted, she very likely would be president. And this is something that Milwaukee Democratic Congresswoman Gwen Moore is trying to remind candidates of.
GWEN MOORE: You can't put all your money into trying to make sure that rural folks get your vote. African-Americans are just like any other voters. They need to be dealt into the game. They need to feel like there is something that they can gain from it as well.
DETROW: So black voters are a key part of any Democratic coalition in these states, especially in the rest of the country, of course. So far, Moore says that she's very happy about what she's hearing, Sanders and other candidates talking a lot about criminal justice reform, voting rights, other things that many African-American voters really care deeply about.
GREENE: And briefly, I mean - Republicans, they just feel like let's repeat what we did in 2016 to get those states?
DETROW: That and an increased focus on socialism - warning the Democratic Party is drifting far to the left.
GREENE: NPR political correspondent Scott Detrow. Thank you, Scott.
DETROW: Thank you.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
GREENE: All right. We're going to turn now to Louisiana, where, in the course of 10 days, three historically black churches were destroyed by fire.
MARTIN: Yeah, these churches are in St. Landry Parish. This is about 60 miles west of Baton Rouge. They'd been standing for generations. The fires, though, have destroyed them completely. Investigators are now trying to figure out what happened.
And yesterday, there was a breakthrough in the investigation. Police arrested a 21-year-old white man named Holden Matthews, who happens to be the son of a local sheriff's deputy. Matthews has been charged with three counts of arson. Louisiana's governor, John Bel Edwards, talked after the arrest.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOHN BEL EDWARDS: I don't know what this young man's motive was. I don't know what was in his heart. But I can say it cannot be justified or rationalized. These were evil acts.

KATIE GAGLIANO: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for having me.
GREENE: Well, thank you for taking the time to bring us your reporting. So who is this man, Holden Matthews? And what might have been his motive here?
GAGLIANO: Yeah. So Holden Matthews is a 21-year-old from Opelousas, La. That's the area where these fires occurred. As you said, his father, Roy Matthews, is a sheriff's deputy for St. Landry Parish. We know that his father actually assisted in facilitating his arrest.
We don't know too much about him. We're still discovering things. We know that the sheriff said he doesn't have a reported history of violence or an arrest record. We've also discovered, as they said in a press conference yesterday, he has connections to the death metal movement. On his Facebook page, he's listed as the lead singer for a group called the Vodka Vultures. And he also has a lot of online posts connecting him to paganism and beliefs in Norse mythology.
Now, some of these offshoots can have some connections to neo-Nazi movements or white supremacy. It's still undetermined if he was involved in any of those subsets.
GREENE: OK. So we're just learning more about this young man.
GAGLIANO: Yes.
GREENE: Can you talk about these churches and how important they've been in this community?
GAGLIANO: These churches are very central to the lives of the people that live in this area. Religion and faith are a cornerstone of these people's lives. As you said, these churches have been in the communities for generations. Congregants that I spoke to said their families have been there for years. They've - many of them have celebrated all of their religious rites in these churches - they've been christened, they've been baptized, they've been married there.
It's - you know, they said seeing these churches burn - though losing a building can't destroy their faith, it's still a very heavy emotional and sentimental loss for them.
GREENE: Well, I just want to listen to the voice here of a pastor at one of the churches, Reverend Gerald Toussaint. Here he is.
GERALD TOUSSAINT: A lot of people want to make it a hate thing. Well, we don't represent hate.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: No.
TOUSSAINT: We represent love.
GREENE: Is that the sentiment that the leaders of these churches are basically expressing right now?
GAGLIANO: Yes. And that's what they've really been expressing from the beginning. You know, as you heard the governor say, hate doesn't have a place here. And that's really what these pastors have been leading with. They've been wanting to keep the focus on, you know, the endurance of their faith, the importance of love and spreading that message.
You know, we're still trying to determine, as you said, what the motives are in this case. And of course, given the nature of these fires, they are looking at this as, you know, a potentially bias-motivated event. But until they determine that, the pastors are wanting to keep their communities calm and keep the focus on facts.
GREENE: Katie Gagliano with The Acadiana Advocate, thanks a lot.
GAGLIANO: Of course. Thank you.

GREENE: And so on Thursday morning, Sudan awoke to word from the state news broadcaster that the military would be making an important announcement.
MARTIN: Later came a declaration from Sudan's defense minister.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
AWAD IBN AUF: (Foreign language spoken).
MARTIN: The defense minister announced that longtime President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who has led that country for 30 years, had been arrested and removed from office. It was the news protesters had been waiting for. Thousands were on the streets celebrating. But the joy was short-lived after the defense minister said he would oversee a transitional government - not what protesters had wanted to hear.
GREENE: NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton has been following these developments. Hi, Ofeibea.
OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE: Greetings.
GREENE: So I mean, al-Bashir has been known for so long as just a ruthless African tyrant. Does that pretty much capture his reign over these 30 years? Or is it more complicated?
QUIST-ARCTON: It is a little more complicated. He is a political survivor. He came in 30 years ago. He was a military officer - a senior military officer. But his (coughing) - excuse me - political opponents and his critics say that he has overseen - Sudan - which was one of the biggest countries in Africa and should have been one of the richest - had oil, had a southern part. He has overseen a war with the South, which has now become an independent country, economic mismanagement and, of course, Darfur and the, quotes, ""genocide"", as Colin Powell called it. So Bashir is seen as somebody who's been a political maneuverer, an operator, but somebody who has not done well for his country.
GREENE: Well, as Rachel mentioned, I mean, protesters wanted him out. It seems like they've gotten that. But they did not want the military in charge of their country for the foreseeable future. So how are - how is the protest movement feeling at this moment?
QUIST-ARCTON: Well, it's been a bittersweet moment because, of course, they heard that Bashir was going. And initially, in December, when these demonstrations started, it was because the price of fuel had shot up. But soon they said, no, Bashir must go - but not just Bashir, Bashir and his political and military clique that have mismanaged the country. So when they heard that the defense minister, who's one of Bashir's lieutenants, is going to head this military council, these protesters - and all ages, all genders, men, women, young and old - said absolutely not. They have defied a ban and a curfew to stay out in the streets to say no, there must be a civilian administration.
GREENE: Well, what is next for al-Bashir? I mean, he's still wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide. Right?
QUIST-ARCTON: Indeed. And let me - before that, let me just - let us listen to Dalia el Roubi. She is one of the main organizers of the protests.
DALIA EL ROUBI: Unacceptable....
QUIST-ARCTON: Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court...
ROUBI: ...The assumption that people will actually believe that this is not another face of the NCP is really quite insulting. And they're underestimating the knowledge and awareness and commitment of the people on the street and their convictions for change.
QUIST-ARCTON: Bashir is wanted by the International Criminal Court on genocide and war crimes charges. The U.S. says the civilians must be included in the new government, and the African Union has condemned the military takeover.
GREENE: NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton.
QUIST-ARCTON: Always a pleasure - thank you.

""When he was a little boy, an officer got on his back while he was screaming. And he's been handcuffed to gurneys in emergency rooms just for having a seizure and being big,"" she said. Walker is 6-foot-3.
To make matters worse, on this particular visit, Walker bit Ellen. ""I'm sitting there brokenhearted, scared out of my mind, bleeding, and Walker's trying to run away,"" she said. ""And I see, like, five guys on him, and all I think is 'This will not end well. They're gonna kill him.' ""

As Ellen tells it, every time Walker tried to escape at the hospital, Keith would say: ""Walker gets up! Walker sits down! Walker scoots back! Walker lies down!"" And then you said high-fives all around."" And to Ellen's surprise, Walker beamed and high-fived every officer.
Then Keith started singing the opening theme song to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood . At that point, Walker, who had been terrified moments before, felt like the officers were his friends, Ellen said. And people around them watched the joy unfold and wanted to join in.

How The Insurance Industry Helps Police Departments Tackle Bad Behavior,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606977/how-the-insurance-industry-is-helping-police-departments-tackle-bad-behavior,"How The Insurance Industry Helps Police Departments Tackle Bad Behavior How The Insurance Industry Helps Police Departments Tackle Bad Behavior Embed Embed
Bad policing can get expensive when it leads to lawsuits and settlements. For smaller cities, that can lead to serious pressure to change things from the people who help foot the bill: insurers.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
As conversations continue around the country about how police engage with the communities they serve, we've got a story this morning about an often-overlooked industry helping some police departments tackle bad behavior. Karen Duffin from our Planet Money podcast has the story.
KAREN DUFFIN, BYLINE: It was about five years ago. Tony Miranda was brought in as the new police chief in Irwindale, Calif. Fourteen hundred residents, it's a really nice little town - with one caveat.
TONY MIRANDA: The city was known for the police department because it garnered the most news. News at 6, news at 5, news at 11 - all negative.
DUFFIN: Police officers there had been accused of, or removed for, sexual assault, embezzlement and sex with a minor. So Miranda needs to make a lot of changes. He sees that there's tons of infighting. Lots of things have been neglected - training, basic technology. Like the program they use to send cops on 911 calls - theirs is broken. And when Miranda asks them, like, how do you guys even figure out where to go then?
MIRANDA: And one of the patrolmen holds up his palm and he says - like this, Chief. He's writing the calls on his palm of his hand with his ink pen.
DUFFIN: So Miranda tells his officers, I'm bringing in new blood. I'm going to hire a new No. 2.
MIRANDA: And one sergeant stands up and says, you know what, Chief? They're going to call for a vote of no confidence.
DUFFIN: Right off the bat, they tried to get him fired. And this may have been where the story ended, but Miranda had a powerful ally on his side - insurance. All those scandals had cost millions of dollars in legal fees, and insurance had been picking up most of the bill. But then their insurer told them - if you don't shape up, we're going to cancel your policy.
MIRANDA: An exterior threat that could close the Irwindale Police Department down.
DUFFIN: Without insurance, one big lawsuit could be enough to bankrupt a small town. So some towns have even shut down their police departments after they lost their insurance. John Rappaport at the University of Chicago studies police reform.
JOHN RAPPAPORT: There's a whole big, powerful, well-financed industry that is trying to influence police behavior.
DUFFIN: Big cities tend to self-insure, but smaller cities, like Irwindale, they buy either private insurance or join what's called a municipal risk pool - a sort of government insurance. In the mix of what can be a heated debate over police reform, insurers approach it as a business decision. Does this police behavior create risk? If yes, let's reduce it.
RAPPAPORT: We're not telling you you're bad. We're just telling you that your numbers are worse than they were last year, and we want to bring them back down to where they were.
DUFFIN: In Irwindale, their insurance authority gave them eight things to fix and 18 months to fix them. Miranda again.
MIRANDA: So they needed to either get a handle on things or cancel their policy. That was it.
DUFFIN: Which was motivating. There were trainings, new policies. They fixed their broken equipment. Tony Miranda got to hire that No. 2. And insurance isn't a cure-all for all bad police behavior. Insurers care mostly about expensive problems that might generate large payouts like excessive force. But pressure from the insurance authority worked for Irwindale. Eighteen months later, their insurance declared them new and improved - let them keep their insurance.
MIRANDA: I have to say, without that, I'm not sure if Irwindale would be here today. I'm really not sure.
DUFFIN: Karen Duffin for NPR News.

"It May Take Months To Identify Cyclone Victims, Forensic Coordinator Says",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712606953/it-may-take-months-to-identify-cyclone-idai-victims-forensic-coordinator-says,"David Greene talks to Associated Press reporter Cara Anna, who tells the story of a man who is trying to help recovery efforts in Mozambique after last month's cyclone.
CARA ANNA: (Reading) He was haunted by the thought of a small child's skull, unburied and lost in the debris of a cyclone that had claimed hundreds of lives. Stephen Fonseca stood in a field of ruined maize where a tiny spine had been found, and he wanted to find the rest of the body. But in every direction were scattered kernels and stalks bleached by the sun. At a glance, much of the landscape looked like bones.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
That is the voice there of Associated Press reporter Cara Anna reading from her latest story. She's been following one man who has been helping survivors in Mozambique cope with death after a cyclone that was the worst storm ever to hit southern Africa. The death toll in Mozambique alone is estimated to be more than 600 and climbing. I asked Cara how she came across Stephen Fonseca with the Red Cross.
ANNA: I first came across him in one of the statements that aid organizations were making shortly after the cyclone hit. Everybody was trying to get a handle on how bad the damage was, how many people were affected, how many people were lost. And I'm sure the International Committee of the Red Cross had a statement mentioning they had a forensic investigator on the ground. And that piqued my interest. It wasn't something I immediately got to. But on the second trip back to Mozambique, we caught up with him and managed to follow him for a couple of days.
GREENE: Just the image you paint of him hoping that he can find a small child's skull - I mean, can you just tell me exactly what his job is and what his mission is?
ANNA: He's based in South Africa. He is the forensic coordinator for the African continent with the International Committee of the Red Cross. And in Mozambique, he was the only forensically trained body recovery specialist searching rural Mozambique after the cyclone hit.
GREENE: And how much time did you spend with him?
ANNA: We were there for a couple of days in rural Mozambique. We sort of followed him around. I was kind of amazed that he was a bit worried that he wasn't giving us enough material. He had described, you know, wading through thick muds - landscape where crocodiles, hippos, snakes could pose a threat. He described coming across bodies in trees, bodies found on islands.
But the fact that he was worried that we wouldn't find something sufficiently dramatic just amazed me because his work is so fascinating. And the challenge that he had taken on was just - appeared staggering to me. That he was standing in this maize field trying to find a skull of a child, it seemed like an impossible task. So I tried to describe that.
GREENE: I guess, I mean, we should say there's so many important jobs after a disaster like this, many of them focusing on people who are, fortunately, still living. Why does he find this work so, so very important?
ANNA: He thinks it's important to find closure. I think the term he used was ambiguous loss, the idea of families across that region never knowing what happened to relatives who were swept away. He wanted, as best as possible - along with, you know, the local communities that he came across - the common interest was finding closure, being able to tell people for certain what happened to their loved ones.
GREENE: Explain that, this kind of work, more if you can.
ANNA: Well, he - we followed him as he went into different communities, first of all, introducing himself and his work and distributing some of just the basic materials to help others who were already doing work in the field. I mean, these villagers, as he explained, were just as interested in dignified burials, even if the people were strangers, even if they had washed up from as far away as neighboring Zimbabwe.
So one of the first things he wanted to do was simply hand out tools to help them along, things like simple grave markers, gloves, masks, tags for bodies - just to help them out. And as he did his own work, of course, he - especially when he found the small shinbone of a child - he was careful to take measurements, to write down the information, to document what he had found, to handle it properly and, in the end, place it in a makeshift body bag and bury it with bones that he believed also belonged to the same child.
GREENE: You mentioned one, I mean, really disturbing thing, which was that there were not traditional body bags for children's remains. What would he do?
ANNA: He took a normal-size, I suppose, body bag - just so much incredibly larger than the tiny shin bone that he found - and essentially cut it into a more manageable size and put duct tape along the seams. And then he drove with a local chief to the grave where the vertebrae - where the tiny spine had already been buried. And so they stood there in the hot sun. And they dug it up. And, you know, quietly they placed the second small body bag in with it. The grave marker was already there. And it said, you know, in Portuguese - it was written in permanent ink - it said, don't touch, the body of a child.
GREENE: This is such a different type of story than we often see after a disaster. I mean, it's just the sheer numbers and the sheer amount of land in these three countries that was affected. I mean, you've decided to bring us just into one life and profile - one person doing one thing. Was that experience different for you journalistically?
ANNA: It was a different - oh, gosh. It was a different experience for sure. I've never followed anyone doing this kind of work. And I've had two reporting trips to Mozambique now. And a lot of the work has been focused on the many, many people trying to deliver aid to people still alive - you know, frantic - organized frantic chaos, you know, trying to help people survive. And this was a very different, quiet experience but just fascinating to see.
GREENE: Is there one image or one scene or one moment that stands out for you after following this man?
ANNA: I think it was just the one in the field. It just struck me as an immense task. And I wanted to bring that to life as much as possible immediately for people. And he said it himself as he stood and he looked around the field. And he said, this is literally like a needle in a haystack.
GREENE: your reporting.
ANNA: Thank you very much.

High School Musical Explores Themes From The College Admissions Scandal,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/711931714/high-school-musical-explores-themes-from-the-college-admissions-scandal,"Enlarge this image Students perform in Granite Bay High School's original production of Ranked . Yarcenia Garcia/Courtesy of Granite Bay High School Yarcenia Garcia/Courtesy of Granite Bay High School Students perform in Granite Bay High School's original production of Ranked .
Yarcenia Garcia/Courtesy of Granite Bay High School A new musical explores life in high school in a way that's eerily familiar. It's called Ranked , and it's set in a dystopian world where your class rank — determined by grades and test scores — governs everything from where you sit to what your future holds.
There's a mean girl, ranked No. 1; a student who refreshingly doesn't care about rank; and a student on the edge who's under immense pressure to improve their standing. Really, all the characters are under immense pressure. It's a major theme throughout. And at the end of Act 1, there's a major plot twist: It turns out, one of the main character's parents is paying to inflate a child's grade — and the student had no idea.
""We're literally watching our story that we wrote play out in the national news,"" says Kyle Holmes, a theater teacher at Granite Bay High School in Granite Bay, Calif.
Education U.S. Charges Dozens Of Parents, Coaches In Massive College Admissions Scandal Law Felicity Huffman And 12 Other Parents To Plead Guilty In College Cheating Scandal He and David Taylor Gomes, who helps run the school's musical, started writing the story last spring, long before the Justice Department announced charges against about 50 people in what prosecutors called the largest college admissions scandal in the U.S.
That scandal — and the gall of wealth and privilege in America — has been the subject of conversations in nail salons, at dinner tables and even in the halls of Congress. Just this week, more than a dozen parents agreed to plea agreements and others were indicted.
And Granite Bay High School has another connection to the scandal: The guy behind the now-infamous scheme, Rick Singer, started his admissions counseling business outside Sacramento, not far from Granite Bay. In the past, he actually worked with students at Granite Bay High School .
How the musical came to be
Last spring, exasperated from the uninspiring list of show choices, Holmes and Gomes set out to write a show that was relevant and had realistic characters for high schoolers. They wanted to write something that explored life at a school like Granite Bay.
Holmes, who wrote the book for the musical, says it's easy to see the pressure to do well at Granite Bay. ""[Our students] are stressed all the time. They're staying up late, they're not sleeping, they're studying.""
That stress, and the pressure that comes with it, inspired the lyrics of the song ""Someone Always Bleeds"":
Rich kids like you
Never have to pay their dues
Who needs to read textbooks
You've got daddy's checkbooks
Someone always bleeds! ...
Maybe we're all pawns
Maybe we got played
We don't all have the funds
Are you feeling betrayed?
""Did I tell the future? I don't know,"" Gomes says with a laugh. He wrote the play's music and lyrics. ""There was definitely a tangible energy in the air when we realized our story was accurate.""
So how did this story, written months ago, come to be so spot-on? Early in the process, Gomes and Holmes involved experts: their students. They asked students to submit monologues, and they held workshops where dozens of students shared what their lives were like. They wanted to dig below the surface — beyond the idea of ""school is hard, tests are hard,"" Gomes explains. He says they wanted the good stuff — ""Not what they tell their parents, not what they tell their friends, but the things that they think about and don't express.""
Over and over again, these conversations came back to the stress of academics and the value of self-worth. Many of the things students said made it directly into the script.
In the show, Emma Harlow, a senior who plays student Sydney Summers, delivers the line, ""How do we know the difference between who we actually are and what people want from us?""
She says that line gives her all the feels. ""It really hits deep.""
That's partly because Harlow, the real-life student, actually said those words to Holmes, her theater teacher, months ago.
""I felt that my whole entire life,"" she says. ""I'm just doing things to make sure my family looks good and part of me got lost along the way.""
Some of those feelings are captured in the song ""Come Up for Air,"" when the students in the show begin to reconcile expectations with who they really are. ""These waves keep crashing down,"" they sing. ""But we're still there.""
""Nothing makes you feel more heard than when someone puts your words into another story,"" Harlow says. ""And you know that story is making other people feel heard.""
Senior Natalie Collins loves a line that comes right after the characters discover a student's family paid for his rank. The line is (spoiler alert!): ""Ryan was playing the game, just like the rest of you.""
""It's just so disgustingly real!"" Collins says. ""We're all fighting and we're all playing this game to get to the top, and get to the next step of education, and a lot of hard work — real work — gets lost along the way.""
""Everyone feels this way""
Usually, Granite Bay announces its spring musical by posting headshots of the performers in the hallway. But this year, it tried something a little different: Holmes asked students to anonymously submit personal text messages, exchanges and emails that depicted the pressure the students were under from parents and counselors.
One text exchange reads:
A: How was the test?
B: I got an 86%!
A: Oh no what happened?
Another:
A: I'm watching you
B: Where am I currently then
A: Failing class
They used the messages in a collage that included headlines from recent news stories ("" The Silicon Valley Suicides ,"" "" Is class rank valid? "") and hung it in the hallway instead of the headshots. A banner at the top reads: ""Pain is temporary. Grades last forever.""
A wall at Granite Bay High School is covered in news articles and messages. It's meant to illustrate the pressure students are under to get good grades and get into top colleges. Courtesy of Granite Bay High School Courtesy of Granite Bay High School ""Alone, all the messages seemed crazy,"" Harlow says. ""And then we put it all together, and literally everyone feels this way. Everyone's parents are saying these things. We're all getting these emails. It's not good that we're all doing that, but it showed us that there is actually an issue.""
When the show debuted on April 4, Harlow says she and her castmates watched their parents, and their friends' parents, start to understand just how competitive and stressful their lives feel. Harlow is hopeful those conversations will continue after the show closes this weekend."
