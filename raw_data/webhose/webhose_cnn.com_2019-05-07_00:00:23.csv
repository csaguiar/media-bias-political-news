Ryanair apologizes for denying boarding to refugee,edition.cnn.com,"Gianluca Mezzofiore, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/europe/ryanair-denies-boarding-activist-scli-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Ryanair has apologized for preventing a prominent refugee from boarding a flight to Ireland despite being in possession of the appropriate travel documents.
Iyad El-Baghdadi is an Arab Spring activist who was raised in the UAE and obtained political asylum in Norway in 2015. He told CNN he was meant to travel from Berlin to Dublin on a Ryanair flight departing at 10.30 a.m. local time on Wednesday. He tweeted an appeal to his 122,000 followers to ""make some noise"" about the incident. I'm at the airport in Berlin and I'm being denied boarding by @Ryanair because I'm a refugee. I'm heading to Dublin. The Irish government website says I can travel but @Ryanair says I can't. If you love me, make some noise. https://t.co/ZGPKN37W7p
— İyad el-Baghdadi | إياد البغدادي (@iyad_elbaghdadi) April 10, 2019 Baghdadi told CNN: ""I called the Irish embassy yesterday to make sure I can travel. They referred to the Irish government's website, confirming I can travel. But Ryanair denied me boarding without giving me any reason,"" he said. ""They told me 'Our supervisor is busy.' I was supposed to be in Dublin for a meeting and then travel onward to Oslo."" Ryanair told CNN in a statement: ""This customer was denied boarding because of an error made by our handling agent in Berlin. Ryanair has since made contact with the customer directly and he will travel with us later today. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused."" Read More Baghdadi later tweeted that he had just received a call from Ryanair customer service offering apologies and that he would be put on the next flight and compensated. ""Now I'm thinking about all the refugees who do NOT have 122k followers on Twitter and don't get such callbacks,"" he added. The Irish government says on its website that holders of ""Convention travel documents may not be subject to an Irish visa requirement for short stays of up to 90 days in Ireland."" ""In order for the holder of such a travel document to be exempt from an Irish visa requirement for short stays, the travel document must be issued by a European State which is a contracting party to the 'European Agreement on the Abolition of Visas for Refugees,'"" the website states, adding a list of countries that includes Norway. Baghdadi sent CNN a picture of himself holding a Norwegian travel document."
Devin Nunes lawsuit called a 'baseless attack' by McClatchy,edition.cnn.com,Oliver Darcy,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/media/devin-nunes-lawsuit-mcclatchy/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter.

""We should not overlook how awful this is,"" NiemanLab's Joshua Benton wrote. ""A sitting member of Congress suing a news organization on clearly nonsense grounds to harass a free press."" That was on Monday, when Representative Devin Nunes filed a $150 million lawsuit against the McClatchy newspaper chain. He claimed a story in his district's newspaper, The Fresno Bee, defamed him. Nunes gave the scoop about the suit to Fox News, which led its home page with the story , treating the suit like something really serious. Sean Hannity brought Nunes on and celebrated the suit. You could almost hear Hannity's viewers at home at home saying, ""Yeah, sue the fake news!"" The reality is... very different. Nunes is getting ridiculed for his legal filings, first against Twitter, now against McClatchy. And the newspaper publisher isn't mincing words. McClatchy CEO Craig Forman sent a memo to the entire company on Tuesday reassuring staffers that ""we will vigorously defend The Fresno Bee."" And later in the day, in a detailed statement, the company said the suit ""represents a baseless attack on local journalism and a free press,"" an unproductive distraction"" and ""a misuse of the judicial system.""

Hopefully, he will provide such answers during the litigation."" The company also said Nunes filed suit in Virginia, but California is the more appropriate venue. Here's the full statement . Fox's Judge Andrew Napolitano said he doesn't think Nunes has a case... Neither do other experts on the right and left . We'll see what the courts say to Nunes.

9/11: Gay rugby hero whose legacy challenges homophobia,edition.cnn.com,Eoghan Macguire,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/sport/mark-bingham-international-gay-rugby-spt-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Alice Hoagland recalls the last time she spoke with her son, Mark Bingham. It was September 11, 2001, and Bingham was on board the hijacked United Flight 93.
""He just called and said 'Mom, I want to tell you that I love you. I'm on a flight from Newark to San Francisco.' ""'Three guys have taken over the plane and they say they have a bomb.'"" The hijackers, of which it later transpired there were four, were part of the al-Qaeda terror cell that crashed commercial jets into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon in Washington DC, killing 2,937 people. Flight 93, however, never reached its intended target, thought to be a major political target in Washington such as the Capitol. Passengers heroically battled with the hijackers before the plane crashed in a field near the town of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Read More Bingham lost his life along with 39 other passengers and crew members taking the total death toll of the attacks to 2,977. It was the most lethal attack ever staged on US soil. An item in memory of Mark Bingham at The Wall of Names at the Flight 93 National Memorial in Shanksville, Pa. Yet out of the carnage and devastation, has come a form of healing for Hoagland and the flourishing of a sporting community close to Bingham for much of his life. The Bingham Cup Mention the Bingham Cup to members of the Atlanta Bucks rugby team and all will know what the tournament represents as well as the story of the man it's named after. Jeffrey Thorpe, who has played the rough and tumble sport with the Bucks for the past two years, tells CNN Bingham is someone who is ""really respected"" among his friends and teammates. The Bucks are part of International Gay Rugby (IGR), a network for inclusive teams located all over the world. Founded roughly 15-years-ago, the Bucks are one of close to 30 American IGR teams. According to Gus Ventura, North American trustee for IGR, Bingham's inspirational story has had ""an enormous impact on the growth (of the) sport"" in the US and helped ""mitigate the homophobia"" gay athletes often encounter. Alice Hoagland at a congressional hearing in 2014. Bingham was introduced to the sport in high school and played college rugby at University California Berkeley. As a gay man, he went on to play for IGR club the San Francisco Fog and was instrumental in setting up New York's Gotham Knights, another gay and inclusive team. Bingham's death at the age of just 31 was mourned by the many close friends he made in the game, some of whom decided to set up a competition in his honor. The Bingham Cup began in 2002 under the banner of the IGR and has been held every other year since. What began with just a handful of gay and inclusive teams has expanded rapidly. Last year, 78 teams from 20 countries came to Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to play in the Bingham Cup, making it one of the largest 15-a-side rugby tournaments in the world.

There are currently more IGR teams in the US than any other country.

It's something I never would have done if I hadn't been part of this."" Gay heroes Hoagland describes being ""really touched"" whenever she hears such stories. She recalls her son pointing out before 9/11 that there were ""not enough gay heroes"" and that gay people tended to be treated with derision and jest in media and entertainment. Yet it's a source of pride, Hoagland adds, that Bingham continues to inspire others to challenge those stereotypes. She recites the words of Senator John McCain, who attended Bingham's memorial service in 2001, and highlighted how the actions of the passengers aboard Flight 93 may even have saved the politician's own life in Washington DC..

Africa's first gay rugby club shatters stereotypes 01:23 Thorpe, of the Atlanta Bucks, suggests Bingham's legacy has been to show that gay people can not only be heroes but that they can compete in the most physical and competitive sports. ""If you look back at his story and know that he was a rugger, know that he was gay and then hearing what he did on 9/11, I think the majority of people would be taken aback,"" Thorpe says. ""A lot of people think that because you are LGBT, you can't play something this aggressive. That's false. Everyone wants to join a team and (have) that camaraderie."" The Bingham Cup has enabled many people to do just that while bringing together gay and inclusive teams from around the world. Last year's edition saw women's teams compete for the first time while organizers hope the 2020 event in Ottawa, Canada, will be even bigger. Rugby team rallies against deportation of gay player to Kenya There are now IGR teams on five continents, an incredible feat given the first gay and inclusive rugby team was only founded in London, England, in 1995. For Hoagland, who has attended every staging of the competition, it's a fitting way to remember her only son. ""Mark would say rugby is my life,"" she says, while he also loved the camaraderie and togetherness the sport encourages. Perhaps more powerfully, however, the friends Hoagland has made in attending the Bingham Cup have helped her to cope with the loss of a man she describes as ""remarkable"" and her very own ""hero."" ""The way they remember and honor him has helped me profoundly to deal with my grief,"" she says. ""It's astounding to me how very inclusive and how very much it allows the young men and women to play together and be a cohesive part. ""The joy the young men and women have when they play reminds me very much of Mark's joy, she continues. ""I just wish (Mark) was here to enjoy it too."""
"Barr returns to Capitol Hill, where he'll face more Mueller questions - CNNPolitics",edition.cnn.com,Jeremy Herb,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/william-barr-senate-hearing/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General William Barr said special counsel Robert Mueller did not ask him or Congress to come to a determination on whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice, but that he made a conclusion there wasn't a case to prosecute because ""that's generally how the Department of Justice works.""
Barr also told a Senate subcommittee that spying on the Trump campaign occurred and that he's undertaking a review of the origins of the counterintelligence investigation into members of the Trump campaign and Russia to determine whether there was ""unauthorized surveillance."" ""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,"" Barr said. ""I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred. I'm saying that I'm concerned about it and looking into it, that's all."" Barr was back on Capitol Hill Wednesday for a second day of testimony on the Justice Department budget, this time before a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, but once again special counsel Robert Mueller's report dominated the conversation. Democrats pressed Barr to explain his decision not to prosecute on obstruction of justice, after Mueller reached no conclusions but wrote that the investigation did not exonerate Trump, according to Barr's summary. Barr says spying on Trump campaign 'did occur,' but provides no evidence Barr wouldn't respond to the questions, saying he would be able to explain in more detail once Mueller's report was released. But he acknowledged he didn't know whether Mueller agreed with him. Read More ""I don't know whether Bob Mueller supported my conclusion,"" Barr said. ""I am not going to sit here and try to characterize his reasoning or his report, that's why it's important to get the whole report out instead of trying to read these little tea leaves."" Barr did say that Mueller did not ask him to make a conclusion, as part of his underlying argument that it was his role as attorney general to do so. ""Generally, grand juries are to investigate crimes and a prosecutor's role at the end of the day is binary,"" Barr said. ""Are there charges, or no charges? Or, is this a crime or not a crime?"" For several other questions, such as whether the White House was briefed on the Mueller investigation, Barr also stuck to his line that he would be able to offer more explanation once the report is out, which he said was likely next week. Still, his testimony did elicit some new hints about what he will put out from the Mueller report. Barr reviewing origins of FBI's Russia investigation, says 'spying on a political campaign is a big deal' Barr told the panel, for instance, that his decision to redact information about the ""personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties"" did not apply to Trump. ""No, I'm talking about people in private life, not public office,"" Barr said. Barr also suggested that the report would not be filled with pages of redactions. ""You will get more than the gist,"" he told the panel. At Tuesday's House hearing, Barr said he expected to release a redacted version of the Mueller report within a week, with plans to color-code redactions and provide an explanation for why material was not released publicly. But Barr sparred with House Democrats who pressed him on why he would not release grand jury material or provide the full, unredacted Mueller report to Congress. ""I don't intend at this stage to send the full, unredacted report to the committee,"" Barr said, adding that wouldn't ask a court to release grand jury material ""until someone shows me a provision"" that allows it to be released. Barr stuck to his argument Wednesday, saying the restriction on including grand jury material that Democrats are demanding is ""inflexible under the law."" In the House, Barr was squaring off with Democrats who have subpoena power and have already authorized a subpoena in the Judiciary Committee to obtain the full Mueller report and underlying evidence. Democratic lawmakers expressed frustration after the hearing that Barr wouldn't answer certain questions, such as whether the White House had been briefed about the Mueller report. Senate Democrats also argued to Barr that he could provide Congress with grand jury material, saying Barr was within his discretion to go to court to do so. ""I think attempts to hide swaths of the report from public scrutiny along the way will only fuel suspicions that have been raised by many that the Justice Department, which represents the United States, is playing the role of President Trump's defense team,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. ""Your imprint on the course of justice, the rule of law, in these moments, are going to be scrutinized long after both you and I are gone from public service. The only way out in my view is transparency."" Republicans, however, suggested that providing grand jury material confidentially to Congress could result in it being leaked. ""Can we agree there is a material risk that the grand jury information would leak?"" asked Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana. ""I think so,"" Barr responded. Barr's decision to review the beginning of the 2016 counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, which was reported after his testimony Tuesday, was a topic of interest to both Democrats and Republicans. Barr said he wanted to look at all of the investigations that have already probed the matter, including Congress and the Justice Department inspector general, and see if any areas need additional investigation. ""One of the things that I want to do is pull together all the information from the various investigations that have gone on, including on the Hill, and in the department, and see if there are any remaining questions to be addressed,"" Barr said. Barr later said he did not have evidence that wrongdoing occurred in the Justice Department or the FBI, but he did have questions and concerns about what happened. ""I have no specific evidence right now that I would cite. I do have questions about it,"" Barr said, adding there could be ""abuses that may not rise to the level of a crime."" This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday."
'Lionel Messi is God': Can Manchester United stop Barcelona's divine talent? - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Nick Friend, for CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/football/lionel-messi-barcelona-manchester-united-champions-league-spt-intl/index.html,"(CNN) ""Bring it on"" was the rallying cry from Chris Smalling as the Manchester United defender was confronted with the reality of facing Lionel Messi in Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal.
With Smalling likely to start at the heart of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's defense and Messi intent on performing the role immortalized by his unparalleled phenomenon, the pair will -- by the game's close -- be well-acquainted. To leave Messi unattended is, at best, unwise. Mikael Silvestre -- a Champions League winner during his time at Manchester United -- acknowledged that it is Messi's divine brilliance that stands in his former team's way on its path to an unlikely semifinal place. ""Barcelona -- except 'God' (Messi) -- is a team that you can stop over two games,"" Silvestre told CNN Sport last month. ""I think United can stop Barcelona and progress."" Given both the Catalan side's style of play and the central importance of Messi, Silvestre is well aware of the grit and good fortune necessary if his former club is to remain in the game for long enough to concern the five-time winners.

""They did it against Paris [in the previous round, where United overcame a 2-0 first-leg deficit to win on away goals]. They ended up playing with Mason Greenwood, Tahith Chong, James Garner -- the three youngsters -- in the Parc des Princes. ""It was an inspiring performance, with that mental ability to stay in the game and believe and to never ever give up. It is in the club's DNA -- that never-give-up attitude."" Messi, though remains the key. As a defender who racked up 249 appearances during the Alex Ferguson era, Silvestre has a warning for his former team.

""[Stopping him] has been done before,"" he points out. ""We know how to do it."" Indeed, Silvestre himself has managed it; he came on as a late substitute when United beat Barcelona by a single goal in the 2008 semifinal. More than a decade on, though, Messi's icon has more than stood the test of time. That the Argentine has not been crowned as the world's greatest player since claiming his fifth Ballon d'Or title in 2015 is, in many ways, a red herring. Mikael Silvestre was part of the Manchester United squad that won the 2007/08 Champions League, coming on as a substitute against Barcelona at Old Trafford in the second leg of the 1-0 semifinal aggregate win. READ: How a painting helped soccer great Buffon cope with depression Timeless supremacy His unique ability has never declined, and nor have his own numbers; 26 goals in the 2015/16 La Liga season have subsequently been followed by 37 and 34, with the Argentine great sat on 33 with seven games of the current season remaining -- a year dominated by his Barcelona side. In this year's Champions League, Messi's six appearances have brought with them eight goals and a further three assists. It is a run that has added to an already exceptional overall record in Europe's major club competition; 108 goals in 131 appearances give him a superior minutes per goal ratio to that of his great rival Cristiano Ronaldo, though the Argentine remains 16 strikes behind the Juventus forward's 124. The duo's long-running battle for footballing supremacy has seen them competing in a competition of their own. Former Real Madrid captain Raul Gonzalez is the pair's closest challenger -- but even his 71 goals place him 37 behind Messi. Of those still active, Karim Benzema is the next closest, but his Champions League tally of 60 is less than halfway to Ronaldo's astronomic figure.

Yet, for almost as long as the theory has existed, it is a label that Messi has confounded. There are, of course, occasional outliers. Messi's record against Chelsea, for example, sits at just three goals in 10 games. However, his history with Manchester United is different. Although it currently shows just two goals in four games, those strikes came in the 2009 and 2011 finals. His performance at Wembley in the latter of the two is remembered for its sheer majesty, as Barcelona cruised to a 3-1 victory. READ: Tottenham edge out Manchester City but lose Harry Kane to injury Some hope, perhaps, for the Old Trafford faithful comes in Messi's record on English soil. While hardly a goalscoring famine, Messi has netted eight times in 15 games in England, as opposed to 13 in 14 matches at the Camp Nou. Indeed, he is also without a goal in his last 11 Champions League quarterfinals. Whether that is an omen for Solskjaer's side -- good or bad -- remains to be seen."
Modi biopic banned during Indian election - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Manveena Suri, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/asia/modi-biopic-india-election-intl/index.html,"New Delhi (CNN) A Bollywood biopic of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been banned from release during the country's elections, amid claims it would serve as political propaganda.
The Election Commission of India announced on Wednesday that it was halting the release of the biopic until after the elections -- which kick off on April 11 and last about six weeks. The move comes days after the film's producers announced its release would be postponed, after it failed to get a censor's certificate in time. The film -- in which Modi is played by Indian actor Vivek Oberoi -- depicts various moments throughout the future prime minister's life, including selling tea on the railways as a child, a two-year spiritual stint in the Himalayas as a teen and leading the nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to a landslide victory at the polls in 2014. Narendra Modi biopic slammed as propaganda by opposition ahead of Indian election Last month , the main opposition Congress Party slammed the release of the movie, labeling it propaganda and suggesting its release would contravene the country's election laws.

Snap off to strong start as it faces pivotal year - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Kaya Yurieff,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/tech/snap-stock/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) After a tough 2018 for Snap, some analysts are optimistic the company is bouncing back.
Last year, Snap struggled with a controversial redesign of its Snapchat app, its first-ever declines in daily active users, an exodus of top executives , and heightened competition from rival Instagram. Things seem to be stabilizing this year. Snapchat has stopped losing users, and now analysts are hopeful its parent company Snap's prospects are improving, especially following its first-ever Partner Summit in Los Angeles last week, which featured new product and business announcements. ""We came away from Snap's first big partner summit feeling more upbeat than before on the cadence of innovation and the overall trajectory of the business in 2019,"" wrote Barclays analyst Ross Sandler in a recent investor note. The company's stock is reflecting this sentiment, too. It has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, although it's still trading below its $17 IPO price . Read More ""2018 was a year of transition,"" said Ron Josey, an analyst at JMP Securities. ""Snap is in a much better spot this year than they were a year ago."" At its event last week, Snap ( SNAP ) announced several new features that it hopes will increase the time users spend on the Snapchat app. The company launched a new gaming platform featuring titles only available on Snapchat, more additions to its lineup of original shows , and a way to post Snapchat Stories to other platforms such as Tinder. Snap event debuted new strategies ... and a changed Evan Spiegel Snap also outlined new monetization and advertising opportunities , including six-second ads in games and ways for advertisers to target users outside of the Snapchat app for the first time. JMP's Josey said he is impressed with Snap's reach and continued innovations in augmented reality and direct messaging. At the event, the company said it now reaches 90% of 13 to 34-year-olds in the US. Analysts also believe Snap is ""growing up."" Following a visit to the company's new headquarters in Santa Monica, Jefferies analysts said in March they ""felt like [Snap] had grown up from a startup to a more mature company,"" according to CNBC . The firm also said it was ""generally impressed"" with the company's ""cohesion and positive steps on the road to recovery."" Snapchat is betting big on social gaming In its most recent quarter , Snap stopped losing daily active users after two straight quarters of losses. The company's revenue hit a record $390 million, up 36% from the same period a year ago and well ahead of what investors had expected. Snap's new, supposedly faster Android app is rolling out , which could help it attract more users. In the past, Android users complained the app often crashed and had lesser camera quality than iOS. Not everyone is as optimistic. Research firm eMarketer slashed its Snapchat user estimates on Wednesday, citing the app's unpopular redesign . The firm expects Snapchat to have 77.5 million monthly users in the US in 2019, which is down 2.8% from last year. (Snapchat only shares daily user statistics, not monthly). ""I don't think it's all lost for Snapchat,"" eMarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told CNN Business.

Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are dealing with college cheating scandal in different ways - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Faith Karimi,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/felicity-huffman-lori-loughlin-different-reactions/index.html,"(CNN) Of the 50 people caught up in the largest college admissions cheating scheme ever prosecuted in the United States, actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin have become the faces of the scandal, with many wondering whether they will end up behind bars.
Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman make court appearances in college admissions scandal Huffman and Loughlin are among 33 parents accused of using their wealth to cheat on standardized tests for their children, and bribe college administrators and coaches who had major clout when it came to admissions. The investigation took a crucial turn last week when Huffman and a dozen other parents and one coach agreed to plead guilty to mail fraud and other forms of bribery, highlighting the separate actions both women have taken since the scandal broke. Here are the different ways the actresses have dealt with the fallout: Felicity Huffman Read More What is she accused of? Huffman has agreed to plead guilty to paying $15,000 to a fake charity associated with Rick Singer to facilitate cheating for her daughter on the SATs. Singer ran a college prep business, and helped wealthy parents cheat on standardized tests for their children. He also bribed college coaches to designate children falsely as recruited athletes, smoothing their path to admission, a criminal complaint says. Felicity Huffman's Netflix film won't release in April as scheduled Huffman and Singer exchanged emails about how to get extra time on her daughter's SAT, the complaint says. They arranged for Huffman's daughter to take the SAT at a location controlled by an administrator bribed by Singer, the complaint says. The daughter got a score of 1420 out of a maximum 1600 on the SAT, about 400 points over her Preliminary SAT exam a year earlier. Does she plan to plead guilty? Yes. As a result, federal prosecutors said they will recommend incarceration at the ""low end"" of the sentencing range, a $20,000 fine and 12 months of supervised release, according to a plea agreement. Prosecutors recommended a range of sentences for those pleading guilty, from 12 to 18 months. A federal judge will have the final say on the outcome for Huffman and the other defendants. In addition to lower sentencing, prosecutors will not bring further charges, the plea agreement says. What has she said about the alleged scandal? She issued an apology and took responsibility for her actions, saying her daughter was not aware of the payment. She said she had betrayed her daughter and wouldn't make any excuses for breaking the law. ""I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done ... and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,"" she said in a statement. ""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly."" Felicity Huffman will plead guilty to paying $15,000 to facilitate cheating for her daughter on the SAT. How much prison time is she facing? It's unclear whether a guilty plea will mean no time in prison. Prosecutors plan to seek a sentence of four to 10 months' jail time, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. Huffman is due back in court on May 21 for a sentencing hearing. The actress and the other defendants are facing anywhere between six to 21 months in prison if convicted or if they plead guilty, but the exact sentence will depend on several factors, a law enforcement source told CNN. Has the fallout affected her acting career? A Netflix comedy film starring Huffman won't be hitting the streaming platform on April 26, its previously scheduled release date. ""Otherhood"" is about three mothers who move from the suburbs to New York so they can reconnect with their children. While it is not uncommon for film release dates to shift, news of the film's pushback came a day after the ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""American Crime"" actress entered her plea in the college admissions scam. Lori Loughlin What is she accused of? Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying $500,000 to a fake charity to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew recruits. Their daughters did not participate in the sport. Does she plan to plead guilty? Loughlin and her husband both pleaded not guilty to two conspiracy charges in the college admissions scandal, according to federal court filings. Loughlin and 15 other parents face a charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering in addition to last month's charge of conspiracy to commit fraud. They were charged last Tuesday in a superseding indictment with conspiring to launder bribes and other payments through Singer's charity, prosecutors said. The added charges came a day after Huffman and others agreed to plead guilty in the case. Loughlin's attorneys did not engage in substantial plea discussions, according to a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation. It's not too late, however, for those negotiations to still take place, the source said. CNN has reached out to Loughlin's counsel for comment. Lori Loughlin and her husband are accused of paying $500,000 to get their daughters into USC. What has she said about the alleged scandal? Not much. Late last month, the actress was caught on video by paparazzi in Los Angeles and said she was sorry, but she couldn't talk about her legal issues. ""You can follow me around all day if you want, but I just can't comment right now,"" Loughlin said. ""But thank you for your time."" How much prison time is she facing? The charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud are punishable by a maximum 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. The charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering is punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, according to federal officials. Has the fallout affected her acting career? The ""Full House"" actress was dropped by the Hallmark Channel and other brands in the wake of last month's charges. Sephora also ended a makeup partnership with her daughter, the social media influencer Olivia Jade, who was a student at USC."

Benioff and his fellow ""Game of Thrones"" showrunner Dan Weiss talked to Entertainment Weekly about their show's forthcoming series finale. The eighth and final season starts Sunday and viewers have already started theorizing about, and agonizing over, how it will all conclude. Benioff told EW ""From the beginning, we've talked about how the show would end."" ""A good story isn't a good story if you have a bad ending,"" he said. ""Of course we worry."" Read More 'Game of Thrones' releases behind-the-scenes videos Benioff talked about how hotly debated the ending of ""The Sopranos"" (with the screen cutting to black) was when it aired in 2007. ""I've gotten into a lot of arguments with people about why that was a great ending, but people felt legitimately cheated and that's their right to feel that way, just as it's my right to feel like they're idiots,"" he said.

Barr reviewing origins of FBI's Russia investigation - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Laura Jarrett,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/barr-doj-investiation-fbi-russia/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General William Barr suggested to lawmakers Wednesday that Donald Trump 's presidential campaign was spied on, saying he will be looking into the ""genesis"" of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation that began in 2016 of potential ties between the campaign and the Russian government.
Barr returns to Capitol Hill, where he'll face more Mueller questions ""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,"" Barr said, echoing some of the more inflammatory claims lobbed by the President for months, but declining to elaborate on his concerns. ""I think spying did occur."" He did not provide evidence for his claims. The news will likely be viewed as a welcome development to the President, who has regularly called for an investigation and, as recently as last week, told reporters more should be done to examine the origins of the Russia probe. It will also likely raise concerns of politicization of the Department of Justice's work at an already tense time, as Democrats worry that Barr is bending to the President's demands and have called on Barr to release an unredacted version of the special counsel's confidential report on the Russia investigation to Congress. Read More Congressional Democrats fumed Wednesday over Barr's statements, accusing the attorney general of mischaracterizing the FBI's counterintelligence investigation in an effort to please Trump. ""I'm amazed that the AG would make that kind of statement, I think it's in many ways disrespectful to the men and women who work in the DOJ, and it shows, I think, either a lack of understanding or willful ignorance on what goes into a counterintelligence investigation,"" Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN. ""These comments directly contradict what DOJ previously told us,"" tweeted House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, who authorized the subpoena for the Mueller report. ""I've asked DOJ to brief us immediately."" Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who served in the Obama administration, told CNN's Anderson Cooper Wednesday night that Barr's statement was ""both stunning and scary."" Yet, according to a source familiar with his thinking, when Barr spoke of ""spying"" on the Trump campaign, he meant it in the ""classic sense"" of intelligence collection. He doesn't view the term as ""pejorative,"" the source said. When asked if Barr used the word ""spy"" to throw a bit of red meat toward conspiracy theorists who voiced concerns over surveillance tactics, the person said flatly: ""no."" The source emphasized repeatedly that Barr is focused on whether there was proper ""predication"" for any surveillance -- something he stated publicly at Wednesday's hearing. Barr's own review of the FBI's counterintelligence work, first reported by Bloomberg and confirmed by a US official to CNN, was briefly touched on during his House appropriations hearing, but the attorney general went further during Wednesday's Senate appropriations hearing explaining his reasoning. ""For the same reason we're worried about foreign influence in elections, I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,"" Barr said. I'm not suggesting those rules were violated but I think it's important to look at. . . . I think it's my obligation."" He added that he's not launching a full blown investigation into the FBI and and does not view it as a problem that is ""endemic"" to the FBI, but has in mind some colleagues to help him ""pull all this information together, and letting me know if there are some areas that should be looked at."" Trump said Wednesday morning that Barr was doing a ""great job"" and ""getting started on going back to the origins on where exactly this all started because it was an illegal witch hunt."" ""This was an attempted coup, this was an attempted takedown of a president,"" Trump said. The US official told CNN that Barr's review is separate from the ongoing work being conducted by the Justice Department's internal watchdog, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, but could not detail its precise scope nor explain how the work of US Attorney John Huber, who was also tasked with investigating surveillance matters, factors in at this stage. Barr did not elaborate further. In March 2018, amid calls by Republican lawmakers for a second special counsel to investigate how the Russia investigation began, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions revealed that Huber was looking into allegations that the FBI abused its powers in surveilling former Trump foreign policy aide Carter Page among other issues. At the same time, Horowitz's office confirmed it would ""review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source"" and ""review the DOJ's and FBI's relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court) applications."" Yet those efforts by Sessions to appease Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill appeared less than sufficient at the time. Trump claimed on Twitter that the inspector general was the wrong person to probe possible FISA abuse, calling the move ""disgraceful."" Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 28, 2018 Barr said Tuesday he expected Horowitz's review will be completed in ""May or June."" This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday."
UK economy just got a surprise lift from Brexit stockpiling - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Ivana Kottasová,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/economy/uk-economy-brexit-stockpiling/index.html,"London (CNN Business) The struggling UK economy is getting a boost from Brexit stockpiling.
UK GDP grew 0.3% in the three months to the end of February, the Office for National Statistics said Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting an expansion of 0.2%. Economists said the faster pace of growth was partly due to manufacturing businesses stockpiling materials and parts that would be harder to acquire if Britain crashes out of the European Union. The Office for National Statistics said that it had seen evidence that manufacturers were engaged in stockpiling as the original Brexit deadline approached. UK politicians have still not agreed a deal that would prevent a disorderly Brexit, which could lead to lengthy delays at the country's borders. The latest deadline to avoid leaving the European Union without a deal is Friday. The 10 most dire warnings from business on Brexit Read More Economists expect there was even more stockpiling last month ahead of the original Brexit date of March 29. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club, pointed to a survey that showed manufacturing activity spiked to its highest level in 13 months in March. ""It got a substantial lift from producers and their clients stockpiling inputs and finished products at a record rate to guarantee their supplies in case of a disruptive Brexit,"" he said. Some companies, including the drugmakers Sanofi ( GCVRZ ) and Novartis ( NVS ) , said they would stockpile treatments in the United Kingdom ahead of Brexit. Select food suppliers and supermarkets have said the same. Prime Minister Theresa May is traveling to Brussels on Wednesday to ask the European Union for yet another Brexit delay. The 10 most dire warnings from business on Brexit The UK economy has suffered because of prolonged uncertainty over Brexit. A weak housing market, slumping autos production, declining investment and downbeat executives all suggest that nearly three years of confusion over Brexit is causing the economy to stagnate. ""By normal standards, a 0.3% expansion would be considered quite feeble,"" said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics."
Would you eat cow's stomach or pig's feet to save the planet? - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Isabelle Gerretsen and Stephanie Bailey, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/health/meat-offal-emissions-climate-intl/index.html,"(CNN) How often do you eat meat? Once a week? Every day?
If it's the latter, your diet is having a huge impact on the planet. You've probably heard that the best way to fight climate change is to reduce your meat intake , but if you're not ready to go full vegan, a new study has found that you can slash polluting emissions by swapping your steak for animal organs. The meat industry accounts for 14.5% of total global greenhouse gas emissions, more than the transport sector's direct carbon output . Cattle products are particularly harmful, as cows produce huge amounts of noxious methane -- a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide -- when they burp or pass gas. Read More Despite growing awareness of its negative environmental impacts, we are producing and eating more meat than ever . We're eating more beef than ever -- but at what cost? Nose to tail eating But even meat-lovers can help slash emissions by cutting down on meat waste and adopting a ""nose to tail"" diet , which aims to use every part of the animal. According to a study published in the Environmental Science and Technology journal, swapping beef ribs and pork chops for offal, internal organs and pig's trotters could lead to a drastic reduction in emissions. How far will you go to reduce your beef intake? The study on Germany's meat supply chain found that while reducing total meat consumption could see emissions fall by 32%, eating more offal instead of popular cuts could also lead to a significant reduction. If 50% less offal was thrown away during the slaughtering process and consumed as food instead, emissions could fall by 14%, according to lead author Professor Gang Liu of the University of Southern Denmark. Combat climate change by cutting beef and lamb production There is ""huge potential [to lower emissions] by eating more byproducts and reducing waste along the supply chain,"" Liu said. New 'planetary health diet' can save lives and the planet, major review suggests He said that the nose to tail diet was a more effective mitigation strategy than one aimed at ""turning the [entire] global population vegetarian."" ""This way you could use meat more efficiently,"" he said, adding that in many Asian countries eating meat byproducts, such as tripe and lungs, is common.

A police chase ensued and one of the gunmen was shot death. He was found to have been armed with an assault weapon, a grenade and a magazine of bullets, according to media reports from the scene. ""During the pursuit on a secondary road, the perpetrators exchanged fire with the police, and during this exchange one of the perpetrators lost his life,"" police said.

Austrian Airlines spokeswoman Tanja Gruber told CNN that the airline was ""glad that neither passengers nor crew were hurt during the incident."" ""Safety is our top priority at Austrian Airlines and as a first measure we decided to stop the transport of valuable cargo to and from Tirana airport,"" she said.

Oregon could be the next state to OK sending electoral votes to winner of the popular vote - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Devan Cole,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/oregon-electoral-college-popular-vote/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Oregon could become the next state to join a compact pledging to devote its electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote in future presidential elections if enough states sign on.
The state's Senate passed a bill calling for Oregon to join the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, which more than a dozen states and the District of Columbia have already entered into. The states will not shift their vote allocations until their combined electoral votes equal 270, enough to decide a presidential election. Currently, the number stands at 189, and Oregon has seven electoral votes. The bill, which passed the state Senate 17 to 12, now heads to Oregon's House for consideration. Should it pass, it would be up to Democratic Gov. Kate Brown to either sign the bill into law or veto it. Brown's spokesperson, Nikki Fisher, told CNN on Wednesday that the governor supports the proposal and she ""has always believed that every vote matters."" Last week, New Mexico joined the compact, which was already adopted by California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and the District of Columbia. Read More Democratic senator introduces constitutional amendment to abolish Electoral College In a statement released Tuesday, National Popular Vote, the group pushing for states to adopt the compact, praised the move by Oregon's state Senate. ""This is the fully constitutional way to ensure that every voter is politically relevant in every presidential election while preserving the Electoral College as the founders intended,"" John Koza, the group's chairman, said. The Electoral College has increasingly come under fire from progressives since the 2016 election when President Donald Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton but won a majority of the Electoral College votes. The system has already become a topic of conversation in the 2020 election. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who's running for the Democratic presidential nomination, announced at a CNN town hall last month that she would like to eliminate the system. Other candidates have said the same."
Black hole photos: This is the first image of a black hole,edition.cnn.com,Ashley Strickland,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/world/black-hole-photo-scn/index.html,"(CNN) In April 2017, scientists used a global network of telescopes to see and capture the first-ever picture of a black hole, according to an announcement by researchers at the National Science Foundation Wednesday morning. They captured an image of the supermassive black hole and its shadow at the center of a galaxy known as M87.
This is the first direct visual evidence that black holes exist, the researchers said. In the image, a central dark region is encapsulated by a ring of light that looks brighter on one side. The massive galaxy, called Messier 87 or M87, is near the Virgo galaxy cluster 55 million light-years from Earth. The supermassive black hole has a mass that is 6.5 billion times that of our sun. ""We have seen what we thought was unseeable,"" said Sheperd Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. ""We have seen and taken a picture of a black hole."" The black hole image captured by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration, called EHT, is a global network of telescopes that captured the first-ever photograph of a black hole. More than 200 researchers were involved in the project. They have worked for more than a decade to capture this. The project is named for the event horizon, the proposed boundary around a black hole that represents the point of no return where no light or radiation can escape. Read More In their attempt to capture an image of a black hole, scientists combined the power of eight radio telescopes around the world using Very-Long-Baseline-Interferometry, according to the European Southern Observatory, which is part of the EHT. This effectively creates a virtual telescope around the same size as the Earth itself. The telescopes involved in creating the global array included ALMA, APEX, the IRAM 30-meter telescope, the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, the Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano, the Submillimeter Array, the Submillimeter Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. Stephen Hawking paper on black holes and 'soft hair' released ""The observations were a coordinated dance in which we simultaneously pointed our telescopes in a carefully planned sequence,"" said Daniel Marrone, associate professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona. ""To make sure these observations were truly simultaneous, so that we could see the same wavefront of light as it landed on each telescope, we used extremely precise atomic clocks at each of the telescopes."" The telescope array collected 5,000 trillion bytes of data over two weeks, which was processed through supercomputers so that the scientists could retrieve the images. Details of the observation were published in a series of six research papers published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters . What are black holes? Black holes are made up of huge amounts of matter squeezed into a small area, according to NASA , creating a massive gravitational field which draws in everything around it, including light. They also have a way of super-heating the material around them and warping spacetime. Material accumulates around black holes, is heated to billions of degrees and reaches nearly the speed of light. Light bends around the gravity of the black hole, which creates the photon ring seen in the image. The imaging methods used to capture the photo reveal that the supermassive black hole has a ring-like structure and a shadow, which is represented by a dark central region. Astronomers have found the fastest-growing black hole ever seen, and it's got a monster appetite ""If immersed in a bright region, like a disc of glowing gas, we expect a black hole to create a dark region similar to a shadow -- something predicted by Einstein's general relativity that we've never seen before,"" said Heino Falcke, chair of the EHT Science Council. ""This shadow, caused by the gravitational bending and capture of light by the event horizon, reveals a lot about the nature of these fascinating objects and allowed us to measure the enormous mass of M87's black hole."" The visual confirmation of black holes acts as confirmation of Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity . In the theory, Einstein predicted that dense, compact regions of space would have such intense gravity that nothing could escape them. But if heated materials in the form of plasma surround the black hole and emit light, the event horizon could be visible. ""Once we were sure we had imaged the shadow, we could compare our observations to extensive computer models that include the physics of warped space, superheated matter and strong magnetic fields. Many of the features of the observed image match our theoretical understanding surprisingly well,"" said Paul T.P. Ho, EHT Board member and director of the East Asian Observatory. ""This makes us confident about the interpretation of our observations, including our estimation of the black hole's mass."" These are the first massive black holes from the early universe M87's black hole has an enormous mass, which gave researchers reason to believe it may be the largest viewable black hole from Earth. Relative to other objects, supermassive black holes are actually small. This is why they couldn't be observed before. Black hole size is directly related to mass. The larger the black hole, the larger the shadow. And black holes may seem invisible, but the way they interact with the material around them is the giveaway, the researchers said. ""Black holes have sparked imaginations for decades,"" said National Science Foundation director France Córdova. ""They have exotic properties and are mysterious to us. Yet with more observations like this one they are yielding their secrets. This is why NSF exists. We enable scientists and engineers to illuminate the unknown, to reveal the subtle and complex majesty of our universe."""
Kirsten Gillibrand is a human being who admits mistakes (opinion),edition.cnn.com,Jill Filipovic,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/opinions/kirsten-gillibrand-town-hall-filipovic/index.html,"Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in Washington and the author of the book "" The H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness.

(CNN) On Tuesday night, America was introduced to an unfamiliar woman: Kirsten Gillibrand, actual human being.
Jill Filipovic Gillibrand has been in politics for more than a decade, and her identity is more often caricatured (she's Hillary Jr., she's Tracy Flick , she's the woman who brought down Al Franken) than captured. Her CNN town hall on Tuesday was a chance for her to present herself to the many who may have only heard about her in outline. What she filled in: that she's a person who, like all of us, evolves and shifts; that she can be deeply empathetic and flatly indignant; that she's fluent in policy and has a message of fighting greed and knitting the country back together. In a political environment increasingly defined by overconfidence, unflinching certitude and uncompromising fidelity to a specific worldview, Gillibrand expressed caution and even remorse when she was uncertain. She said some of her decisions as a Congresswoman from a red district in upstate New York (from 2007-2009) now bring her shame -- a striking departure from the usual non-apology political justifications.

Why Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand loves 'Wonder Woman' 01:06 Where she was undecided or unsure on an issue -- something that came up in questions about mandatory vaccines and lowering the voting age to 16 -- she simply said so, rather than offering a winding non-answer. And when she knew, she knew: Gillibrand's policy solutions were detailed and clearly at the heart of her case. When she was asked about the role of private insurers in her vision of Medicare for All, she emphasized her role in crafting the transition section of Bernie Sanders's bill, explaining how broad Medicare benefits will essentially undercut insurance companies and naturally drive them from the marketplace. Read More She compared the Green New Deal to going to the moon: an exciting and perhaps preposterously ambitious plan, but one that is doable with dedication and resources -- and could even include, she said, getting to net-zero carbon. This is the striking thing about Gillibrand: she comes across as a human being who learns, changes, and is sometimes still making up her mind. But she's also a very particular kind of human being: sharp and determined, the kind of bull-headed lawyer whose personal inclination appears to be making her case without messing around with niceties. For a female politician in an ""is she likable?"" obsessed media landscape, this can be a liability. JUST WATCHED Gillibrand explains why she flip-flopped on immigration Replay More Videos ...

Gillibrand explains why she flip-flopped on immigration 01:01 And so Gillibrand is also trying to be liked. At her town hall, she recited a similar ""thanks for your bravery"" line to multiple questioners. Throughout her campaign, she has put maternity at the forefront, emphasizing her desire to make the world better and safer for her sons. Personally, I like bull-headed, get-stuff-done-and-forget-your-feelings Gillibrand. But that's not exactly a winning persona for a woman in a sexist country, and so last night she led with Empathetic Kirsten. And good for her. Much of her work, especially on sexual assault, has clearly been driven by empathy, it just hasn't necessarily come across in the coverage. As a senator, she led the charge on combating sexual assault in the military and on college campuses, truly owning the issue and lending her platform to vulnerable men and women. But she found herself better known for being one of several senators who called on Al Franken to resign after he was accused of sexual misconduct, and inappropriate photos surfaced of him that appeared to show him pretending to grope a sleeping woman. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand: Americans deserve a brave president Despite the fact that her decision to hold Franken accountable was exactly in line with her policy positions, many Franken sympathizers accused her of trampling his due process to put herself in the spotlight. And despite the fact that several other members of the senate also called for his resignation, Gillibrand took the heat for being an early voice. On Tuesday night, given a chance to show a fuller version of herself to America, Gillibrand leaned into her own complications. And in doing so, she helped expand, just a little more, the idea of who a woman in politics can be."

Josephson, a 21-year-old student at the school, was found dead last month after she got into a vehicle that she thought was her Uber ride. Josephson's parents will also be in attendance at the graduation, CNN affiliate WOLO reports. Josephson had called for an Uber around 2 a.m. March 29 in Columbia outside a bar.

British MEPs stuck in limbo amid Brexit uncertainty - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Bianca Britton,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/uk/brexit-mep-contracts-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) A British member of the European Parliament says he is uncertain whether he and his team will have jobs beyond Friday, with the UK still at risk of crashing out of the EU without a deal
Labour MEP Seb Dance says he is stuck in limbo because his contract expires on April 12 -- the date Britain is currently due to leave the European Union -- meaning he can't plan for anything beyond then. As a result, he says he and his team have been blocked from booking travel and accommodation to attend a session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg next week, because under British and EU law, they will technically no longer be employed. May to ask Merkel and Macron for a Brexit extension as Parliament votes to block no-deal ""It's not great for blood pressure,"" Dance told CNN. ""I'm not going to pretend we're having a great time with the uncertainty."" He said he and his staff went through the same issues last time a Brexit date loomed, on March 29. Read More ""We suspected the [European] Council would grant the extension because we knew of the request the week before, but we obviously had no guarantee -- so it's exactly the same this week,"" he said. Labour MEP Seb Dance told CNN he and his team have struggled to book travel and accomodation in order to attend parliamentary sessions because of Brexit. May says she wants to extend the Brexit deadline to June 30 -- a date rejected by the EU when the UK last sought a postponement -- to give her more time to break the political impasse in London. The EU is expected to hand down its decision later on Wednesday after the remaining 27 member states attend an emergency meeting in Brussels. At this stage, it's unclear whether the EU will grant her the extension she has requested, or give a longer delay. British Prime Minister Theresa May is asking the EU for a delay to Brexit until June 30. James Franey, a parliamentary assistant to Conservative MEP Daniel Dalton, is more relaxed about the situation, saying his team's contracts ""will be extended in the event of Article 50 being extended,"" and adding that they would wait to book travel to Strasbourg over ""the next couple of days,"" once the situation is clearer. Uncertainty around EU elections Should May's request for an extension be granted, it also raises questions over Britain's role in the upcoming elections to the European Parliament . British MEPs were not expected to contest their seats, since Brexit was originally scheduled to have happened on March 29. Given the earlier postponement, and ongoing uncertainty, the UK government has begun preparations to enable the country to participate in the elections. In a letter to Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, May said the UK government ""accepts the European Council's view"" that it would be under a legal obligation to hold elections to the European Parliament if it wants an extension beyond May 22. But she said that if a deal was reached before then, the elections would be canceled. UK lays groundwork to participate in European Parliament elections Dance says that even if elections do go ahead, if the UK leaves the EU on June 30, ""new MEPs won't even take their seats because the parliament doesn't sit again until the 1st of July formally."" ""So you could have new MEPs being elected who don't ever sit which is slightly tragic,"" he said. Dance added that if a longer extension was granted and they were able to sit, there would be an ""obvious question mark"" over how British MEPs can make their voices heard, when the UK is still supposed to be leaving the bloc at some point. ""The worry I have is that we do come back, which is great, but because Brexit is still a thing -- it's never quite going away -- the ability for British MEPs to exert influence, which we've managed quite effectively for the last two and a bit years, could be quite difficult."" MEPs at a European Parliament session in Strasbourg in 2018. Some MEPs are torn as to whether they should even stand in the elections. David Campbell Bannerman, a Conservative MEP since 2009, announced on Tuesday that he would not run again, because it would ""be dishonorable for me personally."" ""I strongly believe it is entirely wrong and counterproductive for these elections to be held at all. With nearly three years since the Referendum ... the British people are angrily demanding that the result be honored and Brexit be delivered,"" Bannerman said in a statement. I have issued a statement just now on my decision not to contest the MEP elections. It would be dishonourable of me to do so. I am most grateful for the support of local activists and for the honour of representing the East of England for nearly 10 years https://t.co/WeGPDvYKSb
— David C Bannerman (@DCBMEP) April 9, 2019 Charles Tannock, another Conservative MEP -- who was first elected in 1999 and backs a second Brexit referendum -- has somberly reflected on his time in Brussels and Strasbourg coming to an end. ""Many goodbyes to make but might still be an MEP next week for last Strasbourg session of this parliament to make final goodbyes,"" he wrote on Twitter . ""So much uncertainty for so many of us but all will be clear this week I hope."" No-deal Brexit 'will be chaos' Unless the EU agrees to a delay, the UK will leave without a deal on Friday, April 12 -- a scenario that business leaders and economists have warned would trigger chaos. Dance says if that happens, his intention is to stay in Brussels, at least in the short term. Theresa May gambles it all in last-ditch bid to deliver Brexit ""I think no deal will be so bad for a whole range of reasons,"" he said. ""I mean we're going to be talking about instant shortages of fresh food. It's absurd, but that's what will happen."" ""It will be chaos. I don't want to be subject to that chaos from a personal point of view. I'd prefer to be here."" Amid the uncertainty though, Dance says increased likelihood that Brexit could fall apart entirely is what's keeping him and his team going. ""The adrenaline of maybe actually killing this thing [Brexit] is probably getting us through, in the sense that I've always thought Brexit is full of contradictions that would expose themselves eventually and I think they finally are,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we're on the road to it dying."" A newspaper with a Brexit-focused headline is seen next to a MEP attending a debate in Parliament. While uncertainty is often part and parcel of a job in politics, Dance says it's not just MEPs' futures that are in limbo. ""People who work in the commission -- the Brits -- some of whom who have been there for years and years, would expect to be in much more higher power positions were it not for the fact they're British,"" he said. ""I think all of that has caused a lot of people to live in a sort of limbo and uncertainty for a very long period of time and it's not good for well-being."""

""The use of Warner Bros.' score from The Dark Knight Rises in the campaign video was unauthorized,"" the entertainment company said in a statement Tuesday. ""We are working through the appropriate legal channels to have it removed."" CNN and Warner Bros. share a parent company, WarnerMedia, which is owned by AT&T. On Tuesday, President Donald Trump tweeted the two-minute video with the caption ""Make America Great Again."" The video has since been taken down ""in response to a report by the copyright owner."" A campaign aide told CNN's Jim Acosta that the Trump campaign did not make the video.

He also accused the company of ""positioning themselves as a weapon of the left."" The video included highlights of Trump's presidency interwoven with clips of his critics, including politicians like former President Barack Obama and his 2016 opponent Hillary Clinton as well as Hollywood celebrities, such as Rosie O'Donnell and Amy Schumer. The video plays to what appears to be the theme song from ""The Dark Knight Rises"" over the shots."
"Pastor knew it was dangerous, but after Louisiana fires, he felt he had no choice but to sleep in his church - CNN",edition.cnn.com,Eliott C. McLaughlin,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/black-church-fires/index.html,"Opelousas, Louisiana (CNN) As arson investigators worked to find out who has been setting Louisiana churches ablaze, the Rev. Dwight Brown slept in his church two nights last week, he said Wednesday.

I couldn't take that chance."" Brown asked that CNN not divulge the name of his church, for fear that it could become a target, but it sits near two of the three churches that burned in recent weeks in St. Landry Parish, about an hour's drive west of Baton Rouge. Firefighters respond to a fire at Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas on Thursday. Police say three black churches were intentionally torched over a 10-day span: St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre on March 26, Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas on April 2 and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church on Thursday. Officials are also investigating a fourth, smaller fire on March 31 at the predominantly white Vivian United Pentecostal Church in Caddo Parish, more than 200 miles north of St. Landry. The blaze was intentionally set, officials said. Read More Brown, a law enforcement officer, attended services at his church for more than three decades before becoming pastor there.

Brown stopped sleeping in his church over the weekend, after taking precautions to safeguard it, including removing the church's sign and installing cameras inside the church and at its entrance. He also stops in every night and turns on a light, and members of his congregation have begun walking by the church during the day and giving each other updates, he said. More questions than answers It is still unclear who is responsible for the fires and will likely take investigators time to sift through what evidence remains to determine if the blazes are connected. ""We believe these three fires are suspicious,"" State Fire Marshal Butch Browning said. ""We are falling short of talking about what caused the fires, falling short of saying they are related, however cognizant that there is a problem and no coincidence that there are three fires."" Residents and worshipers in St. Landry Parish, where all three fires occurred, are withholding judgment about what may have caused them, even as officials say they contained ""suspicious elements"" and the episodes evoke recollections of past acts of hate against black churches. A firefighter stands outside the door to Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church on Thursday. ""I feel our district was being targeted because all three of the churches were in our district,"" Pastor Freddie Jack, the Seventh District Missionary Baptist Association president, said Monday. The NAACP labeled the fires ""domestic terrorism,"" adding the ""spike in church burnings in Southern states is a reflection of the emboldened racial rhetoric and tension spreading across the country."" St. Landry Parish is nearly 42% black. Opelousas is 75% black. The city's mayor, Julius Alsandor, called the church burnings ""hideous."" ""The relevance and the impact on the people in the surrounding communities and especially the congregation of each of these churches, it's hurtful and there may be some fear that is being exhibited by those who are a part of the three churches,"" he said.

He also declined a bonus that measures Marriott's success against that of its competitors. And his salary did not increase last year. Still, Sorenson took home about $12.9 million in pay, including $1.3 million in salary, a $2.9 million cash bonus and $8.4 million in stock awards. He also received nearly $256,000 in other benefits, including complimentary rooms, food and beverages at the company's hotels and the use of golf and spa facilities while on personal travel. That compares to total compensation of $13.3 million in the previous year. Arne Sorenson The data breach , which Marriott revealed in November, affected the reservation database of Starwood, a group of hotels Marriott bought in 2016 that includes the St. Regis, Westin, Sheraton and W Hotels. Read More Marriott is being sued by its customers over the hack, and it hasn't yet estimated how much the breach will cost the company. Morgan Stanley analysts suggested in December that the company could end up paying $200 million in legal fees and fines, as well as spending $1 per customer to notify them of the hack. That could cost upward of $700 million. Other estimates put the figure as high as $1 billion, but Marriott Chief Financial Officer Leeny Oberg told Bloomberg those forecasts were premature. While Sorenson's salary did not increase, the rest of the company's C-Suite got 3% pay raises. Marriott justified the increases by citing its stock performance and saying that the hack did not materially hurt its bottom line. Shares in Marriott have increased 9% since the hack. That lags the 14% gain for rival Hilton ( HLT ) during the same period, but is better than a 5% decline for Hyatt ( H ) . A spokesperson for Marriott ( MAR ) said in a statement that the company's compensation reflects its performance and is set by independent board members. Separately, Symantec reported Wednesday that the hospitality industry is still susceptible to attacks. Hotel booking sites in particular leak personal information, the security company said. Two in three booking sites inadvertently leak booking reference codes to third-party sites, including advertisers. With that information, the third-parties could log into a reservation, cancel a booking or view a customer's personal details. The advertisers would be able to view people's names, email addresses, home addresses, phone numbers, the last four digits of their credit card numbers and passport numbers. That's the same kind of data that Marriott's breach exposed."
Trump repeats claim he won't release his taxes while he's under audit - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Betsy Klein,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/donald-trump-taxes-release-audit/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump continues to hold the line on refusing to release his tax returns.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee's deadline for the IRS to turn over six years of his personal and business tax returns, Trump said: ""I won't do it."" ""There is no law, as you know, I got elected last time with the same issue and while I'm under audit, I won't do it. If I'm not under audit, I would do it, I have no problem with it, but while I'm under audit, I would not give my taxes,"" Trump said. Fact-checking Trump's claims he's under audit IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, appearing before a Senate Finance committee hearing on Wednesday, said that he is ""working with counsel and anticipating responding"" to the House request for Trump's returns. Rettig added that he has not either been directly or indirectly asked not to comply with Neal's request to turn over the returns from inside the White House or elsewhere. Read More He declined to answer questions after the hearing about his plans for responding to Neal. ""I am unable to discuss that with you at this moment,"" Rettig told CNN after the hearing. Technically, there's nothing preventing Trump from releasing his tax returns now. Most tax attorneys would typically advise a client against doing so if they're under audit to avoid further scrutiny. Once the tax returns are out, reporters could find something that the IRS missed. Of course, most tax attorneys don't represent presidents or people running for the White House. Regardless of those risks, past presidents released their tax returns while in office. Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush both did during their tenure. (But neither of them led a sprawling business empire like Trump, who is involved in approximately 500 corporate entities.) Trump suggested that ""frankly, the people don't care"" whether they see his tax returns, noting that he won in 2016 with the same audit issue and that he has released a 104-page summary of his assets and values. ""I built a great company, one of the best companies, I have some of the greatest assets in the world, I did a good job, and now, frankly, I don't care about them, I only care about the United States,"" Trump said Wednesday. ""But I have no obligation to do that while I'm under audit. And no lawyer would tell you to release your tax returns while you're under audit."""
Bernie Sanders' truly awful answer on his newfound millionaire status - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/bernie-sanders-taxes-millionaire/index.html,"(CNN) Bernie Sanders is (finally) going to release his tax returns. But questions over how he handles his wealth in the context of his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination remain. And the early returns should be concerning to Sanders' backers.
In an interview with The New York Times on Tuesday , Sanders said that ""April 15 is coming,"" adding, ""We wanted to release 10 years of tax returns. April 15, 2019, will be the 10th year, so I think you will see them."" (Sanders, despite effectively running for president without pause since 2015, has released only a single year's tax return, for 2014 .) THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!

Reminded by the Times reporter that he is now someone of considerable means, Sanders retorted: ""I wrote a best-selling book. If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too."" Uh, what? Sanders got a pass on some of his acerbic-ness during the 2016 presidential campaign because a) most people didn't think he could win and b) others found it part of his cantankerous but righteous personality. But let's think about that campaign for another minute. Close your eyes and imagine if Hillary Clinton, who beat Sanders for the Democratic nomination, when asked about the extent of her wealth, said ""I wrote a best-selling book. If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too."" Read More Bernie Sanders' fundraising is just the latest sign of his top-tier status She would have been pilloried! People would have blasted Clinton for being out of touch with the average person who, obvi, doesn't have the opportunity to write a book -- best-selling or not. Telling the average middle-class American that they too can be rich if they only write a best-selling book is like telling them that if they would just star in a movie then they could be a big star, too. Yes, it's true. No, for almost everyone, it's not realistic. In 2016, Clinton was the frontrunner -- and most of the attention and energy in the political media was focused on her. But now Sanders is one of the frontrunners. Which means that he simply cannot be as dismissive, curt or out-of-touch as his ""write a best-selling book"" comments come off. Then there is the broader problem of Sanders' wealth as it relates to his core campaign message that ""millionaires and billionaires"" have cornered far too much wealth and power in this country -- and need to be reined in by a more activist federal government. Now that Sanders is one of those ""millionaires and billionaires,"" it could complicate that message -- and his appeal as the underfunded outsider taking on the monied interested in Washington. Faiz Shakir, Sanders' campaign manager, told CNN on Tuesday night that the senator ""believes in opportunity for all, and the fact that he is somebody who has personally benefited from that opportunity is something that he feels should be a shared opportunity with everyone else. He's made some money off a book. And I think that the opportunity that he has had is evaporating for so many others. He feels that strongly."" Sanders, talking to the Times, tried to draw a line between himself and the likes of President Donald Trump, a self-described billionaire. ""Not being a billionaire, not having investments in Saudi Arabia, wherever he has investments, all over the world, mine will be a little bit more boring,"" Sanders said of his returns when compared to those of Trump's. (The President has never released any of his tax returns and pledged again Wednesday morning that he is under no obligation to do so.) On the most practical level, Sanders is right. He isn't as rich as Trump. There's a big difference between a millionaire and a billionaire. And there's no reason that someone who is wealthy can't speak powerfully about the economic plight of the less fortunate and the deeply negative impact the wealthiest of Americans are having on society. But this is politics. And the combination of Sanders now being a member of the economic strata he has long derided and his totally tone-deaf answer on how he got there spells at least the potential for trouble down the line for the Vermont senator. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correctly state that Sanders released his full 2014 tax return during the 2016 campaign."
Politico: Trump criticizes George Washington for not better naming Mt. Vernon - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Maegan Vazquez,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/mount-vernon-donald-trump-emmanuel-macron/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump paid a visit to Mount Vernon last year with French President Emmanuel Macron, and according to new details relayed by associates to Politico , the experience was ""truly bizarre.""
Mount Vernon president and CEO Doug Bradburn, who led the tour, according to Politico, has told several people that the Macrons were far more knowledgeable about the history of Washington's compound than Trump seemed to be. On the tour, Trump reportedly learned about the first US president's real estate empire. But three sources briefed on the exchange told Politico that Trump didn't seem too impressed. ""If he was smart, he would've put his name on it,"" Trump said of Mount Vernon. ""You've got to put your name on stuff or no one remembers you."" Bradburn reminded Trump that Washington had succeeded in getting the nation's capital named after him. Trump reportedly replied that that was a good point and laughed, according to the publication. Read More Washington's real estate empire made him one of the wealthiest Americans of his time, but Trump asked whether the first US president was ""really rich."" When the guide spoke about Washington's wealth and real estate dealings, ""that is what Trump was really the most excited about,"" a person familiar with the tour told Politico. When shown the bed where Washington died from a throat infection, Trump reportedly felt the bedpost and said, it was ""a good bed to die in,"" three people briefed on the event told Politico. A spokesperson for Mount Vernon declined to comment on the article. ""Mount Vernon does not provide details about high-profile visits outside of the organization's public statements,"" the spokesperson said. In a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, a spokesperson for the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association said it was breaking traditional protocol of not commenting on high-profile visits because the association was ""concerned that the third-party accounts of the Trump-Macron visit released by several media outlets ... do not correctly reflect the events that transpired nearly a year ago."" ""During the tour, all parties were interested and engaged in the story of George Washington and his beloved home. Conversations touched on topics like business dealings, real estate, and related matters that were of relevance and interest to the touring parties, and questions were asked by both leaders with curiosity and respect,"" the statement said. The White House did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment."
Disney to test its power with new streaming service - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/media/disney-investor-day-2019-streaming/index.html," Disney's new streaming service will test Marvel's power, the reach of the ""Star Wars"" galaxy and the magic of animated classics spanning more than 80 years, coupled with the new-found bulk provided by its acquisition of Fox Entertainment assets.
The studio will play show-and-tell with investors on Thursday, amid what promises to be a banner year for Disney ( DIS ) at the box office -- thanks to ""Avengers,"" ""Toy Story"" and ""Star Wars"" sequels, as well as a new version of ""The Lion King"" -- and a major theme-park expansion with the opening of Star Wars Land sure to lengthen queue lines this spring. Disney is bringing 'Monsters, Inc.' TV series to streaming service Still, beyond those can't-miss projects, much of the intrigue surrounding the Mouse House's future revolves around its plans to introduce a streaming service this year, Disney+, as the major studios seek to fortify their positions against the challenge posed by Netflix ( NFLX ) as well as tech giants like Amazon ( AMZN ) , Google ( GOOG ) and most recently Apple ( AAPL ) in the content space. Absorbing Fox -- which has created its own layer of drama within the entertainment industry -- has left Disney uniquely positioned to mount such an effort. The deal strengthened what was already the entertainment industry's most enviable array of brands, with Fox's National Geographic among the announced Disney+ elements. (Disclosure: My wife works for a division of Disney.) Nevertheless, at the risk of mixing sci-fi metaphors, Disney CEO Robert Iger's determination to boldly explore this new frontier represents a leap into an arena that remains filled with unknowns. Read More If properties with avid fan bases serve as the linchpin of any subscription-driven service, the industry consensus is that nobody can match the arsenal that Disney possesses. Yet even that doesn't assure success with such a startup venture. Indeed, Disney has already witnessed warning signs, or at least experienced limitations, in leveraging its vast trove of intellectual property. ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" fell well short of box-office expectations, and most recently a live-action reboot of ""Dumbo"" is flying far below the stratospheric returns of ""Beauty and the Beast."" Star Wars: GalaxyÕs Edge will open in summer 2019 at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California, and fall 2019 at Disney's Hollywood Studios in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. (Disney Parks) There's also the issue of whether Disney and other studios will divert projects that would have played on and benefited other studio-owned assets -- such as networks like ABC, Disney Channel and Freeform -- to feed the streaming operation. That calculus, in terms of what shows premiere where, is by no means an exact science. In addition, Disney will be using its library to stock the new service's shelves. By ceasing to license content to Netflix, the company will forgo about $150 million in revenue this year, executives told investors in February. There's also the matter of how to integrate Disney+ with its other streaming platforms, including ESPN+ and the studio's controlling stake in Hulu. In an interview with Barron's , Iger said some decisions regarding which properties will get funneled toward Disney+ will be ""easy,"" such as producing mid-budget movies directly for the service, in contrast to the Marvel and Lucasfilm blockbusters. Disney CEO Bob Iger The emphasis in series is somewhat murkier, with a ""Star Wars"" spinoff, ""The Mandalorian,"" among the more eagerly anticipated titles being used to help launch the service. This week, the company also announced a series based on the hit movie ""Monsters Inc."" In that same interview, Iger conceded that building up the company's direct-to-consumer strategy would be a process, one that will initially require considerable investment against uncertain returns. ""We're looking for Wall Street to show some patience while we prove this out,"" he said. Disney has also sought to differentiate itself from Netflix, with Iger telling analysts last summer that Disney would use its marquee brands to be ""in the quality game,"" as opposed to emphasizing volume. Notably, Disney's past acquisitions were greeted with varying degrees of skepticism, only to pay off with a level of dominance in the theatrical world illustrated by the titles that the company is unleashing through 2019. That track record has bought Iger considerable goodwill among investors. At the same time, the studio faces questions not only in regard to streaming but also its longer-term succession plans, with the 68-year-old Iger having already extended his tenure three times, in the latest announcement through 2021. On most fronts, 2019 looks like a landmark year for Disney. The challenge now is how much fairy dust the studio has left to sprinkle on the streaming realm."
Wall Street Journal: Investigators in New York have 'gathered more evidence than previously known' in Trump hush money probe - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Devan Cole,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/investigators-hush-money-payments-trump/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Federal investigators in New York have ""gathered more evidence than previously known"" from individuals in the President's ""inner circle,"" related to the hush-money payments made to two women who claim they had affairs with President Donald Trump, Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
According to the paper, prosecutors in the Manhattan US Attorney's office interviewed Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director and longtime confidante of Trump, last spring and Keith Schiller, the President's longtime bodyguard. The paper also said investigators ""learned of calls"" between Schiller and David Pecker, the head of American Media Inc., the company that publishes the National Enquirer. Pecker worked with Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, to suppress potentially damaging claims made against candidate Trump by women, with AMI using a tabloid tactic called ""catch and kill."" Additionally, the Journal reported that investigators ""possess a recorded phone conversation"" between Cohen and a lawyer who represented the two women. Trump has denied having affairs with Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, and Karen McDougal. The paper said the investigators obtained information about Trump's involvement in the payments ""weeks before"" Cohen implicated the President in the scheme during a court appearance last year. Read More According to the Journal, during a previously reported raid of Cohen's home, office and hotel room last summer, investigators seized ""a recording of a September 2017 phone call"" between Cohen and Keith Davidson, Daniels' attorney at the time. The call, the paper said, ""was sparked by an inquiry to Mr. Davidson from a City National Bank client manager, asking about funds the lawyer had transferred"" to Daniels. Davidson, according to the paper, was ""worried that the bank's singling out of the payment might mean the transaction was under federal investigation,"" while Cohen, who had been recording the call, ""didn't indicate he was alarmed,"" the paper said. The Journal also said following the raid, investigators asked Hicks ""about her contacts"" with Pecker. They also asked ""at least one other witness"" about whether or not Hicks had ""coordinated"" with anyone at AMI as she was crafting a response to an inquiry from the Journal for a November 2016 story. The paper was working on a report about an AMI payment to McDougal for the rights to her story of an alleged affair with Trump. As for Schiller, the Journal said investigators ""were aware"" Schiller ""had spoken by phone"" to Pecker and were looking to find out if the bodyguard had ever given the phone to Trump. The Journal said it ""couldn't determine what investigators learned."""

Elizabeth Warren releases 2018 tax returns,edition.cnn.com,Devan Cole,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/elizabeth-warren-2018-tax-returns/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday released her 2018 tax returns, laying bare a key financial record the Democratic Party has made a political issue since President Donald Trump took the unusual step of withholding his own tax returns.
According to the returns, the Massachusetts Democrat and presidential hopeful reported an adjusted gross income of $846,394 in 2018 -- $324,687 of which came from writing. The documents said she paid $206,488 in federal taxes in 2018 and owed $24,477 in taxes for the year. Warren previously released 10 years of tax returns last August. The move to release her latest returns comes as questions continue to swirl about Trump's own returns and those belonging to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a fellow Democratic presidential candidate who has repeatedly promised to release the information ""soon."" Sanders, an independent who revealed Tuesday that his own book deals had made him a millionaire , is expected to release his returns on or before Monday, the tax filing deadline for 2018, according to his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir. In a statement, Warren touted anti-corruption legislation she introduced last year that would require elected officials and candidates for federal office to make public more robust information about their taxes and other financial dealings. Read More ""There's a crisis of faith in government -- and that's because the American people think the government works for the wealthy and well-connected, not for them. And they're right. I've put out eleven years of my tax returns because no one should ever have to guess who their elected officials are working for. Doing this should be law,"" Warren said. Her 2018 adjusted gross income was down from the previous year; her 2017 federal income tax filing showed she and her husband, Bruce Mann, who is a professor at Harvard Law School, reported a little more than $913,000 in adjusted gross income. Earlier this year, as Warren prepared to formally kick off her presidential bid, she filed her first financial disclosure report with the Federal Election Commission, which provided an early look at her finances. The documents showed that her assets, tucked away in retirement and investment accounts, range in value from $2.59 million and $8.38 million. She also has somewhere between $100,001 and $250,000 in her savings account at the First National Bank of Omaha and smaller amounts in savings and checking accounts at other financial institutions. According to the filing, she also received a $300,000 advance for her book, ""This Fight is Our Fight."""

2 teens on vacation were killed 46 years ago. An 80-year-old is now under arrest - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/cold-case-virginia-beach-80-year-old/index.html,"(CNN) Virginia Beach police have accused an 80-year-old New York man of killing two teens in a case that's gone unsolved for 46 years.
The double homicide dates to 1973, when Janice Pietropola and Lynn Seethaler , both 19, traveled from the Pittsburgh area to Virginia Beach to vacation. They were found dead on June 30 inside their oceanfront motel cottage, and their deaths were ruled homicides, police said. After an exhaustive investigation, the case went cold, police said. The cottage where the teens were slain was destroyed, then rebuilt into motels and shops. Last fall, Virginia Beach Police cold case investigators, working with the local prosecutor, began to aggressively research a strong lead in the case, police said. Police on Monday arrested the accused killer: Ernest Broadnax of New York. He was arrested in New York and charged with two counts of second-degree murder and one count of rape, police said. Broadnax is awaiting extradition, police said. It was not immediately clear if he had retained an attorney. Read More Michael Pietropola, brother of victim Janice Pietropola, said he felt ""bittersweet"" about the arrest. He is happy that justice may finally be served, but it also ""opened up deep wounds that had been there since 1973."" ""We hope through the trials and proceedings that we will get answers, answers that the police can't even give us right now,"" Pietropola said, ""so we can get some closure, some rationalization of a crazy crime that took the lives of two beautiful teenagers."" Mostly, Pietropola said, he hopes to be able to make some sense of what happened in Virginia Beach in 1973. ""What was going through this guy's mind? What made him pick my sister and her friend? What drove him to this? Those are the questions that as a brother I would want for closure,"" Pietropola said. Broadnax served three prison stints in New York for assault, burglary, and attempted burglary, records show. He was released on parole in 2013. Virginia Beach Police Chief Jim Cervera declined to describe what led to Broadnax's arrest, other than saying it was ""an advancement in technology that wasn't available X number of years ago. Most of the technology, as you know, that's coming online wasn't available 10 years ago."" Investigators, he said, just kept resubmitting pieces of evidence. Eventually, that doggedness paid off."
WikiLeaks says Julian Assange is being spied on and blackmailed - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Claudia Rebaza, Lauren Kent and Alex Eliseev, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/uk/julian-assange-spy-operation-ecuador-embassy-gbr-intl/index.html,"London (CNN) WikiLeaks' Editor-in-Chief said Wednesday the group has ""uncovered an extensive spying operation against Julian Assange"" in the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he has lived under asylum since 2012, likening it to the movie ""The Truman Show.""
Speaking at a press conference in the British capital, Kristinn Hrafnsson said surveillance of WikiLeaks' founder Assange included video and audio recordings from various recorders inside the embassy, including footage of a medical examination of Assange as well as legal meetings and legal documents. Will shake-up at London embassy leave Assange out in the cold? Wednesday's allegations ramped up the war of words between Ecuadorian authorities and WikiLeaks, which claims there has been an escalating effort to push Assange out of the embassy, with the aim of getting him extradited to the United States. Fidel Narvaez, Ecuador's former consul to London, said he did not believe that Ecuador was protecting Assange any longer, describing him as a political refugee. 'Massive trove' Read More Hrafnsson said the ""massive trove"" of information came to light as part of an extortion case in Spain. He said individuals had allegedly demanded 3 million euros from WikiLeaks, in a case currently being handled by local Spanish police. Ecuador's government caught in massive espionage operation against Julian Assange which:
1. Spied on his legal, medical visits
2. Stole legal notes during the middle of a court hearing against them
3. Secretly cooperated with US prosecutors
4. Tried to extort him for 3M Euro
— WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 10, 2019 Hrafnsson said he traveled to Spain 10 days ago and saw hundreds of documents, apparently collected by someone from inside the Ecuadorian embassy. CNN has reached out to Spain's Policia Nacional, who said they had no comment. Assange expulsion from Ecuador embassy would be 'illegal,' his legal team says When asked to respond to WikiLeaks' allegations, a spokesperson for Ecuador's Foreign Office Communication Department told CNN: ""This is under consideration and we will keep the press informed."" Australian whistleblower Assange has been holed up at the embassy, yards from Harrods department store in Knightsbridge, since he was granted asylum in 2012 as part of an attempt to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was facing allegations of sexual assault. The case has since been dropped, but Assange fears extradition to the US due to his work with WikiLeaks, and so has remained in place. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. New rules Since Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno took office in 2017, Assange has repeatedly claimed that Ecuador has been making his life more difficult in an attempt to force him to vacate the premises. Ecuador has denied Assange's allegations, with Attorney General Inigo Salvador telling reporters in October that his country was ""not looking to revoke"" Assange's asylum. However, Moreno said in December that if the UK government guaranteed that Assange would not be extradited to a third country where he could face the death penalty, the WikiLeaks founder should hand himself in to the authorities. Julian Assange: The house guest who overstayed his welcome? Ecuador said the UK had given such a guarantee, but Moreno said he needed clarification on the British position. Last year, Assange was told he had to abide by new rules imposed by the Ecuadorian embassy, which included paying for his food, medical care and laundry, taking care of his cat, keeping the parts of the embassy he uses clean, and obtaining prior authorization for visitors. In a statement last Friday , the Ecuadorian Foreign Ministry called rumors about the termination of Assange's asylum ""fake news,"" adding that the claim of a possible agreement with the UK ""misrepresents reality."" ""The Ecuadorian government notices that these falsehoods are also an attempt to tarnish the dignity of the country,"" the ministry said in the statement. ""When they issue falsehoods, the asylee and his associates express once more their ingratitude and disrespect towards Ecuador, instead of showing gratitude towards the country that has welcomed him for nearly seven years, incurred significant expenditures to pay for his stay at the embassy, has borne their rudeness and to whom he, paradoxically, has filed a lawsuit against for adopting a cohabitation protocol in order to prevent his bad behavior from taking place again."""
Durham explosion: Paramedics pull injured to safety after blast and fire - CNN,edition.cnn.com,Eliott C. McLaughlin,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/durham-explosion-north-carolina/index.html,"Durham, North Carolina (CNN) The cars near the site of a gas explosion that killed one person in Durham, North Carolina, on Wednesday look like they've been in accidents.
Windows are blown out. Air bags are deployed. Some have dents and dings. The roads are awash in glass, so much so they glisten. The air reeks of dust and pollen. Some 60 emergency responders and cleanup people are on the scene of the blast, which happened hours earlier after someone smelled gas. Authorities said 17 people, including a firefighter, were hospitalized. Six people were critically wounded, said Lee VanVleet of Durham County Emergency Medical Services Emergency responders were evacuating the area when the blast erupted, Durham Fire Chief Robert Zoldos said. Read More The blast occurred just after 10 a.m. in the busy area of Brightleaf Square, where people grab a morning coffee and visit other shops. A contractor boring under the sidewalk hit a 2-inch gas line, said Durham police spokesman Wil Glenn. The search-and-rescue mission has given way to a cleanup operation. Workers were using heavy-duty backpack blowers to clear debris on the ground and firefighters were spraying the remaining hot spots with water. A witness from a building across the street said, ""Half the block is destroyed."" CNN has blurred a figure at center left due to a graphic injury. One of the critically injured patients was taken to the North Carolina Jaycee Burn Center in Chapel Hill, VanVleet said. A Dominion Energy employee who responded to the initial gas leak was among the injured, police said. The firefighter's injuries are serious but not life-threatening, Zoldos said. He was in surgery, the chief said. Authorities asked people to avoid the Brightleaf Square area and warned that parts of downtown will be closed, possibly for a couple of days, as they conduct their investigation. Maverick's Smokehouse & Taproom, though closed to the public, brought in employees to help feed the emergency crews. Sounded like a bomb, office worker says A witness described a scene like a war zone, with first responders scrambling to ferry injured people to safety after the blast. ""Half the block is destroyed,"" Jim Rogalski told CNN via text message. ""Lots of injuries. Our office across the street was blown out. It was terrifying. Glass and debris everywhere. No one killed in our office but several injuries -- deep cuts, head lacerations."" ""The ceiling tiles and structures collapse(d),"" added Rogalski, whose workplace is across the street from where the blast occurred. ""Windows blown out a block away. Our office was filled with glass, dust and debris."" JUST WATCHED One killed after a gas explosion in North Carolina Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH
One killed after a gas explosion in North Carolina 01:04 A human resources employee told Rogalski and his co-workers that authorities were investigating a gas leak across the street and they should remain inside. About 15 minutes later, they heard what sounded like a bomb, he told CNN. ""The first second was stunned silence, then lots of scream(ing) in the building. Several of us shouted, 'Is anyone hurt?'"" he recalled. ""The injured were quickly taken to an exit."" Another person who works nearby said firefighters entered his building and told employees that workers had hit a gas line, and ""we heard the big explosion right after they told us they may evacuate us."" The blast shook the structure and blew out its windows, said the witness, who declined to give his name. ""It sounded like the building was going to collapse, and we left immediately,"" he said. Police arrived quickly, within about a minute, Rogalski said, and he went outside to find throngs of people and paramedics trying to help the injured. Firefighters soon arrived and pushed everyone back about four blocks in case of another explosion, he said. Firefighters respond to the gas blast in Durham on Wednesday morning. ""Paramedics pulled writhing people on the street to safety,"" he said, adding that he saw bystanders using their own shirts to treat injuries. The Durham School of the Arts is nearby and reported no injuries but said it was sending students home early. Students without transportation will be taken to the Brogden Middle School auditorium to wait for their parents, the school said. The building where the blast occurred is a former Studebaker dealership that now appears to host other businesses, including a coffee shop and a mental health clinic. Aerial video showed the two-story building missing its roof and back wall, the inside filled with charred debris. Four other buildings were damaged, officials said. The city observed the 150th anniversary of its founding on Wednesday."

Steven Mnuchin doesn't seem to understand how the whole checks-and-balances thing works - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/steven-mnuchin-maxine-waters/index.html,"(CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was done . The clock had ticked past 5 p.m. He had been sitting in a congressional hearing and answering questions for hours. And he had a meeting.
""It will be embarrassing if I keep this person waiting for a long period of time,"" Mnuchin told House Financial Services Committee Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-California). To which she responded: ""We're all late all the time unfortunately. We're all pressed for time, and I do get it."" THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!

Awkward, right? We're only getting started! Here's what happened next. 1. Mnuchin asked if he was dismissed. Read More 2. ""I have the gavel at this point,"" Waters said. ""If you wish to leave, you may."" 3. Mnuchin then said ""OK, so we're dismissed? Is that correct?"" 4. Waters, then, said again: ""If you wish to leave, you may leave. You're wasting your time, remember you have a foreign dignitary in your office."" 5. Mnuchin then went with a threat: ""If you'd wish to keep me here so that I don't have my important meeting and continue to grill me, then we can do that. I will cancel my meeting and I will not be back here. I will be very clear if that's the way you'd like to have this relationship."" 6. Waters said she accepted Mnuchin's offer to stay and answer questions. 7. ""No, I didn't make you an offer,"" Mnuchin replied. 8. Mnuchin then asked Waters again to dismiss him: ""You're supposed to take the gravel [sic] and bang it, that's the appropriate ..."" 9. Waters shot back: ""Please do not instruct me as to how I am to conduct this committee."" And, scene . You can -- and MUST -- watch the whole thing here . Mnuchin asks to be dismissed. Waters says no. pic.twitter.com/rYkuBl3HXO
— Manu Raju (@mkraju) April 9, 2019 This is far from the first time that Mnuchin has clashed with the new Democratic majority in the House. Following a Mnuchin classified briefing on the Trump administration's decisions to drop some Russia sanction, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) called it ""a waste of time"" and ""one of the worst classified briefings."" Mnuchin has also drawn the ire of House Democrats with his dismissive and vague answers about whether he plans to approve the handing-over of Trump's tax returns to Ways and Committee Chairman Richard Neal (Massachusetts). And with his decision to no-show a House committee hearing about the economic impacts of the government shutdown. There's a pattern here. Mnuchin, like Trump, comes from the business world. And Mnuchin, again like Trump, isn't used to having to be answerable to much of anyone -- apart, perhaps, from stockholders. The idea that he not only has to appear before Congress intermittently but also sit and take the slings and arrows (aka questions) thrown at him by the likes of Waters galls him. He quite clearly views the whole thing as a giant waste of his time, and not something to miss an ""important meeting"" for. Here's the problem with that worldview: The Constitution lays out the separation of power between the three co-equa l branches of the government , and the need for checks and balances within that system. ""In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself,"" wrote James Madison in Federalist Papers #51. Mnuchin either isn't familiar with the whole checks-and-balances thing -- or thinks it doesn't apply to him. Either way, that's troubling."
Bernie Sanders unveils more ambitious new Medicare for All plan - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Tami Luhby,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-2020/index.html,"(CNN) Hours after unveiling his new Medicare for All proposal, Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday he would do what it takes -- even if it meant busting Senate norms -- to pass his signature health care policy.
Sanders has frequently raised doubts over breaking with lawmaking customs to advance his big-ticket policy agenda, but in a statement to CNN, he said his Medicare for All push would not be halted by current filibuster rules, which effectively require 60 votes to advance a bill. He is also floating a path to passage by way of budget reconciliation. The two options would only require a simple majority of senators to sign on. ""In terms of Medicare for All, before we even get to the issue of the filibuster, we need 51 senators who are prepared to do what polls show that rank and file Democrats want -- and that is a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system,"" Sanders said. ""Once we have, and I believe it will be sooner than later, a Democratic majority who are prepared to vote for Medicare for All in the House and Senate, we will pass it."" Sanders noted that his Medicare for All plan, which was cosponsored by four fellow 2020 Democratic presidential rivals, currently has only 15 ""publicly stated"" backers in the Senate. ""That has got to change,"" he said, pushing his liberal colleagues and issuing a warning in the process. ""In my view, Democratic elected officials and candidates should do what grassroots Democrats want them to do."" Read More The goal would not wipe out the filibuster entirely, Sanders' office said, but weaken it as part of a broader strategy that would employ unconventional means to deliver on his aggressive agenda. ""Bernie would support reforming the current filibuster rules to maintain the talking filibuster while eventually allowing legislation like Medicare for All to pass with a simple majority,"" Sanders aide Josh Miller-Lewis told CNN. In his statement, Sanders also suggested that he would consider using budget reconciliation -- an arcane process employed by Senate Republicans in their failed attempt to wipe out Obamacare -- that also allows for some legislation, potentially including Medicare for All, to pass with 51 votes. ""It is the vice president who determines what is and is not permissible under budget reconciliation,"" Sanders said, suggesting that he would be willing to go over the head of a skeptical Senate parliamentarian. ""I can tell you that a vice president in a Bernie Sanders administration will determine that Medicare for All can pass through the Senate under reconciliation and is not in violation of the rules."" Expected to stoke debate on 2020 trail Sanders -- an independent who caucuses with the Democrats and is again seeking their party's nomination -- introduced the revamped proposal in the midst of a charged political moment, as the presidential primary heats up and the Trump administration makes a fresh push to topple Obamacare in the courts. But even as they circle the wagons around the current law, Democrats are eyeing the future -- and the prospects of enacting a single-payer system that would fundamentally re-order American life well beyond doctors' offices and emergency rooms. The decision to move forward now is also expected to stoke a more pointed debate on the 2020 presidential primary circuit, where top contenders -- including Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker, who all cosponsored the Medicare for All bill -- are being faced with a high-stakes new question over the role of private insurance companies. Sanders, through this legislation, is determined to put the industry out of business. The other four, and a raft more who do not support the bill, have all said the private insurers are either inescapable or, as many moderates argue, vital cogs in America's health care system. Trump attorney general on ACA lawsuit: 'Let the courts do their job' At a Wednesday morning event on Capitol Hill, Sanders cast the movement supporting the legislation in historical terms. ""We are involved in a great struggle not unlike, to be honest with you, the struggles of the labor movement, the struggles of the civil rights movement, the struggles of the women's movement, the struggles of the gay community, the struggles of the environmental movement,"" Sanders said. ""This is what we're about."" Asked earlier if Sanders is priming for a showdown with his 2020 opponents, including the bill's candidate-cosponsors, campaign manager Faiz Shakir laid down a marker. ""Whether it's a fight that he's going to have with them is up to them,"" Shakir said. ""This is a core pillar of why (Sanders) is running for president, a core pillar of what he would do as president. It's up to other people to determine for themselves whether and how much, how core it is for them. I will let other people decide for themselves how they'll go about it."" Much like Sanders has on the stump, Shakir predicted a sharp and expensive fight with private insurance interests to come. ""You aren't going to upend that system easily,"" he said. ""So there's going to be a bunch of lobbying groups out there (spending) hundreds of millions of dollars and you can be damn sure that they're going to decide that an advertising campaign against Bernie Sanders is a worthwhile expenditure for them -- rather than providing health care coverage for people."" At the Wednesday rally in Washington, Gillibrand, the only cosponsor in attendance, said that universal, government-guaranteed coverage needs ""to become the next social safety net, to become something that is there for you no matter what."" The New York senator, who has supported single-payer for more than a decade and wrote the Sanders legislation's four-year transition plan, said the path to building support for the bill could be greased by allowing Americans to first buy-in to a government-run public option -- a move, she argued, that would ultimately wipe out the private insurance industry. ""I dare any insurance company to just try to compete. They won't,"" Gillibrand said. ""The insurance industry wants to make money. They are a for-profit industry. Their goals are not aligned with ours."" Booker, who was not at the rally, also discussed the bill -- and the roadblocks facing it in Congress -- during a New York radio interview. ""I think the best way to do (reach full coverage) would be to design a Medicare for All system,"" he said. ""But anybody who says those words, 'Medicare for All,' who's running for president, the next thing out of their mouth should be talking to people about, in a split Congress, what are you going to actually do in your first year to make healthcare more accessible and affordable?"" He has not discussed in detail his plan for moving it through a Senate in which Democrats lack that 60-vote supermajority. In a divided Congress, the legislation would likely be dead on arrival. Soon after Sanders' announcement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders offered another preview of the pushback awaiting Democratic candidates who back Medicare for All. ""Democrats just announced their government takeover of healthcare plan,"" she tweeted, claiming the plan ""confiscates every American's private health insurance."" Would effectively eliminate private insurance In addition to Sanders, Gillibrand and the other three presidential hopefuls, the bill's cosponsors also include Sens. Tammy Baldwin, Richard Blumenthal, Patrick Leahy, Mazie Hirono, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Brian Schatz, Tom Udall, Sheldon Whitehouse and Martin Heinrich. A number of them, like the five candidates, have also signed on to less radical bills, some of which would create a Medicare buy-in system or expand previously existing programs. The 2019 legislation would go further than Sanders' previous plans by covering more long-term care services, bringing it closer in line with a broader House version sponsored by Washington Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal. Nursing home and other institutional coverage would still fall to Medicaid under the new bill, as it had before, while long-term care at home and in the community would be expanded. Apart from its new measures to cover long-term care, much of Sanders' proposal remains the same as what he introduced in 2017. He wants to create a federal universal health insurance program that would cover medically necessary services, prescription drugs, dental and vision services. Premiums, deductibles and co-pays would disappear, except for a potential $200 co-pay for brand-name drugs. Though many of his rivals have said they would maintain a role for private insurance, Sanders' bill would effectively eliminate the industry. Insurers would only be allowed to provide services not covered by the universal plan, such as cosmetic surgery. As for how to foot the bill, Sanders describes a litany of ways Americans are already spending billions on health care, particularly because of high administrative costs, executive pay packages and prescription drug prices. He maintains that Medicare for All, despite its cost, would save many people money. The new legislation also lists several ways to raise additional funds, including levying premiums on workers and employers; boosting income and estate tax rates; and establishing a wealth tax. The decision to extend coverage for home- and community-based long-term care was predicated on a need to help the elderly and the disabled, while extending care to rural communities, Shakir told CNN. ""It's a really critical part of whether you're going to be able to sustain life (among the elderly),"" he said. ""Home care means so much to the disability community because it is literally liberty and freedom to be able to still run their own lives and not be committed to institutions or have to travel far distances to get basic care."""
Republican senators float bill on pre-existing conditions protections - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Tami Luhby,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/republican-obamacare-pre-existing-conditions/index.html,"(CNN) Seeking to show Republicans' commitment to protecting those with pre-existing conditions, a group of GOP senators led by Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina is reviving and expanding a bill that would retain at least some of the protections built into Obamacare.
The move is an attempt to address concerns that the popular and ironclad provisions secured by the Affordable Care Act may disappear amid President Donald Trump's renewed drive to overturn the landmark health reform law. It comes as Democrats offer up an array of new proposals for universal, government-backed health coverage. The bill's introduction comes less than two weeks after the Trump administration said in a federal appeals filing that the entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down , a surprising shift from its earlier position that only key pre-existing conditions protections were unconstitutional. The Justice Department now says it agrees with a Texas federal judge's ruling that invalidated Obamacare because Congress effectively eliminated penalties for not having insurance. Trump says GOP will be the party of health care but provides no plan The administration's new stance put the GOP back on the defensive against claims that it is not committed to making sure that people with complicated medical histories can still get comprehensive insurance. And it placed a spotlight on the fact that the party still has no solid plan to replace law should it fall. Trump has said Republicans would unveil a new health care plan , but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell quickly tamped down any expectations that the chamber would pursue such legislation. Read More McConnell has made clear, both privately to Trump, and publicly, that he has no plans to take up broad health care reform legislation until after the 2020 election. But he did say he was open to smaller-bore measures related to prescription drug prices -- and the Tillis bill may become a more palatable GOP backstop if the courts do end up striking down Obamacare in full. Like last year's version, the Tillis bill doesn't have the votes to move forward in the Senate. Democrats have dismissed GOP health care efforts, which they view as a way to undermine Obamacare, and it's an open question whether all Republicans in the chamber to support it. Fifteen Senate Republicans co-sponsored a similar Tillis measure in the last Congress. House Democrats, now in control of the chamber, have focused their energy on defending Obamacare or more expansive health care overhauls, making it exceedingly unlikely they'd ever consider the bill. Trump attorney general on ACA lawsuit: 'Let the courts do their job' Tillis first introduced the legislation shortly after the Justice Department announced it would not defend Obamacare's pre-existing protections in the Texas case. The senators marketed that bill as ensuring that those with imperfect health histories would be able to get insurance. It became a talking point for some Republicans on the midterm campaign trail. However, experts quickly pointed out that the bill would allow insurers to exclude coverage of the pre-existing conditions and to adjust premiums based on gender, which could increase rates for women, especially those of child-bearing age. Obamacare, on the other hand, requires insurers to provide comprehensive policies and bars them from using gender as a factor in rates. A new bill would require insurers to guarantee access for people with pre-existing conditions and prohibit premiums based on health. But, it would allow insurers to exclude any coverage of the pre-existing conditions. A bit of a catch. https://t.co/Dgc1DNor0B

Israel Folau: Australian rugby star Israel Folau criticized for homophobic posts - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Emily Dixon, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/sport/australia-israel-folau-rugby-homophobic-comments-scli-intl/index.html,"(CNN) A series of ""unacceptable"" homophobic and transphobic social media comments posted by Australian rugby player Israel Folau are being investigated by the sport's governing body.
On Instagram, the New South Wales Waratahs player shared an image listing ""drunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolaters,"" reading underneath, ""Hell awaits you."" The 30-year-old Folau, who also plays for Australia's national team, captioned the image: ""Those that are living in Sin will end up in Hell unless you repent. Jesus Christ loves you and is giving you time to turn away from your sin and come to him."" He also included several Bible verses in the caption. On Tuesday, Folau posted a transphobic reaction on social media to new legislation passed in Tasmania, which became the first Australian state to make listing gender on birth certificates optional. Those aged 16 and over can now apply to change their registered gender without the approval of their parents, while transgender people will no longer be denied official recognition of their gender until they've had surgery. On Twitter, Folau shared a screenshot of an article about the legislation, writing: ""The devil has blinded so many people in this world, REPENT and turn away from your evil ways."" Read More In a statement on its website, Rugby Australia wrote: ""Rugby Australia is aware of a post made by Israel Folau on his Instagram account this afternoon."" ""The content within the post is unacceptable. It does not represent the values of the sport and is disrespectful to members of the Rugby community,"" the statement continued. ""The Rugby Australia Integrity Unit has been engaged on the matter tonight."" Homophobia in sport: English Rugby Union praised for tackling abuse In April 2018, Folau was criticized for writing in an Instagram comment that gay people would go to hell unless they repented. All Blacks player TJ Perenara and ""Thor: Ragnorok"" filmmaker Taiki Waititi were among those to condemn Folau's comments on Twitter. Welsh rugby union referee Nigel Owens, who is gay, wrote in a column for Wales Online, ""When young people in particular see comments like this, and not just from our sporting stars but from anybody, it could be enough to push those people over the edge."" 'Hate speech' Folau defended his comment in a column for Players' Voice, writing that accusations of homophobia ""could not be further from the truth."" The following month, Folau posted a video on Twitter of a sermon by American evangelist David Wilkerson, in which Wilkerson condemns ""rampant iniquity"" and ""sexual perversions beyond description"" as footage of activists waving rainbow flags plays. Speaking on Fox Sports' ""Kick & Chase"" the same month, Rugby Australia Chief Executive Raelene Castle said of Folau's homophobic comments, ""in my career this is the singularly most difficult thing I've ever had to deal with."" Castle defended Rugby Australia's decision not to sanction Folau, saying: ""On one hand it's a human rights issue but on the other hand, you're dealing with freedom of speech."" ""We've had conversations with Izzy about presenting his views in a respectful way,"" Castle said. ""He is walking the line, we will continue the dialogue."" Robbie Rogers wants change as study shows fear of homophobia in sport James Lolicato, co-founder of Australian charity Proud 2 Play -- which ""focuses on increasing LGBTI+ engagement in sport, exercise and active recreation"" -- told CNN that Folau's latest comments ""are not only demeaning to LGBTI+ people, but also are discriminatory."" ""We see the negative consequences that arise from comments such as these from high-level players, be that of young LGBTI+ people feeling isolated and afraid to get involved in sport, or the modeling of these comments and behaviors in other people,"" Lolicato said. ""Rugby needs to look at its vilification policies and sanction Israel to show that they really are a sport for everybody,"" he added. ""We can no longer mask hate speech as 'free speech' and need to make sure that discrimination of all forms is properly tackled in sport."" Folau's New South Wales Waratahs team was not immediately available for comment. Described as a ""freak of an athlete"" with ""exceptional physical prowess,"" Folau has played 63 times for Australia. Prior to converting to rugby union, the 30-year-old played professional rugby league and Australian rules football."

'Lionel Messi is God': Can Manchester United stop Barcelona's divine talent?,rss.cnn.com,"Nick Friend, for CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_world/~3/Ed7TYPc6bl0/index.html,"(CNN) ""Bring it on"" was the rallying cry from Chris Smalling as the Manchester United defender was confronted with the reality of facing Lionel Messi in Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal.
With Smalling likely to start at the heart of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's defense and Messi intent on performing the role immortalized by his unparalleled phenomenon, the pair will -- by the game's close -- be well-acquainted. To leave Messi unattended is, at best, unwise. Mikael Silvestre -- a Champions League winner during his time at Manchester United -- acknowledged that it is Messi's divine brilliance that stands in his former team's way on its path to an unlikely semifinal place. ""Barcelona -- except 'God' (Messi) -- is a team that you can stop over two games,"" Silvestre told CNN Sport last month. ""I think United can stop Barcelona and progress."" Given both the Catalan side's style of play and the central importance of Messi, Silvestre is well aware of the grit and good fortune necessary if his former club is to remain in the game for long enough to concern the five-time winners. Read More READ: How 'Little Seoul' fell in love with its favorite Son Messi has scored 108 Champons League goals, including eight hat-tricks, as well as making 30 assists. ""They did it against Paris [in the previous round, where United overcame a 2-0 first-leg deficit to win on away goals]. They ended up playing with Mason Greenwood, Tahith Chong, James Garner -- the three youngsters -- in the Parc des Princes. ""It was an inspiring performance, with that mental ability to stay in the game and believe and to never ever give up. It is in the club's DNA -- that never-give-up attitude."" Messi, though remains the key. As a defender who racked up 249 appearances during the Alex Ferguson era, Silvestre has a warning for his former team.

Indeed, Silvestre himself has managed it; he came on as a late substitute when United beat Barcelona by a single goal in the 2008 semifinal. More than a decade on, though, Messi's icon has more than stood the test of time. That the Argentine has not been crowned as the world's greatest player since claiming his fifth Ballon d'Or title in 2015 is, in many ways, a red herring. Mikael Silvestre was part of the Manchester United squad that won the 2007/08 Champions League, coming on as a substitute against Barcelona at Old Trafford in the second leg of the 1-0 semifinal aggregate win. READ: How a painting helped soccer great Buffon cope with depression Timeless supremacy His unique ability has never declined, and nor have his own numbers; 26 goals in the 2015/16 La Liga season have subsequently been followed by 37 and 34, with the Argentine great sat on 33 with seven games of the current season remaining -- a year dominated by his Barcelona side. In this year's Champions League, Messi's six appearances have brought with them eight goals and a further three assists. It is a run that has added to an already exceptional overall record in Europe's major club competition; 108 goals in 131 appearances give him a superior minutes per goal ratio to that of his great rival Cristiano Ronaldo, though the Argentine remains 16 strikes behind the Juventus forward's 124. The duo's long-running battle for footballing supremacy has seen them competing in a competition of their own. Former Real Madrid captain Raul Gonzalez is the pair's closest challenger -- but even his 71 goals place him 37 behind Messi. Of those still active, Karim Benzema is the next closest, but his Champions League tally of 60 is less than halfway to Ronaldo's astronomic figure.

Yet, for almost as long as the theory has existed, it is a label that Messi has confounded. There are, of course, occasional outliers. Messi's record against Chelsea, for example, sits at just three goals in 10 games. However, his history with Manchester United is different. Although it currently shows just two goals in four games, those strikes came in the 2009 and 2011 finals. His performance at Wembley in the latter of the two is remembered for its sheer majesty, as Barcelona cruised to a 3-1 victory. READ: Tottenham edge out Manchester City but lose Harry Kane to injury Some hope, perhaps, for the Old Trafford faithful comes in Messi's record on English soil. While hardly a goalscoring famine, Messi has netted eight times in 15 games in England, as opposed to 13 in 14 matches at the Camp Nou. Indeed, he is also without a goal in his last 11 Champions League quarterfinals. Whether that is an omen for Solskjaer's side -- good or bad -- remains to be seen."

""It's not really superstitious. It's a thing you do every time. There are guys literally that think they won't play good if they don't do the same thing (every time),"" Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Seth Jones tells CNN Sport, speaking ahead of the NHL Playoffs' start. Follow @cnnsport Let's face it, even if you might find it hard to admit, we all probably have a few habits that get us out of the house and through each day. A Montreal Canadiens video crew chronicled Andrew Shaw's intriguing pregame routine -- including slashing a teammate in the knee pad and orchestrating 50 different handshakes -- in which he admits: ""I've added little things that I find just help me get ready for the game. ""I think now it's just being superstitious going into every game. Most players do have a routine. If they say they don't, they are lying to you."" Read More 'Rigid routine' When NHL players are asked about their pregame routine, they often answer in a sheepish, almost noncommittal way -- ""Oh that's not me but let me tell you about my teammate."" Many players don't readily expand on their daily routines likely out of fear of not wanting to sound odd or give away a secret that an opponent, or even worse a teammate, can use against them. Winnipeg Jets forward Mark Scheifele warns: ""We have (Dustin) Byfuglien on our team who is a big jokester, so anyone who has a superstition probably needs to get rid of it if you play on the Winnipeg Jets. If you set your sticks up a certain way. You put your pads a certain way. Buff's gonna knock 'em over."" Even so, Scheifele, who is the Jets leading goal scorer, has a ritual that 'afflicts' several other NHLers -- wanting to be the last skater off the ice after the warm-up. ""I am the last one to go off. I like being on the ice. I like shooting around. I like it when no one else is out there.

Compare this to three-time Stanley Cup champion Sidney Crosby. The Pittsburgh Penguins captain counts on a simple peanut butter and jelly before each game. But don't let the simple sandwich fool you. Crosby's before-the-puck-drop rituals might be the most well known. But as someone who has won multiple Olympic golds and Stanley Cups, who can say they aren't working? ""There is just too many, it's hard now after you do things for so long to know what is a superstition and what's just part of your daily routine,"" Crosby acknowledged in a 2017 post-practice interview. ""There's a lot of guys in here that have them -- they just don't want to admit it."" During Crosby's sixth season, a HBO camera crew followed ""Sid the Kid"" during his pregame routine -- willingly taking the long way around the arena as to not walk in front of the visitors' locker room. The aforementioned Jones, who says he is not really superstitious, is quick to smile and highlight one of his teammate's routines. ""Boone Jenner is one of the weirdest ones I've seen on the bench. Every time he comes on the bench from a shift, he'll take (a sip of) water, then Gatorade, water, Gatorade, spit, spit ... there is like a certain sequence to it.

But in jest seems to admit that if he has a good game or scores, the next pregame meal must be reenacted - right down to the same time, same table and same guy paying the bill. Meanwhile, the Columbus Blue Jackets' Cam Atkinson almost appears to laugh in the face of superstitions -- the All-Star forward wears the #13 on his back. When called out about the monotony of his chicken and pasta routine, Atkinson countered: ""you should ask (Johnny) Gaudreau about his pre-game lunch."" At this point Atkinson cracks a big smile. Atkinson knows the Calgary Flames star well. So, well that Gaudreau actually wears the #13 in homage to Atkinson. ""Gaudreau has pasta but has never had pasta sauce in his life. So he gets a big bowl of pasta with nothing -- not even butter, no cheese, nothing. I don't know how you can do that."" Gaudreau too seems impervious to all of this. ""I'm not superstitious at all.

Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday released her 2018 tax returns, laying bare a key financial record the Democratic Party has made a political issue since President Donald Trump took the unusual step of withholding his own tax returns.
According to the returns, the Massachusetts Democrat and presidential hopeful reported an adjusted gross income of $846,394 in 2018 -- $324,687 of which came from writing. The documents said she paid $206,488 in federal taxes in 2018 and owed $24,477 in taxes for the year. Warren previously released 10 years of tax returns last August. The move to release her latest returns comes as questions continue to swirl about Trump's own returns and those belonging to Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a fellow Democratic presidential candidate who has repeatedly promised to release the information ""soon."" Sanders, an independent who revealed Tuesday that his own book deals had made him a millionaire , is expected to release his returns on or before Monday, the tax filing deadline for 2018, according to his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir. In a statement, Warren touted anti-corruption legislation she introduced last year that would require elected officials and candidates for federal office to make public more robust information about their taxes and other financial dealings. Read More ""There's a crisis of faith in government -- and that's because the American people think the government works for the wealthy and well-connected, not for them. And they're right.

Her 2018 adjusted gross income was down from the previous year; her 2017 federal income tax filing showed she and her husband, Bruce Mann, who is a professor at Harvard Law School, reported a little more than $913,000 in adjusted gross income. Earlier this year, as Warren prepared to formally kick off her presidential bid, she filed her first financial disclosure report with the Federal Election Commission, which provided an early look at her finances. The documents showed that her assets, tucked away in retirement and investment accounts, range in value from $2.59 million and $8.38 million.

It's deadline day for Trump's tax returns - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Lauren Fox,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/trump-tax-returns-house-deadline/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin informed Congress early Wednesday evening that his department would be unable to comply with House Democrats' deadline for President Donald Trump's tax returns, inserting himself into what is sure to be a pitched battle for the closely held documents.
In a letter Wednesday to House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal, Mnuchin said that ""the Treasury Department will not be able to complete its review"" by Wednesday's deadline Democrats had given Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Charles Rettig to turn over six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns. Highlighting what he called the ""unprecedented nature of this request,"" Mnuchin said that he would be overseeing the Treasury's handling of the request and that the Department of Justice was being consulted ""to ensure that our response is fully consistent with the law and Constitution."" Mnuchin's decision to involve himself and the Justice Department in processing the returns suggests that he does not feel compelled to stick to a deadline, making for a prolonged and politicized process. Congressional Democrats believe the law clearly allows them to ask for the information in this way, with Rettig acknowledging in a hearing earlier Wednesday that requests are typically handled by the IRS commissioner. Mnuchin stressed in the letter that his and the Justice Department's involvement was to protect all American taxpayers from the potential implications of the request. Read More ""The Committee's request raises serious issues concerning the constitutional scope of Congressional investigative authority, the legitimacy of the asserted legislative purpose, and the constitutional rights of American citizens,"" he wrote. ""The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power."" Neal said Wednesday that he would discuss the proper response with counsel since the Treasury Department ""has decided not to allow the IRS to comply with my request by the April 10 deadline."" The top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, on Wednesday called Mnuchin's involvement ""a sign of political interference,"" adding that ""if Secretary Mnuchin does not provide the president's tax returns, he will break the law."" Mnuchin's letter follows the directive in a letter from Trump's attorney William Consovoy asking the Treasury Department to ""refrain from divulging the requested information until it receives a formal legal opinion from"" the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. Democrats anticipate lengthy battle A week after Neal made his formal request for Trump's tax information , including information on eight of the President's business entities, Democrats are fully anticipating a drawn-out political and legal showdown as the administration digs in and Democrats prepare to go to court. ""They want to rig this thing. They've already started to do that,"" Rep. Bill Pascrell, a Democrat from New Jersey, told CNN. ""Their excuses for not giving them up are the most hypocritical I have ever heard of any subject in the Congress, and I've been here 22 years. ... They're trying to rig it? Good. We're ready for you."" Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee huddled Tuesday afternoon to discuss potential next moves and to talk about other issues before their committee. Neal said Tuesday that he plans to send a follow-up request for the information in writing before taking more drastic steps. There are still questions about whether the committee would issue a subpoena on top of the request or if the request would be grounds enough to trigger a fight in court if the IRS didn't comply. Mnuchin defends consultation between White House and Treasury on Trump tax returns Earlier Wednesday, Mnuchin said he was consulting with the Justice Department on Neal's request. ""We need to make sure that the IRS and the individual taxpayer info does not become subject to political wills,"" said Mnuchin on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund. ""I take the obligation very seriously to make sure we follow the law correctly."" When asked by CNN if he had spoken Rettig in recent days, Mnuchin said, ""I speak to the IRS commissioner regularly. It's my job to supervise the IRS. I'm not going to comment on specific conversations that we've had together."" Democrats are relying on a 1920s-era law that has never been challenged in court before. The IRS statute, known as 6103, says three people on Capitol Hill -- the Senate Finance Committee chairman, the head of the Joint Committee on Taxation and the chairman of House Ways and Means Committee -- can ask for any individual's tax information for legislative purposes and the secretary of the treasury ""shall furnish"" the request. It's a provision that's been employed before and is typically used for research purposes by the Joint Committee on Taxation. But asking for the president's tax returns is uncharted territory, a fact that the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee was cognizant of as he was waiting to make the request. ""We wanted to make sure that the case we constructed was one that stood up under the critical scrutiny of the courts,"" Neal told CNN last week. Allies of the President have argued that the Democrats have no right to see his returns. Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that Democrats would never see them and the American public had already settled the politics of it when they elected Trump. ""They knew they were not going to get these taxes,"" Mulvaney said of Democrats. ""That is not going to happen, and they know it. This is a political stunt by my former colleagues."" During a tense exchange before the Financial Services Committee on Tuesday afternoon, Mnuchin wouldn't commit to what precisely the Treasury Department would do next. Asked if he would comply, Mnuchin said he would ""comply with the law"" but stopped short of saying he would commit to handing over the returns. Democratic Rep. Nydia Velázquez of New York shot back, ""And the law says -- upon a written request from the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the chairman of the Committee on Finance of the Senate or the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the secretary shall furnish. So that's the law. "" Mnuchin responded, ""Again, I just want to be very clear. ... I have said that I will comply with the law. I have not made a comment one way or another whether we would supply the tax returns. I want to be very clear on that. We have said we will comply with the law."" No matter what comes next, Democrats say they are ready for the fight. ""Let 'em try it,"" Pascrell said. ""We're ready. We're ready. I am smacking my lips on this one, and America should be also."" This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday."

Pentagon awards nearly $1 billion in emergency funds to build Trump's border wall - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Ryan Browne,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/politics/pentagon-awards-funds-border-wall/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Defense Department announced Tuesday that it had awarded $976 million in contracts to build President Donald Trump's much-sought-after border wall with a completion date for these projects of October 2020.
A $789 million contract was awarded to the Texas-based company SLSCO Ltd. for the construction of border wall in Santa Teresa, New Mexico which is located in the El Paso sector of the border. A second $187 million contract was awarded to the Montana-based Barnard Construction Company for work in Yuma, Arizona. The contracts were awarded by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, a spokesman for the Department of Defense, told CNN that the El Paso sector contract would include the construction of ""30-foot bollard fencing and a five-foot anti-climb plate,"" and that the Yuma Sector project will feature ""18-foot bollard fencing and a five-foot anti-climb plate."" Read More A spokesperson for the Army Corps of Engineers told CNN last month that the plan was to install 46 miles at El Paso and 11 miles of fencing at Yuma. CNN has reported that DHS had asked the Pentagon for assistance replacing existing vehicle barriers with pedestrian fencing, as well as light installation in El Paso and Yuma. These are the first border wall contracts to use Pentagon funds that the Trump administration had repurposed from other Defense Department accounts to support the border wall. CNN previously reported that the contract award was expected as early as Tuesday. The funds for the contracts are to come from the $1 billion that was recently reprogrammed from Army personnel accounts into the 284 counter-drug account that authorizes border barrier construction. That reprogramming has been opposed by some lawmakers in Congress, but the Pentagon has said it does not need congressional approval to shift the funds. As a consequence of the move, Congress has threatened to strip the Pentagon of its ability to transfer funds in the future. Officials had previously told CNN that if the contracts were awarded in mid-April, construction could begin by late May, depending on whether the Department of Homeland Security issues environmental waivers, which is sometimes done to expedite construction. The administration has previously said it plans to shift an additional $1.5 billion in Pentagon funds toward wall construction at some point. That money is separate from the $3.6 billion in military construction funds that the Trump administration has sought to tap into to fund the wall via a national emergency declaration."
2 teens on vacation were killed 46 years ago. An 80-year-old is now under arrest - CNN,us.cnn.com,Eric Levenson,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/cold-case-virginia-beach-80-year-old/index.html,"(CNN) Virginia Beach police have accused an 80-year-old New York man of killing two teens in a case that's gone unsolved for 46 years.
The double homicide dates to 1973, when Janice Pietropola and Lynn Seethaler , both 19, traveled from the Pittsburgh area to Virginia Beach to vacation. They were found dead on June 30 inside their oceanfront motel cottage, and their deaths were ruled homicides, police said. After an exhaustive investigation, the case went cold, police said. The cottage where the teens were slain was destroyed, then rebuilt into motels and shops. Last fall, Virginia Beach Police cold case investigators, working with the local prosecutor, began to aggressively research a strong lead in the case, police said. Police on Monday arrested the accused killer: Ernest Broadnax of New York. He was arrested in New York and charged with two counts of second-degree murder and one count of rape, police said. Broadnax is awaiting extradition, police said. It was not immediately clear if he had retained an attorney. Read More Michael Pietropola, brother of victim Janice Pietropola, said he felt ""bittersweet"" about the arrest. He is happy that justice may finally be served, but it also ""opened up deep wounds that had been there since 1973."" ""We hope through the trials and proceedings that we will get answers, answers that the police can't even give us right now,"" Pietropola said, ""so we can get some closure, some rationalization of a crazy crime that took the lives of two beautiful teenagers."" Mostly, Pietropola said, he hopes to be able to make some sense of what happened in Virginia Beach in 1973. ""What was going through this guy's mind? What made him pick my sister and her friend? What drove him to this? Those are the questions that as a brother I would want for closure,"" Pietropola said. Broadnax served three prison stints in New York for assault, burglary, and attempted burglary, records show. He was released on parole in 2013. Virginia Beach Police Chief Jim Cervera declined to describe what led to Broadnax's arrest, other than saying it was ""an advancement in technology that wasn't available X number of years ago. Most of the technology, as you know, that's coming online wasn't available 10 years ago."" Investigators, he said, just kept resubmitting pieces of evidence. Eventually, that doggedness paid off."
Wall Street Journal: Investigators in New York have 'gathered more evidence than previously known' in Trump hush money probe - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Devan Cole,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/investigators-hush-money-payments-trump/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Federal investigators in New York have ""gathered more evidence than previously known"" from individuals in the President's ""inner circle,"" related to the hush-money payments made to two women who claim they had affairs with President Donald Trump, Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.

The paper also said investigators ""learned of calls"" between Schiller and David Pecker, the head of American Media Inc., the company that publishes the National Enquirer. Pecker worked with Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, to suppress potentially damaging claims made against candidate Trump by women, with AMI using a tabloid tactic called ""catch and kill.""

Republican senators float bill on pre-existing conditions protections - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Tami Luhby,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/republican-obamacare-pre-existing-conditions/index.html,"(CNN) Seeking to show Republicans' commitment to protecting those with pre-existing conditions, a group of GOP senators led by Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina is reviving and expanding a bill that would retain at least some of the protections built into Obamacare.
The move is an attempt to address concerns that the popular and ironclad provisions secured by the Affordable Care Act may disappear amid President Donald Trump's renewed drive to overturn the landmark health reform law. It comes as Democrats offer up an array of new proposals for universal, government-backed health coverage. The bill's introduction comes less than two weeks after the Trump administration said in a federal appeals filing that the entire Affordable Care Act should be struck down , a surprising shift from its earlier position that only key pre-existing conditions protections were unconstitutional. The Justice Department now says it agrees with a Texas federal judge's ruling that invalidated Obamacare because Congress effectively eliminated penalties for not having insurance. Trump says GOP will be the party of health care but provides no plan The administration's new stance put the GOP back on the defensive against claims that it is not committed to making sure that people with complicated medical histories can still get comprehensive insurance. And it placed a spotlight on the fact that the party still has no solid plan to replace law should it fall. Trump has said Republicans would unveil a new health care plan , but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell quickly tamped down any expectations that the chamber would pursue such legislation. Read More McConnell has made clear, both privately to Trump, and publicly, that he has no plans to take up broad health care reform legislation until after the 2020 election. But he did say he was open to smaller-bore measures related to prescription drug prices -- and the Tillis bill may become a more palatable GOP backstop if the courts do end up striking down Obamacare in full. Like last year's version, the Tillis bill doesn't have the votes to move forward in the Senate. Democrats have dismissed GOP health care efforts, which they view as a way to undermine Obamacare, and it's an open question whether all Republicans in the chamber to support it. Fifteen Senate Republicans co-sponsored a similar Tillis measure in the last Congress. House Democrats, now in control of the chamber, have focused their energy on defending Obamacare or more expansive health care overhauls, making it exceedingly unlikely they'd ever consider the bill. Trump attorney general on ACA lawsuit: 'Let the courts do their job' Tillis first introduced the legislation shortly after the Justice Department announced it would not defend Obamacare's pre-existing protections in the Texas case. The senators marketed that bill as ensuring that those with imperfect health histories would be able to get insurance. It became a talking point for some Republicans on the midterm campaign trail. However, experts quickly pointed out that the bill would allow insurers to exclude coverage of the pre-existing conditions and to adjust premiums based on gender, which could increase rates for women, especially those of child-bearing age. Obamacare, on the other hand, requires insurers to provide comprehensive policies and bars them from using gender as a factor in rates. A new bill would require insurers to guarantee access for people with pre-existing conditions and prohibit premiums based on health. But, it would allow insurers to exclude any coverage of the pre-existing conditions. A bit of a catch. https://t.co/Dgc1DNor0B
— Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) August 24, 2018 This year's legislation would bar insurers from excluding such coverage, according to The Wall Street Journal , which first reported the new Tillis bill. Tillis is up for re-election next year in a state that has politically swung back and forth between Democrats and Republicans over the last decade."
Durham explosion: Paramedics pull injured to safety after blast and fire - CNN,us.cnn.com,Eliott C. McLaughlin,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/durham-explosion-north-carolina/index.html,"Durham, North Carolina (CNN) The cars near the site of a gas explosion that killed one person in Durham, North Carolina, on Wednesday look like they've been in accidents.
Windows are blown out. Air bags are deployed. Some have dents and dings. The roads are awash in glass, so much so they glisten. The air reeks of dust and pollen. Some 60 emergency responders and cleanup people are on the scene of the blast, which happened hours earlier after someone smelled gas. Wednesday night, officials disclosed that the man who was killed was Kong Lee, the 61-year-old owner of the Kaffeinate coffee shop. Authorities said 17 people, including a firefighter, were hospitalized. Six people were critically wounded, said Lee VanVleet of Durham County Emergency Medical Services. Eight of the injured are employees of Duke University, school President Vincent E. Price said. Read More Emergency responders were evacuating the area when the blast erupted, Durham Fire Chief Robert Zoldos said. The blast occurred just after 10 a.m. in the busy area of Brightleaf Square, where people grab a morning coffee and visit other shops. A contractor boring under the sidewalk hit a 2-inch gas line, said Durham police spokesman Wil Glenn. The search-and-rescue mission has given way to a cleanup operation. Workers were using heavy-duty backpack blowers to clear debris on the ground and firefighters were spraying the remaining hot spots with water.

One of the critically injured patients was taken to the North Carolina Jaycee Burn Center in Chapel Hill, VanVleet said.

He was in surgery, the chief said. Authorities asked people to avoid the Brightleaf Square area and warned that parts of downtown will be closed, possibly for a couple of days, as they conduct their investigation.

Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are dealing with college cheating scandal in different ways,rss.cnn.com,Faith Karimi,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_entertainment/~3/GM02w8hYiIQ/index.html,"(CNN) Of the 50 people caught up in the largest college admissions cheating scheme ever prosecuted in the United States, actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin have become the faces of the scandal, with many wondering whether they will end up behind bars.
Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman make court appearances in college admissions scandal Huffman and Loughlin are among 33 parents accused of using their wealth to cheat on standardized tests for their children, and bribe college administrators and coaches who had major clout when it came to admissions. The investigation took a crucial turn Monday when Huffman and a dozen other parents and one coach agreed to plead guilty to mail fraud and other forms of bribery, highlighting the separate actions both women have taken since the scandal broke. Here are the different ways the actresses have dealt with the fallout: Felicity Huffman Read More What is she accused of? Huffman has agreed to plead guilty to paying $15,000 to a fake charity associated with Rick Singer to facilitate cheating for her daughter on the SATs. Singer ran a college prep business, and helped wealthy parents cheat on standardized tests for their children. He also bribed college coaches to designate children falsely as recruited athletes, smoothing their path to admission, a criminal complaint says. Felicity Huffman's Netflix film won't release in April as scheduled Huffman and Singer exchanged emails about how to get extra time on her daughter's SAT, the complaint says. They arranged for Huffman's daughter to take the SAT at a location controlled by an administrator bribed by Singer, the complaint says. The daughter got a score of 1420 out of a maximum 1600 on the SAT, about 400 points over her Preliminary SAT exam a year earlier. Does she plan to plead guilty? Yes. As a result, federal prosecutors will recommend incarceration at the ""low end"" of the sentencing range, a $20,000 fine and 12 months of supervised release, according to a plea agreement. Prosecutors recommended a range of sentences for those pleading guilty, from 12 to 18 months. A federal judge will have the final say on the outcome for Huffman and the other defendants. In addition to lower sentencing, prosecutors will not bring further charges, the plea agreement says. What has she said about the alleged scandal? She issued an apology and took responsibility for her actions, saying her daughter was not aware of the payment. She said she had betrayed her daughter and wouldn't make any excuses for breaking the law. ""I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done ... and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,"" she said in a statement. ""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly."" Felicity Huffman will plead guilty to paying $15,000 to facilitate cheating for her daughter on the SAT. How much prison time is she facing? It's unclear whether a guilty plea will mean no time in prison. Prosecutors have said they will be asking for jail time for all defendants, according to a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation. The defendants are facing anywhere between six to 21 months in prison if convicted or if they plead guilty, but the exact sentence will depend on several factors, the official added. Has the fallout affected her acting career? A Netflix comedy film starring Huffman won't be hitting the streaming platform on April 26, its previously scheduled release date. ""Otherhood"" is about three mothers who move from the suburbs to New York so they can reconnect with their children. While it is not uncommon for film release dates to shift, news of the film's pushback came a day after the ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""American Crime"" actress entered her plea in the college admissions scam. Lori Loughlin What is she accused of? Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are accused of paying $500,000 to a fake charity to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew recruits. Their daughters did not participate in the sport. Does she plan to plead guilty? The couple appeared last week in federal court in Boston, but they have not publicly indicated how they plan to plead. Loughlin and 15 other parents now face an additional charge of money laundering in addition to last month's charges of conspiracy to commit fraud. They were charged Tuesday in a superseding indictment with conspiring to launder bribes and other payments through Singer's charity, prosecutors said. The added charges came a day after Huffman and others agreed to plead guilty in the case. Lori Loughlin and her husband are accused of paying $500,000 to get their daughters into USC. What has she said about the alleged scandal? Not much. Late last month, the actress was caught on video by paparazzi in Los Angeles and said she was sorry, but she couldn't talk about her legal issues. ""You can follow me around all day if you want, but I just can't comment right now,"" Loughlin said. ""But thank you for your time."" How much prison time is she facing? The charges of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud are punishable by a maximum 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. The charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering is punishable by a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, according to federal officials. Has the fallout affected her acting career? The ""Full House"" actress was dropped by the Hallmark Channel and other brands in the wake of last month's charges. Sephora also ended a makeup partnership with her daughter, the social media influencer Olivia Jade, who was a student at USC."
Bernie Sanders unveils more ambitious new Medicare for All plan - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Tami Luhby,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-2020/index.html,"(CNN) Hours after unveiling his new Medicare for All proposal, Sen. Bernie Sanders on Wednesday said he would support changing the legislative filibuster rules in order to pass the bill in the Senate.
Sanders has frequently raised doubts over using the so-called nuclear option to advance his big-ticket policy agenda, but in a statement to CNN said his Medicare for All push would not be halted if support fell short of the current threshold, which effectively requires 60 votes to advance a bill. ""In terms of Medicare for All, before we even get to the issue of the filibuster, we need 51 senators who are prepared to do what polls show that rank and file Democrats want -- and that is a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system,"" Sanders said. ""Once we have, and I believe it will be sooner than later, a Democratic majority who are prepared to vote for Medicare for All in the House and Senate, we will pass it."" Sanders noted that his Medicare for All bill, which was cosponsored by four fellow 2020 Democratic presidential rivals, currently has only 15 ""publicly stated"" backers in the Senate. ""That has got to change,"" he said, pushing his liberal colleagues to embrace his signature policy priority. ""In my view, Democratic elected officials and candidates should do what grassroots Democrats want them to do."" The move would not wipe out the filibuster entirely, Sanders' office said. Read More ""Bernie would support reforming the current filibuster rules to maintain the talking filibuster while eventually allowing legislation like Medicare for All to pass with a simple majority,"" Sanders aide Josh Miller-Lewis told CNN. In his statement, Sanders also suggested that he would consider using budget reconciliation rules to pass Medicare for All. ""It is the vice president who determines what is and is not permissible under budget reconciliation,"" Sanders said, suggesting that he would be willing to overrule a skeptical Senate parliamentarian. ""I can tell you that a vice president in a Bernie Sanders administration will determine that Medicare for All can pass through the Senate under reconciliation and is not in violation of the rules."" Expected to stoke debate on 2020 trail Sanders -- an independent who caucuses with the Democrats and is again seeking their party's nomination -- introduced the revamped proposal in the midst of a charged political moment, as the presidential primary heats up and the Trump administration makes a fresh push to topple Obamacare in the courts. But even as they circle the wagons around the current law, Democrats are eyeing the future -- and the prospects of enacting a single-payer system that would fundamentally re-order American life well beyond doctors' offices and emergency rooms. The decision to move forward now is also expected to stoke a more pointed debate on the 2020 presidential primary circuit, where top contenders -- including Sens. Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker, who all cosponsored the Medicare for All bill -- are being faced with a high-stakes new question over the role of private insurance companies. Sanders, through this legislation, is determined to put the industry out of business. The other four, and a raft more who do not support the bill, have all said the private insurers are either inescapable or, as many moderates argue, vital cogs in America's health care system. Trump attorney general on ACA lawsuit: 'Let the courts do their job' At a Wednesday morning event on Capitol Hill, Sanders cast the movement supporting the legislation in historical terms. ""We are involved in a great struggle not unlike, to be honest with you, the struggles of the labor movement, the struggles of the civil rights movement, the struggles of the women's movement, the struggles of the gay community, the struggles of the environmental movement,"" Sanders said. ""This is what we're about."" Asked earlier if Sanders is priming for a showdown with his 2020 opponents, including the bill's candidate-cosponsors, campaign manager Faiz Shakir laid down a marker. ""Whether it's a fight that he's going to have with them is up to them,"" Shakir said. ""This is a core pillar of why (Sanders) is running for president, a core pillar of what he would do as president. It's up to other people to determine for themselves whether and how much, how core it is for them. I will let other people decide for themselves how they'll go about it."" Much like Sanders has on the stump, Shakir predicted a sharp and expensive fight with private insurance interests to come. ""You aren't going to upend that system easily,"" he said. ""So there's going to be a bunch of lobbying groups out there (spending) hundreds of millions of dollars and you can be damn sure that they're going to decide that an advertising campaign against Bernie Sanders is a worthwhile expenditure for them -- rather than providing health care coverage for people."" At the Wednesday rally in Washington, Gillibrand, the only cosponsor in attendance, said that universal, government-guaranteed coverage needs ""to become the next social safety net, to become something that is there for you no matter what."" The New York senator, who has supported single-payer for more than a decade and wrote the Sanders legislation's four-year transition plan, said the path to building support for the bill could be greased by allowing Americans to first buy-in to a government-run public option -- a move, she argued, that would ultimately wipe out the private insurance industry. ""I dare any insurance company to just try to compete. They won't,"" Gillibrand said. ""The insurance industry wants to make money. They are a for-profit industry. Their goals are not aligned with ours."" Booker, who was not at the rally, also discussed the bill -- and the roadblocks facing it in Congress -- during a New York radio interview. ""I think the best way to do (reach full coverage) would be to design a Medicare for All system,"" he said. ""But anybody who says those words, 'Medicare for All,' who's running for president, the next thing out of their mouth should be talking to people about, in a split Congress, what are you going to actually do in your first year to make healthcare more accessible and affordable?"" He has not discussed in detail his plan for moving it through a Senate in which Democrats lack that 60-vote supermajority. In a divided Congress, the legislation would likely be dead on arrival. Soon after Sanders' announcement, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders offered another preview of the pushback awaiting Democratic candidates who back Medicare for All. ""Democrats just announced their government takeover of healthcare plan,"" she tweeted, claiming the plan ""confiscates every American's private health insurance."" Would effectively eliminate private insurance In addition to Sanders, Gillibrand and the other three presidential hopefuls, the bill's cosponsors also include Sens. Tammy Baldwin, Richard Blumenthal, Patrick Leahy, Mazie Hirono, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Brian Schatz, Tom Udall, Sheldon Whitehouse and Martin Heinrich. A number of them, like the five candidates, have also signed on to less radical bills, some of which would create a Medicare buy-in system or expand previously existing programs. The 2019 legislation would go further than Sanders' previous plans by covering more long-term care services, bringing it closer in line with a broader House version sponsored by Washington Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal. Nursing home and other institutional coverage would still fall to Medicaid under the new bill, as it had before, while long-term care at home and in the community would be expanded. Apart from its new measures to cover long-term care, much of Sanders' proposal remains the same as what he introduced in 2017. He wants to create a federal universal health insurance program that would cover medically necessary services, prescription drugs, dental and vision services. Premiums, deductibles and co-pays would disappear, except for a potential $200 co-pay for brand-name drugs. Though many of his rivals have said they would maintain a role for private insurance, Sanders' bill would effectively eliminate the industry. Insurers would only be allowed to provide services not covered by the universal plan, such as cosmetic surgery. As for how to foot the bill, Sanders describes a litany of ways Americans are already spending billions on health care, particularly because of high administrative costs, executive pay packages and prescription drug prices. He maintains that Medicare for All, despite its cost, would save many people money. The new legislation also lists several ways to raise additional funds, including levying premiums on workers and employers; boosting income and estate tax rates; and establishing a wealth tax. The decision to extend coverage for home- and community-based long-term care was predicated on a need to help the elderly and the disabled, while extending care to rural communities, Shakir told CNN. ""It's a really critical part of whether you're going to be able to sustain life (among the elderly),"" he said. ""Home care means so much to the disability community because it is literally liberty and freedom to be able to still run their own lives and not be committed to institutions or have to travel far distances to get basic care."""

View this post on Instagram We are excited to announce that The Duke of Sussex and Oprah Winfrey are partners, co-creators and executive producers on their forthcoming mental health series launching on Apple in 2020. The pair have been developing the series for several months and are looking forward to sharing such an important project on this global platform. The dynamic multi-part documentary series will focus on both mental illness and mental wellness, inspiring viewers to have an honest conversation about the challenges each of us faces, and how to equip ourselves with the tools to not simply survive, but to thrive. This commitment builds on The Duke of Sussex's long-standing work on issues and initiatives regarding mental health, where he has candidly shared personal experience and advocated for those who silently suffer, empowering them to get the help and support they deserve. His Royal Highness has spent many years working with communities throughout the UK and young people across the Commonwealth to break the stigma surrounding mental illness and broaden the conversation of mental wellness to accelerate change for a more compassionate, connected and positive society.

Winfrey, who attended Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle -- now the Duchess of Sussex -- in May, told ""CBS This Morning"" Wednesday that the collaboration began when she was having a conversation with the prince and asked him what the most important issues facing the world were. Harry spearheaded the ""Heads Together"" campaign alongside the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, which aims to tackle the stigma surrounding mental illness. ""He said there were two,"" she said. ""He said climate change and he said mental wellness, mental fitness, mental health."" Winfrey subsequently told him about the series she was working on for Apple, upon which he expressed his interest in getting involved. ""He said at the end of the conversation 'If there is anything I can do to help..."" she recalled. The pair held secret meetings in London to pull the project together, she said. ""Our hope is that it will have an impact on reducing the stigma and allowing people to know that they are not alone, allowing people to speak up about it and being able to identify it for themselves and in their friends,"" Winfrey said. The TV star also addressed the treatment her friend Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has received in the press as Harry's wife, noting that she thinks it is unfair. Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge competed in a race to promote the ""Heads Together"" campaign in 2017. ""I feel that if people really knew her they would know that she is not only everything that we perceive of her as being graceful and dynamic in holding that position, but she just has a wonderful, warm, giving, loving heart,"" Winfrey said. The TV series will build on Harry's longstanding commitment to tackling mental health issues and raising awareness of mental illness.

Trump repeats claim he won't release his taxes while he's under audit - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Betsy Klein,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/donald-trump-taxes-release-audit/index.html,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump continues to hold the line on refusing to release his tax returns.
Speaking to reporters Wednesday, the House Ways and Means Committee's deadline for the IRS to turn over six years of his personal and business tax returns, Trump said: ""I won't do it."" ""There is no law, as you know, I got elected last time with the same issue and while I'm under audit, I won't do it. If I'm not under audit, I would do it, I have no problem with it, but while I'm under audit, I would not give my taxes,"" Trump said. Fact-checking Trump's claims he's under audit IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, appearing before a Senate Finance committee hearing on Wednesday, said that he is ""working with counsel and anticipating responding"" to the House request for Trump's returns. Rettig added that he has not either been directly or indirectly asked not to comply with Neal's request to turn over the returns from inside the White House or elsewhere. Read More He declined to answer questions after the hearing about his plans for responding to Neal. ""I am unable to discuss that with you at this moment,"" Rettig told CNN after the hearing. Technically, there's nothing preventing Trump from releasing his tax returns now. Most tax attorneys would typically advise a client against doing so if they're under audit to avoid further scrutiny. Once the tax returns are out, reporters could find something that the IRS missed. Of course, most tax attorneys don't represent presidents or people running for the White House. Regardless of those risks, past presidents released their tax returns while in office. Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush both did during their tenure. (But neither of them led a sprawling business empire like Trump, who is involved in approximately 500 corporate entities.) Trump suggested that ""frankly, the people don't care"" whether they see his tax returns, noting that he won in 2016 with the same audit issue and that he has released a 104-page summary of his assets and values. ""I built a great company, one of the best companies, I have some of the greatest assets in the world, I did a good job, and now, frankly, I don't care about them, I only care about the United States,"" Trump said Wednesday. ""But I have no obligation to do that while I'm under audit. And no lawyer would tell you to release your tax returns while you're under audit."""
Israel Folau: Australian rugby star Israel Folau criticized for homophobic posts,rss.cnn.com,"Emily Dixon, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/PMaXkfa6fX0/index.html,"(CNN) A series of ""unacceptable"" homophobic and transphobic social media comments posted by Australian rugby player Israel Folau are being investigated by the sport's governing body.
On Instagram, the New South Wales Waratahs player shared an image listing ""drunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolaters,"" reading underneath, ""Hell awaits you."" The 30-year-old Folau, who also plays for Australia's national team, captioned the image: ""Those that are living in Sin will end up in Hell unless you repent. Jesus Christ loves you and is giving you time to turn away from your sin and come to him."" He also included several Bible verses in the caption. On Tuesday, Folau posted a transphobic reaction on social media to new legislation passed in Tasmania, which became the first Australian state to make listing gender on birth certificates optional. Those aged 16 and over can now apply to change their registered gender without the approval of their parents, while transgender people will no longer be denied official recognition of their gender until they've had surgery. On Twitter, Folau shared a screenshot of an article about the legislation, writing: ""The devil has blinded so many people in this world, REPENT and turn away from your evil ways."" Read More In a statement on its website, Rugby Quote: : ""Rugby Australia is aware of a post made by Israel Folau on his Instagram account this afternoon.""

""The Rugby Australia Integrity Unit has been engaged on the matter tonight."" Homophobia in sport: English Rugby Union praised for tackling abuse In April 2018, Folau was criticized for writing in an Instagram comment that gay people would go to hell unless they repented. All Blacks player TJ Perenara and ""Thor: Ragnorok"" filmmaker Taiki Waititi were among those to condemn Folau's comments on Twitter. Welsh rugby union referee Nigel Owens, who is gay, wrote in a column for Wales Online, ""When young people in particular see comments like this, and not just from our sporting stars but from anybody, it could be enough to push those people over the edge."" 'Hate speech' Folau defended his comment in a column for Players' Voice, writing that accusations of homophobia ""could not be further from the truth."" The following month, Folau posted a video on Twitter of a sermon by American evangelist David Wilkerson, in which Wilkerson condemns ""rampant iniquity"" and ""sexual perversions beyond description"" as footage of activists waving rainbow flags plays. Speaking on Fox Sports' ""Kick & Chase"" the same month, Rugby Australia Chief Executive Raelene Castle said of Folau's homophobic comments, ""in my career this is the singularly most difficult thing I've ever had to deal with."" Castle defended Rugby Australia's decision not to sanction Folau, saying: ""On one hand it's a human rights issue but on the other hand, you're dealing with freedom of speech."" ""We've had conversations with Izzy about presenting his views in a respectful way,"" Castle said. ""He is walking the line, we will continue the dialogue."" Robbie Rogers wants change as study shows fear of homophobia in sport James Lolicato, CEO of Australian charity Proud2Play -- which ""focuses on increasing LGBTI+ engagement in sport, exercise and active recreation"" -- told CNN that Folau's latest comments ""are not only demeaning to LGBTI+ people, but also are discriminatory."" ""We see the negative consequences that arise from comments such as these from high-level players, be that of young LGBTI+ people feeling isolated and afraid to get involved in sport, or the modeling of these comments and behaviors in other people,"" Lolicato said. ""Rugby needs to look at its vilification policies and sanction Israel to show that they really are a sport for everybody,"" he added. ""We can no longer mask hate speech as 'free speech' and need to make sure that discrimination of all forms is properly tackled in sport."" Folau's New South Wales Waratahs team was not immediately available for comment. Described as a ""freak of an athlete"" with ""exceptional physical prowess,"" Folau has played 63 times for Australia.

The episode took place at a primary school in the small village of Minerbe (4,600 people), near Verona, after the girl's parents, from Morocco, fell behind in paying for her lunch fees, the mayor Andrea Girardi told CNN. ""I spoke this morning with the agent of Antonio Candreva and we agreed that Candreva will make a donation directly to the school,"" said Girardi, who belongs to the anti-immigrant League party. ""I also spoke on Sunday with Candreva. He called me. I was very surprised. He told me that he had read about the little girl tuna meal and wanted to know if he could help."" The girl's parents were nine months behind in paying for their daughter's school meals, added Girardi. On March 29, she was given tuna and crackers while the other kids had pizza, according to the mayor. Italian media reported the girl burst into tears.

He added that all 30 families -- 26 immigrant and six Italians -- have now received financial support. ""I am very happy that Candreva expressed his interest, also if he is important and gains a lot of money, it shows he cares about the others, about common people,"" Girardi said. ""The donation that Candreva is doing will be used by the school, not for the meals, since the city has already supplied founds for the families in difficulties, but to buy stationery and support the budget of the kids that can't afford other expenses as school trips.""

Champions League: Son Heung-min gives Tottenham edge over Manchester City,rss.cnn.com,"Matias Grez, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/bwk7dQiYAsk/index.html,"Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London (CNN) Son Heung-min may have struck a wonderful late winner to hand Tottenham a crucial first-leg victory over Manchester City in the Champions League quarterfinal on Tuesday, but the gloss was taken off an otherwise perfect evening as the host lost Harry Kane to injury.
The home fans held their breathe as Kane, who has scored 24 goals this season, limped off down the tunnel after rolling his ankle awkwardly under a challenge from Fabian Delph, knowing just how important the England international is for their hopes of success this season. ""It's a worry for us,"" Tottenham manager Pochettino said after the game. ""We are going to miss him -- maybe for the rest of the season. ""We hope it is not a big issue but there is not too much time to recover. He twisted his ankle so we will see how it reacts in a few hours."" Worryingly for Spurs, Kane was forced to miss almost two months of action earlier in the season after sustaining ligament damage on the same ankle. Read More Harry Kane was forced off with injury in the second half. READ: How 'Little Seoul' fell in love with its favorite Son But if there can be a silver lining for Tottenham it's that Son seems to thrive in Kane's absence. In the five weeks the striker missed through injury at the start of 2019, the South Korean scored four goals in as many games. Upon Kane's return to the starting XI, Son had managed just one goal in seven games going into Tuesday's match. It then took him just 20 minutes from Kane hobbling off the score the winner. New home Before Tuesday's clash against Manchester City, Tottenham's long-serving defender Jan Vertonghen, now in his seventh year in north London, said the opportunity to move into a new stadium comes only ""once in a generation"" for players and fans. Though the move was intended to usher in a new era and help Spurs take its place at European football's top table, the Belgian urged supporters to be patient, reminding them the team ""need time to build history"" in its new $1.3 billion home. Had this first-leg been at Wembley -- the national stadium which, at times, made for an uncomfortable temporary home for Spurs -- few would have given Pochettino's side a chance against City. Tottenham had failed to beat Guardiola's team in its previous four meetings, losing three of those, and City was on an indomitable run of 22 wins from 23 matches. But Tuesday's game felt special. The fans sensed it, too, creating a deafening, near-constant noise in the lead-up to kick off -- and the players responded. Although last Wednesday's homecoming victory against Crystal Palace was an historic moment for the club -- ""a truly emotional evening,"" as manager Pochettino described it -- the match against City offered Spurs the opportunity to prove it could truly make this new house a home. Strange City XI Tottenham's attacking trio of Kane, Son and Dele Alli was rabid from the first whistle, not allowing City's defenders to rest for a moment. It was the latter who would create the first chance of the match, winning the ball back in midfield and playing it wide to Moussa Sissoko. Tottenham's 17,500-capacity south stand, modeled on Borussia Dortmund's famous 'Yellow Wall.' The Frenchman returned the pass, lofting the ball into the box for Alli to run onto. His connection was crisp but the ball fizzed over Ederson's crossbar. For all its experience at the top level, City appeared nervous. Much was made of its inability to deal with the pressure at Anfield at this same stage last season, finishing that match on the wrong end of a 3-0 humbling. Despite the cacophony of noise inside the stadium, you could almost hear the collective sound of 120,000 eyebrows being raised as Manchester City's lineup was announced. There was only a place on the bench for star midfielders Kevin De Bruyne and Leroy Sane, while Bernardo Silva -- arguably's City's best player this season -- was left out entirely. In came Riyad Mahrez, much maligned when called upon this season, and the lesser-spotted Delph, filling in for Benjamin Mendy at left back. But with 10 minutes on the clock, and with City having barely left its half, the visiting side was gifted a route into the match. In his first foray forward, Raheem Sterling jinked and weaved his way inside onto his right foot and struck at goal, only to be denied by a last-ditch block by Danny Rose. Referee Bjorn Kuipers initially pointed for a corner, before the video assistant referee advised him to view the pitch-side monitor for a potential stray hand from the English left back. The Dutch official needed to watch merely two replays to change his decision and award what was a clear penalty. Unable to watch the same replays Kuipers had, the Spurs supporters were incensed with the decision and the sound of 60,000 simultaneous boos rumbled through the stadium.

Rising Son It would prove to be City's only real chance in a match which, from then on, looked like Tottenham's to win. From Lloris' save, six white shirts broke forward and descended onto Ederson's goal. By the end of the move, City had desperately hauled 10 of its 11 players back into the box to defend, something which would become a running theme. The half-time whistle drew a deafening roar from the home fans, who sensed this night could be different. This was only the second time in their history that Tottenham had reached this stage of the Champions League, last time being comprehensively beaten by Real Madrid. READ: Bayern Munich thump Borussia Dortmund in Bundesliga, Barcelona close in on Liga title Having never previously reached the semifinals, Spurs felt it was its place for the taking.

If anyone thought the noise inside had the stadium had been raucous previously, the fans hit new decibels celebrating the South Korean's goal. ""As a team, we never give up,"" Son told BT Sport after the match. ""We fought for 90 minutes. We were more clinical than them and deserved to win. ""I like this stadium -- it's amazing to play here and I'm really, really grateful for the opportunity."" Though Pochettino and Co. will wait anxiously for the results of Kane's scan ahead of the second-leg in eight days time, Tottenham can, for tonight at least, celebrate a victory that makes this daunting stadium feel a little more like home.

Barr: Restrictions on Mueller report grand jury material 'inflexible' - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Jeremy Herb,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/william-barr-senate-hearing/index.html,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General William Barr said Wednesday he would work with Congress to provide them additional information beyond the redacted special counsel report he plans to release publicly, but he said the restriction on including grand jury material that Democrats are demanding is ""inflexible under the law.""
Barr also explained to a Senate subcommittee why he's undertaking a review of the origins of the 2016 counterintelligence investigation into members of the Trump campaign and Russia, saying he believed spying on the Trump campaign occurred. ""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,"" Barr said. ""There were a lot of rules put in place to make sure that there's an adequate basis before our law enforcement agencies get involved in political surveillance. I'm not suggesting that those rules were violated, but I think it's important to look at that."" Barr was back on Capitol Hill Wednesday for a second day of testimony on the Justice Department budget, this time before a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, but once again special counsel Robert Mueller's report dominated the conversation. Barr reviewing origins of FBI's Russia investigation, says 'spying on a political campaign is a big deal' For many questions, Barr stuck to his line that he would be able to offer more explanation once he releases a redacted version of the Mueller report. But he did provide some new details under Senate questioning. Read More Barr told the panel, for instance, that his decision to redact information about the ""personal privacy and reputational interests of peripheral third parties"" did not apply to President Donald Trump. ""No, I'm talking about people in private life, not public office,"" Barr said. Barr also said that he spoke to Mueller about why the special counsel didn't reach a conclusion on the obstruction of justice question, and said that Mueller didn't tell him he was leaving the matter up to Congress or up to the Justice Department. Barr said he ultimately made the decision there wasn't a case to prosecute because ""that's generally how the Department of Justice works."" ""Generally, grand juries are to investigate crimes and a prosecutor's role at the end of the day is binary,"" Barr said. ""Are there charges, or no charges? Or, is this a crime or not a crime?"" At Tuesday's House hearing, Barr said he expected to release a redacted version of the Mueller report within a week, with plans to color-code redactions and provide an explanation for why material was not released publicly. But Barr sparred with House Democrats who pressed him on why he would not release grand jury material or provide the full, unredacted Mueller report to Congress. ""I don't intend at this stage to send the full, unredacted report to the committee,"" Barr said, adding that wouldn't ask a court to release grand jury material ""Until someone shows me a provision"" that allows it to be released. In the House, Barr was squaring off with Democrats who have subpoena power and have already authorized a subpoena in the Judiciary Committee to obtain the full Mueller report and underlying evidence. Democratic lawmakers expressed frustration after the hearing that Barr wouldn't answer certain questions, such as whether the White House had been briefed about the Mueller report. Senate Democrats also argued to Barr that he could provide Congress with grand jury material, saying Barr was within his discretion to go to court to do so. ""I think attempts to hide swaths of the report from public scrutiny along the way will only fuel suspicions that have been raised by many that the Justice Department, which represents the United States, is playing the role of President Trump's defense team,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. ""Your imprint on the course of justice, the rule of law, in these moments, are going to be scrutinized long after both you and I are gone from public service. The only way out in my view is transparency."" Republicans, however, suggested that providing grand jury material confidentially to Congress could result in it being leaked. ""Can we agree there is a material risk that the grand jury information would leak?"" asked Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana. ""I think so,"" Barr responded. Barr's decision to review the beginning of the 2016 counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, which was reported after his testimony Tuesday, was a topic of interest to both Democrats and Republicans. Barr said he wanted to look at all of the investigations that have already probed the matter, including Congress and the Justice Department inspector general, and see if any areas need additional investigation. ""One of the things that I want to do is pull together all the information from the various investigations that have gone on, including on the Hill, and in the department, and see if there are any remaining questions to be addressed,"" Barr said. Barr later said he did not have evidence that wrongdoing occurred in the Justice Department or the FBI, but he did have questions and concerns about what happened. ""I have no specific evidence right now that I would cite. I do have questions about it,"" Barr said. This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday."
Magic Johnson leaves Lakers front office job,rss.cnn.com,"Steve Almasy, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_sport/~3/f6put8tPioQ/index.html,"(CNN) Magic Johnson , the beloved former point guard behind five world titles for the Los Angeles Lakers, announced Tuesday night he was quitting as the team's president of basketball operations.
Johnson was in his second full season in the position for the Lakers, who are 37-44 and will be sitting out the playoffs. The Lakers website says Johnson and General Manager Rob Pelinka are responsible for all basketball-related decisions. That included firing and hiring coaches and signing players to contracts. At an impromptu news conference Johnson told shocked reporters, ""I want to go back (to) having fun. I wanna go back being who I was before taking on this job,"" according to CNN affiliate KTLA . The Lakers released a statement following Johnson's announcement. The team said it was ""deeply grateful to Magic"" for all he has done as ""a player, an ambassador and an executive."" Read More The Lakers will work ""in a measured and methodical fashion to make the right moves for the future of our organization,"" the statement said. ""We thank (Johnson) for his work these past two years as our President of Basketball Operations and wish him, Cookie, Andre, EJ and Elisa all the best with their next steps,"" the statement said. ""He will always be not only a Lakers icon, but our family."" Johnson returned to the Lakers on February 2, 2017, to advise ownership on basketball and business. He wasted no time on saying what his intentions were and he was put in charge weeks later. Jeanie Buss, controlling owner of the Lakers, announced the hiring , saying, ""Together, (Magic), Luke (Walton) and our new general manager will establish the foundation for the next generation of Los Angeles Lakers greatness."" Walton is 98-147 as coach of the Lakers, who have not had a postseason game since 2013. Johnson said Tuesday he had more fun as a mentor to players, as a big brother figure. He said he couldn't do that in his business role. He appeared to hint that he would have had to fire Walton on Wednesday, and it pushed him toward stepping down. ""Tomorrow I would have to affect somebody's livelihood and their life,"" he said. ""That's not fun for me. That's not who I am."" Johnson said his team was ""halfway"" toward the progress he once promised, with superstar LeBron James joining the team this season. He said another star will join the team this summer. ""I think this team is really going to be able to contend for championships with the growth of the young players."" The basketball hall of famer told reporters Buss didn't know Johnson was going to quit, video posted on NBA.com shows. He complained about back-stabbing and whispering. ""I don't like a lot of things that went on that didn't have to go on,"" he said."
Pentagon awards nearly $1 billion in emergency funds to build Trump's border wall - CNNPolitics,rss.cnn.com,Ryan Browne,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_us/~3/W-1xhfpEhzc/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Defense Department announced Tuesday that it had awarded $976 million in contracts to build President Donald Trump's much-sought-after border wall with a completion date for these projects of October 2020.
A $789 million contract was awarded to the Texas-based company SLSCO Ltd. for the construction of border wall in Santa Teresa, New Mexico which is located in the El Paso sector of the border. A second $187 million contract was awarded to the Montana-based Barnard Construction Company for work in Yuma, Arizona. The contracts were awarded by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Lt. Col. Jamie Davis, a spokesman for the Department of Defense, told CNN that the El Paso sector contract would include the construction of ""30-foot bollard fencing and a five-foot anti-climb plate,"" and that the Yuma Sector project will feature ""18-foot bollard fencing and a five-foot anti-climb plate."" Read More A spokesperson for the Army Corps of Engineers told CNN last month that the plan was to install 46 miles at El Paso and 11 miles of fencing at Yuma. CNN has reported that DHS had asked the Pentagon for assistance replacing existing vehicle barriers with pedestrian fencing, as well as light installation in El Paso and Yuma. These are the first border wall contracts to use Pentagon funds that the Trump administration had repurposed from other Defense Department accounts to support the border wall. CNN previously reported that the contract award was expected as early as Tuesday. The funds for the contracts are to come from the $1 billion that was recently reprogrammed from Army personnel accounts into the 284 counter-drug account that authorizes border barrier construction. That reprogramming has been opposed by some lawmakers in Congress, but the Pentagon has said it does not need congressional approval to shift the funds. As a consequence of the move, Congress has threatened to strip the Pentagon of its ability to transfer funds in the future. Officials had previously told CNN that if the contracts were awarded in mid-April, construction could begin by late May, depending on whether the Department of Homeland Security issues environmental waivers, which is sometimes done to expedite construction. The administration has previously said it plans to shift an additional $1.5 billion in Pentagon funds toward wall construction at some point. That money is separate from the $3.6 billion in military construction funds that the Trump administration has sought to tap into to fund the wall via a national emergency declaration."
Barr says 'spying on a political campaign is a big deal' - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Laura Jarrett,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/barr-doj-investiation-fbi-russia/index.html,"(CNN) Attorney General William Barr told lawmakers Wednesday that he will be looking to the ""genesis"" of the the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into potential ties between members of Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the Russian government began in 2016, saying, ""I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal"" -- echoing some of the more inflammatory claims lobbed by President Donald Trump for months, but declining to elaborate on his concerns.
Barr returns to Capitol Hill, where he'll face more Mueller questions ""I think spying did occur,"" Barr said, though he declined to provide the basis for his concern. ""The question is whether it was . . . adequately predicated."" The news will likely be viewed as a welcome development to the President, who has regularly called for an investigation and, as recently as last week, told reporters more should be done to examine the origins of the Russia probe. It will also likely raise concerns of politicization of the department's work at an already tense time, as Democrats worry that Barr is bending to the President's demands and have called on Barr to release an unredacted version of the special counsel's confidential report on the Russia investigation to Congress. Barr's own review of the FBI's counterintelligene work, first reported by Bloomberg and confirmed by a US official to CNN, was briefly touched on during his House appropriations hearing, but the attorney general went further during Wednesday's Senate appropriations hearing explaining his reasoning. Read More ""For the same reason we're worried about foreign influence in elections, I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,"" Barr said. I'm not suggesting those rules were violated but I think it's important to look at. . . . I think it's my obligation."" He added that he's not launching a full blown investigation to the FBI, and does not view it as a problem that is ""endemic"" to the FBI, but has in mind some colleagues to help him ""pull all this information together, and letting me know if there are some areas that should be looked at."" Trump said Wednesday morning that Barr was doing a ""great job"" and ""getting started on going back to the origins on where exactly this all started because it was an illegal witch hunt."" ""This was an attempted coup, this was an attempted takedown of a president,"" Trump said. The US official told CNN that Barr's review is separate from the ongoing work being conducted by the Justice Department's internal watchdog, Inspector General Michael Horowitz, but could not detail its precise scope nor explain how the work of US Attorney John Huber, who was also tasked with investigating surveillance matters, factors in at this stage, and Barr did not elaborate further. In March 2018, amid calls by Republican lawmakers for a second special counsel to investigate how the Russia investigation began, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions revealed that Huber was looking into allegations that the FBI abused its powers in surveilling former Trump foreign policy aide Carter Page -- among other issues -- and Horowitz's office confirmed it would ""review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source,"" and ""review the DOJ's and FBI's relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court) applications."" Yet those efforts by Sessions to appease Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill appeared less than sufficient at the time. Trump claimed on Twitter that the inspector general was the wrong person to probe possible FISA abuse, calling the move ""disgraceful."" Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!

"Pastor knew it was dangerous, but after Louisiana fires, he felt he had no choice but to sleep in his church - CNN",us.cnn.com,Eliott C. McLaughlin,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/black-church-fires/index.html,"Opelousas, Louisiana (CNN) As arson investigators worked to find out who has been setting Louisiana churches ablaze, the Rev. Dwight Brown slept in his church two nights last week, he said Wednesday.
""I was afraid my church was going to be targeted. My church is directly between two of the churches,"" he said. ""I wasn't going to sit there and let it burn down. It's 130 years of history. I couldn't take that chance."" Brown asked that CNN not divulge the name of his church, for fear that it could become a target, but it sits near two of the three churches that burned in recent weeks in St. Landry Parish, about an hour's drive west of Baton Rouge. Firefighters respond to a fire at Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas on Thursday. Police say three black churches were intentionally torched over a 10-day span: St. Mary Baptist Church in Port Barre on March 26, Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas on April 2 and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church on Thursday. Officials are also investigating a fourth, smaller fire on March 31 at the predominantly white Vivian United Pentecostal Church in Caddo Parish, more than 200 miles north of St. Landry. The blaze was intentionally set, officials said. Read More Brown, a law enforcement officer, attended services at his church for more than three decades before becoming pastor there. His church was founded in 1889.

— Darran Simon (@darransimon) April 9, 2019 He's heard of other pastors sleeping in cars outside their churches, he said. Brown stopped sleeping in his church over the weekend, after taking precautions to safeguard it, including removing the church's sign and installing cameras inside the church and at its entrance. He also stops in every night and turns on a light, and members of his congregation have begun walking by the church during the day and giving each other updates, he said. More questions than answers It is still unclear who is responsible for the fires and will likely take investigators time to sift through what evidence remains to determine if the blazes are connected. ""We believe these three fires are suspicious,"" State Fire Marshal Butch Browning said. ""We are falling short of talking about what caused the fires, falling short of saying they are related, however cognizant that there is a problem and no coincidence that there are three fires."" Residents and worshipers in St. Landry Parish, where all three fires occurred, are withholding judgment about what may have caused them, even as officials say they contained ""suspicious elements"" and the episodes evoke recollections of past acts of hate against black churches. A firefighter stands outside the door to Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church on Thursday. ""I feel our district was being targeted because all three of the churches were in our district,"" Pastor Freddie Jack, the Seventh District Missionary Baptist Association president, said Monday. The NAACP labeled the fires ""domestic terrorism,"" adding the ""spike in church burnings in Southern states is a reflection of the emboldened racial rhetoric and tension spreading across the country."" St. Landry Parish is nearly 42% black. Opelousas is 75% black. The city's mayor, Julius Alsandor, called the church burnings ""hideous."" ""The relevance and the impact on the people in the surrounding communities and especially the congregation of each of these churches, it's hurtful and there may be some fear that is being exhibited by those who are a part of the three churches,"" he said. For now, fear and confusion is the norm for congregants.

""We will let the authorities handle that, but we just know a higher power and a higher authority who can bring this thing to fruition."" In an appeal for the public's help, Gov. John Bel Edwards said he directed local, state and federal authorities to ""aggressively investigate"" the fires. ""Churches are sacred places, and no one should fear for their safety in their house of worship,"" he said. ""And no one should be concerned that their house of worship would be destroyed.""

Bernie Sanders' truly awful answer on his newfound millionaire status - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/bernie-sanders-taxes-millionaire/index.html,"(CNN) Bernie Sanders is (finally) going to release his tax returns. But questions over how he handles his wealth in the context of his campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination remain. And the early returns should be concerning to Sanders' backers.
In an interview with The New York Times on Tuesday , Sanders said that ""April 15 is coming,"" adding, ""We wanted to release 10 years of tax returns. April 15, 2019, will be the 10th year, so I think you will see them."" (Sanders, despite effectively running for president without pause since 2015, has released only a single, two-page summary for one year of his tax returns.) THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!

Reminded by the Times reporter that he is now someone of considerable means, Sanders retorted: ""I wrote a best-selling book. If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too."" Uh, what? Sanders got a pass on some of his acerbic-ness during the 2016 presidential campaign because a) most people didn't think he could win and b) others found it part of his cantankerous but righteous personality. But let's think about that campaign for another minute. Close your eyes and imagine if Hillary Clinton, who beat Sanders for the Democratic nomination, when asked about the extent of her wealth, said ""I wrote a best-selling book. If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too."" Read More She would have been pilloried! People would have blasted Clinton for being out of touch with the average person who, obvi, doesn't have the opportunity to write a book -- best-selling or not. Telling the average middle-class American that they too can be rich if they only write a best-selling book is like telling them that if they would just star in a movie then they could be a big star, too. Yes, it's true. No, for almost everyone, it's not realistic. In 2016, Clinton was the frontrunner -- and most of the attention and energy in the political media was focused on her. But now Sanders is one of the frontrunners. Which means that he simply cannot be as dismissive, curt or out-of-touch as his ""write a best-selling book"" comments come off. Then there is the broader problem of Sanders' wealth as it relates to his core campaign message that ""millionaires and billionaires"" have cornered far too much wealth and power in this country -- and need to be reined in by a more activist federal government. Now that Sanders is one of those ""millionaires and billionaires,"" it could complicate that message -- and his appeal as the underfunded outsider taking on the monied interested in Washington. Faiz Shakir, Sanders' campaign manager, told CNN on Tuesday night that the senator ""believes in opportunity for all, and the fact that he is somebody who has personally benefited from that opportunity is something that he feels should be a shared opportunity with everyone else. He's made some money off a book. And I think that the opportunity that he has had is evaporating for so many others. He feels that strongly."" Sanders, talking to the Times, tried to draw a line between himself and the likes of President Donald Trump, a self-described billionaire. ""Not being a billionaire, not having investments in Saudi Arabia, wherever he has investments, all over the world, mine will be a little bit more boring,"" Sanders said of his returns when compared to those of Trump's. (The President has never released any of his tax returns and pledged again Wednesday morning that he is under no obligation to do so.) On the most practical level, Sanders is right. He isn't as rich as Trump. There's a big difference between a millionaire and a billionaire. And there's no reason that someone who is wealthy can't speak powerfully about the economic plight of the less fortunate and the deeply negative impact the wealthiest of Americans are having on society. But this is politics. And the combination of Sanders now being a member of the economic strata he has long derided and his totally tone-deaf answer on how he got there spells at least the potential for trouble down the line for the Vermont senator."
Champions League: Son Heung-min gives Tottenham edge over City,rss.cnn.com,"Matias Grez, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_football/~3/bwk7dQiYAsk/index.html,"Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, London (CNN) Son Heung-min may have struck a wonderful late winner to hand Tottenham a crucial first-leg victory over Manchester City in the Champions League quarterfinal on Tuesday, but the gloss was taken off an otherwise perfect evening as the host lost Harry Kane to injury.
The home fans held their breathe as Kane, who has scored 24 goals this season, limped off down the tunnel after rolling his ankle awkwardly under a challenge from Fabian Delph, knowing just how important the England international is for their hopes of success this season. ""It's a worry for us,"" Tottenham manager Pochettino said after the game. ""We are going to miss him -- maybe for the rest of the season. ""We hope it is not a big issue but there is not too much time to recover. He twisted his ankle so we will see how it reacts in a few hours."" Worryingly for Spurs, Kane was forced to miss almost two months of action earlier in the season after sustaining ligament damage on the same ankle. Read More Harry Kane was forced off with injury in the second half. READ: How 'Little Seoul' fell in love with its favorite Son But if there can be a silver lining for Tottenham it's that Son seems to thrive in Kane's absence. In the five weeks the striker missed through injury at the start of 2019, the South Korean scored four goals in as many games. Upon Kane's return to the starting XI, Son had managed just one goal in seven games going into Tuesday's match. It then took him just 20 minutes from Kane hobbling off the score the winner. New home Before Tuesday's clash against Manchester City, Tottenham's long-serving defender Jan Vertonghen, now in his seventh year in north London, said the opportunity to move into a new stadium comes only ""once in a generation"" for players and fans. Though the move was intended to usher in a new era and help Spurs take its place at European football's top table, the Belgian urged supporters to be patient, reminding them the team ""need time to build history"" in its new $1.3 billion home. Had this first-leg been at Wembley -- the national stadium which, at times, made for an uncomfortable temporary home for Spurs -- few would have given Pochettino's side a chance against City. Tottenham had failed to beat Guardiola's team in its previous four meetings, losing three of those, and City was on an indomitable run of 22 wins from 23 matches. But Tuesday's game felt special. The fans sensed it, too, creating a deafening, near-constant noise in the lead-up to kick off -- and the players responded. Although last Wednesday's homecoming victory against Crystal Palace was an historic moment for the club -- ""a truly emotional evening,"" as manager Pochettino described it -- the match against City offered Spurs the opportunity to prove it could truly make this new house a home. Strange City XI Tottenham's attacking trio of Kane, Son and Dele Alli was rabid from the first whistle, not allowing City's defenders to rest for a moment. It was the latter who would create the first chance of the match, winning the ball back in midfield and playing it wide to Moussa Sissoko. Tottenham's 17,500-capacity south stand, modeled on Borussia Dortmund's famous 'Yellow Wall.' The Frenchman returned the pass, lofting the ball into the box for Alli to run onto. His connection was crisp but the ball fizzed over Ederson's crossbar. For all its experience at the top level, City appeared nervous. Much was made of its inability to deal with the pressure at Anfield at this same stage last season, finishing that match on the wrong end of a 3-0 humbling. Despite the cacophony of noise inside the stadium, you could almost hear the collective sound of 120,000 eyebrows being raised as Manchester City's lineup was announced. There was only a place on the bench for star midfielders Kevin De Bruyne and Leroy Sane, while Bernardo Silva -- arguably's City's best player this season -- was left out entirely. In came Riyad Mahrez, much maligned when called upon this season, and the lesser-spotted Delph, filling in for Benjamin Mendy at left back. But with 10 minutes on the clock, and with City having barely left its half, the visiting side was gifted a route into the match. In his first foray forward, Raheem Sterling jinked and weaved his way inside onto his right foot and struck at goal, only to be denied by a last-ditch block by Danny Rose. Referee Bjorn Kuipers initially pointed for a corner, before the video assistant referee advised him to view the pitch-side monitor for a potential stray hand from the English left back. The Dutch official needed to watch merely two replays to change his decision and award what was a clear penalty. Unable to watch the same replays Kuipers had, the Spurs supporters were incensed with the decision and the sound of 60,000 simultaneous boos rumbled through the stadium. Hugo Lloris saves Sergio Aguero's first-half penalty. READ: Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's bizarre miss forces PSG to wait for Ligue 1 title Up stepped Sergio Aguero, faced not only by Hugo Lloris in the Tottenham goal but also the vast, imposing single-tier stand at the south end of the stadium. Modeled on the stand which houses Borussia Dortmund's famous 'Yellow Wall,' the 17,500 fans erupted as Lloris guessed the right way and palmed away Aguero's tame penalty. Rising Son It would prove to be City's only real chance in a match which, from then on, looked like Tottenham's to win. From Lloris' save, six white shirts broke forward and descended onto Ederson's goal. By the end of the move, City had desperately hauled 10 of its 11 players back into the box to defend, something which would become a running theme. The half-time whistle drew a deafening roar from the home fans, who sensed this night could be different. This was only the second time in their history that Tottenham had reached this stage of the Champions League, last time being comprehensively beaten by Real Madrid. READ: Bayern Munich thump Borussia Dortmund in Bundesliga, Barcelona close in on Liga title Having never previously reached the semifinals, Spurs felt it was its place for the taking. With barely 10 minutes left on the clock, Son feinted his way past Delph and drilled a low shot through Ederson in the City goal. If anyone thought the noise inside had the stadium had been raucous previously, the fans hit new decibels celebrating the South Korean's goal. ""As a team, we never give up,"" Son told BT Sport after the match. ""We fought for 90 minutes. We were more clinical than them and deserved to win. ""I like this stadium -- it's amazing to play here and I'm really, really grateful for the opportunity."" Though Pochettino and Co. will wait anxiously for the results of Kane's scan ahead of the second-leg in eight days time, Tottenham can, for tonight at least, celebrate a victory that makes this daunting stadium feel a little more like home.

With Smalling likely to start at the heart of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's defense and Messi intent on performing the role immortalized by his unparalleled phenomenon, the pair will -- by the game's close -- be well-acquainted. To leave Messi unattended is, at best, unwise. Mikael Silvestre -- a Champions League winner during his time at Manchester United -- acknowledged that it is Messi's divine brilliance that stands in his former team's way on its path to an unlikely semifinal place. ""Barcelona -- except 'God' (Messi) -- is a team that you can stop over two games,"" Silvestre told CNN Sport last month. ""I think United can stop Barcelona and progress."" Given both the Catalan side's style of play and the central importance of Messi, Silvestre is well aware of the grit and good fortune necessary if his former club is to remain in the game for long enough to concern the five-time winners. Read More READ: How 'Little Seoul' fell in love with its favorite Son Messi has scored 108 Champons League goals, including eight hat-tricks, as well as making 30 assists. ""They did it against Paris [in the previous round, where United overcame a 2-0 first-leg deficit to win on away goals]. They ended up playing with Mason Greenwood, Tahith Chong, James Garner -- the three youngsters -- in the Parc des Princes. ""It was an inspiring performance, with that mental ability to stay in the game and believe and to never ever give up. It is in the club's DNA -- that never-give-up attitude."" Messi, though remains the key. As a defender who racked up 249 appearances during the Alex Ferguson era, Silvestre has a warning for his former team. JUST WATCHED Tottenham's new hi-tech stadium

""[Stopping him] has been done before,"" he points out. ""We know how to do it."" Indeed, Silvestre himself has managed it; he came on as a late substitute when United beat Barcelona by a single goal in the 2008 semifinal. More than a decade on, though, Messi's icon has more than stood the test of time. That the Argentine has not been crowned as the world's greatest player since claiming his fifth Ballon d'Or title in 2015 is, in many ways, a red herring. Mikael Silvestre was part of the Manchester United squad that won the 2007/08 Champions League, coming on as a substitute against Barcelona at Old Trafford in the second leg of the 1-0 semifinal aggregate win. READ: How a painting helped soccer great Buffon cope with depression Timeless supremacy His unique ability has never declined, and nor have his own numbers; 26 goals in the 2015/16 La Liga season have subsequently been followed by 37 and 34, with the Argentine great sat on 33 with seven games of the current season remaining -- a year dominated by his Barcelona side. In this year's Champions League, Messi's six appearances have brought with them eight goals and a further three assists. It is a run that has added to an already exceptional overall record in Europe's major club competition; 108 goals in 131 appearances give him a superior minutes per goal ratio to that of his great rival Cristiano Ronaldo, though the Argentine remains 16 strikes behind the Juventus forward's 124. The duo's long-running battle for footballing supremacy has seen them competing in a competition of their own. Former Real Madrid captain Raul Gonzalez is the pair's closest challenger -- but even his 71 goals place him 37 behind Messi. Of those still active, Karim Benzema is the next closest, but his Champions League tally of 60 is less than halfway to Ronaldo's astronomic figure.

Yet, for almost as long as the theory has existed, it is a label that Messi has confounded. There are, of course, occasional outliers. Messi's record against Chelsea, for example, sits at just three goals in 10 games. However, his history with Manchester United is different. Although it currently shows just two goals in four games, those strikes came in the 2009 and 2011 finals. His performance at Wembley in the latter of the two is remembered for its sheer majesty, as Barcelona cruised to a 3-1 victory. READ: Tottenham edge out Manchester City but lose Harry Kane to injury Some hope, perhaps, for the Old Trafford faithful comes in Messi's record on English soil. While hardly a goalscoring famine, Messi has netted eight times in 15 games in England, as opposed to 13 in 14 matches at the Camp Nou. Indeed, he is also without a goal in his last 11 Champions League quarterfinals. Whether that is an omen for Solskjaer's side -- good or bad -- remains to be seen."

High-threat countries including Uganda will now be labeled with a ""K"" in order to ""communicate more clearly to US citizens the risks of kidnapping and hostage taking by criminal and terrorist actors around the world,"" the department said Tuesday.

Israeli exit polls leave Benjamin Netanyahu's re-election plans in limbo,rss.cnn.com,Oren Liebermann,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_meast/~3/auGXBiHqI4I/index.html,"Jerusalem (CNN) Benjamin Netanyahu's hopes of securing a record fifth term as Israeli Prime Minister are on hold for the moment, after early results showed a tight election race with his main rival.
Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party appear neck and neck with the centrist Blue and White party led by Benny Gantz, with more than 90% of votes counted. Both sides are projected to win 35 seats each based on actual results, report Israel's Channel 12 and 13. Netanyahu's Likud party has secured 26.28% of the vote so far, while Gantz's Blue and White has 25.97% -- a difference of less than 13,000 votes, according to the results from the Central Elections Committee. But Netanyahu may have the advantage when it comes to putting together a coalition. His bloc, made up of the right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties, has 65 seats according to the latest results. A center-left bloc led by Gantz looks to have only 55 seats. To form a governing coalition, a candidate will need to put together 61 seats in the Israeli Knesset. Read More This picture could yet change if some of the smaller right-wing parties decide to support Gantz, a move observers say is unlikely. With no clear winner having yet to emerge, both Netanyahu and Gantz claimed victory on Tuesday evening. ""The right-wing bloc led by the Likud won a clear victory. I thank the citizens of Israel for the trust. I will start forming a right-wing government with our natural partners as soon as tonight,"" Netanyahu said. Gantz, meanwhile, said the election had one clear winner and that he, not Netanyahu, should be called on to form the next government. ""We won! The Israeli public has had their say!"" Gantz said in a statement. ""These elections have a clear winner and a clear loser. Netanyahu promised 40 seats and lost. The President can see the picture and should call on the winner to form the next government. There is no other option!"" Officially, it's up to Israel's President to decide who is tasked with forming the next government. He announces his decision after consulting with the heads of the political parties that have secured enough votes to enter the Knesset. These consultations take a few days, and the President is likely to announce his decision about a week after the elections. Netanyahu prepares to cast his vote on Tuesday. Gantz waves to his supporters after casting his vote earlier Tuesday. Netanyahu's veer to the right A tense night beckons for Netanyahu as he waits to see if his dream of becoming Israel's longest ever serving leader will be fulfilled. He would pass the founder of the state, David Ben Gurion, during the summer. Most of the final pre-election polls on Friday showed Netanyahu trailing by a few seats to Gantz. Casting himself as the underdog, Netanyahu veered sharply to his right in the final days of the campaign, pledging to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected, and warning his voter base that the end of his strong right-wing government would signal the beginning of a weak left-wing government. How Israel's political debate moved from peace talks to annexation Netanyahu fought the election in the face of looming indictments for bribery and breach of trust offenses. His campaign sought to portray his pending indictments as a witch-hunt led by left-wing elites and fed by the media. As CNN discovered when it visited a Likud stronghold in Beersheva, that message resonated strongly with many blue-collar Israelis. The local Likud organizer in the town compared Netanyahu to Moses, saying, ""The more they go after him, the stronger he becomes."" The election was called in December, ostensibly after the government gave up on efforts to get a new military draft law through Parliament. Netanyahu believed the timing was right -- sending voters to the polls before any indictments were brought against him, and with a message he could sell to the electorate. Speaking to his Likud lawmakers on the day the election was called, he said the outgoing government had ""outstanding achievements"" on which to campaign. Gantz enters the fray At first facing a diverse array of opponents, Netanyahu saw his challenge crystallize after a dramatic announcement in February, which saw three former army chiefs come together with a former TV news anchor-turned-politician to create the Blue and White party. The name was simple but significant. Blue and White are the colors of the Israeli flag. The message was equally simple: Blue and White had been created to reclaim the state of Israel from Prime Minister Netanyahu. The man who would lead that campaign and present himself as the anti-Netanyahu candidate was Gantz, a former head of the army, who had held that position under Netanyahu, fighting two wars in Gaza during his tenure. Bibi forever? Supporters in Netanyahu's heartland think so Gantz's entry into the political arena had been widely anticipated, and, indeed, hoped for in many quarters. Blue and White's polling numbers quickly surged, turning it into a two-horse race. The campaign was hard and personal. After it emerged that Iran had allegedly hacked Gantz's phone, Netanyahu questioned whether he could be trusted to keep the country safe if he couldn't look after his phone. Netanyahu loyalists also suggested Gantz had abandoned a dying soldier after an attack many years ago in the West Bank town of Nablus. Blue and White rejected the slur, and Gantz was also cleared by a military inquiry. For his part, the Prime Minister announced he intended to sue Gantz and his key ally, Moshe Ya'alon, after the latter suggested Netanyahu could be guilty of treason in connection with an investigation into military procurement. The ""Ultimate Deal"" lurks in the background During the race, Netanyahu -- known to supporters and detractors alike as ""Bibi"" -- focused on burnishing his status as a global player with close ties to both the President of the United States and the President of Russia. In a visit to Washington during the campaign, Donald Trump signed a proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, in defiance of the overwhelming international consensus. And in the election's closing days, on a visit to Moscow, Netanyahu was able to personally thank Vladimir Putin for Russia's key role in locating the body of an Israeli soldier who had been missing in Lebanon for nearly 37 years. As the election went into its final days, most polls showed Gantz with a slim lead over his rival. But the same polls suggested that Netanyahu's route to building a successful coalition would be more straightforward, due to the number of other right-wing parties projected to win seats. Why Trump and Netanyahu desperately need each other Lurking in the background throughout the campaign was the prospect that President Trump is set to unveil his plans soon for the ""Ultimate Deal"" -- his name for a peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. Nevertheless, the conflict did not play a key role in the campaign, and there was little discussion by the main parties of the merits or otherwise of pursuing a two-state solution. And whatever coalition gets built, there remains the ticking clock that is the Attorney General's intention to indict Netanyahu pending a hearing within the next few months. One more hearing is expected over the summer. Any decision by the Attorney General to press forward and bring charges is certain to change the political landscape once again. As counting gets underway, a word of caution: exit polls in Israel, as in many other places, are notoriously unreliable. Four years ago, all three main Israeli networks' exit polls were badly off. All of them significantly underestimated Netanyahu's tally of seats, and two of the three actually suggested he would lose to his then-chief rival, Isaac Herzog. In the event, Netanyahu secured 30 seats to Herzog's 24."
Steven Mnuchin doesn't seem to understand how the whole checks-and-balances thing works - CNNPolitics,us.cnn.com,Analysis by Chris Cillizza,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/steven-mnuchin-maxine-waters/index.html,"(CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was done . The clock had ticked past 5 p.m. He had been sitting in a congressional hearing and answering questions for hours. And he had a meeting.
""It will be embarrassing if I keep this person waiting for a long period of time,"" Mnuchin told House Financial Services Committee Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-California). To which she responded: ""We're all late all the time unfortunately. We're all pressed for time, and I do get it."" THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!

""If you wish to leave, you may."" 3. Mnuchin then said ""OK, so we're dismissed? Is that correct?"" 4. Waters, then, said again: ""If you wish to leave, you may leave. You're wasting your time, remember you have a foreign dignitary in your office."" 5. Mnuchin then went with a threat: ""If you'd wish to keep me here so that I don't have my important meeting and continue to grill me, then we can do that. I will cancel my meeting and I will not be back here. I will be very clear if that's the way you'd like to have this relationship."" 6. Waters said she accepted Mnuchin's offer to stay and answer questions. 7. ""No, I didn't make you an offer,"" Mnuchin replied. 8. Mnuchin then asked Waters again to dismiss him: ""You're supposed to take the gravel [sic] and bang it, that's the appropriate ..."" 9. Waters shot back: ""Please do not instruct me as to how I am to conduct this committee."" And, scene . You can -- and MUST -- watch the whole thing here . Mnuchin asks to be dismissed. Waters says no. pic.twitter.com/rYkuBl3HXO
— Manu Raju (@mkraju) April 9, 2019 This is far from the first time that Mnuchin has clashed with the new Democratic majority in the House. Following a Mnuchin classified briefing on the Trump administration's decisions to drop some Russia sanction, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) called it ""a waste of time"" and ""one of the worst classified briefings."" Mnuchin has also drawn the ire of House Democrats with his dismissive and vague answers about whether he plans to approve the handing-over of Trump's tax returns to Ways and Committee Chairman Richard Neal (Massachusetts). And with his decision to no-show a House committee hearing about the economic impacts of the government shutdown. There's a pattern here. Mnuchin, like Trump, comes from the business world. And Mnuchin, again like Trump, isn't used to having to be answerable to much of anyone -- apart, perhaps, from stockholders. The idea that he not only has to appear before Congress intermittently but also sit and take the slings and arrows (aka questions) thrown at him by the likes of Waters galls him. He quite clearly views the whole thing as a giant waste of his time, and not something to miss an ""important meeting"" for. Here's the problem with that worldview: The Constitution lays out the separation of power between the three co-equa l branches of the government , and the need for checks and balances within that system. ""In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself,"" wrote James Madison in Federalist Papers #51. Mnuchin either isn't familiar with the whole checks-and-balances thing -- or thinks it doesn't apply to him. Either way, that's troubling."

Missing Americans in the Dominican Republice: Friend wishes she could have held her hand before she died - CNN,us.cnn.com,Madeline Holcombe,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/us/missing-americans-dominican-republic-friend/index.html,"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) A man and woman missing for two weeks likely died after a car accident in the Dominican Republic, authorities said. Although their bodies were found within days of the wreck, family and friends are only now learning what happened to them.
The National Police believe the car Orlando Moore and Portia Ravenelle were in plunged into the ocean in the early hours of March 27, not long after the pair left for the airport to catch a flight home to New York. A body fitting the description of Moore was found at sea in an advanced stage of decomposition, police said. A woman later identified as Ravenelle was found on the airport road on the day of the wreck but died in an ICU eight days later, they said, without explaining how or why she might have ended up on the road. ""She had to die by herself,"" family friend Francesca Figueroa told CNN. ""When one of us could have been there holding her hand."" Friends with Moore for about 25 years, Figueroa said she thinks of him as family. Both Moore and Ravenelle, friends who worked together, spent the night before their trip to the Dominican Republic at Figueroa's having dinner and watching a movie.

Missing New York couple's bodies may have been found days ago, Dominican Republic officials say They were due back in New York on March 27 at 5:45 a.m., Figueroa said. When they didn't return, Figueroa said her family started looking for them. Figueroa said she spoke to a US Embassy representative on March 31 who told her ""no bodies were found, there were no dead bodies reported, no accidents, no one was in jail."" She said she was relieved. Perhaps they were just lost. But on Tuesday, she learned that her friends likely were in a car accident on the way to the airport to go back home. ""I am saddened it took this many days to find out,"" Figueroa said. She was in intensive care for eight days National Police Col. Frank Félix Durán Mejia said Tuesday that an unconscious woman was found on the road to the international airport in Santo Domingo on March 27 and taken to a hospital. Fingerprints were used to identified the woman as Ravenelle, Durán Mejia said. Hospital spokesman Dario Mañon said she arrived with severe trauma and contusions to the head. It was about 12 hours after the pair's missed flight had left for New York. He said Ravenelle died on April 4, before she was in a condition in which hospital officials could take her photo and share it with the media. Authorities asked Tuesday for a photo taken while she was in intensive care, he said. Mañon told CNN that no one from her family or friends had called the hospital looking for her. Authorities are working to confirm an identity Portia Ravenelle, left, went sightseeing with Canadians Carter Warrington, center, and Cheryl Freeman, right. Airport surveillance cameras show that the two never made it inside the airport building on the morning of their flight. Authorities said there was no evidence of foul play. Fishermen reported seeing a vehicle at the bottom of the sea, but because of rough conditions, divers have not been able to identify the vehicle, Durán Mejia said. On March 31, the body of a man fitting the description of Moore was found at sea near Sans Souci, Durán Mejia said. The body had a tattoo that read ""Milan"" on its right arm, police said. Figueroa confirmed to the police on Tuesday that Moore has a tattoo with his daughter's name, ""Milan,"" on his arm. Autopsies of both bodies are underway, with results expected next week, Durán Mejia said. ""Everybody is devastated. Everybody is devastated,"" Figueroa said. ""His daughter is devastated, everybody is devastated, as I am, as my husband, as the mayor, as everybody in this town is because he's well known in this town. You go on the corner, and everybody knows Orlando."" They planned to drive at night for early morning flight Cheryl Freeman and Portia Ravenelle in Samama, Dominican Republic. Cheryl Freeman and her boyfriend said that they spent time with Moore and Ravenelle while on vacation in the resort town of Samana. Freeman said Moore and Ravenelle had a 2 a.m. flight and were driving a rental car to the airport. Ravenelle expressed anxiety about driving at night and said the rental company warned them to not stop and open their windows for anyone because the locals know which cars are rentals and try to mug tourists, Freeman said. How a missing couple from New York spent their last day in the Dominican Republic Ravenelle repeatedly asked Moore if he was sure they had enough gas to make it to the airport. She kept checking to make sure their phones were charged enough to use the GPS, Freeman said. After the pair left, Freeman's boyfriend sent Moore an email wishing them a safe flight. He never heard back from him. Freeman said she did not realize the two had gone missing until she returned home to Halifax, Nova Scotia, on March 31 and discovered several emails from Ravenelle's family. Traffic police investigators are conducting a review of the area of the supposed wreck site, Durán Mejia said. No police report was filed with respect to the location and there is no indication the pair's vehicle hit another vehicle there, he said. There is no word yet on the transportation of the pair's remains to the United States, Durán Mejia said, noting paperwork must be completed."

Albanian airport heist: Robbers make off with huge cash haul from Austrian Airlines plane,us.cnn.com,"Matthew Robinson, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/europe/albania-airport-heist-robber-killed-intl-scli/index.html,"(CNN) Armed robbers have made off with a large cash haul seized from an Austrian Airlines plane just about to take off from an airport in Albania.
The masked assailants broke onto the runway of Tirana International Airport, close to the Albanian capital, Tuesday through a fire services entrance, and stole a shipment of money destined for Vienna, Albanian state police told CNN in a statement. A police chase ensued and one of the gunmen was shot death. He was found to have been armed with an assault weapon, a grenade and a magazine of bullets, according to media reports from the scene. ""During the pursuit on a secondary road, the perpetrators exchanged fire with the police, and during this exchange one of the perpetrators lost his life,"" police said. Police arrested four of the attackers and questioned 40 others following the incident, the AFP news agency reported.

""Security of life, property and national security prevail over all other interests,"" he said. Defense Minister Olta Xhaçka wrote on Twitter that military police and members of the special forces will guard the perimeter of the airport.

Man shot after he allegedly robbed the Bellagio and tried to steal a car in valet Witnesses reported that the assailants, dressed in military uniforms, approached airport staff working by the plane when the engines were already running, and ordered them to the ground. They then took the cargo of cash that had been loaded into the hold. Austrian Airlines spokeswoman Tanja Gruber told CNN that the airline was ""glad that neither passengers nor crew were hurt during the incident."" ""Safety is our top priority at Austrian Airlines and as a first measure we decided to stop the transport of valuable cargo to and from Tirana airport,"" she said. ""We are currently gathering and joining forces in order to develop further measures. Tirana Airport has as well increased its security measures immediately."" Gruber told CNN that the exact value of the goods stolen couldn't yet be confirmed, but initial reports from local media suggest that at least €2.5 million ($2.8 million) was taken. The airline said in a statement that local authorities inspected the aircraft following the incident and it was able to depart for Vienna 2 hours 40 minutes behind schedule. Shipments of large amounts of money regularly pass through Tirana International Airport, as Albania's central bank does not accept deposits of hard currency from foreign banks operating in the country. Tuesday's incident is not the first armed robbery at the airport. In 2016, three masked robbers entered the terminal and stole up to €3 million ($3.38 million) that was destined to be transported abroad. CNN's Aldona Gashi contributed to this report."
Modi biopic banned during Indian election,us.cnn.com,"Manveena Suri, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/asia/modi-biopic-india-election-intl/index.html,"New Delhi (CNN) A Bollywood biopic of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been banned from release during the country's elections, amid claims it would serve as political propaganda.
The Election Commission of India announced on Wednesday that it was halting the release of the biopic until after the elections -- which kick off on April 11 and last about six weeks. The move comes days after the film's producers announced its release would be postponed, after it failed to get a censor's certificate in time.

High school principal dies after making a bone marrow donation to save a stranger - CNN,edition.cnn.com,"Gianluca Mezzofiore and Carma Hassan, CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/health/principal-bone-marrow-donation-stranger-trnd/index.html,"(CNN) A high school principal has died after going to the hospital to donate bone marrow to try to save the life of a 14-year-old in France.
Derrick Nelson, principal of Westfield High School in New Jersey, died unexpectedly Sunday night, according to school officials. His fiancée, Sheronda Braker, said that Nelson suffered complications after his bone marrow donation. The school's newspaper reported in February that Nelson decided to donate his bone marrow to a boy in France after being contacted by Be the Match . The national bone marrow donor program told him that his blood might be a match. ""If it's just a little bit of pain for a little bit of time that can give someone years of joy, it's all worth it,"" Nelson told the paper then. In a statement to CNN, Braker said Nelson ""was a tremendous father to our beloved daughter Morgan and the best companion and life partner I could have ever asked for."" Read More ""He loved his family almost beyond belief. He was a man who carried himself with dignity, courage and compassion,"" she continued. ""His last kind and generous act on this earth in giving so someone else might live is a true testament to who he was and how he should always be remembered. We will always love him."" in a letter to parents, Westfield Public Schools Superintendent Margaret Dolan said, ""Dr. Nelson touched us all with his kindness, compassion, integrity, and endlessly positive attitude. ""We hold him and his family in our hearts as we grieve this loss together and I know you join me in granting his family the privacy they have requested."" Nelson, 44, served in the US Army Reserve for more than 20 years, according to Dolan. He joined Westfield Public Schools in 2010 as the assistant principal of Roosevelt Intermediate School. He later was assistant principal and principal of Westfield High, which has more than 1,800 students. People praised Nelson as a committed educator and a role model with a strong moral compass. His friend Salim Sivaad, also known as Wayne Clemmons, an Atlanta-based musician, told CNN he received news of Nelson's death from a mutual friend. ""Derrick was my brother's college roommate and fraternity brother, and that's how I met him back in 1995,"" he said. ""I had not been in contact with him recently. That's why it was such a shock. ... I didn't know he was donating or had the complications before he passed."" (3) It turns out Derrick's death was no less heroic, and ultimately tragic. My friend died trying to save the life of a child...a total stranger who he'd never met from a foreign land. Derrick died as a result of complications while donating life-saving bone marrow.
— Salim Sivaad (@SalimSivaad) April 9, 2019 Jackson O'Brien, senior class president at Westfield High, told CNN affiliate WABC , ""He always tried to inspire students in the classroom and outside to be good people. And I think he served as a great role model."" Westfield Mayor Shelley Brindle said on Facebook that her family was ""devastated"" to hear the news. ""This is a tremendous loss for our community, and I know that our children, and we as parents, will struggle with coming to terms with this over the coming days and weeks,"" she said. ""He was a man of immense character and kindness, and his legacy will live on in the generations of students whose lives he touched."" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy called the principal's final act ""one of selflessness."""

'Lionel Messi is God': Can Manchester United stop Barcelona's divine talent?,us.cnn.com,"Nick Friend, for CNN",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/football/lionel-messi-barcelona-manchester-united-champions-league-spt-intl/index.html,"(CNN) ""Bring it on"" was the rallying cry from Chris Smalling as the Manchester United defender was confronted with the reality of facing Lionel Messi in Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal.
With Smalling likely to start at the heart of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's defense and Messi intent on performing the role immortalized by his unparalleled phenomenon, the pair will -- by the game's close -- be well-acquainted. To leave Messi unattended is, at best, unwise. Mikael Silvestre -- a Champions League winner during his time at Manchester United -- acknowledged that it is Messi's divine brilliance that stands in his former team's way on its path to an unlikely semifinal place. ""Barcelona -- except 'God' (Messi) -- is a team that you can stop over two games,"" Silvestre told CNN Sport last month. ""I think United can stop Barcelona and progress."" Given both the Catalan side's style of play and the central importance of Messi, Silvestre is well aware of the grit and good fortune necessary if his former club is to remain in the game for long enough to concern the five-time winners. Read More READ: How 'Little Seoul' fell in love with its favorite Son Messi has scored 108 Champons League goals, including eight hat-tricks, as well as making 30 assists. ""They did it against Paris [in the previous round, where United overcame a 2-0 first-leg deficit to win on away goals]. They ended up playing with Mason Greenwood, Tahith Chong, James Garner -- the three youngsters -- in the Parc des Princes. ""It was an inspiring performance, with that mental ability to stay in the game and believe and to never ever give up. It is in the club's DNA -- that never-give-up attitude."" Messi, though remains the key. As a defender who racked up 249 appearances during the Alex Ferguson era, Silvestre has a warning for his former team.

""[Stopping him] has been done before,"" he points out. ""We know how to do it."" Indeed, Silvestre himself has managed it; he came on as a late substitute when United beat Barcelona by a single goal in the 2008 semifinal. More than a decade on, though, Messi's icon has more than stood the test of time. That the Argentine has not been crowned as the world's greatest player since claiming his fifth Ballon d'Or title in 2015 is, in many ways, a red herring. Mikael Silvestre was part of the Manchester United squad that won the 2007/08 Champions League, coming on as a substitute against Barcelona at Old Trafford in the second leg of the 1-0 semifinal aggregate win. READ: How a painting helped soccer great Buffon cope with depression Timeless supremacy His unique ability has never declined, and nor have his own numbers; 26 goals in the 2015/16 La Liga season have subsequently been followed by 37 and 34, with the Argentine great sat on 33 with seven games of the current season remaining -- a year dominated by his Barcelona side. In this year's Champions League, Messi's six appearances have brought with them eight goals and a further three assists. It is a run that has added to an already exceptional overall record in Europe's major club competition; 108 goals in 131 appearances give him a superior minutes per goal ratio to that of his great rival Cristiano Ronaldo, though the Argentine remains 16 strikes behind the Juventus forward's 124. The duo's long-running battle for footballing supremacy has seen them competing in a competition of their own. Former Real Madrid captain Raul Gonzalez is the pair's closest challenger -- but even his 71 goals place him 37 behind Messi. Of those still active, Karim Benzema is the next closest, but his Champions League tally of 60 is less than halfway to Ronaldo's astronomic figure.

Copa90: Guardiola reveals coaching secrets - to pub team 05:00 Alongside Messi's extraordinary, timeless supremacy has, however, sat an accusation that he has struggled to reach his own high standards when faced with English opposition. Yet, for almost as long as the theory has existed, it is a label that Messi has confounded. There are, of course, occasional outliers. Messi's record against Chelsea, for example, sits at just three goals in 10 games. However, his history with Manchester United is different. Although it currently shows just two goals in four games, those strikes came in the 2009 and 2011 finals. His performance at Wembley in the latter of the two is remembered for its sheer majesty, as Barcelona cruised to a 3-1 victory. READ: Tottenham edge out Manchester City but lose Harry Kane to injury Some hope, perhaps, for the Old Trafford faithful comes in Messi's record on English soil. While hardly a goalscoring famine, Messi has netted eight times in 15 games in England, as opposed to 13 in 14 matches at the Camp Nou. Indeed, he is also without a goal in his last 11 Champions League quarterfinals. Whether that is an omen for Solskjaer's side -- good or bad -- remains to be seen."
Netanyahu on cusp of victory after tight Israeli election results,us.cnn.com,Oren Liebermann,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/middleeast/israel-election-results-benjamin-netanyahu-benny-gantz-intl/index.html,"Jerusalem (CNN) Benjamin Netanyahu was on course to secure a record fifth term as Israeli Prime Minister after his main election rival conceded defeat on Wednesday evening.
After a dramatic finish to a tightly-fought race, former army chief Benny Gantz accepted that Netanyahu had won. ""We are all democratic, we all accept the decision of the nation,"" Gantz said. With more than 97% of the vote counted, according to Israeli media, a bloc led by Netanyahu's Likud party would secure 65 seats in the 120-strong Knesset. A center-left bloc led by Gantz's Blue and White party, supported by the Arab parties, would only muster 55 seats. Likud supporters celebrate as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu waves to them at its headquarters in Tel Aviv. Likud tied with Blue and White, gaining 35 seats each. But Netanyahu's path back to power is clearer, combining seats won by two ultra-orthodox religious parties, which both polled well, with those of smaller right-wing groups. How Israel's political debate moved from peace talks to annexation Netanyahu claimed victory Tuesday night. ""The right-wing bloc led by the Likud won a clear victory. I thank the citizens of Israel for the trust. I will start forming a right-wing government with our natural partners as soon as tonight,"" Netanyahu said. Read More Having all but secured his cherished fifth term, Netanyahu will become Israel's longest-serving leader in the summer, overtaking David Ben-Gurion, the country's founder. The votes of diplomats abroad and soldiers are yet to be counted. Israel's President, Reuven Rivlin, will decide who will form the next government after consultations with the heads of the political parties that secured enough seats in the Knesset. The President is likely to announce his decision in about a week. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump congratulate on Twitter , ""Spoke to Bibi @Netanyahu to congratulate him on a great and hard-fought win. The United States is with him and the People of Israel all the way!"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accompanied by his wife Sara, greets supporters. In the final days of the campaign, Netanyahu veered sharply to the right, pledging to annex West Bank settlements if re-elected, and warning his voter base that the end of his strong right-wing government would signal the beginning of a weak left-wing government. Netanyahu fought the election in the face of looming indictments for bribery and breach of trust offenses, which he sought to portray as a witch-hunt led by left-wing elites and fed by the media. The date for a final hearing in the case is yet to be set. At first, Netanyahu faced a diverse array of opponents. But then three former army chiefs come together with a TV news anchor-turned-politician to create the Blue and White party, named after the colors of the Israeli flag. Led by Gantz, a former head of the army under Netanyahu, Blue and White's polling numbers surged, and the election quickly became a two-horse race. Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz addresses his supporters after Israeli general elections polls closed. Netanyahu -- known to supporters and detractors alike as ""Bibi"" -- focused on burnishing his status as a global player with close ties to both the President of the United States and the President of Russia. In a visit to Washington made by Netanyahu during the campaign, Donald Trump signed a proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, in defiance of the overwhelming international consensus. And in the election's closing days, on a visit to Moscow, Netanyahu was able to personally thank Vladimir Putin for Russia's key role in locating the body of an Israeli soldier who had been missing in Lebanon for nearly 37 years. With his victory all but certain, attention will now turn to the corruption case. The Supreme Court will rule on whether Netanyahu can continue in office if he is charged. For his part, Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing."
NHL: The 'rituals' that obsess ice hockey stars,us.cnn.com,"David Close, CNN",04-09-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/09/sport/nhl-superstition-ice-hockey-spt-intl/index.html,"(CNN) Whatever you do, don't call it superstitious.
""It's not really superstitious. It's a thing you do every time. There are guys literally that think they won't play good if they don't do the same thing (every time),"" Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Seth Jones tells CNN Sport, speaking ahead of the NHL Playoffs' start. Follow @cnnsport Let's face it, even if you might find it hard to admit, we all probably have a few habits that get us out of the house and through each day. A Montreal Canadiens video crew chronicled Andrew Shaw's intriguing pregame routine -- including slashing a teammate in the knee pad and orchestrating 50 different handshakes -- in which he admits: ""I've added little things that I find just help me get ready for the game. ""I think now it's just being superstitious going into every game. Most players do have a routine. If they say they don't, they are lying to you."" Read More 'Rigid routine' When NHL players are asked about their pregame routine, they often answer in a sheepish, almost noncommittal way -- ""Oh that's not me but let me tell you about my teammate."" Many players don't readily expand on their daily routines likely out of fear of not wanting to sound odd or give away a secret that an opponent, or even worse a teammate, can use against them. Winnipeg Jets forward Mark Scheifele warns: ""We have (Dustin) Byfuglien on our team who is a big jokester, so anyone who has a superstition probably needs to get rid of it if you play on the Winnipeg Jets. If you set your sticks up a certain way. You put your pads a certain way. Buff's gonna knock 'em over."" Even so, Scheifele, who is the Jets leading goal scorer, has a ritual that 'afflicts' several other NHLers -- wanting to be the last skater off the ice after the warm-up. ""I am the last one to go off. I like being on the ice. I like shooting around. I like it when no one else is out there. The way I look at it is that if I'm the last one off the ice, I've prepared the most."" JUST WATCHED Around the World with the Stanley Cup Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH

Obviously, we are competitors but that is a fun way to settle that score."" When St. Louis Blues forward Ryan O'Reilly arrives at the arena, he's intent on chilling rather than warming up. ""When I get to the rink, the first thing I do -- I get in the cold tub. Its one of those things that wakes myself up. It gets my legs feeling the right way."" Speaking of cold, according to Florida Panthers defenseman Keith Yandle, his former teammate Jeff Halpern, who is now coaching with the (Tampa Bay) Lightning, used to put his skates in the refrigerator.

I can be a barista at Starbucks at this point."" Ottawa Senators defenceman Thomas Chabot doesn't want to disrupt his meal routine but also doesn't want to tire of it.

Compare this to three-time Stanley Cup champion Sidney Crosby. The Pittsburgh Penguins captain counts on a simple peanut butter and jelly before each game. But don't let the simple sandwich fool you. Crosby's before-the-puck-drop rituals might be the most well known. But as someone who has won multiple Olympic golds and Stanley Cups, who can say they aren't working? ""There is just too many, it's hard now after you do things for so long to know what is a superstition and what's just part of your daily routine,"" Crosby acknowledged in a 2017 post-practice interview. ""There's a lot of guys in here that have them -- they just don't want to admit it."" During Crosby's sixth season, a HBO camera crew followed ""Sid the Kid"" during his pregame routine -- willingly taking the long way around the arena as to not walk in front of the visitors' locker room. The aforementioned Jones, who says he is not really superstitious, is quick to smile and highlight one of his teammate's routines. ""Boone Jenner is one of the weirdest ones I've seen on the bench. Every time he comes on the bench from a shift, he'll take (a sip of) water, then Gatorade, water, Gatorade, spit, spit ... there is like a certain sequence to it. And if he messes it up -- he's done."" Jenner counters with, ""I'm not the worst."" But in jest seems to admit that if he has a good game or scores, the next pregame meal must be reenacted - right down to the same time, same table and same guy paying the bill. Meanwhile, the Columbus Blue Jackets' Cam Atkinson almost appears to laugh in the face of superstitions -- the All-Star forward wears the #13 on his back. When called out about the monotony of his chicken and pasta routine, Atkinson countered: ""you should ask (Johnny) Gaudreau about his pre-game lunch."" At this point Atkinson cracks a big smile. Atkinson knows the Calgary Flames star well. So, well that Gaudreau actually wears the #13 in homage to Atkinson. ""Gaudreau has pasta but has never had pasta sauce in his life. So he gets a big bowl of pasta with nothing -- not even butter, no cheese, nothing. I don't know how you can do that."" Gaudreau too seems impervious to all of this. ""I'm not superstitious at all.

That was on Monday, when Representative Devin Nunes filed a $150 million lawsuit against the McClatchy newspaper chain. He claimed a story in his district's newspaper, The Fresno Bee, defamed him. Nunes gave the scoop about the suit to Fox News, which led its home page with the story , treating the suit like something really serious. Sean Hannity brought Nunes on and celebrated the suit. You could almost hear Hannity's viewers at home at home saying, ""Yeah, sue the fake news!"" The reality is... very different. Nunes is getting ridiculed for his legal filings, first against Twitter, now against McClatchy. And the newspaper publisher isn't mincing words. McClatchy CEO Craig Forman sent a memo to the entire company on Tuesday reassuring staffers that ""we will vigorously defend The Fresno Bee."" And later in the day, in a detailed statement, the company said the suit ""represents a baseless attack on local journalism and a free press,"" an unproductive distraction"" and ""a misuse of the judicial system."" Read More Legal experts are mighty skeptical of this suit McClatchy continued: ""Nunes declined the opportunity to talk to reporters from The Fresno Bee last year about his investment in the Alpha Omega Winery, the subject of his claim. Hopefully, he will provide such answers during the litigation."" The company also said Nunes filed suit in Virginia, but California is the more appropriate venue. Here's the full statement . Fox's Judge Andrew Napolitano said he doesn't think Nunes has a case... Neither do other experts on the right and left . We'll see what the courts say to Nunes. In the meantime, as CNN legal analyst Renato Mariotti tweeted, ""No one should cover his frivolous lawsuits without putting them in proper context."""
"Marriott suffered a massive hack last year, but its CEO still made $13 million",us.cnn.com,"David Goldman, CNN Business",04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/investing/marriott-ceo-pay/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) The chief executive of Marriott gave up some of his bonus pay last year after a hack exposed information about some 500 million guests. But he still made nearly $13 million.
The company said Wednesday that CEO Arne Sorenson asked not to receive bonuses for ""individual achievement"" or ""guest satisfaction"" following the data breach. He also declined a bonus that measures Marriott's success against that of its competitors. And his salary did not increase last year. Still, Sorenson took home about $12.9 million in pay, including $1.3 million in salary, a $2.9 million cash bonus and $8.4 million in stock awards. He also received nearly $256,000 in other benefits, including complimentary rooms, food and beverages at the company's hotels and the use of golf and spa facilities while on personal travel. That compares to total compensation of $13.3 million in the previous year. Arne Sorenson The data breach , which Marriott revealed in November, affected the reservation database of Starwood, a group of hotels Marriott bought in 2016 that includes the St. Regis, Westin, Sheraton and W Hotels. Read More Marriott is being sued by its customers over the hack, and it hasn't yet estimated how much the breach will cost the company. Morgan Stanley analysts suggested in December that the company could end up paying $200 million in legal fees and fines, as well as spending $1 per customer to notify them of the hack. That could cost upward of $700 million. Other estimates put the figure as high as $1 billion, but Marriott Chief Financial Officer Leeny Oberg told Bloomberg those forecasts were premature. While Sorenson's salary did not increase, the rest of the company's C-Suite got 3% pay raises. Marriott justified the increases by citing its stock performance and saying that the hack did not materially hurt its bottom line. Shares in Marriott have increased 9% since the hack. That lags the 14% gain for rival Hilton ( HLT ) during the same period, but is better than a 5% decline for Hyatt ( H ) . A spokesperson for Marriott ( MAR ) said in a statement that the company's compensation reflects its performance and is set by independent board members. Separately, Symantec reported Wednesday that the hospitality industry is still susceptible to attacks. Hotel booking sites in particular leak personal information, the security company said. Two in three booking sites inadvertently leak booking reference codes to third-party sites, including advertisers. With that information, the third-parties could log into a reservation, cancel a booking or view a customer's personal details. The advertisers would be able to view people's names, email addresses, home addresses, phone numbers, the last four digits of their credit card numbers and passport numbers. That's the same kind of data that Marriott's breach exposed."
Snap off to strong start as it faces pivotal year,us.cnn.com,Kaya Yurieff,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/tech/snap-stock/index.html," After a tough 2018 for Snap, some analysts are optimistic the company is bouncing back.
Last year, Snap struggled with a controversial redesign of its Snapchat app, its first-ever declines in daily active users, an exodus of top executives , and heightened competition from rival Instagram. Things seem to be stabilizing this year. Snapchat has stopped losing users, and now analysts are hopeful its parent company Snap's prospects are improving, especially following its first-ever Partner Summit in Los Angeles last week, which featured new product and business announcements. ""We came away from Snap's first big partner summit feeling more upbeat than before on the cadence of innovation and the overall trajectory of the business in 2019,"" wrote Barclays analyst Ross Sandler in a recent investor note. The company's stock is reflecting this sentiment, too. It has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, although it's still trading below its $17 IPO price . Read More ""2018 was a year of transition,"" said Ron Josey, an analyst at JMP Securities. ""Snap is in a much better spot this year than they were a year ago."" At its event last week, Snap ( SNAP ) announced several new features that it hopes will increase the time users spend on the Snapchat app. The company launched a new gaming platform featuring titles only available on Snapchat, more additions to its lineup of original shows , and a way to post Snapchat Stories to other platforms such as Tinder. Snap event debuted new strategies ... and a changed Evan Spiegel Snap also outlined new monetization and advertising opportunities , including six-second ads in games and ways for advertisers to target users outside of the Snapchat app for the first time. JMP's Josey said he is impressed with Snap's reach and continued innovations in augmented reality and direct messaging. At the event, the company said it now reaches 90% of 13 to 34-year-olds in the US. Analysts also believe Snap is ""growing up."" Following a visit to the company's new headquarters in Santa Monica, Jefferies analysts said in March they ""felt like [Snap] had grown up from a startup to a more mature company,"" according to CNBC . The firm also said it was ""generally impressed"" with the company's ""cohesion and positive steps on the road to recovery."" Snapchat is betting big on social gaming In its most recent quarter , Snap stopped losing daily active users after two straight quarters of losses. The company's revenue hit a record $390 million, up 36% from the same period a year ago and well ahead of what investors had expected. Snap's new, supposedly faster Android app is rolling out , which could help it attract more users. In the past, Android users complained the app often crashed and had lesser camera quality than iOS. Not everyone is as optimistic. Research firm eMarketer slashed its Snapchat user estimates on Wednesday, citing the app's unpopular redesign . The firm expects Snapchat to have 77.5 million monthly users in the US in 2019, which is down 2.8% from last year. (Snapchat only shares daily user statistics, not monthly). ""I don't think it's all lost for Snapchat,"" eMarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told CNN Business. ""It's difficult to tell right now in the beginning of the year, but all of these [announcements] are good signs to increase engagement within the app, and possibly even add new users if this Android app turns out well."" Snap's priority this year should be all about increasing engagement and adding users, according to Josey. ""Things are certainly better than they were six to nine months ago, or even three to six months ago,"" he said. ""Now it's a matter of, can you execute and keep the momentum going."""

The brand said Wednesday that its board has accepted the resignation of Steve Stagner, who started his latest stint as chief executive in March 2018. He spent decades at the company before then. The leadership shakeup follows a difficult time for the brand, which has been struggling to compete with online retailers like Casper and Amazon ( AMZN ) . The company also over-expanded by acquiring the Sleepy's retail chain in 2015 . In October, Mattress Firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to get out of about 700 unfavorable leases. It exited bankruptcy almost two months later, as planned. Mattress Firm's parent company, Steinhoff International, has also been troubled. In 2017, its CEO resigned in the wake of accounting problems. Read More Mattress Firm is hoping that its smaller store footprint — about 2,600 nationally as of November, compared to roughly 3,300 at the time it filed for bankruptcy — and more liquidity will help it turn things around.

Stagner said that ""now is the right time to leave Mattress Firm and make way for fresh leadership,"" adding that he will spend more time with his family after a ""busy year."" During this leadership transition, the board plans to work with remaining management to execute a growth strategy, Mattress Firm said in a statement. Stagner spent 23 years at the company, and served as CEO from 2010 to 2016. That year, he became executive chairman and chairman of the board of directors, and handed the CEO reigns to Ken Murphy. In 2018, Stagner took them back. At the time, the company said that the decision reflected ""the need for a singular voice of leadership"" as it moves forward. -- CNN Business' Nathaniel Meyersohn and Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report."
House votes to restore net neutrality rules,us.cnn.com,Seth Fiegerman,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/tech/house-net-neutrality-vote/index.html,"(CNN Business) The House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill to restore net neutrality protections that were repealed by President Donald Trump's Federal Communications Commission in a controversial move more than a year ago.
The bill, called the Save the Internet Act, would reinstate protections that require internet service providers to treat all online content the same. Providers would once again be explicitly prohibited from blocking, speeding up, or slowing down access to specific online services. Its passage represents a victory for Democrats, technology companies and consumer advocacy groups who have loudly protested the FCC's repeal of the rules, but it may only be a symbolic victory. The bill must also pass the Republican-controlled Senate and be approved by President Trump. On Monday, the White House said it ""strongly opposes"" the bill, signaling that President Trump would veto it. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the bill was ""dead on arrival in the Senate."" ""This legislation is a big-government solution in search of a problem,"" Ajit Pai, the chairman of the FCC, said in a statement after the bill's passage Wednesday. ""The Internet is free and open, while faster broadband is being deployed across America. This bill should not and will not become law."" Read More California won't yet enforce nation's strongest net neutrality law The latest legislative effort comes amid a legal showdown over the repeal. A collection of tech companies, advocacy groups and nearly two dozen states sued the FCC last year to challenge the repeal. Oral arguments in the case, Mozilla versus the FCC, were heard in February. A number of states, including California, Washington and Vermont, pushed forward with their own net neutrality rules, despite the FCC asserting authority to prevent states from pursuing laws inconsistent with the net neutrality repeal. Some agreed not to enforce the laws pending the outcome of the Mozilla case. ""Net Neutrality is now one step closer to being reinstated as the law of the land,"" Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC chairman Tom Wheeler and a staunch supporter of net neutrality, said in a statement Wednesday. The net neutrality rules were first approved by the FCC in 2015, during the Obama administration, and were intended to keep the internet open and fair. The Republican-led FCC voted to repeal the protections in late 2017. In the absence of an explicit ban on these actions, providers are required to publicly disclose any instance of blocking, throttling or paid prioritization. It will then be evaluated based on whether or not the activity is anti-competitive. The frightening future of robocalls: Numbers and voices you know The concern among net neutrality advocates is that the repeal risks giving internet providers too much control over how online content is delivered. It may also make it harder for the next generation of online services to compete if they have to pay up to be placed in a so-called internet fast lane. ""Simply put, large corporations should not be in charge of deciding what Americans see online,"" Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat and chairman of the House Rules Committee, said at a hearing on Monday. ""A free and open internet is a critical part of enabling free speech and allowing our digital economy to thrive."" Conservative groups and Republican lawmakers pushed back against the attempt to undo the net neutrality repeal, arguing that it would grant the government too much control over the internet. The Trump administration said the bill would ""return to the heavy-handed regulatory approach of the previous administration."""
Stephen MillerL: How he tightened his grip over Donald Trump's immigration and border policy - CNNPolitics,edition.cnn.com,Jeremy Diamond,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/politics/stephen-miller-tightens-grip-on-immigration-border-policy/index.html,"Washington (CNN) As President Donald Trump pushed his administration in recent weeks to take the drastic step of shutting down the US southern border, one key adviser fed Trump's impulse: Stephen Miller, the President's 33-year-old senior policy adviser and chief speechwriter who has long channeled Trump's hardline immigration views.
As most of the President's advisers sought to dissuade him from the idea, warning the economic consequences would be devastating, Miller encouraged the President to move forward with shutting down some ports of entry, two administration officials said. While Trump was ultimately convinced to back down, Miller's stance solidified his position in Trump's mind as the chief facilitator of the President's hardline instincts and appears to have won him more power. In the wake of that debate, Trump has moved to more formally empower Miller, telling aides in a recent Oval Office meeting that he was putting Miller in charge of all immigration and border issues, according to a person familiar with the meeting. In the days since, there has been a cascade of personnel moves inside the Department of Homeland Security. Last week, Miller convinced the President to pull the nomination of Ron Vitiello as the next director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, bluntly telling Trump that Vitiello was ""soft"" on closing the southern border. The decision blindsided department officials and Republican lawmakers, who initially thought it was a clerical error. Read More Two days later, Trump announced the forced resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. Two days after that, Nielsen's deputy, Claire Grady, resigned under pressure to make room for the President's preferred pick for acting secretary, Kevin McAleenan, the Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner. How border hardliners nudged out Nielsen More turnover is anticipated -- giving Miller an expansive foothold to shape the administration's immigration policies and attempt end-runs around current laws. More than anyone in the West Wing, Miller has developed a mind-meld with the President on immigration, arguably his most important issue heading into the 2020 election. Where some advisers have sought to temper Trump's instincts, Miller has unabashedly stoked them, earning him a reputation around Washington as a radical and influential voice inside the White House. Administration officials caution that Miller is not some all-powerful and invisible hand driving every one of Trump's actions on immigration, as he is sometimes made out to be. The reality, they say, is more complex. While Miller goaded Trump on as he contemplated shutting down the US-Mexico border, the idea originated with Trump. And other advisers, including White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney as well as senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, hold sway with Trump on immigration matters. Asked Wednesday morning about Miller's role, the President praised Miller, but sought to dispel any questions about who is really driving his immigration policy. ""Frankly, there's only one person that's running it. You know who that is? It's me,"" he said, pointing to his head. Minutes later, Miller responded to CNN's request for comment from the previous day: ""Only one person in this U.S. government runs immigration policy: President Donald Trump."" Still, Miller now finds himself in the driver's seat and better positioned than ever before to shape the administration's immigration and border security policies. The question is what he will do with the newfound position of authority. Will he be able to deliver for Trump, or, like so many before him, be the one to bear the blame for a failure to overcome intractable issues and legal hurdles? Former Sessions staffer Before he entered Trump's universe, Miller was communications director to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama. Their hardline views on immigration often left them on the edges in the Senate, fighting broader bipartisan immigration reform efforts every step of the way. ""All I can think of is his non-stop emails telling us Jeff Sessions was coming to the floor to talk about some fringe thing the broader party disagreed with,"" one former GOP aide said, chuckling. ""Now he's the mainstream in this White House and he's got more power than he could've ever dreamed of."" Miller's path to power began when he joined the still fledgling operation working to elect Trump in January 2016 as a policy adviser and speechwriter. He quickly developed a knack for channeling Trump's voice on the stump and became a core member of Trump's inner circle of aides. After Trump was inaugurated, it took Miller less than a week to make his mark in the West Wing. He crafted an executive order alongside then-chief strategist Steve Bannon to ban travelers to the US from seven Muslim-majority countries -- a move that blindsided even some members of Trump's Cabinet. Since then, Miller has influenced the administration's border and immigration policies and crafted the rhetoric to go along with it. Last summer, he played a key role in advocating for the administration's ""zero tolerance"" family separation policy. And he was instrumental in insisting the White House not budge in its demands for border wall funding before and during the government shutdown this winter. Miller has at times pushed the bounds of his immigration authority. In the past, he attempted to direct then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Nielsen to take certain immigration actions, administration officials said. ""Kelly would say yeah, no, I'm the secretary -- that's not how this works,"" one administration official recalled. In recent weeks Miller has ramped up his calls to mid-level officials at the Department of Homeland Security, administration officials said, berating them for not doing more to stem spiking immigration numbers at the border and directing them to take specific actions. Vitiello, the ICE nominee, isn't the only official Miller has tried to push out. He has also openly complained about the department's general counsel, John Mitnick, and told Trump that L. Francis Cissna, the head of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, has proven unable to deliver results. While Miller played a critical role in ousting Nielsen -- often complaining about her to and with Trump -- she had few allies in the West Wing to begin with. View from Capitol Hill On Capitol Hill, Miller is equal parts agitator and close ally. Republicans who have worked with him on immigration, particularly those supportive of his views on the issue, note what they perceive to be an encyclopedic knowledge of immigration laws -- a resource in the heated debates that have transpired with Democrats. But it can cut both ways, one senior GOP aide said: ""He remembers everything your boss has said or done on the issue. And he's got the goods to kill you on it if you take a new position that runs contrary to something you've proposed or voted on before."" Miller drew the ire of a number of Senate Republicans in 2018 for his perceived role in blowing up a bipartisan immigration deal that would have granted legal status to undocumented immigrants who crossed into the US as children. ""As long as Stephen Miller is in charge of negotiating immigration, we are going nowhere,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told reporters at the time. The debate, and legislative implosion that followed, served as a window for some GOP senators into how Miller operates. ""You didn't necessarily see him or hear from him directly,"" said one senator involved in the bipartisan talks. ""But you knew he was always there, always working, and always the last person in the president's ear."" As to the most striking part of the process? ""He wouldn't give an inch,"" the senator said. Miller's efforts to gut DHS's current leadership structure became the latest flashpoint between Miller and lawmakers -- with Republican senators in particular striking out at Miller. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley told the Washington Post that ""it would be hard for (Miller) to demonstrate he's accomplished anything for the President."" And South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the Republican majority whip, said amid the shakeup, he hopes there will be a check on Miller's influence. ""I do think his voice is influential and I hope it gets balanced out with other voices there,"" Thune told CNN. Miller's status among Democrats is so baked in by this point that one top administration official attempted to make light of it. During a meeting of bipartisan congressional staffers convened by Vice President Mike Pence during the government shutdown, two sources said, Miller walked through a series of potential deal points. When he was done, Kushner looked at the Democratic staffers in the group. ""See? He's not so bad!"" Kushner exclaimed. There were a few chuckles, the sources said, but mostly the Democrats in attendance shifted uncomfortably in their seats. White House operator White House aides describe Miller as a subtle operator inside the West Wing. Rather than fighting it out with other aides in meetings with Trump, Miller tends to use his one-on-one moments with Trump to shape the President's thinking. Stephen Miller looks on as President Trump hosts a discussion on border security ""I think the thing people don't fully understand about Miller is that he works in the shadows,"" one former senior White House official said. ""He almost never speaks during meetings with POTUS when other staff members are there."" There are other times though, when Miller is not so subtle. During one meeting on border security last fall, Shahira Knight, Trump's legislative affairs director, was arguing that the administration should wait until after the midterm elections to push for border security funding, since it would be in a stronger position to do so. Miller cut her off mid-sentence, two people in the room said, shooting back a list of reasons why the administration would almost certainly be in a weaker position after the midterms, including that the Republicans were guaranteed to lose seats and possibly control of the House. His outburst silenced the room, the two people said. One staffer, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss the interaction, described it as an ""evisceration."" For Knight, whose job is to maintain the White House's relationship with lawmakers, Miller hasn't exactly been helpful, according to several people familiar with the situation. Miller has avoided making enemies inside the White House, where his colleagues often tout his wry sense of humor. As one of the longest-tenured members of the President's inner circle, Miller has deftly moved between warring factions in a West Wing famous for back-biting. Early in the administration, he worked closely with Bannon to implement hard-right nationalist policies, including the travel ban. But as Bannon's fortunes began to turn , Miller sought to ingratiate himself with Kushner, who had had long been feuding with Bannon. Donald Trump fired Steve Bannon. But Bannon still won. ""Your polling numbers are actually very strong considering Steve won't stop leaking to the press and trying to undermine Jared,"" Miller told the President when he thought they were alone, according to former White House aide Cliff Sims' book ""Team of Vipers."" ""If Steve wasn't doing that, I bet you'd be ten points higher."" Miller has also forged a close working relationship with Mulvaney. When Trump kept pushing for border closures, it was Miller and Mulvaney who huddled together to brainstorm how Trump could close parts of the border without devastating the economy. They suggested only closing certain ports of entry, stalling some trade instead of all and slow-walking entries into the US. Miller and Mulvaney were also on the same side during the debate over whether Trump should declare a national emergency. Instead of telling Trump why he shouldn't, both encouraged him to do so and looked for ways to make it work. Just as Miller still operates with the same fringe tendencies he honed working for Sessions, Mulvaney still makes decisions like he's a member of the Tea Party, sources said. Can he deliver? Some of the changes Trump has sought, such as denying migrants the ability to claim asylum once they cross into the US, remain illegal. And Miller will be constrained by those same laws. ""At the end of the day,"" a senior administration official said, ""the President refuses to understand that the Department of Homeland Security is constrained by the laws."" But Miller is already working with other officials to develop workarounds to current laws, including developing policies to make it more difficult for people to obtain asylum protections by cracking down on the number of people deemed to have a ""credible fear"" of returning to their home country. ""The biggest issue is getting a hold of the credible fear system,"" a senior administration official said, arguing there is a ""cultural bias"" resulting in a high number of credible fear threats being approved. ""The purpose of the credible fear threat is not to ease path of meritless asylum seekers but to weed them out."" Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports reduced immigration to the US, said he believes there are steps the Trump administration could still take to address the overcapacity situation at immigration detention centers and cut down on the number of border crossings. But even though Krikorian said he believes empowering Miller will be a boon to his and the Trump administration's policy goals, he acknowledged limits to the impact Miller can have. ""There's no question that there's a limit to what they can do without changes from Congress. The question is how realistic are the President's expectations? Is he expecting them to solve this problem or is he expecting them to make some progress so that he can then go to the public and to Congress and say Congress has to do its part too?"" Krikorian said. ""That's kind of up to the President. That's not really something Stephen can do."""
Disney to test its power with new streaming service,us.cnn.com,Brian Lowry,04-10-2019,2019,4,http://us.cnn.com/2019/04/10/media/disney-investor-day-2019-streaming/index.html," Disney's new streaming service will test Marvel's power, the reach of the ""Star Wars"" galaxy and the magic of animated classics spanning more than 80 years, coupled with the new-found bulk provided by its acquisition of Fox Entertainment assets.
The studio will play show-and-tell with investors on Thursday, amid what promises to be a banner year for Disney ( DIS ) at the box office -- thanks to ""Avengers,"" ""Toy Story"" and ""Star Wars"" sequels, as well as a new version of ""The Lion King"" -- and a major theme-park expansion with the opening of Star Wars Land sure to lengthen queue lines this spring. Disney is bringing 'Monsters, Inc.' TV series to streaming service Still, beyond those can't-miss projects, much of the intrigue surrounding the Mouse House's future revolves around its plans to introduce a streaming service this year, Disney+, as the major studios seek to fortify their positions against the challenge posed by Netflix ( NFLX ) as well as tech giants like Amazon ( AMZN ) , Google ( GOOG ) and most recently Apple ( AAPL ) in the content space. Absorbing Fox -- which has created its own layer of drama within the entertainment industry -- has left Disney uniquely positioned to mount such an effort. The deal strengthened what was already the entertainment industry's most enviable array of brands, with Fox's National Geographic among the announced Disney+ elements. (Disclosure: My wife works for a division of Disney.) Nevertheless, at the risk of mixing sci-fi metaphors, Disney CEO Robert Iger's determination to boldly explore this new frontier represents a leap into an arena that remains filled with unknowns. Read More If properties with avid fan bases serve as the linchpin of any subscription-driven service, the industry consensus is that nobody can match the arsenal that Disney possesses. Yet even that doesn't assure success with such a startup venture. Indeed, Disney has already witnessed warning signs, or at least experienced limitations, in leveraging its vast trove of intellectual property. ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" fell well short of box-office expectations, and most recently a live-action reboot of ""Dumbo"" is flying far below the stratospheric returns of ""Beauty and the Beast."" Star Wars: GalaxyÕs Edge will open in summer 2019 at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California, and fall 2019 at Disney's Hollywood Studios in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. (Disney Parks) There's also the issue of whether Disney and other studios will divert projects that would have played on and benefited other studio-owned assets -- such as networks like ABC, Disney Channel and Freeform -- to feed the streaming operation. That calculus, in terms of what shows premiere where, is by no means an exact science. In addition, Disney will be using its library to stock the new service's shelves. By ceasing to license content to Netflix, the company will forgo about $150 million in revenue this year, executives told investors in February. There's also the matter of how to integrate Disney+ with its other streaming platforms, including ESPN+ and the studio's controlling stake in Hulu. In an interview with Barron's , Iger said some decisions regarding which properties will get funneled toward Disney+ will be ""easy,"" such as producing mid-budget movies directly for the service, in contrast to the Marvel and Lucasfilm blockbusters. Disney CEO Bob Iger The emphasis in series is somewhat murkier, with a ""Star Wars"" spinoff, ""The Mandalorian,"" among the more eagerly anticipated titles being used to help launch the service. This week, the company also announced a series based on the hit movie ""Monsters Inc."" In that same interview, Iger conceded that building up the company's direct-to-consumer strategy would be a process, one that will initially require considerable investment against uncertain returns. ""We're looking for Wall Street to show some patience while we prove this out,"" he said. Disney has also sought to differentiate itself from Netflix, with Iger telling analysts last summer that Disney would use its marquee brands to be ""in the quality game,"" as opposed to emphasizing volume. Notably, Disney's past acquisitions were greeted with varying degrees of skepticism, only to pay off with a level of dominance in the theatrical world illustrated by the titles that the company is unleashing through 2019. That track record has bought Iger considerable goodwill among investors. At the same time, the studio faces questions not only in regard to streaming but also its longer-term succession plans, with the 68-year-old Iger having already extended his tenure three times, in the latest announcement through 2021. On most fronts, 2019 looks like a landmark year for Disney. The challenge now is how much fairy dust the studio has left to sprinkle on the streaming realm."

The condom is limited edition for now and being given to bar customers and attendees of events around Buenos Aires. But Tulipan plans to sell it online in the future. The pack comes after a survey of 30,000 people conducted by AHF Argentina , which campaigns for HIV treatment and services, revealed that 20.5% of Argentine men never use protection, 65% occasionally use condoms and only 14.5% regularly use them."
"Under pressure, Amazon plans to accept cash at cashierless 'Go' stores",edition.cnn.com,Nathaniel Meyersohn,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/tech/amazon-go-cashless-stores/index.html,"New York (CNN Business) Bowing to growing pressure from opponents who say that cashless stores leave out low-income Americans, Amazon plans to take cash at its 10 cashierless ""Go"" stores .
Amazon Go stores, located in San Francisco, Chicago and Seattle, use AI and cameras to check out customers. Amazon reportedly is considering opening up to to 3,000 by 2021. ""We are working to accept cash,"" a spokesperson for Amazon said Wednesday. ""Paying cash at Amazon Go will work as you would expect: you'll check out, pay with cash, and then get your change."" Amazon did not say when Go stores will begin accepting cash. Amazon also said its bookstores will start taking cash, but did not share any details. Retailers want to go cashless. But opponents say that's discriminatory Steve Kessel, Amazon's senior vice president of physical stores, told employees last month that Go stores would add ""additional payment mechanisms,"" CNBC reported earlier on Wednesday. Kessel was responding to a question about how Amazon plans to address ""discrimination and elitism"" at cashierless stores, according to the report. Many retailers and restaurant, including Sweetgreen, Dig Inn and Dos Toros Taqueria, claim that eliminating cash at their stores makes them more efficient and safer. But opponents argue that cashless stores exclude millions of Americans without bank accounts .

Around 8.4 million US households, or 6.5% of the country, were ""unbanked"" in 2017 — meaning they did not have a checking or savings account— according to the most recent FDIC data . And close to 17% of black households and 14% of Hispanic households did not have a bank account in 2017. In 2019, Philadelphia passed a ban on cashless stores. So did New Jersey. And lawmakers in New York City, San Francisco and Washington are all currently weighing bans to prevent retailers and restaurants in their cities from going cashless. On Wednesday, Philadelphia councilman Bill Greenlee, who sponsored legislation banning cashless stores in the city, said he was ""happy to see that Amazon Go will start accepting cash so that all potential customers can shop at their establishments."" Amazon Go stores sell ready-to-eat lunches, dinners and snacks.

House votes to restore net neutrality rules,edition.cnn.com,Seth Fiegerman,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://edition.cnn.com/2019/04/10/tech/house-net-neutrality-vote/index.html,"(CNN Business) The House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill to restore net neutrality protections that were repealed by President Donald Trump's Federal Communications Commission in a controversial move more than a year ago.
The bill, called the Save the Internet Act, would reinstate protections that require internet service providers to treat all online content the same. Providers would once again be explicitly prohibited from blocking, speeding up, or slowing down access to specific online services. Its passage represents a victory for Democrats, technology companies and consumer advocacy groups who have loudly protested the FCC's repeal of the rules, but it may only be a symbolic victory. The bill must also pass the Republican-controlled Senate and be approved by President Trump. On Monday, the White House said it ""strongly opposes"" the bill, signaling that President Trump would veto it. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the bill was ""dead on arrival in the Senate."" ""This legislation is a big-government solution in search of a problem,"" Ajit Pai, the chairman of the FCC, said in a statement after the bill's passage Wednesday. ""The Internet is free and open, while faster broadband is being deployed across America. This bill should not and will not become law."" Read More California won't yet enforce nation's strongest net neutrality law The latest legislative effort comes amid a legal showdown over the repeal. A collection of tech companies, advocacy groups and nearly two dozen states sued the FCC last year to challenge the repeal. Oral arguments in the case, Mozilla versus the FCC, were heard in February. A number of states, including California, Washington and Vermont, pushed forward with their own net neutrality rules, despite the FCC asserting authority to prevent states from pursuing laws inconsistent with the net neutrality repeal. Some agreed not to enforce the laws pending the outcome of the Mozilla case. ""Net Neutrality is now one step closer to being reinstated as the law of the land,"" Gigi Sohn, a counselor to former FCC chairman Tom Wheeler and a staunch supporter of net neutrality, said in a statement Wednesday. The net neutrality rules were first approved by the FCC in 2015, during the Obama administration, and were intended to keep the internet open and fair. The Republican-led FCC voted to repeal the protections in late 2017. In the absence of an explicit ban on these actions, providers are required to publicly disclose any instance of blocking, throttling or paid prioritization. It will then be evaluated based on whether or not the activity is anti-competitive. The frightening future of robocalls: Numbers and voices you know The concern among net neutrality advocates is that the repeal risks giving internet providers too much control over how online content is delivered. It may also make it harder for the next generation of online services to compete if they have to pay up to be placed in a so-called internet fast lane. ""Simply put, large corporations should not be in charge of deciding what Americans see online,"" Rep. Jim McGovern, a Democrat and chairman of the House Rules Committee, said at a hearing on Monday. ""A free and open internet is a critical part of enabling free speech and allowing our digital economy to thrive."" Conservative groups and Republican lawmakers pushed back against the attempt to undo the net neutrality repeal, arguing that it would grant the government too much control over the internet. The Trump administration said the bill would ""return to the heavy-handed regulatory approach of the previous administration."""
