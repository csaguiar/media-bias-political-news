"News Brief: DHS Secretary, Iran's Revolutionary Guard, College Scandal",www.npr.org,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314414/news-brief-dhs-secretary-irans-revolutionary-guard-college-scandal,"Replacing Cabinet secretaries has become routine. U.S. labels Iran's Revolutionary Guard a foreign terrorist group. In Boston, 14 people agreed to plead guilty in the college admission scandal.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Temporary employees fill a very specific need at a specific time, and they can give employers flexibility. But what happens when those temp workers are working at the highest levels of the U.S. government?
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Well, back in January, President Trump acknowledged the number of people serving in his administration who are working in an acting capacity.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I sort of like acting - gives me more flexibility. Do you understand that? I like acting.
GREENE: While some of those roles have since been permanently filled - President Trump's picks for attorney general and EPA administrator were both confirmed by the U.S. Senate - but other vacancies now exist. And the Department of Homeland Security is particularly impacted. Tomorrow is Kirstjen Nielsen's last day on the job as secretary. Two other prominent agencies within the DHS, FEMA and ICE, still don't have Senate-approved leaders. So how long is it going to stay this way?
MARTIN: NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell is with us this morning. Hey, Kelsey.
KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hey, there.
MARTIN: So we know that the head of Customs and Border Protection has been tapped by President Trump to replace Nielsen - or to step up in an acting capacity as the head of DHS. Any sense, at this point, who would be nominated to take the job permanently?
SNELL: No. And you know, that lack of, you know, certainty is creating a lot of turmoil in terms of when I talk to folks on Capitol Hill about what they expect to happen. The entire nominations process is actually very tense right now.
Last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved to make it easier to approve lower court and subcabinet appointees. And while that's speeding things along for some of these, like, lower court judges, it has everyone on high alert. And Democrats are going after the administration right now for constant churn in personnel. I think that this is causing a lot of tension among senators. And I think that's really, really well captured by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on the Senate floor.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CHUCK SCHUMER: And what he's done by these constant firings and constant change of policy is simply created chaos at the border. Nobody knows what the policy will be from day to day and week to week and month to month.
SNELL: Yeah. So he's talking about just the feeling among members of Congress that they don't know what to expect from this administration. And that's going to make it really hard for President Trump to nominate somebody who is going to kind of sail through the process, which is what any administration would like - not to mention the fact that an immigration hard-liner would have an even more difficult task since Republicans and Democrats have been very skeptical of some of this president's policies.
MARTIN: Right. So let's talk about the specific vacancies. I mean...
SNELL: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...We mentioned a couple there in the intro. But there - I mean, the president has a lot of roles to fill. We should also just note that he fired the head of the Secret Service, which is under the Department of Homeland Security. He did that this week, too.
SNELL: Right. So there are acting secretaries at the Department of Defense, Interior, Office of Management and Budget, the Small Business Administration. And this is a lot of people in this Cabinet who are not permanent. And that doesn't even cover the judicial nominees and subcabinet appointments that are not filled.
Now, the president may favor this style, but it really does make lawmakers anxious. It's hard to negotiate with an administration and know who's calling the shots and make policy plans with temps.
MARTIN: Right. But it doesn't seem like President Trump - his personality - I mean, he's not someone who might care about making Congress anxious, shall we say? Do we have any sense of a timeline as to when any of these jobs would get filled?
SNELL: No, but there's a reason to move fast. Things are contentious now, but they won't get any better as the election draws near. So Republicans will want to get things moving pretty quickly.
MARTIN: NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell. Thanks, Kelsey.
SNELL: Thanks.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
MARTIN: The Trump administration has been fixated on the threat it sees from Iran. And now the administration has made an unprecedented move.
GREENE: Yesterday, the U.S. designated an element of Iran's security forces as a terrorist organization. We're talking about Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MIKE POMPEO: For 40 years, the Islamic Republic's Revolutionary Guard Corps has actively engaged in terrorism and created, supported and directed other terrorist groups. The IRGC masquerades as a legitimate military organization, but none of us should be fooled.
GREENE: OK. So this is part of Iran's government, the Revolutionary Guard, that will now be joining ISIS and Boko Haram on the terrorist list. It means that anyone who deals with them could run the risk of facing criminal charges. Among the many questions here is how the government in Tehran is going to be responding to this.
MARTIN: We've got NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul, who's been following this and can give us more context. Hey, Peter.
PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.
MARTIN: So David just said this - that the designation means anyone who deals with the Revolutionary Guard could run the risk of criminal charges. What else does the designation mean in practice?
KENYON: Well, what it means in practice - even on that trade question - is dependent on how aggressively the administration really wants to enforce this. As you mentioned, it could lead Washington to act against any company doing business with the Revolutionary Guard. And that could get complicated because the Guards have ties to the Iranian economy that aren't always apparent from the outside - or even necessarily from the inside sometimes.
So this could be another reason for companies to be cautious about trade with Iran. This is the first time it's happened, a foreign government element being declared a terrorist organization. It's due to happen on April 15. And Secretary of State Pompeo. Listed a string of attacks as justification. He talked about Khobar Towers in 1996, 19 U.S. servicemen killed in Saudi Arabia; a failed attempt in 2011 to kill the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. - Pompeo said ample justification for this decision.
MARTIN: Although those are examples that were years ago. Did they give any...
KENYON: Yes, they were.
MARTIN: ...Explanation for why they are making this designation in this moment?
KENYON: As for now, Iranians have some ideas about that. The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, called it another election eve gift to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli leader who's standing for re-election.
This is probably the most high-profile move from the Trump administration since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear agreement - reimposed sanctions on Iran, including on its oil and gas sector. The Europeans have tried to set up a workaround to help companies continue trading with Iran, but that's not really expected to have a major impact. And of course, even before this designation for the Revolutionary Guard Corps, there were already hundreds and hundreds of Iranian entities and individuals under U.S. sanctions.
MARTIN: So what are the broader implications of this? I mean, we're already seeing Iran kind of engage in a tit for tat here. Right?
KENYON: Yes. That's exactly right. As promised, Tehran responded with more or less identical steps against the U.S. The Iranian National Security Council dubbed the U.S. a sponsor of terrorism. It's designating CENTCOM - that's the U.S. Central Command - and its forces as terrorists.
In Iran, the U.S. move does appear to be pushing Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, closer to the Revolutionary Guards, who are not his natural allies. Rouhani is hailing the Revolutionary Guards as defenders of Iran. The speaker of the Parliament's quoted as calling the U.S. move the ""climax of stupidity and arrogance."" Lawmakers have been chanting death to America. Now the question is - will this escalate beyond a war of words? No sign of that so far, but we'll have to see.
MARTIN: NPR's Peter Kenyon for us this morning. Peter, thanks. We appreciate it.
KENYON: Thanks, Rachel.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
MARTIN: All right. The Department of Justice has confirmed that 13 parents, including the actress Felicity Huffman, have now agreed to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal.
GREENE: Yeah. Let's remember that big story that broke last month. Federal prosecutors revealed a multimillion-dollar scam that enabled wealthy families to allegedly bribe their way into elite colleges by having test scores and athletic achievements falsified. Fifty people were charged at the time. This is U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling unveiling the details on March 12.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ANDREW LELLING: This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions through the steady application of wealth combined with fraud. There can be no separate college admissions system for the wealthy. And I'll add, there will not be a separate criminal justice system either.
MARTIN: We're joined in the studio by NPR's Elissa Nadworny, who's been following all this. Thanks for coming in, Elissa.
ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: Good morning.
MARTIN: So let's start with the news. Exactly what are these 13 parents - what are they agreeing to plead guilty to?
NADWORNY: Yeah. So more than a dozen parents and one college coach have agreed to plead guilty. And they were charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in connection with this scheme.
So according to prosecutors, those charges carry a punishment of up to 20 years. But if parents cooperate with prosecutors, they're likely to get a much lighter sentence. Felicity Huffman, the actress best-known for the TV show ""Desperate Housewives""...
MARTIN: Yeah.
NADWORNY: ...Her plea agreement - in her plea agreement, prosecutors recommended a prison sentence at, quote, ""the low end"" of the sentencing range. In other cases, they've recommended 12 to 18 months behind bars.
MARTIN: But that means that people involved in this, including Felicity Huffman, could see jail time.
NADWORNY: Yeah, absolutely. And yeah, we've actually heard from Huffman. She released a statement with an apology saying she was, quote, ""ashamed and has deep regrets over what she's done."" And she also says her daughter knew nothing about her actions. And she apologized to students who, quote, ""work hard every day to get into college""
MARTIN: I mean, yeah, that's what this has been all about - right? - this huge awakening, really, about how privilege and class play into something that everybody aspires to get, like a college education in America.
NADWORNY: Yeah, absolutely.
MARTIN: I mean, how have you watched this all unfold - this reckoning, really, that's happening?
NADWORNY: Yeah. I mean, this has really tapped into a lot of frustrations over wealth and privilege and then how that mixes with this idea of higher education being accessible. So yeah. Exactly as you said, we love this idea that if we work hard, if we have talent, we're able to get into these schools. And this story has kind of shown that that's just not true. It's pretty amazing. These schools are almost mythical - you know, Yale, Stanford. Like...
MARTIN: Yeah.
NADWORNY: ...Students dream about getting in these schools. And that's despite the fact that just 1 percent of all college students go to these highly selective schools. So...
MARTIN: Right because there's data that says that for a certain segment of really wealthy, white students in particular - makes a marginal difference in your life. But for certain students who come from less privileged backgrounds, it can really change your whole trajectory.
NADWORNY: Absolutely. And it's been kind of a re-examination of then, like, if these schools are serving those wealthy students, like, you know - it's really hard for low-income students to actually get that path.
MARTIN: Right. So as this unfolds, where are you going to be looking to determine what changes are actually going to occur here - if any - like, on a systemic level?
NADWORNY: Yeah. Well, I think one thing we're watching is kind of what the sentences will be - if these folks will actually get prison time. I think, in the kind of larger conversation, we're looking at renewed conversations about equity and college access and kind of where all this fits. SATs - like, should colleges require tests like this? Those are some of...
MARTIN: Because this was at the center of the fraud...
NADWORNY: The fraud, exactly.
MARTIN: ...Like, fudging scores on standardized tests.
NADWORNY: Exactly.
MARTIN: All right. NPR's Elissa Nadworny for us this morning. Thank you so much. We appreciate it.
NADWORNY: Yep, you bet.

"In Its Third Season, 'The Bold Type' Balances Real Life With A Glass Of Rosé",www.npr.org,Rachel Martin,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711052290/in-its-third-season-the-bold-type-balances-real-life-with-a-glass-of-ros,"The Bold Type stars Aisha Dee as Kat Edison, Katie Stevens as Jane Sloan, and Meghann Fahy as Sutton Brady — three friends working at a women's magazine in New York City. Justin Coit/Freeform hide caption
toggle caption Justin Coit/Freeform If you ask Aisha Dee to describe her show The Bold Type , she says it's like drinking a glass of rosé while reading a Cosmo. It's ""real world"" but it's also ""wish fulfillment,"" she says.
Dee, Katie Stevens and Meghann Fahy star as Kat, Jane and Sutton — three best friends living in New York and working together at Scarlet magazine, a fictional outlet inspired by Cosmopolitan . The Freeform comedy series begins its third season Tuesday night.
The premise is familiar — HBO's hit shows Sex and the City and Girls both followed the friendships of young women living and working in New York. But The Bold Type aims to provide a fresh take, dealing with issues of career advancement, sexuality, race, women's health and the #MeToo movement.
""These three girls are strong, and they are empowered, and they're making strides in their careers — but they're also not perfect,"" Dee says. ""We get to see them be vulnerable and also kind of navigate these situations that a lot of us come up against.""
""Sometimes it's nice to put on TV and just escape,"" says Meghann Fahy, who plays Sutton. But the stars say what's special about The Bold Type is that it provides a space to tackle issues that affect women — as well as an escape.
""We try to have the happy medium of making it aspirational for people to watch, but also making sure that we do put in failures, and we do put in mess for these characters because that is what's real,"" Stevens says.
They're portraying young women living in 2019 America — but nobody ""wants to sit in the darkness of what that really looks like,"" she jokes.
Interview Highlights On the real Cosmopolitan
Aisha Dee: I'd go to the library with my mom all the time and like sneak into the magazine section because I knew she wouldn't approve of me reading it. ... I think Cosmo told me a lot about about life, and sex, and love.
Meghann Fahy: It's really a women's health magazine. Sometimes I think it gets a bad rap ... When we were young ... not being able to read it, or feeling like we had to hide it, was ... an oppression of, like, sexuality and sensuality and, like, what it is to be a woman and a girl who's learning about her body. ... On our show we sort of talk about how the magazine is so much more than [what people give it credit for].
On people comparing their show to Sex and the City
Katie Stevens: What's more cool to me is you see all those BuzzFeed quizzes that are like, ""Are you Miranda or a Carrie, or..."" you know. And now there are quizzes that are like, ""Are you a Sutton, Kat, or a Jane."" I think that ours is obviously like a refreshed, newer version. ... I could watch all of my favorite shows from that era and find problematic things about them. But I think ultimately what you take away from Sex and the City in terms of the women's friendships and them navigating their lives and their aspirations ... I think that you get the same feeling when you watch The Bold Type.
It's Been a Minute with Sam Sanders 'The Bold Type': Aisha Dee And Amanda Lasher On where their characters are headed in Season 3
Stevens: For Jane, when we left her at Season 2 she had some big decisions to make in terms of who she wanted to be with, and kind of navigating her health stuff in terms of freezing her eggs, and if she was going to do that or not. So in Season 3 she's finally made those decisions. ... I've learned so much from playing this storyline ... about women's health, and we touch a little bit more on that in Season 3.
Fahy: For Sutton in Season 3 I think she's really sort of grappling with what it is that she actually wants to be doing. I think she finally got into the fashion department and ... she doesn't want to be an assistant forever. So she's kind of trying to decide what it is that she does want to work towards. I think that's exciting we haven't actually seen her do that yet.
Dee: We get to see this woman, [Kat], who is described as being so strong and confident, but often we see characters like that and we don't feel the need to ask the question, ""Why they need to be so strong and why they need to be so confident?"" You get to see Kat be vulnerable and also kind of discover parts of herself in her 20s. ...
I love getting to see this woman who is an adult ... or is trying to be an adult — and she's still discovering who she is and still finding herself, and finding confidence, and falling in love for the first time, and falling out of love for the first time. It's been really a very special story to get to tell, and it's inspired me a lot.

Iowa College Students Assess Democratic Presidential Primary Candidates,www.npr.org,Tamara Keith,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314449/iowa-college-students-assess-democratic-presidential-primary-candidates,"It's still very early in the Democratic presidential primary process. Young Democrats in Iowa tell us what they want in their 2020 presidential candidate. The conversation yielded some surprises.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
It's still very early in the Democratic presidential primary process; some likely candidates haven't even announced their running yet. But voters in states like Iowa that have early primaries and caucuses have already gotten an up-close look at a lot of the candidates who are in the race. NPR's Tamara Keith sat down with a group of students at The University of Iowa to get a sense of what issues matter most to them and which candidates are making a good impression.
TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: In the state that will make the first cut in the very large, historically diverse Democratic field, the nine students I met with take their responsibility seriously.
ALLISON MEYER: Hi, I'm Allison Meyer.
DANIELLE BEAVERS: Hi, I'm Danielle Beavers.
LAURYN SCHNACK: I'm Lauryn Schnack.
JENNA NELSON: Jenna Nelson.
ELLA DANIELS: I'm Ella Daniels.
GRACIE MAHONEY: Gracie Mahoney.
ANNA VAN HEUKELOM: I'm Anna Van Heukelom.
SARAH SCHOTT: My name is Sarah Schott.
JOHNNY MOLONEY: I'm Johnny Moloney.
KEITH: They range in age from 18 to 22, and all of them plan to caucus for Democrats next winter. Because they're in Iowa City, candidates come through all the time, says Daniels.
DANIELS: I didn't grow up in a super political environment, and then so coming here, with all the candidates that come through Iowa City, it's a lot of opportunity. It's really cool to see.
KEITH: Though Schnack says they can get jaded about all the attention.
SCHNACK: And when we see, oh, a candidate's coming; oh, but I am slightly busy that day, so I'll just wait because they'll be back.
KEITH: Having a few selfies with candidates on your cellphone is the norm for this group. Like many Democrats, President Trump is on their minds. In particular, Moloney says...
MOLONEY: The most important quality is just someone who's going to be able to beat Donald Trump (laughter).
KEITH: But what does that mean? Moloney suggests it needs to be someone who can stand up to Trump in debates. Meyer offers this.
MEYER: I'd say, honestly, the quality I'm looking for most is authenticity.
KEITH: Schott says she wants someone who represents her generation.
SCHOTT: I think that Donald Trump tapped into a lot of, like, old-people fear, and that was, like, a big base of his campaign and how he won. And I think that our generation is the generation that's going to be able to overcome that and work past fear as, like, a nation.
KEITH: They have a lot of ideas about who they want - someone who cares passionately about income inequality, someone who's in it for the greater good. Beavers is looking for someone who contrasts with President Trump's narrow focus on his base.
BEAVERS: When you are representing the entirety of the United States, which is supposed to be an open place for people of all different backgrounds, I think that you need to be super respectful. So I am looking for that in a candidate. So looking for women candidates or minorities is important to me, too.
KEITH: Or maybe this, says Nelson.
NELSON: I am kind of also looking for a candidate that will have qualities that can also be attractive to people on, like, the more moderate or right sides of the spectrum because, ultimately, you have to get the votes to win.
KEITH: Five of the nine say they donated to Bernie Sanders in 2016, just a few dollars, in a couple of cases, to get a sticker. But this time is different. Even though Sanders is near the top in most polls, only one of these young Iowans says she might caucus for him. Mahoney says last time, Sanders was the best of an uninspiring field.
MAHONEY: In 2016, it was really more of a function of - I supported him over Hillary - and who was the guy from Maryland? Like, yeah.
KEITH: Martin O'Malley.
MAHONEY: Martin O'Malley. Yeah, like, when that was my choice, yeah, sure, I supported Bernie, but this year it's different.
KEITH: But this time, Schott says there are a lot of other options, and she worries Sanders, who she was a fan of four years ago, is just going to rob support from candidates who she thinks have a better chance of winning.
SCHOTT: I just don't think that this is his campaign. All the candidates have very similar values but I think can go a lot farther with them than he can.
KEITH: As for the issues, the environment and climate change are high on the list; mass incarceration, LGBT rights and gun control rank, too. So who do they like? Van Heukelom is exploring a summer internship with Cory Booker.
VAN HEUKELOM: I went and saw him speak. He's really personable, and I think that he's really passionate, and he knows what he cares about.
KEITH: Mahoney followed Beto O'Rourke's Senate campaign.
MAHONEY: When he was campaigning for senator, he went to 252 counties in Texas. That's, like, a big deal, and he did it twice. He might be a little young, but he's in the spirit of compromise, and I really appreciate that.
KEITH: As our conversation goes on, it becomes clear the women candidates are barely getting a mention, even though there are half a dozen in the race. Moloney says he's following with interest Pete Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Ind.
MOLONEY: He's been pretty good. He's - I forget what he said for his CNN town hall. It was like, I have more governing experience than the vice president, I have more military experience than anybody in Congress, and I have - there's another thing he said; I don't remember. And also that he's not super old, which is good.
KEITH: The debates are still months away, but I had to ask.
If you were caucusing today, who would you caucus for?
BEAVERS: Harris.
MEYER: Beto.
NELSON: Bernie.
SCHNACK: Yang.
MOLONEY: Buttigieg.
VAN HEUKELOM: Cory Booker.
SCHOTT: Beto.
DANIELS: Beto.
MAHONEY: Beto.
KEITH: One each for Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Andrew Yang, Cory Booker and Pete Buttigieg, and four for the former congressman from Texas, Beto O'Rourke. Though none of these voters say they're fully locked in yet.

U.S. Designates Iran's Revolutionary Guard As A Foreign Terrorist Group,www.npr.org,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314442/u-s-designates-irans-revolutionary-guard-as-a-foreign-terrorist-group,"U.S. Designates Iran's Revolutionary Guard As A Foreign Terrorist Group U.S. Designates Iran's Revolutionary Guard As A Foreign Terrorist Group Embed Embed Heard on Morning Edition
David Greene talks to Brian Hook, a top State Department policy adviser on Iran, about the Trump administration labeling a wing of the Iranian military as a foreign terrorist organization.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The United States has blacklisted Iran's elite military branch, the Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it a terrorist organization. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the announcement yesterday.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MIKE POMPEO: For 40 years, the Islamic republic's Revolutionary Guard Corps has actively engaged in terrorism and created, supported and directed other terrorist groups. The IRGC masquerades as a legitimate military organization, but none of us should be fooled.
GREENE: This new designation freezes out Iran's most powerful military force, limiting its access to the international arena. This also means new sanctions against Iran. We have one of the officials behind this policy with us. Brian Hook is the U.S. representative for Iran and works alongside Secretary Pompeo at the State Department.
Brian Hook, welcome back to the program.
BRIAN HOOK: Good morning, David.
GREENE: So this, as I understand, is the very first time the United States has named an element of a foreign government as a terrorist entity. I mean, this is something previous administrations have considered but not done. What is the evidence you can bring us that the Revolutionary Guard belongs right there, alongside groups like ISIS and al-Qaida?
HOOK: This is an organization that has been part of the Iranian regime. And it uses terrorism as a tool of statecraft. And it's been doing this for 40 years. That's what makes it fundamentally different from any other government. When you look at its history, going back even to 1983, they were behind the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut. They were behind the U.S. Embassy bombing annex and Khobar Towers in 1996. The IRGC is often the organization that's behind the wrongful detentions of U.S. citizens, dual nationals. They also bombed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aries in 1992 and the Jewish center in Buenos Aries in '94.
That's just a fraction of what they've been doing, and so we thought that they met the statutory definition of a foreign terrorist organization.
GREENE: Can I just drill down on one thing you said, I mean, that the Revolutionary Guard can be responsible for holding Americans. Has - haven't U.S. diplomats had to negotiate with the Revolutionary Guard in the past to free Americans? And would that still be possible now if you can face criminal charges for dealing with them?
HOOK: Iran, the regime, since the time it took American diplomats hostage in 1979, has been using human beings as pawns in a political chess game. And so we think that's just an element of its foreign policy that we really can't try to strike deals with. It's something that we - they need to stop doing, and it's not just to the United States that it does it. It also does it to the nations all over the world. And so we...
GREENE: But can you still negotiate with them? Can that still happen in moments when it's necessary?
HOOK: Yes, it can. Doing this designation will not impede our diplomacy in any way. In the past, we've designated the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas - a range of organizations - and that has not impeded our diplomacy.
GREENE: So I want to talk about the implications of this or the possible implications. In response, Iran has now labeled the U.S. Central Command a terrorist organization. And the commander of the Revolutionary Guard Corps warned that he can basically now target the U.S. military the same way that they target groups like ISIS. Are U.S. troops at greater risk now?
HOOK: We don't believe so. Iranian aggression to the United States is a virtual constant feature of the - of Iran's foreign policy. If we apply pressure, they could try to make a display of strength. There's always that risk. But in the past, when we've eased up on pressure, as we did during the Iran nuclear deal, the IRGC took U.S. sailors hostage and humiliated them on camera. What we believe ultimately endangers American troops is an IRGC that operates with impunity and never gets deterred in the region. And we think this decision helps to build deterrents against the Revolutionary Guard's aggression against troops and our partners and allies in the region.
GREENE: I want to ask you about the timing of this. The response from Israel was quick and, I should say, pretty jubilant. I mean, Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is fighting for re-election in a very close race. Israelis are going to the polls today. He wrote on Twitter in Hebrew that President Trump was, quote, ""answering another of my important requests."" Is that what's happening here?
HOOK: The United States makes its national security decisions in the interests of Americans. We don't base it around elections or anything else. There are a number of nations that we think will benefit from designating the Revolutionary Guard. Israel is one of them. But I think many of our Sunni Arab partners in the region support this. We know that so many of our allies around the world are frustrated by the instability and the violence in the Middle East. And if we want to promote peace and stability in the Middle East, that can't be done without weakening the Revolutionary Guard Corps.
GREENE: I mean, we should say Iranians certainly see a connection with the Israeli election. I mean, Iran's foreign minister called this an election eve gift to Netanyahu. Even if the United States makes a decision based on national security, is this timing - is the timing of this announcement helpful to Benjamin Netanyahu?
HOOK: All I can say is that we make our national security decisions. This has been a process that's been in the works for many months. This was the earliest possible date that we could do it, at the conclusion of our interagency process.
GREENE: Brian Hook is a top State Department policy adviser on Iran, speaking to us about the decision to label Iran's Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization.
Thank you so much for your time.

"'Fosse/Verdon' Wiggles And Kicks, But Fails To Satisfy",www.npr.org,Linda Holmes,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711063555/fosse-verdon-wiggles-and-kicks-but-fails-to-satisfy,"Enlarge this image Michelle Williams gives it her all as Gwen Verdon in Fosse/Verdon .

Eric Liebowitz/FX If you could bottle the keen curiosity the new FX series Fosse/Verdon has about the details of both Bob Fosse's genius and his destructive, dishonest, sexually harassing, emotionally abusive behavior, you would perhaps have a little bit of curiosity to spare to make up for the project's limited interest in what it all meant for Gwen Verdon and countless other women he treated like hot garbage.
The first tell that this highly anticipated limited series cannot live up to its aspirations for itself is that while it is called Fosse/Verdon , the book it's based on is called Fosse . It is a better idea, in theory, to make a series that's about Fosse and Verdon and the collaboration that brought forward musicals like Chicago , Sweet Charity and Damn Yankees . Unfortunately, the series isn't really about both of them, except that both Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams — playing Fosse and Verdon — are stars. It's more like a twist on an old joke: ""But enough about Bob Fosse. What did Gwen Verdon think about Bob Fosse?"" [Note: They've only made five episodes available to press, and there are eight total.]
Fresh Air Dancer Gwen Verdon Of 'Fosse/Verdon' Book Reviews Biography Of Director Bob Fosse Razzles, Dazzles And Delights The Sam Wasson book Fosse , on which the show is based, is less a biography than a graduate thesis on Fosse's genius and, incidentally, a vigorous counterpoint to objections to his behavior that might scratch up his legacy. Most seriously, it raises the spectre, which the show pursues, of Fosse having been inappropriately sexualized, and perhaps sexually abused, by strippers in the clubs he worked in when he was 13 or 14 years old. That's obviously a very troubling story of trauma and it deserves to be told. Unfortunately for those hoping that sexualized girls would receive the same careful thought, the very same book unironically compliments the ""killer rack"" Verdon had at 15 when she was dancing ""nearly naked"" in front of ""loud and hungry men."" (Wasson is careful to point out also that she didn't have technique and was only there because of her sex appeal. At 15.)
Television and film never tire of these stories, it seems — men who are brilliant geniuses but who are awful people because of their terrible pain. Phantom Thread , Steve Jobs, Mad Men , it's an entire genre: The man is monstrous, but he's got his reasons, and you can't deny the talent, and women can't help wanting to either have him or mother him. It's clear the the executive producers of this series are fascinated by Fosse, and it's no wonder: they include Broadway hot properties Lin-Manuel Miranda and his Hamilton director Thomas Kail, as well as showrunner Steven Levenson, who wrote the Tony-winning book of Dear Evan Hansen .
What's less clear is what exactly the show is supposed to illuminate. There aren't enough new facts here for the biography aspect to be the point; it's supposed to be shedding light on something. It's just not clear what.
We watch as Fosse's overt, textbook sexual harassment of a dancer, in which she refuses to sleep with him and he then humiliates and demotes her, is brushed past like just one of his many complexities. Verdon goes on to tell him privately, in a moment treated as a gentle pearl of wisdom, that his new protege and future paramour Ann Reinking knows she's so good that she doesn't have to sleep with him to get a part. (She later does anyway, of course.) The unstated assumption is that men with power coercing women into sex only works on women without enough talent, which is absolutely appalling in its tone-deafness. Meanwhile, the dancer Fosse harassed remains a flat character, ultimately deciding to sleep with him because, presumably, she doesn't have enough talent not to. And then she vanishes. She doesn't matter.
There's an interesting directorial choice here, sometimes used very effectively, in which quick cuts connect brief moments into impressionistic montages, where you barely register what shots you're actually seeing, only the effect of the whole sequence. In one of them, Fosse looks down at interchangeable, random women in his bed, which, again, is all part of illuminating his pain and his emptiness. Again, the root of this weird angle on the situation seems to lie in Wasson's book, which insists that sex with dancers in his shows was ""an opportunity for Fosse to learn about and merge with his female collaborators."" For the most part, of course, those ""collaborators"" were people who worked for him. And if you can't learn about your collaborators other than with sex, you probably should stop collaborating with people you don't know. (That's not to even mention ""merge with,"" which: ew.)
What happened to those women? How many of them had their careers interrupted, their reputations damaged, their hopes dashed — how many of them watched their opportunities wither because he grew bored with them, or spoke ill of them? How many of them felt degraded by the way he treated them? That's not part of the story, even though how Fosse feels about them very much is. The only thing about them that's part of the story is how much he didn't give a flying fig about them, and that's regrettable.
This is ironic in part because it seems like part of the very reason for the show to exist is to address itself to the other side of the genius coin: Gwen Verdon. But unfortunately, despite heroic efforts from Williams to imbue Verdon with life and roundness and complexity, the script simply doesn't give her enough to do. Every scene with Williams in it is more interesting than every scene without her in it, and it's not because Rockwell isn't living it up as Bob Fosse — he very much is. But the portrayal of Fosse is unfortunately one that reads as a cliche. The character presents as a powerful man who poaches in self-pity from morning until night, and who, when presented with challenges, calls a woman he's hurt in the past and asks her to fix it. In Verdon's case, he often asks her to fix a show he can't manage to complete. She, on the other hand, is always a bit of a surprise, both hurt by Fosse and somehow sick of him, working around him to get Chicago staged even though he wants to do other things.
[A side note: The book Fosse tells the story of Fosse deciding to do Chicago — which was Verdon's idea — as a kindness, a ""valentine,"" essentially a thank-you gift to her after treating her so badly for so many years. But then, as soon as the show runs into trouble, Wasson talks about how Fosse was angry that Verdon ""rop[ed] him into it."" There is perhaps no better example of this kind of toxic genius than wanting to be patted on the back for the kindness of doing a project as a gift, then blaming the gift recipient when you become unhappy in the work.]
Had Verdon been treated as Fosse's equal in this series, it would have been a lot better. Had Fosse/Verdon been interested in interrogating the ways in which the contributions of women are erased by men who don't know the difference between a muse who inspires you and an uncredited collaborator who did some of the work for which you're being praised, then maybe. Maybe it would have worked out. Williams and Rockwell are doing their best, and the show honestly looks great. But it feels misbegotten, and unless there is a wild swerve in the last three episodes that pushes in the opposite direction from the worst instincts on display in the book — in which case I'll see you back here for a wrap-up — you'd be better off watching a collection of YouTube dance numbers."

Teen Years Echo Through A Lifetime In 'Trust Exercise',www.npr.org,Heller McAlpin,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/709999799/teen-years-echo-through-a-lifetime-in-trust-exercise,"In Art Lost And Found, The Echoes Of A Century's Upheaval
Choi is an extraordinarily patient writer, slowly building her novel sentence by careful sentence, as if layering coats of paint until she achieves the desired intensity of hue. Her descriptions of what it's like to be a high-strung, artsy teenager in an environment where you're emotionally stripped, exposed and on constant display are uncomfortably astute. Like Meg Wolitzer's The Interestings, Trust Exercise digs into the nitty-gritty of adolescents' social machinations and the bitter aftertaste of their disappointments, and shows how these years reverberate across a lifetime.
In a particularly elegiac passage, Choi writes, ""Remember the impossible eventfulness of time, transformation and emotion packed like gunpowder into the barrel. Remember the dilation and diffusion, the years within days. Theirs were endless; lives flowered and died between waking and noon.""
Reader: Remember that gunpowder image. Like Chekhov's proverbial gun on the mantel, it's bound to go off, at least metaphorically.
I know plenty of people who look back on college nostalgically, but I don't know many adults who would happily return to high school — which could be a problem. Trust Exercise evokes a complicated, miserable high school experience so vividly and intricately that it's liable to try readers' patience and turn them off early. And that would be a pity.
Choi's book isn't long, but its first half, the set-up for all that follows, feels long. Her construction, with its bottom-heavy foundation, raises issues about how long you want to hang around in a basement before ascending to floors with a better view — but it's worth hanging in there for her payoff, which is certain to cast what preceded it in new light. That said, I want to point out that Lisa Halliday, in contrast, managed to make all three sections of her clever novel Asymmetry equally compelling even on your first readthrough.
'Trust Exercise' is fiction that contains multiple truths and lies. Working with such common material, Choi has produced something uncommonly thought-provoking.
Which isn't to say there aren't pleasures aplenty right off the bat in Choi's laminated prose. She writes of ""the excruciating in-betweenness of no longer being children, yet lacking those powers enjoyed by adults."" One character sees her ""lonely, unloved competence"" reflected in a lowly stage prop, a plastic sewing kit. Then there's the Svengali-like teacher, a man who ""slid into the room like a knife"" with ""a noiseless and ambushing style of movement,"" who insists his students spell theater the British way, ending in ""re.""
There are all sorts of resonant observations that bear on the reliability of narratives, even when they involve events experienced first-hand: ""We never know, when life reunites us with someone, how closely our stories will match,"" Choi writes. (The same can be said of siblings who grew up in the same household yet have starkly different memories of it.)
Notions of truth become complicated in an environment where students are being taught to dissemble. Acting, they learn, is ""fidelity to authentic emotion, under imagined circumstances."" Literary fiction plays similar games, leading one character to argue, ""The whole thing about fiction not being the truth is a lie.""
Trust Exercise is fiction that contains multiple truths and lies. Working with such common material, Choi has produced something uncommonly thought-provoking. Trust me. Facebook"

Bush, about the impact of the Trump administration turnover. Card says it's disrupting to the cadence of government.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
When you look around the upper echelons of the Trump administration right now, there appear to be an awful lot of temps. Earlier this year, the president was asked why so many of his Cabinet officials are serving in an acting capacity. And here's what he said.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I sort of like acting - gives me more flexibility. Do you understand that? I like acting. So we have a few that are acting. We have a great, great Cabinet.
MARTIN: President Trump has replaced his attorney general and EPA administrator with permanent hires. But now there are two more vacancies, the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen. Whoever the president nominates for that particular role is going to have to deal with the backlash to the president's immigration policies, so it may not happen quickly.
Andrew Card served as chief of staff to President George W. Bush, and he is with us now on the line. Thank you so much for being with us this morning.
ANDREW CARD: Good morning, Rachel. It's great to be with you.
MARTIN: So do you think it matters to have a number of Cabinet members in their roles as - in an acting basis.
CARD: Well, it is destructing to the cadence of government doing its job. But this is also an important time for the president to have a team that he has confidence in, not only because he needs the team to help him, as he's president, he needs a team to be in place that he can count on doing the job when he's going to be distracted with the campaign. So I think it's important for him to have the people around him that he thinks can make a difference and do the job that he wants done - although it is disruptive.
It's particularly challenging, I think, for the Secret Service because this is a time when they have to beef up to get ready to protect a lot of candidates who may be running for president. So in addition to protecting the president and doing all of the other things the secret has to - the Secret Service has to do, they have to worry about staffing up to help presidential campaigns that they don't really want to have to help.
MARTIN: But especially when it comes to the Cabinet nominees - I mean, secretary of defense, currently in an acting capacity - and the interior secretary, currently in an acting capacity. I mean, what does the president mean when he says he likes the flexibility when it comes to these top jobs - I mean, especially jobs that are so urgent and important?
CARD: Well, when you're doing the job, whether you have the title acting or not, you have to do the job. So you are completely focused on doing your job. You don't really worry about the - the the fact that you may be acting, though there are challenges when you have to address Congress. And Congress - you'd like Congress to act quickly to get candidates confirmed that the president has nominated. I'm not sure that it's going to happen, but I suspect that Mitch McConnell will work hard to try to get things done quickly so that people can be fully confirmed in their positions.
MARTIN: Right - because there is a problem...
CARD: But you really want the person in the job to focus on doing the job for the president, and that's what's important. So they shouldn't be preoccupied whether or not their title is acting or the real job.
MARTIN: Right.
CARD: But it's also significant that the president is controlling the agenda. Everybody is talking about what's happening in the Cabinet right now. They're not talking about who's running for president. And that's also an ancillary benefit to have kind of the pot stirred all the time, and he has a great capacity to stir the pot.
MARTIN: But Cabinet secretaries in acting positions don't have to testify before Congress. I mean, that's significant. Is it not?
CARD: It is significant. And one of the things that happens when you have to nominate someone else to do a job and the hearings are going to be held on Capitol Hill, it takes the focus and gives your opposition the ability to have the focus be on the negative things that are happening, not the positive things. So yes, it's a challenge.
I think that Kristen (ph) Nielsen did a remarkable job. That's a tough job, Department of Homeland Security. She did a remarkable job, and she deserves a lot of kudos for what she did. But this is a time of change. And - and the president felt it was - a need to make a change there. I respect that. And I just hope that the organization itself focuses on doing their job rather than worries about what the changes mean.
MARTIN: What do you think she did well? - because she's gotten an awful lot of criticism, as you well know, for implementing the president's very controversial immigration policies, including separating children from families.
CARD: Well - and first of all, I think it's - it's an outrageous policy. But I also don't think there's a problem that - it's not easy to understand or to solve. And President Obama had a tough time dealing with this, and he had - didn't have anywhere near the magnitude of the problem that President Trump has.
So this is not an easy problem to address. And I hope cool, calm reflection on what is happening and what needs to be done will take place all across the aisle - Republicans, Democrats; in the executive branch and in the legislative branch - because this is a real challenge to be met. And I don't know that there are good answers. I think there - some problems are so great that there may be no good policy and answers. They may be just less bad policy answers.
MARTIN: President Trump has suggested he's making these changes at the Department of Homeland Security in order to go in an even, quote, ""tougher direction."" If he does bring in someone at DHS who's going to toe an even tougher line on immigration, can they get through the confirmation process right now?
CARD: Well, I think it's going to be very hard to get someone through the confirmation process unscathed, especially because it's an election year but even more significantly because of the nature of the policies that are being debated right now in the homeland security arena and the - the real problem at the (unintelligible) - at the border. There are real challenges at the border. I was just in Texas. And believe me; they - they can see the challenge every day.
MARTIN: Former Bush chief of staff Andrew Card. Thank you for your time this morning, sir. We appreciate it.
CARD: Thank you. Have a great day.
MARTIN: Thanks.

Judge Rules Against Trump Policy Of Sending Asylum-Seekers To Mexico,www.npr.org,Max Rivlin-Nadler,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711331399/judge-rules-against-trump-policy-of-sending-asylum-seekers-to-mexico,"A federal judge in California blocked the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocol policy that required asylum-seekers to return to Mexico as they await court hearings in the U.S.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
All right. As the Trump administration moves to take a harder stance on immigration, a federal judge in California has blocked the administration's policy requiring asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico as they wait for their court hearings in the United States. Officials say hundreds of asylum-seekers have been sent back to Mexican cities, from Tijuana to Juarez, under the president's so-called Migrant Protection Protocols. Reporter Max Rivlin-Nadler was in immigration court in San Diego when the judge's ruling came down.
MAX RIVLIN-NADLER, BYLINE: At 9 a.m. Monday, 19 Central American asylum-seekers, including families and small children, made their way from migrant shelters in Tijuana to the San Ysidro Port of Entry and then to a special courtroom in downtown San Diego. It was their first hearing in their immigration cases. None of them had lawyers. Many said they had tried to find one but couldn't; none of the pro bono lawyers on a list given to them by Customs and Border Protection would travel to Mexico to meet with them. Many said they were fearful of returning to Mexico, where they had been living since at least February, when they first entered the U.S. to apply for asylum. I'd rather be detained in the United States than have to return, said one father through tears, sitting next to his 10-year-old son.
Midway through the hearing, however, the judge was interrupted. A lawyer announced that the entire MPP program had been halted. An injunction had just come down from Judge Richard Seeborg in a federal court in San Francisco. Ian Philabaum is the program coordinator at the Innovation Law Lab, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit which resulted in the injunction. The suit claimed that the government was not correctly applying asylum law.
IAN PHILABAUM: The Trump administration was trying to manipulate the statute in order to further its efforts to impede asylum-seekers from being able to seek their protection that they are afforded under international and domestic law here in the United States.
RIVLIN-NADLER: Since first going into effect in January, the MPP policy has expanded to El Paso, Texas, and to Calexico, east of San Diego. In Mexicali, across the border from Calexico, one asylum-seeker waiting for her immigration hearing was Sairi Lemus (ph), a Guatemalan mother of three. She explained the process to KJZZ's Michel Marizco.
SAIRI LEMUS: (Speaking Spanish).
RIVLIN-NADLER: ""And then, well, they interviewed us, and everything but no,"" she said. ""They sent us to wait here. We have an appointment with the judge May 8 in San Ysidro."" Lawyers are still trying to make sense of the ruling - who can stay in the U.S., who can return to the U.S. There were 11 plaintiffs named in the lawsuit, and all are currently in Tijuana.
LISA KNOX: I'm not sure how broadly this is going to apply and who's going to be allowed to return.
RIVLIN-NADLER: Lisa Knox is an attorney at Centro Legal de la Raza. She represented plaintiffs in the case.
KNOX: So certainly, it could be that everyone's going to be allowed to return to the U.S. who's been through the Migrant Protection Protocols program. But the order is very clear that the 11 individuals named in the lawsuit have to be allowed to enter the U.S.
RIVLIN-NADLER: The ruling will go into effect at 5 p.m. on April 12. The federal government can appeal the injunction. For the 19 asylum-seekers in immigration court in San Diego when the ruling came down, the judge said they would be sent back to Tijuana for now, pending another round of interviews to determine whether their fear of returning is credible. They might be among the very last Central American immigrants returned to Mexico. For NPR News, I'm Max Rivlin-Nadler in San Diego.

South Korean Brewery Makes Korean Beer In California : The Salt : NPR,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/04/09/696638173/why-a-south-korean-brewery-moved-to-california-to-make-korean-beer,"Enlarge this image After starting a brewery in Seoul, Booth Brewery co-founders Heeyoon Kim (left) and Sunghoo Yang moved their operations to California to make Korean beer and ship it back.

After starting a brewery in Seoul, Booth Brewery co-founders Heeyoon Kim (left) and Sunghoo Yang moved their operations to California to make Korean beer and ship it back.
Courtesy of The Booth Brewing Co. Booth Brewing, one of South Korea's most visible craft beer producers, doesn't make its beer where Korean beer giants Hite and OB produce their ubiquitous watery lagers. Instead, most of Booth's beers are brewed in Eureka, the California city near the Oregon border most known for redwood trees and marijuana cultivation.
Booth launched in Seoul in 2013 after husband and wife team Sunghoo Yang, a former investment analyst, and Heeyoon Kim, a former doctor, wanted to help correct the dearth of craft beer in South Korea. Part of their impetus was an article that ran a few years prior in The Economist . ""Brewing remains just about the only useful activity at which North Korea beats the South,"" the article concluded, while declaring North Korea's government-brewed Taedonggang as more memorable than South Korea's beer offerings.
Like many South Koreans, Yang and Kim wanted to prove that conclusion wrong. So they teamed up with Daniel Tudor, the article's author, and opened a pub that served pizza and craft beer out of a Seoul alley. Their patriotic origin story and quirky branding — their bottles have colorful labels featuring the adventures of a blue creature called the Boothman — quickly attracted a fan base. Within the year, they expanded to four more locations.
""Hoppy beers, it's an acquired taste,"" says Yang. ""The first time you try it, it's a little different and bitter, but then once you get the hang of it, you really appreciate the style and then people kind of get addicted to it."" For many of their customers, trying American-style hoppy IPAs for the first time was a hard sell. ""I think half the customers, when they first came to our bar, thought our beer was too bitter, so they couldn't finish a pint. But then as time passed on, that wasn't a problem anymore,"" Yang says.
It was a good time to join the craft beer business. In the early 2000s, the Korean government started issuing microbrewery licenses, leading to a boom in brewpubs, usually offering German-style beers like wheat beers and Pilsners. But they were only allowed to sell their beer on the brewery premises. In 2014, the laws changed, allowing smaller breweries to finally distribute outside of their pubs.

Courtesy of The Booth Brewing Co. A few years ago, Booth was having its beers made off-site by a contract brewery. But the company wanted to grow, and to do that, it needed its own brewery. At the same time, Eureka's Lost Coast brewing, an American craft beer mainstay since 1989, was also growing. Yang and Kim were familiar with Lost Coast, and when that brewery announced its move to a bigger facility, the Booth founders heard the news. So they traveled across the world to buy Lost Coast's 30-barrel brew house, and started producing beer there in 2017.
Yes, shipping the beer back to Korea is expensive, Yang says. But it's actually a better business model for them, because of access to ingredients like hops. There wasn't a distributor in Korea, so they had to import their own, which sometimes didn't make it through customs. There was also a bigger pool of brewer talent in America. And it was cheaper for Booth to make beer overseas because of Korea's tax laws, which impose larger taxes on Korean-made beers than on imported ones, much to the irritation of local breweries.
While Booth also has a small, four-barrel brewing system in Korea, the majority of its beer is brewed in Eureka and shipped back, or distributed throughout Humboldt County, Calif., and the Bay Area. The company offers a variety of beers and enjoys collaborating with other breweries worldwide as well as producing limited edition beers, such as a smoothie IPA that benefits LGBT charities.
Booth's beer offerings are tailored to the two markets. The company doesn't push its hoppier IPAs in Korea, since they're more expensive to produce and not as price competitive as other options. And craft beer has become such an established part of American drinking culture that any decent bar is more likely to have a variety of craft beers than mass lagers like Budweiser, Yang points out. ""Whereas Korea, we're still in the stages where craft beer is something new, it's interesting to try, so it's something that you kind of opt for and maybe not go back to it for a while,"" he says.
There's a lot of excitement in the Korean beer scene, but it's still early. ""The craft market in Korea is growing steadily and has a pretty wide 'general awareness' in the country, but details and a real understanding is still lacking outside of a few small groups of hardcore fans,"" Erik Moynihan, CEO of Seoul-based Magpie Brewing, wrote in an email. He points to encouraging signs, like the fact that there's been a spike in the number of new breweries opening, and new laws allowing craft breweries to sell their products in grocery and convenience stores.
Recently, there have been discussions in the Korean craft beer scene about what defines a Korean brewery: If the owners aren't Korean nationals, does it still count? What about Booth and Korean breweries that make their beers in other countries? ""It's a whirlpool of opinion that we at Magpie are often caught up in as well,"" Moynihan says. ""Regardless, Booth was present at the beginning of the beer scene in Korea, and really had an impact on the attention (domestic and global) that our market has attracted.""
And Booth — which considers itself a ""global company starting from Seoul,"" Kim wrote in an email — hopes to grow that market even more, with a taproom in Eureka slated to open this year, and possibly one in Los Angeles. The company also wants to expand into Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam, which have been slower to adopt craft beer than Korea has.
""Trends are really fast,"" Yang says of Korea's relationship with craft beer. ""It catches on really fast, it goes away really fast, but we hope that this one's here to stay.""

In Redding, Calif., where the Carr Fire burned more than 200,000 acres and destroyed more than a thousand homes, there's a feeling of desperation. Something has to be done to clear the dense stands of trees and thick brush in the mountains around town, or the next fire will be even worse.
""It's not just global warming,"" said Ryan Adcock, who grew up here. She was forced to evacuate her home for five days due to the Carr Fire and was taking advantage of a rare smoke free morning walking with her kids along a river front bike path. National California Carr Fire Leaves Many Unsure About Their Future California Carr Fire Leaves Many Unsure About Their Future Embed Embed Transcript
""It's not just one thing, there's logging, there are several factors that play into why it's worse now than it's ever been,"" she says.
There was a time when logging and timber companies ruled Redding. When Bill Oliver moved here in the 1960s to take a job with the U.S. Forest Service, he remembers the valley was lined with timber mill after timber mill.
""That was the major industry between Shasta Lake City, 8 miles north, all the way down to Anderson, 8 miles south of here,"" Oliver says.
In response to California's deadly wildfires, the Trump administration is calling for more 'active' logging in western forests. They want to open up more public lands to the timber industry, to reduce the fire risk but also revive rural, natural-resource dependent economies.
This is a decades-old debate in the West and by no means a new GOP talking point. But out on the ground, foresters and even some timber industry leaders say what's really needed to mitigate the wildfire threat is a lot more involved — and expensive.
""The picture has changed,"" says Rich Fairbanks.
Fairbanks managed and fought fires for the U.S. Forest Service for 30 years, largely in southern Oregon and northern California, where many of the West's worst fires have burned so far this year. Fairbanks is now a fire and forest management consultant from his home near Ashland, Ore.
""A lot of senators and congressmen are still thinking we're back in the 1970s,"" he says.
Indeed, much has changed since the 1970s and 1980s, which marked the height of the timber wars over clear cutting and the spotted owl. Since then, the amount of federal land open to logging has dropped precipitously and a lot of the logging moved to private land. Timber and logging companies themselves have consolidated and mechanized, leaving fewer people necessary to do the work.
A 'sustainable' industry
So, even if more public land was opened back up to logging, retired Forest Service officials like Bill Oliver wonder whether there is enough industry left in the West to process the timber. Oliver, a wildfire scientist, says the forests are dangerously overgrown today due to prior forest management decisions.
""The forests are much too dense because we've tried to keep fire out for about a hundred years,"" Oliver says.
Oliver says the actual stuff that needs to be cleared out of the woods are the brush and small diameter trees that provide kindling for today's mega fires. Those don't tend to be worth that much to the timber industry. It's the big trees that make the money. This has long been an impediment to joint public-private forest restoration and wildfire mitigation efforts. But there are signs this is changing.
One of the few big players left in northern California's wood products industry is Sierra Pacific Industries . Each of their six mills in the region are being systematically upgraded to handle that smaller diameter wood so it can be turned into commercially viable products like particle board.

The industry sees opportunity, says Dan Tomascheski, vice president of forest resources at the company. But they need reassurances that there will be a lumber supply on public lands for more than just one or two years.
""This can't be a bubble,"" he says. ""This has to be a ramp up and then a sustained program.""
The Forest Service says there is a sustainable market — and opportunity — when you consider that upwards of 80 million acres of forest lands nationwide are considered at risk of major fires and in need of treatment. So far only about two million acres of public land have been treated through logging and other thinning projects or prescribed burns, according to the agency.
""We're not talking about just cutting trees to cut trees,"" says Tomascheski. ""We're talking about harvesting timber in a way that produces the fuel breaks and the thinning that we all need.""
Environmental appeals
The Trump administration says the biggest thing standing in the way of the fuel load is environmental lawsuits. A bill introduced this month by Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., aims to reduce legal appeals and fast track forest management projects on some national forests in the West.
At a recent committee hearing, Daines said there were more than two dozen forest management projects under litigation in Montana alone.
""I can't even see the mountains out of my backdoor in my home which are just a few miles away because of the smoke,"" Daines said.
The administration's secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke, has even referred to some of the groups opposing logging as environmental terrorist organizations , causing an outcry in many corners of the region. Still, in a lot of the West, tensions between environmentalists and logging companies have actually cooled over the past decade.
There are now partnerships and compromises being made on forest health projects from Idaho to California that don't always make the headlines. Dan Tomascheski at Sierra Pacific says his company now regularly talks with some environmental groups that he couldn't imagined working with 20 years ago. ""The level of hostility and the fiery dialogue has really diminished,"" Tomascheski says. He says this is largely due to an understanding among all sides that the status quo in forest management isn't working and the wildfires are only worsening in severity.
People outside of Washington D.C. tend to point their finger at a much less high profile culprit they say is holding up fire mitigation projects: funding.
""The biggest enemy of good forest management, especially fire management, is budget cuts,"" says forest management consultant Rich Armstrong.
Armstrong says it takes money to plan and implement the kinds of landscape level forest restoration projects that are needed. But the government has cut the budget for wildfire mitigation and other forest programs, while diverting much of the remaining funding to pay to fight wildfires.
At Sierra Pacific, Dan Tomascheski sees the effects of this on the ground.
""The Forest Service has lost quite a bit of expertise in all of the disciplines of hydrology, road engineering, wildlife biology etcetera,"" he says. ""They've lost a lot of the funding for those positions and they need to regain some of that expertise.""
Congress recently passed a bi-partisan fix creating a separate fund to pay for wildfire suppression, though that won't take effect until next year at the earliest. Correction Aug. 30, 2018

Are Plastic Bag Bans Garbage? : Planet Money,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2019/04/09/711181385/are-plastic-bag-bans-garbage,"Are Plastic Bag Bans Garbage? Facebook April 9, 2019 8:04 AM ET Greg Rosalsky Fiona Goodall/Getty Images
Editor's note: This is an excerpt of Planet Money's newsletter. You can sign up here .
It was only about 40 years ago that plastic bags became standard at U.S. grocery stores. This also made them standard in sewers, landfills, rivers and the Great Pacific Garbage Patch . They clog drains and cause floods, litter landscapes and kill wildlife. The national movement to get rid of them is gaining steam — with more than 240 cities and counties passing laws that ban or tax them since 2007. New York recently became the second U.S. state to ban them. But these bans may be hurting the environment more than helping it.
University of Sydney economist Rebecca Taylor started studying bag regulations because it seemed as though every time she moved for a new job — from Washington, D.C., to California to Australia — bag restrictions were implemented shortly after. ""Yeah, these policies might be following me,"" she jokes. Taylor recently published a study of bag regulations in California. It's a classic tale of unintended consequences.
Paper or plastic?
Before California banned plastic shopping bags statewide in late 2016, a wave of 139 California cities and counties implemented the policy themselves. Taylor and colleagues compared bag use in cities with bans with those without them. For six months, they spent weekends in grocery stores tallying the types of bags people carried out (she admits these weren't her wildest weekends). She also analyzed these stores' sales data.
Taylor found these bag bans did what they were supposed to: People in the cities with the bans used fewer plastic bags, which led to about 40 million fewer pounds of plastic trash per year. But people who used to reuse their shopping bags for other purposes, like picking up dog poop or lining trash bins, still needed bags. ""What I found was that sales of garbage bags actually skyrocketed after plastic grocery bags were banned,"" she says. This was particularly the case for small, 4-gallon bags, which saw a 120 percent increase in sales after bans went into effect. Loading...

Trash bags are thick and use more plastic than typical shopping bags. ""So about 30 percent of the plastic that was eliminated by the ban comes back in the form of thicker garbage bags,"" Taylor says. On top of that, cities that banned plastic bags saw a surge in the use of paper bags, which she estimates resulted in about 80 million pounds of extra paper trash per year.
Plastic haters, it's time to brace yourselves. A bunch of studies find that paper bags are actually worse for the environment. They require cutting down and processing trees, which involves lots of water, toxic chemicals, fuel and heavy machinery. While paper is biodegradable and avoids some of the problems of plastic, Taylor says, the huge increase of paper, together with the uptick in plastic trash bags, means banning plastic shopping bags increases greenhouse gas emissions. That said, these bans do reduce nonbiodegradable litter.
Are tote bags killing us?
What about reusable cloth bags? We know die-hard public radio fans love them! They've got to be great, right?
Nope. They can be even worse.
A 2011 study by the U.K. government found a person would have to reuse a cotton tote bag 131 times before it was better for climate change than using a plastic grocery bag once. The Danish government recently did a study that took into account environmental impacts beyond simply greenhouse gas emissions, including water use, damage to ecosystems and air pollution. These factors make cloth bags even worse. They estimate you would have to use an organic cotton bag 20,000 times more than a plastic grocery bag to make using it better for the environment.
That said, the Danish government's estimate doesn't take into account the effects of bags littering land and sea, where plastic is clearly the worst offender.
Stop depressing me. What should we do?
The most environment-friendly way to carry groceries is to use the same bag over and over again. According to the Danish study, the best reusable ones are made from polyester or plastics like polypropylene. Those still have to be used dozens and dozens of times to be greener than plastic grocery bags, which have the smallest carbon footprint for a single use.
As for bag policies, Taylor says a fee is smarter than a ban. She has a second paper showing a small fee for bags is just as effective as a ban when it comes to encouraging use of reusable bags. But a fee offers flexibility for people who reuse plastic bags for garbage disposal or dog walking.
Taylor believes the recent legislation passed in New York is a bad version of the policy. It bans only plastic bags and gives free rein to using paper ones ( counties have the option to impose a 5-cent fee on them). Taylor is concerned this will drive up paper use. The best policy, Taylor says, imposes a fee on both paper and plastic bags and encourages reuse.
This bag research makes public radio's love for tote bags awkward, doesn't it? It might be weird, though, if we started giving out plastic grocery bags.

Photo of Kamasi Washington: Getty Images. Photo of Herbie Hancock: courtesy of the artist. Herbie Hancock and Kamasi Washington, two of the biggest names in jazz, will join forces for a North American co-headlining tour this summer.
Their initial slew of dates, starting July 30 in Vienna, Va. and ending Aug. 23 in Berkeley, Calif., should go on sale to the general public this Friday. (Tickets for the pair's first date, in Virginia, are already available .)
Hancock, a 14-time Grammy-winning pianist and NEA Jazz Master, will lead a band similar to the one featured a few years ago in a Jazz Night in America concert film : Lionel Loueke on guitars, Terrace Martin on alto saxophone and synthesizers, James Genus on electric bass, and Vinnie Colaiuta on drums. Their set list will combine Hancock favorites and material from a highly anticipated forthcoming album.
Hancock has long been an exemplar of jazz crossover: he's the rare instrumental virtuoso to credibly break through to a mainstream audience, let alone the pop album chart. He received his first gold record in 1974 with Head Hunters , the self-titled debut by his new jazz-funk band. At the time, the critic Lee Underwood stamped a concert review with a smirk: ""Mr. Communicate-With-A-Wider-Audience, Herbie Hancock, opened to a full house recently, again pleasing the funkers while disappointing the more cerebrally oriented connoisseurs.""
The Week's Best Stories From NPR Books Herbie Hancock: 'On A Path To Find My Own Answer' Washington has earned a similar reputation since the release of his debut triple album, The Epic, in 2015. A tenor saxophonist and bandleader with a talent for the ecstatic, Washington is the key figure in what has lately been touted as a jazz resurgence in popular culture. (""Mr. Communicate-With-A-Wider-Audience"" is an epithet he'd probably wear as a badge of honor.)
His follow-up to The Epic , a double album titled Heaven and Earth , received widespread acclaim last year, landing at No. 12 on the NPR Music Jazz Critics Poll . And at the beginning of this year, Washington had a premiere at Sundance: As Told to G/D Thyself , a dreamy, episodic short film, featuring the work of African-American filmmakers like Bradford Young and Jenn Nkiru. (The film has just been made available for streaming on Apple Music.)
Music Interviews Kamasi Washington's 3-Hour Jazz 'Epic,' Complete With Creation Myth Both Hancock and Washington will be busy in the weeks and months leading up to their tour. Hancock, as chairman of the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz , is preparing for International Jazz Day festivities in Australia at the end of this month, culminating in a global all-star concert in Melbourne on April 30. Hancock is also scheduled to perform at the Beacon Theater in New York on Aug. 1, and at the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island on Aug. 2 and 3.
Washington is also headlining at Newport, on Aug. 3, but that's far from the only synchronicity he has with his co-headliner. Terrace Martin, a longtime Washington associate, is another one. (It seems likely that Martin will also play with Washington on the tour.) Hancock and Washington also both appeared on You're Dead! , the 2014 album by producer Flying Lotus. And there have been reliable reports that Hancock's next album-in-progress will feature Washington (along with Martin, Flying Lotus and rapper Kendrick Lamar).
Moving out of the realm of the speculative, there's a bit of precedent for this tour. In 2017, Hancock headlined a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, with Washington as the opener. Reviewing that concert for the Los Angeles Times, Chris Barton painted the picture of a hometown victory lap for Washington, and a show of dominion by Hancock.
""The only note missing in Hancock's arsenal was a guest spot from Washington, a seemingly natural choice that could have built a bridge between two generations,"" Barton wrote. ""A missed opportunity for a special moment, maybe — but if you were listening, the bridge was there all along."""
Wound Healing Might Be Improved With Staples Modeled On Porcupine Quills : Shots - Health News,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/09/711050307/porcupine-barbs-for-better-wound-healing,"Deep Look via YouTube At first, the idea of using porcupine quills to patch up wounds sounds torturous. But, taking inspiration from the spiky rodent, researchers have begun to work on a new type of surgical staple that may be less damaging — and less painful — than current staples.
Worldwide, surgeons perform more than 4 million operations annually, usually using sutures and staples to close wounds. Yet these traditional tools designed to aid healing can create their own problems.
""We've been using sutures and staples for decades, and they've been incredibly useful,"" says Jeff Karp, a bioengineer at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""But there are challenges in terms of placing them for minimally invasive procedures.""
Shots - Health News Failure To Save A Child In Wartime Inspires Wound-Healing Tech Surgical staples are faster to insert than sutures, which require a needle and thread, he explains. But current staples, made of metal, tear tissue on the way in and cause more damage when bent to stay in place.
The quill tip in this finger has microscopic, backward-facing barbs that make the quill hard to remove. Bioengineers think the same sort of barbs could help keep dissolvable medical staples in place until a wound heals. Josh Cassidy/KQED Josh Cassidy/KQED Karp and his team have been searching for new ways to hold tissue together.
One brainstorming session led to a discussion of a porcupine and its quill.
The North American porcupine appears cute, but it has more than 30,000 menacing quills covering much of its body, each one hollow and 2 to 3 inches long . The slow-moving herbivore uses the quills as a last-resort defense against predators.
The quills are actually specialized hairs that mostly lie flat against the animal's body. Only when threatened will the porcupine erect them. And, contrary to a common myth, porcupines don't shoot the quills out from their bodies.
""The wonderful thing about porcupines is that they seem to feel secure,"" said Uldis Roze , emeritus biology professor at Queens College, City University of New York. ""They feel like they're not in danger, and they're sweet.""
When the porcupine is relaxed, its other hairs and fur hide most of the quills.
Shots - Health News Slug Slime Inspires Scientists To Invent Sticky Surgical Glue When threatened, the adult porcupine displays three types of warnings before lashing out, according to Roze's book The North American Porcupine. First, the contrasting black and white pattern of the animal's quills and other hairs — known as aposematic coloration — is a visual warning signal. A unique pungent odor and ominous teeth are further clues that dogs, mountain lions and other potential predators should stay away.

Lindsay Wildlife Experience Lindsay Wildlife Experience The North American porcupine has a cute face, but it has upward of 30,000 menacing quills covering much of its body. The slow-moving herbivore uses them as a last-resort defense against predators.
Lindsay Wildlife Experience If that doesn't work, a porcupine will use its powerful, spiky tail to slap at the aggressor. Each quill is held in place by its own special structure in the porcupine's skin. Direct physical contact with a predator causes the porcupine's skin to release the quill.
Quills from North American porcupines pack a hidden punch: microscopic, backward-facing barbs.
Covering just the needlelike tip of the quills, the barbs make removing a quill difficult, because they flare out when pulled in a direction opposite to the way they went in.
That means that if a predator gets quilled, the quill might never come out. When scientists examine the skulls of deceased mountain lions, Roze says, they often find the tips of porcupine quills embedded in the lions' jaw bones
""The mountain lion just accepts it,"" said Roze. ""It's part of the work of killing a porcupine.""
Of course, that mountain lion's days of porcupine feasting may end forever if the quills keep it from eating or end up in the cat's vulnerable internal organs.

Courtesy of Woo Kyung Cho Still, a quill passing through the body is far from painless — it's excruciating — as Roze knows from personal experience. He was once quilled in his bicep while up in a tree, trying to catch a porcupine.
Despite his wife's suggestion afterward that he immediately seek medical care, he waited two harrowing days. By that time, the quill had traveled in one direction and cleanly exited his lower arm. He kept the quill as a souvenir.
The quill's barbs eased its penetration into his flesh. They also helped drive the quill in deeper, until it exited (though it would have been stopped by a harder material, such as bone).
It was the barbs that most interested Karp. He and his team ran experiments comparing a barbed quill to a barbless quill, measuring the forces required to insert and remove barbed spears.
In contrast to a barbless quill or a surgical staple — which tear the tissue and create gaps that are susceptible to infection — the barbed quill's design means it does minimal damage on the way in, the researchers found.

Right: In a live porcupine, the partially hidden quills usually lie flat along the herbivore's body, amidst other hairs, until and unless called into action. Josh Cassidy/KQED Josh Cassidy/KQED A new type of medical staple that had two barbed tips would require much less effort to place, Karp figures, and the gripping power of the barbs would hold it in position without needing to bend the staple.
Karp says he anticipates making the new staples out of biodegradable material so they will fully dissolve over time without having to be removed.
The challenge now is to re-create the full barb's shape.
""Nature has designs that humans can't achieve yet, at least at large scale,"" Karp says. ""Large-scale manufacturing is a human problem.""
But if the right technologies become available, he estimates that human testing of porcupine quill-inspired tools could begin in two to five years.
""This could be an enabler for smaller incisions to be made in a large number of surgeries,"" Karp says. That would be good news for both surgeons and patients.

Tyrone Siu/Reuters
A Hong Kong district court has found nine activists guilty of public nuisance crimes for their roles in organizing massive pro-democracy rallies that took over city streets and became known as the ""Umbrella Movement"" in 2014.
The rallies were spurred by outrage in Hong Kong over the Chinese government's plans to limit voters' choices among candidates to lead the city's government — a move that was seen as attacking its autonomy.
From Chongqing, NPR's Rob Schmitz reports for our Newscast unit:
""Those convicted include three prominent activists who are seen as the faces of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement: sociology professor Chan Kin-man, law professor Benny Tai, and Baptist Minister Chu Yiu-Ming. They could be jailed for up to seven years for their part in the Umbrella protests.""
That trio was found guilty of conspiracy to commit public nuisance. Along with their co-defendants, all but one of them were found guilty of either inciting public nuisance or ""incitement to incite"" others.
Human rights groups are criticizing the court's verdict, with Sophie Richardson of Human Rights Watch saying of the outcome , ""No other word for this than outrageous.""
As they arrived at court for Tuesday's hearing, the activists smiled and spoke to crowds of supporters. After the verdict was announced, they chanted slogans together. They aren't likely to learn their sentences until at least Wednesday; until then, they are free on bail, according to the Hong Kong Free Press . Hong Kong Police Arrest 'Umbrella Movement' Pro-Democracy Organizers
Speaking in court Tuesday, Chu said, according to the Free Press, ""In the Umbrella Movement, I am just a bell toller... In so doing, I hope that consciences may wake up, and together we work to save the day.""
The three main activists founded the Umbrella Movement and planned protests with the goal of flooding roads in a key government district with so many people that Chinese-backed authorities would not have any choice but to pay attention to their demands. They also saw the large public support for their demonstrations as proof that many of Hong Kong's residents either tolerated or approved of their actions.
But in his ruling, District Judge Johnny Chan said the organizers had been naïve to think they could change Beijing's mind ""with a click of fingers"" — and that they were also naïve to think they could easily disperse a protest that quickly grew to tens of thousands of people.
Also found guilty were former student leaders Tommy Cheung Sau-yin and Eason Chung Yiu-wa, along with lawmakers Tanya Chan and Shiu Ka-chun, League of Social Democrats vice chairman Raphael Wong, and former Democratic Party legislator Lee Wing-tat.
In his 268-page ruling , Chan often referenced hours of video footage of the demonstrations and the defendants' speeches. He cited their words often, including one passage in which he said Tanya Chan ""specifically asked [that] supporters going to the venue should equip themselves with umbrellas, bottled water, hats, sunglasses or goggles"" to protect themselves from tear gas and other crowd dispersion tools.
Tanya Chan also instructed protesters to ""sit in a way that a male protester should sit next to a female [protester] and they should link their arms for the purpose of increasing the cost of the police carrying them away,"" he said.
The judge also cited a portion of the video records that showed the defendants urging protesters to plan to work in shifts, and to make supply runs.
Tanya Chan ""said she believed the era of disobedience battle had already begun,"" he wrote.
In their defense, the activists said they were using the protests as a last resort, in the tradition of using civil disobedience to inspire change. The judge noted that through legal precedents, the concept of civil disobedience is ""recognized in Hong Kong.""
But Judge Chan also said, ""Even if a defendant is prosecuted for an offence committed in the course of civil disobedience, civil disobedience is not a defense in law."""

As the trial escalates, so do the many tensions that threaten to tear apart Hesina's family and Yan itself.
Descendant of the Crane lingers over beautiful imagery and elegant language without sacrificing tension or intrigue. The twists and turns revealed as the mystery unravels in Hesina's hands are very satisfying, and she becomes more and more likable as her gentle nature is pushed to its limits. It's also rare to find a book in this genre that has sibling relationships at its heart rather than friendships, but Hesina's deepest and most troubled bonds are with her brothers and sister — full, half, and adopted — and the complexities of these relationships are lovingly explored.
One area where Descendant of the Crane doesn't shine its brightest is the romance that blooms between Hesina and her appointed prosecutor, which feels forced and tepid at best. It's easy to imagine that this could have been a late addition, dropped in to make the book more marketable to perceived young adult audiences. It really wasn't necessary, because Descendant of the Crane is unabashedly a unique and richly embroidered tapestry of genres.

Updated at 12:50 p.m. ET
Attorney General William Barr suggested on Tuesday he would negotiate with leaders in Congress who want to see the secret evidence that underpins special counsel Robert Mueller's report.
Barr reaffirmed to members of the House Appropriations Committee that the first version of the report he plans to release — within one week, he said — would be redacted.
If the leaders of the House and Senate judiciary committees want to see more, the attorney general said, he will play ball.
""I'm glad to talk to Chairman [Jerry] Nadler and Chairman [Lindsey] Graham as to whether they feel they need more information and if there's a way we can accommodate that,"" Barr said. What Else Could Robert Mueller's Report Reveal About Trump And Russia?
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Nadler, D-N.Y., has been unequivocal in his calls for access to the full work product from Mueller's office — not only his report but the testimony, intelligence and other material that supported his findings.
The chairman responded to Barr's comments on Tuesday in a post on Twitter that appeared to hold the view that no negotiations are required: The law grants Congress access to the material that Nadler has requested, he argues, irrespective of the views of the attorney general. Congress is—as a matter of law—entitled to each of the categories AG Barr proposed to redact from the Special Counsel's report. Full release of the report to Congress is consistent with both congressional intent and the interests of the American public. https://t.co/rfplPJ6uXB pic.twitter.com/5YPT7eCo4d — (((Rep. Nadler))) (@RepJerryNadler) April 9, 2019
In a subsequent post , Nadler said that no discussions of any kind are now underway: ""We still have not heard from the attorney general.""
Barr also told members of Congress he would be open to negotiations with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Graham, R-S.C.
The attorney general also announced something else likely to please Graham: a forthcoming report about investigators' use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in the Russia investigation. What You Need To Know About The Russia Investigations: The Dossier
Graham has joined other Republicans in calling for answers about how authorities used material from former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, author of the infamous Russia dossier , in the request for surveillance of Carter Page, a onetime junior Trump 2016 campaign aide.
Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report about that could be done in May or June, Barr said. Big Questions In Russia Case May Be Answered If FISA Documents Are Unredacted
The attorney general also said the door appears open to more investigations or reports about the conduct of the Russia investigation — music to the ears of Republicans who have followed the lead of President Trump in calling it a ""witch hunt"" or suggesting it is the product of a conspiracy by the FBI and the Justice Department.
""More generally I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation, trying to get my arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016,"" Barr said.
The next standoff
The Democratic majority on the House Judiciary Committee has voted to authorize Nadler to issue a subpoena for Mueller's work product and evidence if necessary. House Judiciary Approves Subpoena For Full Mueller Report In Party-Line Vote
Barr told lawmakers later in the hearing that he isn't planning to give an unredacted copy of the Mueller report to Congress absent the negotiations he said he would be open to undertaking with Nadler.
In other words, Nadler won't get a copy without at least asking and, perhaps, a separate dispute. If Nadler tries to use his power to issue a subpoena, that could lead to a court case. "

It was Marian Catholic Night at Guaranteed Rate Field last August, and Sister Mary Jo Sobieck took the field to throw the first pitch for the Chicago White Sox.
The teacher from Marian Catholic High School in Chicago Heights bounced the baseball off her bicep, threw a strike, and became a national sensation.
""It just kind of blew up,"" said Sobieck.
In the latest stop on her journey to fame, Sobieck is appearing on a baseball card that will be sold in Topps trading card packs as a part of their Allen and Ginter series. The series features baseball players alongside celebrities and famous figures from other sports.
A marketing manager for Topps, Susan Lulgjuraj, said Sobieck seemed like a perfect fit for a card.
""We wanted to feature her on the set because she is a huge sports fan, a lifelong baseball fan,"" said Lulgjuraj. ""And when we saw her throw that first pitch last year, it kind of clicked. We said, 'How cool would it be to feature Sister [Mary] Jo on a card?' "" Article continues below
Sobieck described her reaction when she saw an image of the card for the first time.
""I was like, that is ... that is ... that's raw,"" she said. ""It was really cool.""
Sobieck is scheduled to sign some of her baseball cards on Monday. She said she plans to sign them how she signs passes for her students when they're late to class.
""I just kind of beefed that up a little bit more,"" said Sobieck. ""So it's something I'm pretty used to doing.""
Sobieck said Topps is paying her $1,000, which she plans to donate to a scholarship fund at Marian Catholic High School that's named after her. Lulgjuraj said Topps plans to release Sobieck's cards on July 17.
And some of the cards will even come with a ""relic"": a piece of one of Sobieck's veils.

White House Lawyers Discussed Trump Tax Returns With Treasury Department : NPR,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711256462/white-house-lawyers-discussed-trump-tax-returns-with-treasury-department,"Enlarge this image Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testifies before the U.S. House of Representatives last month.

White House lawyers communicated with the Treasury Department about how to handle House Democrats' request for President Trump's tax returns even before they made it, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday.
Politics Key House Democrat Formally Asks For Trump's Tax Returns The law invoked last week by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., empowers Congress to obtain the returns of any taxpayer directly from the Internal Revenue Service. The process was designed to bypass the White House and give Congress equal authority.
Neal gave the IRS until this Wednesday to respond to the committee's request. Mnuchin told reporters after the hearing that the official response to Neal's letter could come within that time frame.
Under questioning by Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., at a House subcommittee hearing, Mnuchin said: ""I want to be very clear and not misleading. I acknowledge that there were conversations. I am not briefed on the full extent of those conversations.""
Quigley told Mnuchin ""we would greatly appreciate it"" if Treasury would report what White House officials had said.
IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, making a subsequent appearance before the same House subcommittee, said no one at the tax agency has had any communication with the White House about disclosing presidential tax returns to Congress.
Rettig did not indicate whether the IRS would comply with Neal's request by Wednesday.
During a later appearance before the House Financial Services Committee, Mnuchin said the Treasury Department would follow the law and cooperate with Congress. ""We would not ever ask for the White House's permission on this nor did they give us permission. As I said, we consulted, which I believe was appropriate of our legal department,"" Mnuchin said.
Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said the department's communications about Trump's tax returns were ""deeply troubling"" and violated ""the spirit of the law if not the letter.""
But Mnuchin insisted that he would protect the Treasury Department's independence on the tax return issue. ""I'm not afraid of being fired at all.""
President Trump has turned away all requests that he voluntarily disclose his taxes, as other recent presidents have done. Democrats contend he is withholding his returns to hide financial details that could lead to political or legal problems.
Politics Congress Really Can Demand, And Get, Trump's Tax Returns. Here's How Some Democrats, such as Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, have been working toward this request almost since the day Trump took the oath of office in 2017.
The Trump administration and its allies have launched several counterattacks.
One of Trump's personal lawyers, William Consovoy, has said that the House Ways and Means Committee ""cannot legally request"" the information.
GOP members of Congress have sought to give the administration cover by casting the request as politically motivated. ""It seems like we have a chairman and potentially a party that is attempting to weaponize the IRS for political gain,"" said Rep. Tom Graves, R-Ga.
Last Sunday, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney gave a political assessment, saying on Fox News the issue was ""already litigated"" during the 2016 election. ""Voters knew the president could have given his tax returns. They knew that he didn't and they elected him anyway, which is, of course, what drives the Democrats crazy.""
When asked whether Democrats would ever get access to the president's tax returns, Mulvaney said: ""Never. Nor should they.""
But George Yin, a tax law professor at the University of Virginia , said past case law should give the administration no leeway. ""The provision does not give any basis for the secretary of the Treasury to refuse the request,"" he said.
He said the provision now being invoked by Democrats appears to have been used in cases ranging from President Richard Nixon's tax returns in the 1970s to the alleged IRS targeting of conservative tax-exempt groups in the Obama administration. The evidence is circumstantial, according to Yin, since records and correspondence haven't leaked and are exempt from Freedom of Information Act requests.
The provision dates to 1924, when Congress was investigating scandals from the administration of President Warren G. Harding, who had died the year before. Among the scandals: Millionaire banker and investor Andrew Mellon had held on to investments when he became Treasury secretary and had allegedly used inside information to profit.
""The parallels between what happened that led to the creation of this law in 1924 and today's circumstances are really very close,"" Yin said.

Mark Lennihan/AP Updated at 3:29 p.m. ET
Bank of America will raise the minimum wage for its employees to $20 an hour in the next two years and freeze health care cost increases for lower-paid workers, the company said Tuesday .
The hourly pay will rise to $17 starting May 1 and then increase to the higher rate by 2021, CEO Brian Moynihan said.
""If you get a job at Bank of America, you'll make $41,000"" a year, he told MSNBC . ""With the success our company has ... we have to share that success with our teammates.""
Politics Bill Raising Federal Minimum Wage To $15 Heads To U.S. House Floor Sheri Bronstein, the company's chief human resources officer, said in a statement that the bank is raising its minimum wage ""because we believe that to best serve our customers and clients, we need the best teams.""
Bank of America said it last raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour two years ago. ""The average rate for all U.S. hourly employees is significantly above this level,"" it said.
This latest move comes at a time when employers of all sizes are having to compete harder to fill open positions.
Economy Amazon Sets $15 Minimum Wage For U.S. Employees, Including Temps ""Banks in particular, they're compelled to raise wages somewhat to recruit staff. So this is something they would be doing anyway, because there's a tighter labor market and that's what happens,"" says Ben Zipperer, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
Zipperer also notes that the announcement comes one day before Moynihan is to appear before the House Financial Services Committee , along with the heads of JPMorgan Chase, State Street, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon and Goldman Sachs.
""It's hard to avoid noticing the particular timing of this announcement,"" Zipperer says.
Business Minimum Wages Rising In 20 States And Several Cities The executives are expected to face tough questions from lawmakers about bank profits, regulatory issues, consumer protection and executive pay.
The heads of major banks typically make outsized salaries compared to their employees. Moynihan, for example, earned $23 million in 2017, or about 250 times as much as the median bank employee, according to a filing by Bank of America last year.
A group that has been working to unionize employees at banks welcomed the news of higher wages at Bank of America. ""It's a good thing to see Bank of America acknowledge that base wages — not metrics and incentives — are the surest way to improve the banking experience and the lives of its workers,"" said Nick Weiner, organizing coordinator at the Committee for Better Banks.
The higher minimum wage will affect ""tens of thousands"" of Bank of America employees, but not contract workers, the bank says. Like many big companies, Bank of America contracts out a wide range of jobs, from software development to janitorial services. The contractors are not required to increase those workers' pay, but the bank says it encourages the contractors to pay competitive wages.
The House is considering a bill to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour. The bill is backed by Amazon, which last year committed to paying all of its workers at least $15."

Keith Srakocic/AP Pittsburgh's mayor signed legislation Tuesday restricting the use of assault-style weapons in the city. The city council introduced a set of bills a few weeks after a gunman entered the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in October, killing 11 members and injuring seven.
But despite the mayor's signature, Pittsburgh's fight has just begun. Supporters of the legislation faced immediate resistance from gun rights advocates who say the city doesn't have the authority to issue such a ban. The National Rifle Association quickly filed a lawsuit on behalf of some Pittsburgh residents.
BREAKING: The @NRA helped #Pittsburgh residents file a lawsuit today challenging the city's new ban on commonly owned magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. #2A https://t.co/KIbUzEdWOs
— NRA (@NRA) April 9, 2019 Pittsburgh tried to regulate assault-style rifles over 20 years ago. But the courts have rejected those laws. State judges ruled that gun laws can be regulated only in the state's capital.
Mayor Bill Peduto has said it is time for the city to do something about the city's gun laws. ""If we didn't challenge laws, women wouldn't be able to vote,"" Peduto said after the signing.
City officials originally sought an outright ban on assault-style rifles and ammunition and accessories. But the resistance was almost immediate.
In January outside Pittsburgh's city hall, hundreds of protesters chanted, ""We will not comply."" Many were strapped with the weapons that would be banned by the law. The protesters say the gun laws aren't legal.
Gun rights activist Justin Dillon, who organized that rally, says laws like this are a political stunt. ""If a politician really cared about its people,"" he said, ""they would have done something before the synagogue shooting and not waited for a tragedy to happen.""
Elected officials agree only the state can regulate firearm possession. So in March they came up with a new strategy: banning the use, not the ownership, of the guns.
City Councilman Corey O'Connor introduced the bill and its amendments.
Law Bump Stock Ban Takes Effect As Gun Rights Groups Ask Supreme Court For Delay World New Zealand Introduces Gun Control Bill Expected To Become Law Within Weeks ""I think they're on the run and this is the first time that more and more, not just cities, but elected officials and communities are starting to fight back,"" he said.
But the new law offers a broad definition of use. It bans not just firing the gun, but even having it loaded in public. That means many of the protesters who opposed the law at the January rally would have been breaking it.
Dillon admits his gun was loaded. ""It's kind of pointless not to have a gun that's loaded,"" he said.
The NRA has filed a lawsuit sharing the same complaints as the protesters. A representative was unavailable for comment, but in a statement the group said, ""Pittsburgh residents have a right to carry the self-defense tools that best suit their needs.""
Peduto says that to have new gun laws, the city will have to go to court. ""The only way that a society progresses is by challenging what is accepted during their time,"" he said.
Not every local official supports the legislation. Three of the council's nine members voted against it. And in January, District Attorney Stephen Zappala told the city council it does not have the power to regulate guns. The city's law will go into effect in 60 days if a judge allows it to pass."

Ryan Kellman/NPR NPR reporting on the crisis in Venezuela over the last several months has raised an outsized number of complaints. Are listeners getting the fullest picture of the political turmoil and its contributing factors? Is NPR directly or indirectly, as some listeners believe, helping make the case for White House intervention in the political affairs of another country?
This office looked back at several months of the coverage of the international story. The reporting is ongoing: NPR's All Things Considered sent a team to the Venezuelan/Colombian border in March for a series of in-depth reports that continues to air this week . For some audience members, these reports only addressed one concern among many, and sparked some new ones.
A complicated history Venezuela's is a complex crisis to follow, involving internal constitutional maneuvering, years of financial mismanagement, and, layered on top, worldwide political jockeying tied to the country's vast oil reserves. In January, military-backed President Nicolás Maduro prepared for his second inauguration following an election victory overcast by allegations of fraud . Days before the swearing-in, Venezuelan National Assembly leader Juan Guaidó declared himself the country's president, invoking a special clause in the constitution . The U.S. was among the first countries to back Guaidó. Since then, many other countries have acknowledged Guaidó as the leader of Venezuela, including the Lima Group (11 other regional countries, plus Canada) and members of the European Union. (Maduro still has support from China and Russia.)
Venezuela's extraordinarily high inflation rate and troubled economy are not new: NPR has covered these stories for years . But, as the inflation rate continues to rise in the country with the most oil reserves in the world (more on that later), many readers insist that NPR is not doing enough to tell the complete story.
As one audience member wrote to the Public Editor's office, ""You offer little in the way of history, explaining the economic conditions that prevailed prior to the Bolivarian revolution that placed former military commander Hugo Chavez in office, and even less about the positive reforms the Chavez administration put in place.""
In effect, this listener (joined by many others) is criticizing specific aspects of NPR's coverage rather than its entirety. Since January, NPR has run more than 200 stories about the country online and in the morning and evening newsmagazines. An assessment of the body of NPR's Venezuela coverage shows many stories that put the current events into historical context. To cite just a couple: NPR's Carrie Kahn and Alex Leff reported that in the last century, the U.S. has participated in Latin American regime changes 40 times. And a recent episode of Planet Money's ""The Indicator"" used Venezuela's current hunger crisis to look at the last two decades of Venezuela's pivot to depending on an economy underpinned by oil — a move put in motion by Chavez.
But unlike text stories on the Web, radio reporter pieces and live interviews are bound by strict time limits, which sometimes leaves audience members frustrated at the lack of context included. Time is tight. A two-minute story can cover the day's news, but does not allow for an explanation of the contributing factors of the last 50 years. That's no different than when NPR covers any other complex ongoing story.
But there's a broader issue, too. NPR's Will Dobson, supervising senior editor on the international desk, said that along with time constraints on radio reporting, the challenge lies with a ""disagreed history."" While the facts surrounding Venezuela's historical events are straightforward, the interpretation of these events is not. For example, many listeners have complained about NPR's use of the phrase ""self-proclaimed president"" to refer to Guaidó, with some audience members criticizing the ""self-proclaimed"" portion and others questioning anything that seems like NPR's affirmation of Guaidó as ""president.""
""It's not [about] giving context,"" said Dobson of the criticism. ""It's reconciling world views.""
Hearing from policymakers One newsmagazine piece that drew feedback from audience members was NPR's interview of special envoy Elliott Abrams, President Trump's appointee to handle matters in Venezuela.
Prior to that interview, NPR covered a House committee hearing where lawmakers asked Abrams about his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair more than three decades ago. During February and March, NPR heard from Latin America experts who argued that U.S. military intervention would not lead to the regime change the Trump administration supports.
In the Abrams interview alone, the full picture might have been difficult to see. Abrams was asked about and laid out, sometimes vaguely, the administration's strategy in Venezuela. His controversial past was acknowledged as a point of contention at the end of the interview. Abrams offered one point of view — one that many listeners disagree with, vehemently — and the interview was conducted respectfully, which is NPR's style.
NPR interviews of political figures and government officials such as Abrams are necessary. They help listeners understand the whole picture and get officials on the record about their actions.
Reporting from the scene A broader theme running through the many audience concerns is the assumption that the Trump administration is preparing to invade Venezuela — and that NPR's reporting of the situation echoes the lack of critical media coverage prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
All Things Considered 's Ari Shapiro told me that this history was actually a central reason for the newsmagazine's reporting trip to Colombia's border with Venezuela.
The teams' stories, some of which ran a lengthy 11-plus minutes, have taken different vantage points: a pregnant woman seeking medical assistance across the Venezuelan border in Colombia; the young men ready to overthrow Maduro using violence; and the perilous journey of the caminantes — those walking hundreds of miles to flee Venezuela.
""It's the biggest refugee crisis outside of Syria,"" said Shapiro. ""And there are concerns that it could be the next U.S. military intervention.""
To prepare for the trip, the reporting team conducted dozens of background interviews, seeking input from professors, other journalists, government officials, people in Venezuela and more.
""For this, we wanted to hear the voices on the ground,"" said Shapiro. ""We wanted to bring listeners to a place and let them experience what it was like being in the city of Cúcuta, being on the road to Bogota with the walkers, the ' caminantes .' We wanted to bring a lot of rich voices and sounds.""
Some listeners said that by highlighting the humanitarian crisis, NPR was in effect adding support to the Trump administration's efforts to oust Maduro. But these kinds of eyewitness reports are crucial for the audience to fully understand the situation.
The full picture A final point of criticism levied against NPR is the range of voices represented. NPR audience member Nancy Slator of Western Massachusetts wrote: ""Day after day the programs interview anti-Maduro people, and I have never heard from the side that supports Maduro. The anti-Maduro people freely say the pro-Maduro people are corrupt, and the hosts just agree with them rather than reporting evidence on the question.""
While no listener can hear every report, opposition voices have outnumbered those of Maduro supporters in NPR's reporting. But NPR's Philip Reeves, who covers Latin America, has pulled in a few pro-Maduro voices, including a member of the civilian militia , a former banker and a retired member of Venezuela's National Guard . And NPR's Eyder Peralta has also included voices from inside the Venezuelan government and of Chavez supporters .
The reason for any imbalance is not, as some listeners argued, that NPR doesn't want to report what Maduro's supporters have to say.
""That's the most fascinating part of the story here,"" said Dobson. ""We want to plunge the depths of the pro-Maduro supporters."" But Dobson said NPR's responsibility to keep its journalists and sources safe is the top priority, and reporting safely from Venezuela is extremely difficult. Venezuela ranks 143 out of 180 countries in press freedom, with journalists risking violence at the hands of the state and some of its supporters. New York Times journalist Nicholas Casey spoke about the challenges last week on Fresh Air , and some local journalists have moved their base to Colombia to continue operating safely.
Context In approaching NPR's coverage of Venezuela, it's important to acknowledge that there are many storylines and facts that are not mutually exclusive: Maduro's repression of the opposition, the Venezuelan economy in free fall, a long history of U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs, oil sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its subsequent backing of opposition leader Guaidó — all of this exists simultaneously.
So, reporting on allegations of crimes against humanity in Venezuela has not stopped NPR from simultaneously reporting on the moves of the U.S. government. The U.S. is Venezuela's biggest oil customer. Under the Obama and Trump administrations, the U.S. placed sanctions on Venezuelan oil, adding to Venezuela's declining economy. In January, U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions that virtually stopped imports from the Latin American country completely.
The question becomes whether reporting through interviews to hear from those directly involved is conducive to communicating every fact that the audience needs to know in the time available for radio reports. What level of knowledge should NPR expect a typical audience member to have about the situation? How can reporting of current news also take account of decades of historical context surrounding U.S. intervention in Latin America?
The answer to the last question is: It depends.
Back to chief international desk editor Will Dobson: ""Sometimes the history can be included in pieces of greater length, and sometimes that isn't possible.""
I think NPR's body of coverage for Venezuela is composed of quality work. The reporting from Caracas and the Venezuelan-Colombian border has been strong and added to the audience's understanding of a complex story. NPR's breaking news on in-country events has not always been expeditious. For example, the npr.org story on the first massive power outage in Venezuela came some 18 hours after the reported incident. But the next day's reporting offered an in-depth look at events that went beyond a breaking-news banner with a few thin paragraphs.
A large portion of the concerns audience members have expressed to this office are calls for NPR to adhere to the basic tenets of journalism: completeness, fairness and independence, which are all described in NPR's Ethics Handbook . And when reporting on a country where the press is openly threatened, the need for this high-quality journalism is even greater. But to produce it, journalists have to be safe, and media organizations have to be responsible.
Reviewing NPR's coverage of Venezuela, it's clear to me that neither the U.S. nor the Venezuelan government represents the dichotomy of ""good"" and ""bad."" The history is messy and the current events are getting messier. While it may be easier for some to see those two parties as representing such a dichotomy, it doesn't do justice to the realities at play and to the Venezuelans whose lives are affected by the crisis in that troubled country."

Amazon Independent Booksellers Normal People , Sally Rooney's second novel, opens in 2011 in a small town in the west of Ireland, where two teenagers, improbably, hook up.
Marianne is a social pariah: She's really smart, lightly contemptuous and weird — a judgment bestowed on her by the cultural gatekeepers at her high school because ""she wears ugly thick-soled flat shoes and doesn't put make-up on her face.""
Connell, a football player, is also very smart, but he knows enough to turn the dimmer switch down on his intelligence, so he's popular. His mom cleans the large house that Marianne's family lives in.
Connell often picks his mom up at the end of her stint and Marianne is often sitting in the kitchen, reading The Fire Next Time or something equally challenging. They talk, they fall into bed together, they break up.
This ""wash-and-repeat"" romantic cycle continues far into their university years at Trinity College, Dublin. Eventually, Marianne confides in Connell that she was in a relationship with a man who beat her during sex. ""It was my idea, that I wanted to submit to him,"" she tells Connell. ""It's difficult to explain.""
It's an understatement to say that, as a chronicler of youthful Irish life and love, Sally Rooney is no Maeve Binchy. In fact, Rooney is a tough girl; her papercut-sharp sensibility is much more akin to writers like Rachel Kushner , Mary Gaitskill , and the pre- Manhattan Beach Jennifer Egan . Normal People moves forward in rough fragments: Instead of chapters, increments of this story are dated and given headings that read ""four months later;"" ""seven months later.""
The great poignancy of reading Normal People derives from being totally swept along by the force of Marianne's and Connell's psychological insights into each other or events and then witnessing how the solid certainty of those insights dissolves four months later or seven months later.
For instance, at the end of high school, when an anxious Connell, in a moment of cowardice, asks another girl to the formal dance (even though he and Marianne have been secretly sleeping together for a long time) we're treated to this self-lacerating assessment by Marianne:
[Connell] didn't do anything that bad. He had never tried to delude her into thinking she was socially acceptable; she'd deluded herself. He had just been using her as a kind of private experiment, and her willingness to be used had probably shocked him. ... In a way she feels sorry for him now, because he has to live with the fact that he had sex with her, of his own free choice, and he liked it. That says more about him, the supposedly ordinary and healthy person, than it does about her.
Rooney nails the bitter smarts of a certain kind of willfully odd teenage girl; but then, three months later, the joke is on Connell when Marianne's eccentricities render her chic and sought-after at university, while his working-class earnestness is socially toxic.
Class is one of Rooney's chief concerns here, especially as Connell, who's something of a budding writer, penetrates deeper and deeper into the smug undergraduate literary culture. Here's his wry take on a reading by a visiting celebrated writer:
Connell couldn't think of any reason why these literary events took place, what they contributed to anything, what they meant. They were attended only by people who wanted to be the kind of people who attended them. ...
[The reading itself] was culture as class performance, literature fetishized for its ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that they might afterward feel superior to the uneducated people whose emotional journeys they liked to read about.
Whoa. For those of us who've attended (or perpetrated) more than our fair share of these types of literary events, Connell's pronouncements constitute a miniature instant classic of academic farce writing. He's so intense in his disdain; but, then, he's so intense in his desire. By the end of the novel, he's seriously deciding whether or not to enter an elite MFA program.
Normal People is a nuanced and flinty love story about two young people who ""get"" each other, despite class differences and the interference of their own vigorous personal demons. But honestly, Sally Rooney could write a novel about bath mats and I'd still read it. She's that good and that singular a writer.

Amazon Independent Booksellers TERRY GROSS, HOST:
This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Congress in the Trump era is the subject of the new book by my guests Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. It's called ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America."" Sherman and Palmer are senior writers for Politico and co-write the twice-a-day newsletter Politico Playbook.
Their new book covers Capitol Hill, when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress as well as the White House, and describes how the power dynamic changed after Democrats took control of the House last year and Nancy Pelosi reclaimed her position as speaker. One thing that Democrats and Republicans in Congress have in common during this divisive period is that they're both dealing with a president who is unpredictable and doesn't follow protocol when it comes to dealing with Congress.
Jake Sherman, Anna Palmer, welcome to FRESH AIR. So we're supposed to be a government of checks and balances. The Congress voted against giving President Trump the money he requested for the wall, so the president declared a national emergency to build the wall and plans on getting the money from other parts of the budget. And Republicans who voted against funding for Trump's wall seem to be willingly ceding their power to the president - ceding their power as being, like, a check against the president. Tell us why you think that's happening.
JAKE SHERMAN: I think it's kind of the most recent example of a long string of Congress giving its power away to the presidency, to be honest with you. We've seen this in various fashions over the last 10 years. Congress has given away some of its power of spending and things of that nature. But this truly is new.
And the fear from the people that we talk to every day on Capitol Hill is that the next president will come in and say something else is an emergency. And if they can't get it from Congress, they'll also declare an emergency and try to get money from other places in the budget. So I think, more than anything, this specifically is a very dangerous precedent to set.
GROSS: Do you think that Republicans in Congress are afraid of President Trump and afraid to stand up to him?
ANNA PALMER: I don't think they're afraid. But I do think there is a concern about going up against the president on key issues like immigration and the border, for example, and what that impact might have on their re-election. One of the things that, you know, you find when you're talking to these members every single day is how obsessed they are with their next election and their popularity. And the president is very popular with the Republican base. And he has shown no compunction to do anything but go after Republicans who aren't in line with what he thinks.
GROSS: So Republicans have traditionally been against massive federal spending and against deficits. But right now, I mean, the tax bill that Republicans passed has greatly added to the deficit. Spending for the wall that the president wants - I mean, that's a hugely expensive bill. And it's another issue where Republicans don't seem to be standing up to Trump on that. Have Republicans changed in their attitude toward spending as the party has gotten further to the right? Have the priorities shifted?
PALMER: Yeah. I mean, I think it's actually pretty stunning. When Jake and I have been covering Capitol Hill Republicans in power for years, the orthodoxy was, spend less, cut spending. And Donald Trump came in and really doesn't care about any of that. And so one of the kind of interesting things that we discuss in the book - and talking to members who were his key allies, whether that's Mark Meadows of North Carolina or Jim Jordan of Ohio - that kind of cutting spending and government waste is - was how they came into office.
They, you know, are willing to let the president spend and do what he wants to on those things. But then there are issues such as immigration or the border wall where they really want to make sure and try to pressure the president to hold fast to where they are on those issues.
GROSS: It seems so paradoxical that for the first couple of years of the Trump presidency, Paul Ryan was the speaker of the House. And he was, like, the deficit hawk. I mean, that was - there were so many programs he wanted to cut. That was his thing.
SHERMAN: It was. And this is something that history will have to reckon with in a way that we are not able to at this moment or we're only beginning to be able to at this moment. But Paul Ryan's orthodoxy - his entire intellectual makeup and his entire partisan makeup - has completely shifted. As you noted, he was a spending hawk, a deficit hawk, who spent the first 15 or 20 years of his congressional career railing against the - a bloated bureaucracy and a bloated federal government.
And he - Donald Trump - got into office. And in a sense, Paul Ryan, I believe, felt like he had lost the argument - that he presented one view of America, which he believed for - between 1999 and 2016. He was on the presidential ticket in 2012. And then Donald Trump got elected, presenting another, completely different view of the Republican Party in America. And Donald Trump won the presidency.
So I think Paul Ryan felt, at that moment, that he had a decision to make. Either he would have to retire, leave Congress, when Donald Trump got elected, or stick around and try - in his words and his thinking - to keep the government on the rails, to keep things from going too crazy. And that was his thinking as he got into Donald Trump's presidency.
Now, a lot of people will say, Republicans only cared about deficit spending when Barack Obama was in office. And Donald Trump got in there, and they didn't care anymore. And there's some truth to that. And there's some truth to Ryan completely changing his tune on all of these things. And that's something we get into a lot.
GROSS: Well, you write about how one of the reasons why Ryan wanted to stay in the House - 'cause he was conflicted about staying or going. He wanted to set an example that there could be, like - I think he used the word a normal person in Congress in the party.
PALMER: I think Paul Ryan, and I certainly think Mitch McConnell, who leads the Senate Republicans, feel like they are kind of the guardrails of this presidency in terms of making sure that things don't go totally haywire. And so I think Paul Ryan - this - Donald Trump offends him in so many ways in what he personally believes, how the president tweets, how he, you know, is crass in some ways. That is not the kind of person that Paul Ryan believes he is himself or how he comports himself to be. But I think he felt a real responsibility to try and make sure that things didn't go completely off the rails.
GROSS: But then he decided to leave.
SHERMAN: He did. And in his telling publicly, it was because he has a young family. His father and grandfather both died young. And he's getting to the age where they passed away. And he had a sense of time in the sense that he thought, in his head, that he was lucky. He was living on borrowed time, in a sense. And he wasn't sure how much time he would have left, although he's a very physically fit guy and shows no sign of slowing down.
But I mean, you do get the sense - and we all got the sense from covering this every day for the last two years - that Paul Ryan did get sick of Donald Trump. And there were several episodes throughout the last two years where Paul Ryan got in massive, blow-up arguments behind the scenes with the president over immigration law, over spending, over just his behavior.
There's an episode where he says - he - the president said he wanted to do away with the 14th Amendment, which allows birthright citizenship. And Paul Ryan went on the radio and said, he can't do that. And then the president called him, screaming. And that's kind of a good encapsulation of their relationship. And President Trump, by the way, who we interviewed, said he - basically said he didn't really care that much for Ryan in the end. He said, he really abandoned me a few times.
PALMER: Foxhole Paul.
SHERMAN: He called him Foxhole Paul, which is his way of saying he wasn't in the foxhole with the president. Paul Ryan wasn't in the foxhole with the president. So it was a complicated relationship between two men who really did not care for each other but felt like they had to work with each other to keep the government open and to keep some things on the rails. Although, many would argue that things did go off the rails on many occasions.
GROSS: Now, I want to ask you about Lindsey Graham. He heads the Senate Judiciary Committee. And after the House voted unanimously to release the full Mueller report, Lindsey Graham decided not to even bring that up to the Judiciary Committee. And Graham's been demanding that the Democrats also vote on appointing a special counsel to look into alleged Department of Justice misconduct on the investigations into President Trump and into Hillary Clinton.
Lindsey Graham used to be so close to John McCain - to Senator McCain. And President Trump seems to have missed no opportunity to insult John McCain. He insulted him during the campaign. He insulted him when he came to office. He insulted John McCain after John McCain died. And Lindsey Graham has become very close and very politically aligned to President Trump. Do you have any insights into what happened to Lindsey Graham between the time when he was, you know, the closest of allies with John McCain and now, when he's so close to the person who has maligned John McCain?
PALMER: I think it's important to note that Senator Graham most recently did speak back home and said that what the president was - his most recent criticism of John McCain was not appropriate. And he really did push back on that. But I do think what you have to realize is, yes, John McCain and Lindsey Graham were close, personal friends. Lindsey Graham also tried to do a massive immigration deal. He has - he's up for re-election. And as I said earlier, what you really realize when you're on Capitol Hill every day is that when members are up for re-election, they are constantly looking at the numbers there. And it's a political calculus.
I think he has decided that, you know, they - he doesn't believe that the Mueller report needs to be released. He wants to go - he has aligned himself with the president in a lot of ways. He's personally golfed with him many times. Being close to the president is politically advantageous to Lindsey Graham at this point.
SHERMAN: I would say one more thing on top of that. I think that writing this book has made - has sharpened this point in my mind - that politicians really exist in a political moment, meaning they act the way they do because of the political dynamics at one moment. And number two, politicians are there to gain power, keep power and increase power. And however they might do that, they'll do it.
And in this situation, Lindsey Graham basically said back home - Anna alluded to this - what the president said about John McCain wasn't right. But the voters of South Carolina put me in office to get things done and to work with this president, and I'm going to do that - basically saying, I understand that he's critical of my very close - former very close friend John McCain. I don't appreciate that. But I also have something else I need to do, which is to work with Donald Trump to achieve the policies I'm looking to achieve. And he's pretty brash about that. And he's pretty honest about it, even though, to everybody else - and many people we talked to - they find it to be intellectually dishonest. But that's the way he views it.
GROSS: What are Republicans looking to right now to see if the winds are shifting against Trump? - because if they're aligning with Trump because they think it's going to help them with re-election, then they need Trump's support. But if Trump is losing support, then it would hurt them to be aligned with Trump when the next election comes around. So how are they testing the winds on that? - because it's always - it always seems to be questionable if there's going to be a point at which the wind shifts.
SHERMAN: You saw this recently. The president said he wanted to do health care reform. And Republicans said, no, thanks. We lost the House of Representatives because we got into a prolonged fight over health care reform, a policy that Republicans do not have their arms around in a real, big way. And I think you saw them back off on that. And you see them back off on several other fronts, too. I think they're trying to put distance between themselves and the president where it's useful.
But, especially in the House of Representatives, many Republicans now hold seats that are overwhelmingly supportive of Donald Trump. The Republican Party on Capitol Hill now is Trump's party. And their fortunes - some - many members tell us, when they go home, they couldn't be close enough to the president. That's the political dynamic at this point. That's what the political map looks like at this point. They couldn't be close enough and tied closely enough to this president. And his - their fortunes are tied together. But in many of their districts, the president's still incredibly popular.
GROSS: Let's take a short break here, and then we'll talk some more about what's happening in Congress now.
If you're just joining us, my guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. They co-write Politico's Playbook, and now they have a new book-book - (laughter) - which is called ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America."" We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF LOUIS SCLAVIS' ""FETE FORAINE"")
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guests are Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman. And they co-write Politico's Playbook. And they also have a new book that they've co-written called ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America.""
Let's look at some divisions within the Democratic Party now between the mainstream of the party and the newer, more left members in the House, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And so there's questions now about whether to push for Medicare for All or make incremental changes in Obamacare, whether to go for the Green New Deal or more incremental environmental change. Give us a sense of the dynamic now in the House among Democrats, between the more left-leaning, new members - who are also largely, you know, younger - and the more veteran members, those who are more mainstream.
SHERMAN: Yeah. The center of gravity in the House of Representatives among Democrats is Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker. And that's the - kind of an eternal truism about Democratic politics. Nancy Pelosi has been the leader of House Democrats now for a very long time and is probably as powerful as ever. And if you ask Nancy Pelosi about the Green New Deal or Medicare for All or any of these positions that some of the younger members are advocating for, she kind of deals with them in her own way by saying, I'm as progressive as they come, but I'm also about getting an outcome. I'm about solutions that can pass the House of Representatives and have a chance of, some point, getting into law. And she's spoken very dismissively about the Green New Deal and about Medicare For All and says we actually have a good health care system, called Obamacare, and we should improve and strengthen that. And she talks about the Green New Deal as the green new dream. She knows the name, obviously, and she knows what's in it. But she's dismissive of it, in a sense, and says she has her own solutions that she's been working on for many years.
And I think there's some of the older guard. The Democrats that have been in the House of Representatives for a decade or more feel like they've been working on these issues for a very long time, and in come a new crop of freshmen and they're taking all the credit for it. And I think there's some tension there. But there's no question that the younger Democrats, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and some of her allies in the House of Representatives, have brought an energy to the House that we really haven't seen in a long time, especially on the left. I mean, we saw a little bit in 2010 with Republicans, but - definitely have brought a new energy and a new vigor to a House Democratic Caucus that was increasingly old.
GROSS: How are divisions among Democrats effecting the tactics that they're using to move forward with opposition to the president? Are they divided on those tactics?
SHERMAN: Minorly, but not really in a major way. I'd say the one thing Democrats are completely on the same page on is going after President Trump with all the weapons and all the tools they have. Now, there is a small clutch of Democrats at the moment who believe that the party should immediately move to impeach the president. That's still a very small minority in the House of Representatives among Democrats. But I think that they have largely stuck together when it comes to demanding the president's tax returns, issuing subpoenas for bank records going back several decades from the president's businesses, things of that nature. I don't think you see much divide there, and I don't think you will, going forward.
But in a way, Democrats are helped by President Trump in that there's not much that could get the president's signature. They're not going to pass many bills into law. So they only really have to stick together on these big investigatory committees, on these big oversight issues, which is not difficult with a president who probably polls in the low teens, if that, with the Democratic base.
GROSS: President Trump - you write that President Trump wanted Nancy Pelosi to be speaker after the Democrats won the House and that his plan was to ask the Freedom Caucus - the most conservative members of Congress, who are also his allies - to vote for her. And Trump told you that he thought the most conservative members of Congress would do him a favor and vote for Nancy Pelosi as House speaker. Tell us more about that. That's an interesting and surprising story.
SHERMAN: I do think that there is some dynamic between Pelosi and Trump that's hard to capture and hard to explain. It seems like, from our experience both talking to the president and watching him publicly, he does seem almost taken by Pelosi, taken by her power, taken by her ability to corral Democrats together to keep them on the same page. And he lamented to us in the book that Democrats stick together much better than Republicans do, and that's something that he was very upset about and very regretful that Republicans couldn't stick together. He doesn't appreciate Democrats' policies, he says, but he appreciates their unity, which was an interesting insight into the president's head.
But also, furthermore, I do think that the president likes cutting deals with Democrats periodically. I think he likes the Hollywood flair, in his mind, and the ratings - again, in his telling - of doing business with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer - by the way, two people that he's known for a very long time. So it's a very interesting relationship, and I think we'll see more in the months ahead between the Democratic speaker, who, by the way, President Trump was a donor to and was very, very, very praising of when he was a developer in New York.
GROSS: Wait - to Schumer, not to Pelosi, right?
SHERMAN: To both of them.
GROSS: To both of them.
SHERMAN: Yes, he wrote the - he wrote Pelosi a note when she became speaker in 2006 saying how great she was and how much he respected her. Again, I'm paraphrasing the president's words, but he sent her a note very praising of her abilities when she became speaker in 2006, 2007.
GROSS: My guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer, senior writers for Politico who co-write the newsletter Politico Playbook. Their new book is called ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America."" We'll talk more after a break. And Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel by Sally Rooney that was named the Irish novel of the year. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF ALLISON MILLER'S BOOM TIC BOOM'S ""WELCOME HOTEL"")
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to my interview about Congress in the Trump era. My guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. They're senior writers for Politico and co-write the twice-a-day newsletter Politico Playbook. Their new book is titled ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America.""
Let's talk about the role of the Freedom Caucus. You write about the Freedom Caucus a lot in your book. And I should say the Freedom Caucus is basically a far-right Republican caucus within the House. And their role has obviously changed from when the House was run by Republicans to now, when it's run by Democrats. But tell us how they were first created.
SHERMAN: The Freedom Caucus came to be during John Boehner's speakership, and it was started by Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows - Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mark Meadows of North Carolina. And they wanted a small group of people who would be able to stand up against their own party when they thought their party went astray. And I visited Jim Jordan at his home in Ohio in reporting this book and talked to him about this. And he compares it to a union because in the House of Representatives, you don't have power as a single member of Congress. You have power if you band together and starve the speaker of the House of the ability to move legislation. And they were able to do that on almost every issue - tax reform, health care reform, spending, immigration. They were able to hold the party's feet to the fire, hold Donald Trump's feet to the fire and drag every piece of legislation to the right.
And they found a kindred spirit, in a sense, in Donald Trump, who was elected, obviously, in 2016. They had been planning to try to oust Paul Ryan if Hillary Clinton was elected president. Instead, they found themselves with a ideological ally in the White House or someone they thought could be an ideological ally. And they have - and it's no overstatement to say they have really shaped the Republican Party in that image and shaped, in a small way, America the - some policies that got enacted into law in Donald Trump's presidency in their image over the last couple years.
GROSS: What are the tactics that they used during Republican control of the House to block legislation they didn't like and to move legislation further to the right?
PALMER: Yeah, I mean, they oftentimes - a lot of it's behind the scenes - right? - so it's not just going to the House floor. But it would be starving John Boehner first and then Paul Ryan of the necessary votes to get bills passed. They would - you know, in the book, we detail how both Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan went to the floor and, you know, kind of would give speeches that then would get played on Fox News that then the president would see. And so you see their impact kind of all along the way.
And I would also say they also had - they - particularly Mark Meadows has a very good relationship with the president. And he was brought in on tax reform kind of surprisingly after he and Jim Jordan wrote a letter saying these were the kind of, you know, four or five things that needed to be in tax reform for their support. And not only did the president read it, but then the president wanted to make sure that he kept those guys happy.
SHERMAN: One other tactic is they took unrelated bills hostage. They were looking for certain policies on immigration reform, so instead, they starved Republicans of the votes they needed to pass an agricultural policy bill. So they would take completely unrelated issues hostage to get what they want on issues that Donald Trump cared about, like immigration reform, immigration overhaul, restrictive immigration policies.
So they were really bending the legislative process to their will and angering a lot of people, but they saw Paul Ryan and the House Republican leadership as not representative of what Donald Trump got elected to do. They thought Donald Trump got elected on a very simple platform, which was building a wall on the border with Mexico and very restrictive immigration policies. And it was - in their view, they needed to do everything they could do to help the president achieve those ends, which, at times, included blocking unrelated pieces of legislation to make a point and to achieve an end.
GROSS: Did the Freedom Caucus have just enough people to block legislation?
SHERMAN: Yes, they had a little bit more than the margin that Republicans had over Democrats, which allowed them - basically gave them veto power over anything that Paul Ryan wanted to do. So if they stuck together, they were the most powerful 20 people in America or 30 people, depending on who their allies were on that specific issue, which is amazing. We had never seen power exercised like this in the modern House of Representatives.
PALMER: I don't think you can underscore how frustrating it was to Republican leadership that this kind of band of ragtag Republicans that typically would never have been taken seriously would've, you know, given rousing speeches on the House floor, but would never have been able to control the agenda how big of an impact that made.
GROSS: Now, you write Jim Jordan of the Freedom Caucus craves confrontation. Give us an example of a confrontation that he initiated.
SHERMAN: Well, he was the mastermind behind the December government shutdown, which we know now was the longest government shutdown in American history - lasted more than a month and impacted Americans who work for the federal government to a degree that we're only beginning to realize. He went to the White House and pushed Donald Trump to shut down the government if he did not get money for his border wall. He thought - in his mind, Jim Jordan - some of his allies thought - in crises - in big legislative crises like a government shutdown, people's incentive structures in people's minds would be scrambled, in a sense, and they would make decisions that were irrational, which is an interesting way to think about governing. He thought if you put people against a wall, they might abandon their ideology.
He thought Nancy Pelosi - there was no way Nancy Pelosi could stand up for not having a wall on the border with Mexico. And he put that theory to a test and pushed Donald Trump into a government shutdown. So those were the kinds of things he did to try to achieve ends for Donald Trump. And I think the president realizes now that those tactics are not necessarily successful, not necessarily good strategy, but that's what Jim Jordan tried to do. He put the government in crisis and believed that he would be able to achieve an end out of that.
GROSS: Let's talk about Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. And you write, you know, with Congress often in gridlock, the judiciary has become more important. And McConnell's goal is to reshape the federal judiciary. How long has that been his goal?
PALMER: Really, when you look at the Republicans and conservatives writ large across the country, the judiciary and the importance of the judiciary has been something that they have been talking about for years. It's something that wins elections for them. It's something that really energizes their base - you know, getting the Supreme Court to be more conservative. And what you've seen this Congress and even before is that Mitch McConnell - his single focus, more than anything else, has been to try to push through more judges that are conservative and - particularly in the Trump administration, they are younger. They are conservative. They are going to be on the bench for a very long time.
GROSS: So he has changed some of the rules in order to push through very conservative judges. So what are some of the rules he's changed?
SHERMAN: Well, I think it's most important to note the kind of unwritten rule that he changed back in Obama's years. President Barack Obama nominated Merrick Garland to be a Supreme Court justice when Scalia passed away. And Mitch McConnell, at that moment - that day, he was on vacation with his wife in the islands. And the moment Scalia, who he knew very well - the moment he died, McConnell took a pen out and wrote a statement, sent it to his office, saying, Merrick Garland will not be given a hearing. The next president will choose the next Supreme Court justice - which, by the way, was a massive gamble for McConnell because Hillary Clinton was ahead in the polls. Donald Trump, who McConnell likes to remind people was donating money to Chuck Schumer just a few years ago - Republicans weren't confident about how Donald Trump would view the judiciary, so it was a huge gamble. But McConnell - that was McConnell's goal, to not get Merrick Garland a hearing and not give him a vote on the floor. And he achieved that. And from that, he got Neil Gorsuch. And later, he got Kavanaugh. But that's right. I mean, McConnell has fast-tracked the procedures to get nominees to the floor and has done so with stunning success and has gotten dozens of judges on to federal courts across the country. And Congresses come and go, and people don't always remember that. The House flips all the time. The Senate flips all the time. Judges have lifetime appointments, and that's incredibly important to remember when thinking about Mitch McConnell and his long-term goals.
GROSS: One of the things that McConnell recently did was to cut the debate time from 30 hours to two hours for judicial and administrative nominees. What's the significance of that?
SHERMAN: The Senate has very arcane rules, to say the least. And it just basically, in layman's terms, allows him to move judges - more judges in a short period of time. Remember; the Senate is home probably one out of every four weeks. So instead of taking several days to move judges, he can move several judges in one day. And that's incredibly, incredibly important because the Judiciary Committee in the Senate can move judges out of their committee quite quickly. But there was this threshold that forced a slowdown in that process, and McConnell has completely removed that stumbling block. And McConnell's critics will say, well, this might not benefit you when you're in the minority. But McConnell's retort is that Democrats are blocking, and they're forcing Republicans to use up all of those 30 hours. And that's preventing the president from getting the judges he wants. And that's, obviously, a very big priority of the president, which McConnell is helping him out with.
GROSS: Do you think McConnell is also thinking, by the time the Democrats have a majority, there will be so many conservative judges who have been appointed, it won't matter that much?
PALMER: Sure. I mean, I think he's making a gamble to say, I'm going to stack the judiciary as far as he can according to Democrats' perspective. And, you know, he's going to continue that mission. When we sat down with him - I think a lot of people wonder what motivates Mitch McConnell because he's a man of few words. He doesn't get fiery. He rarely, you know, kind of does long speeches or different things like that. He's been in politics for a long time. But the one thing that is clear is he sees his legacy as the federal judiciary.
GROSS: Let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. They wrote the new book ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America."" They cover Congress for Politico where they write The Playbook, which is a twice-a-day newsletter about what's going on on the Hill. We'll be right back after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR.
(SOUNDBITE OF CUONG VU & PAT METHENY'S ""SEEDS OF DOUBT"")
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guests are Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer, who cover Congress for Politico. They write the daily newsletter the Playbook. And they also have a new book they've co-authored called ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America.""
How have you seen Congress change in the years that you've been covering it? And that's since 2009 and 2011 to the year or...
SHERMAN: Yeah, that's right.
PALMER: You know, I mean, I've covered Congress...
SHERMAN: Yeah.
PALMER: ...Since 2004.
SHERMAN: OK, sorry.
GROSS: Oh, OK.
PALMER: I'm older. But we've been at Politico since 2009 and 2011.
SHERMAN: We've been covering it together since 2009.
PALMER: Yes. Yes, sorry.
GROSS: OK. OK. So what are some of the ways you've seen Congress change in that time?
PALMER: I definitely think that it has only become more partisan. I think that the way elections start - the day after a member is elected, they're raising money. They're trying to go back to their districts. There's not a lot of community and bipartisanship in a sense of Republicans and Democrats getting to know each other as humans, as people. And I think that's to the detriment of, you know, the institution in the sense that you don't give your colleague on the other side of the aisle the benefit of the doubt that they're coming from a good place. I do think the amount of money in politics has also increased tremendously in my time covering Washington. And the amount of dark money and 527's after Citizens United has had a huge impact on the overall tenor of things as well.
SHERMAN: And I think Anna's right on the money front. I mean, individual House races - races that are conducted with electorates of five-, 600,000 people are costing tens of millions of dollars, which is just astronomical. People were raising several hundred thousand dollars in the past. Now they have to raise three-, $4 million for competitive races. And I think everything has become politicized. I mean, starting in 2009, Republicans made a calculated choice to - in the worst financial crisis in a very long time - to allow President Obama to pass legislation on his own without their help. It was a political decision, but it really set the tone for the last decade of legislating. And I'm not sure Republicans realized that at the time, but their decision to really oppose Barack Obama at every turn set the tone for just a really partisan phase in our politics.
GROSS: Now that the Democrats control the House, it seems the people who really watch right now include the heads of some of the committees, like the House Intelligence Committee, Ways and Means, judiciary - the committees that are really investigating President Trump and continuing to investigate Russian interference in the election. So how are you covering them? You know, like Adam Schiff, Jerrold Nadler - they hold a lot of power now, and what they're trying to do could prove to be very significant.
PALMER: I think we cover them like we always have. I think one of the great things about being a reporter on Capitol Hill that is unlike any other institution is the amount of access that you have to these members. You can follow them in the hallways. You can wait for them after votes. They regularly talk to - both Republicans and Democrats talk to reporters. And so I think that now that they're in power, we cover them because they get to make some of the key decisions about whether these investigations happen and how they happen.
SHERMAN: And also they're sending letters every day. I mean, they're really pressuring the administration. But we also - it's important to keep in mind that everything flows through Nancy Pelosi. She sets the tenor and tone of all these investigations, and it's important to listen to every one of her utterances on every topic to really know what the Democrats are going to do when it comes to investigations.
And I will say, within the Democratic Party, there is some nervousness about looking overzealous. I think that's something that we'll begin to see in the next couple months is Democrats wanting to make sure they proceed with caution because while holding Trump accountable is very important both substantively and in the polls - it polls very well - there is concern of overreach and going too far too quickly too much. There's a lot of committees looking into the president, and it's the Democratic leadership's job to keep it streamlined, to keep everybody in line.
GROSS: I want you to tell a couple of stories about Jared Kushner that you learned that show the ability he thinks he has to fix things and to, like, change how Congress operates for the better.
SHERMAN: During the shutdown, during the immigration fight in late 2018, Jared Kushner was not really involved in the immigration policy and not really involved in anything that was going on. And the - as the government was about to shut down, moments from shutting down, Jared Kushner blew into a meeting with with Paul Ryan, Steve Scalise and Kevin McCarthy and said, I wasn't involved earlier, but now I am, and I can fix this quite quickly.
So Jared tended to think, according to people that we spoke to for the three-year period, 2 1/2-year period that we were writing this book, that he had a unique ability to, again, bend the government to his will and to do things that otherwise people thought were impossible. And he came up short a number of times. He did have one big success in the Trump administration, which was he passed - he helped pass a criminal justice reform bill. But that's about it. That's really the only episode where he had been successful in getting Congress to do what he wanted.
GROSS: Like a lot of other reporters, you reported that President Trump, you know, watches a lot of TV. And if he likes you on TV, he'll make an alliance with you or maybe give you an appointment (laughter). And so I'm wondering. He sees you on TV probably 'cause you - you're on TV a lot. And has that affected your access to him?
SHERMAN: I don't think so. I mean, he's acknowledged passively that he has seen us on TV earlier before we started writing this book. So I don't think it's impacted our access to him, but it certainly has impacted other people's access to him and frankly has impacted who he's put in key government positions and who he's given jobs to and who he likes defending him.
And I mean, we write in the book that members of Congress have literally rearranged their schedules so they can appear more frequently on television, which is really one of the chief ways that Washington has changed - is that daytime television is really prime real estate for policymakers and journalists and people who are trying to speak to the president or who want the president to hear them. I mean, dayside cable, which was at one point kind of an afterthought in the media climate, is now really prime territory for a lot of people.
GROSS: All right. I want to thank you both for talking with us.
SHERMAN: Thank you very much.
PALMER: Thank you.
GROSS: Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer are the authors of the new book ""The Hill To Die On: The Battle For Congress And The Future Of Trump's America."" They co-write the daily newsletter Politico Playbook.
After a break, Maureen Corrigan will review a new novel by Sally Rooney, who's been called the first great millennial author. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.

Evan Vucci/AP President Trump repeated a false claim to reporters Tuesday, wrongly blaming the Obama administration for instituting a policy in which children were separated from their parents at the Southern border.
""I'm the one that stopped it,"" Trump said. ""President Obama had child separation.""
Trump made the comments during a photo op prior to his meeting with Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.
Asked whether the administration was considering reinstating the policy of child separation to curb the number of migrant families crossing the border from Mexico, Trump responded that ""We're not looking to do it.""
But he seemed to imply it was an effective means of stemming border crossings, and he compared families attempting to cross into the U.S. to visitors to an amusement park. ""I'll tell you something, once you don't have it that's why you have many more people coming. They are coming like it's a picnic, like, 'Let's go to Disneyland.' President Obama separated children. They had child separation; I was the one that changed it,"" Trump said.
Politics An Acting Government For The Trump Administration Trump also denied that he is ""cleaning house"" at the Department of Homeland Security, in light of the departure of DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Secret Service Director Randolph ""Tex"" Alles this week. ""I never said I'm cleaning house,"" Trump said.

Still, as NPR's Domenico Montanaro wrote last year, the Trump administration has been unwilling to take the blame for the policy of family separations because of the political optics.

RJ Sangosti/MediaNews Group/Denver Post via Getty Images A weather whiplash is predicted to hit people in the Rockies and Plains this week, as conditions go from balmy to blizzard overnight. The high is predicted to be around 80 degrees in Denver and other cities Tuesday — but within 24 hours, blizzard conditions are forecast, the National Weather Service says.
""Warm today. Snow tomorrow,"" says the NWS office in Denver and Boulder, Colo. , predicting temperatures that could hit record highs Tuesday — followed by rain turning to snow, in a blast of cold air that will ride winds of 40-60 mph on Wednesday.
For many central U.S. residents, the week began with warnings of a possible winter storm. But predictions now call for an April blizzard that could bring whiteout conditions. And because of the intense drop in pressure, the system could develop into the region's second bomb cyclone in less than a month .
Lots of #bombcyclone talk out there again this week.
Remember we have a website for that: https://t.co/e97MGrQ0zS https://t.co/QHgBaPE8Dg
— CPR News (@CPRNews) April 9, 2019 In addition to snow, residents could see dangerous flooding, including in towns in Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota and along the Missouri River, where people are still coping with the effects of last month's floods .
""Heavy snow will develop in the mountains Wednesday morning and then may spread across the plains Wednesday afternoon,"" the NWS office in Boulder says. The agency's blizzard warning for northeast Colorado applies from noon Wednesday to noon Thursday.

— NET News (@NETNewsNebraska) April 8, 2019 Blizzard warnings have now been issued in several states, from the Dakotas and Colorado to parts of Iowa , Nebraska and Minnesota .
The storm came ashore from the Pacific Ocean on Sunday and Monday, bringing heavy rainfall and floods to Oregon, where evacuation orders were issued in the Eugene area, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported on Monday . It is also expected to cause problems in Idaho and Montana as it gets closer to its expected meeting with cold air.
Environment A 'Bomb Cyclone' Is Thwacking The Central U.S. ""Snow is expected to develop Wednesday morning over the higher terrain and spread eastward,"" the National Weather Service office in Colorado says. ""Precipitation is expected to begin as rain but change to snow during the day as colder air moves into the area.""
As for how much snowfall might accumulate, forecasters say that's still uncertain for some areas — but that overall, the snow totals could be similar to last month's blizzard. Parts of South Dakota could see more than 24 inches of heavy, wet snow, the NWS office in Sioux Falls says. Other areas in the state and neighboring areas might see only a few inches.
Latest update on projected snowfall amounts with the upcoming April blizzard. Rain will develop tonight and gradually change to snow on Wednesday and Wednesday night, then continue into early Friday. pic.twitter.com/82tGlbq066
— NWS Sioux Falls (@NWSSiouxFalls) April 9, 2019 The sudden about-face is similar to the way the inland bomb cyclone formed in March, when the weather in the Rockies and Great Plains shifted from clear skies and temperatures in the 50s and 60s to rain, snow and howling winds.
It's not unusual for these parts of the U.S. to experience swings from warm temperatures to snow in the springtime. But the intensity of the coming switch has caught forecasters' attention — and they're warning people to keep a cautious eye on conditions that could quickly turn dangerous.
""We usually get a winter storm sometime in April,"" the National Weather Service's Kari Fleegel told South Dakota Public Broadcasting 's Gary Ellenbolt . ""However, amounts that we have forecast right now are pretty rare. Some of this might be record territory.""
The NWS office in Aberdeen, S.D., where Fleegel is based, is urging people to change their travel plans to account for a storm that it now expects to bring snow in two waves, from 3 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday and from 3 a.m. Thursday to 6 a.m. Friday.
The result, the office says, adds up to a ""potentially historic spring blizzard.""
National 'Bomb Cyclone' Paralyzes Central U.S., Bringing Snow, Floods And Dangerous Winds Announcing a blizzard warning for west central Minnesota Tuesday, the Twin Cities NWS office asked residents , ""Have you taken your winter safety items out of your car for the season? Time to put them back in your vehicle.""
If you're wondering about the ""bomb cyclone"" term, we reported last month:
""The meteorological term 'bomb cyclone' refers to a storm that intensifies very quickly through a process called bombogenesis , in which barometric pressure falls by at least 24 millibars over 24 hours. That's what happened in parts of the central U.S., where just one day before blizzard conditions hit, many areas such as Denver were enjoying sunny weather in the 50s and 60s.""

The final results of the Israeli parliamentary election are too close to call, but two television stations are forecasting a slim victory by incumbent Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party.
Israel's channels 12 and 13 project that Likud will capture 35 seats in the 120-seat parliament, changing their forecasts from earlier in the vote-counting, according to the Associated Press.
The election that is largely seen as a referendum on Israel's longtime right-wing leader, Benjamin Netanyahu. He faces a serious challenge from relative political newcomer Benny Gantz. Both leading candidates have claimed victory.
The prime minister and Trump ally, who could become Israel's longest-serving leader if he secures another term, is facing corruption allegations. Netanyahu has spent the last 10 years in power, and also led the country for three years in the late 1990s.

While the race itself is largely about Netanyahu's political future, Israel's 6.3 million eligible voters are choosing between some 40 different candidate lists , representing a broad array of parties, movements and individuals.
The candidates are competing for the 120 seats in Israel's parliament, the Knesset. After election returns are in, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin will select a party leader to attempt to put together a coalition government. In the past, the process has sometimes taken weeks.
Initial exit polls released by Israeli TV stations were not consistent on which candidate's list was leading.
Still, Netanyahu and Gantz both say they have won.
""The right-wing bloc led by the Likud won a clear victory,"" Netanyahu said in a tweet . ""I will begin forming a right-wing government with our natural partners this very evening.""
A spokesperson for Gantz's alliance said, ""We won. The Israeli public has had their say,"" as Reuters reported.
The performance of other, smaller parties may give Netanyahu an edge in forming a government. As Haaretz reported , ""The bloc of right-wing and religious parties had a small majority over the center-left opposition."" But at the same time, the newspaper added: ""Nothing is certain and the polls are questionable anyway."" Here's What To Know About Israel's Upcoming Elections
Gantz, a former military chief of staff, is neck-and-neck with Netanyahu in the final weeks of the polls with his Blue and White political alliance. The group, which is largely made up of centrist and right-wing former government officials, has campaigned on a message that it can unify the country.
In the final hours of the race, Netanyahu has put out a series of videos to try to turn out his right-wing base by warning that its turnout is low, as NPR's Daniel Estrin reported.
Netanyahu's campaign has previously used social media to cast Gantz as dangerous and inexperienced. As Estrin noted , ""Netanyahu's party also put out a video it later apologized for - showing a military graveyard and claiming Gantz would lead a reckless left-wing government and cause hundreds of deaths.""
Gantz has fired back. He accused Netanyahu of embracing extremists through ties with the far-right Jewish Power Party.
Perhaps most controversially, Netanyahu has recently promised to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank if he wins another term. That would deal a huge blow to Palestinian aspirations to form an independent state there and would short-circuit an outcome that the international community expects to be resolved through peace talks.
""Is he serious? It's a last-minute campaign pledge,"" Estrin told Morning Edition. ""It would cause an uproar in the world, but his party really wants him to do it.""
In his years in office, Netanyahu has moved the country away from a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. After A Decade Of Netanyahu, Hopes Fade For A Palestinian State
In 2009, after taking office for a second time and under pressure from then-President Barack Obama, Netanyahu publicly called for the creation of a Palestinian state for the first time.
But as Estrin reported , with the exception of a 10-month settlement construction freeze, the prime minister continued to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank. It's an area that both Israelis and Palestinians have historical ties to, and Israel has occupied since 1967. Settlements are broadly viewed as an obstacle to peace by Palestinians and the international community. Israel's Attorney General Moves To Indict Netanyahu On Corruption Charges
Netanyahu is also facing the looming possibility of indictment on corruption charges. In February, Israel's attorney general announced that he was preparing to indict the prime minister after studying three different corruption cases, related to allegedly accepting gifts from wealthy businessmen and allegedly conspiring with media moguls to trade favors in exchange for positive coverage.
Netanyahu's party deployed some 1,200 hidden cameras to monitor Arab voters, according to Israeli media , which the party said is aimed at preventing election fraud. ""Arab parties claim it's a move to intimidate Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel,"" Estrin reported. ""The election commissioner has moved to limit but not completely ban the practice.""
Haaretz reported that Tuesday's poll saw ""particularly low numbers"" among Arab voters.
At the same polling station where Netanyahu cast his vote on Tuesday, Estrin met one of his supporters, 29-year-old Tzvi Gudin.
""Netanyahu is a leader once in a generation"" Gudin said. ""I want him to be the leader of the decades.""
Another voter, Yael Levin, told Estrin that she expects Netanyahu's Likud party to gain the most support in this vote – but she hopes that Gantz's party would consider joining Likud in a coalition, as a moderating force. ""Hopefully we can move forward rather than backward,"" she said."

Just over a year ago, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy that increased the frequency of families being separated from their children after they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border.
That policy was eventually walked back after a cascade of outrage.
But the administration failed to reunite some children with their families (including some of those who were separated before the ""zero-tolerance"" policy was implemented). And the administration has continued to separate families from the children with whom they cross the border.
Now, Kirstjen Nielsen, the Department of Homeland Security secretary who led the ""zero-tolerance"" enforcement, will depart on Wednesday.

"College Admissions Scandal Surfaces New Charges Against Lori Loughlin, 16 Others : NPR",www.npr.org,Colin Dwyer,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711466916/lori-loughlin-15-others-indicted-on-new-charges-in-college-admissions-scandal,"U.S. Charges Dozens Of Parents, Coaches In Massive College Admissions Scandal
Already accused of participating in the scheme, the 16 parents facing new charges Tuesday also allegedly sought to disguise that participation.
According to a statement released by federal officials , the individuals laundered their payments ""by funneling them through Singer's purported charity and his for-profit corporation, as well as by transferring money into the United States, from outside the United States, for the purpose of promoting the fraud scheme.""
The indictment significantly escalates the legal jeopardy and potential consequences that these 16 parents face. Each of the new charges — one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud — carries a possible penalty of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of at least $250,000.
In its statement, the Justice Department identified the 16 parents included in Tuesday's indictment:
1. Gamal Abdelaziz, 62, aka ""Gamal Aziz,"" of Las Vegas, Nev.;2. Diane Blake, 55, of Ross, Calif.;3. Todd Blake, 53, of Ross, Calif.;4. I-Hsin ""Joey"" Chen, 64, of Newport Beach, Calif.;5. Mossimo Giannulli, 55, of Los Angeles, Calif.;6. Elizabeth Henriquez, 56, of Atherton, Calif.;7. Manuel Henriquez, 56, of Atherton, Calif.;8. Douglas Hodge, 61, of Laguna Beach, Calif.;9. Michelle Janavs, 48, of Newport Coast, Calif.;10. Elisabeth Kimmel, 54, of Las Vegas, Nev.;11. Lori Loughlin, 54, of Los Angeles, Calif.;12. William McGlashan, Jr., 55, of Mill Valley, Calif.;13. Marci Palatella, 63, of Hillsborough, Calif.;14. John Wilson, 59, of Lynnfield, Mass.;15. Homayoun Zadeh, 57, of Calabasas, Calif.; and16. Robert Zangrillo, 52, of Miami, Fla.
Loughlin, an actress formerly starring on Full House, is perhaps the most widely known figure among the co-defendants. Prosecutors have accused her and her husband of conspiring to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California, paying Singer and others to have the daughters falsely portrayed as recruits to the women's crew team. Read the full indictment
Last month the university announced that the academic status of students associated with the case has been placed on hold, preventing them from registering for classes or withdrawing from the school while the school has placed them under review.
But Loughlin and Giannulli were far from alone in the new indictment. Others include several senior executives of private investment and real estate firms, as well as magnates in the fields of shipping, food and media.
Their arraignment date has not yet been scheduled.
The indictment closely follows the announcement that more than a dozen of their co-defendants have decided to plead guilty to their own charges, in accordance with plea agreements. Among them was Huffman, a longtime television actress in her own right.
""My daughter knew absolutely nothing about my actions, and in my misguided and profoundly wrong way, I have betrayed her. This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life,"" Huffman said in a statement of apology released Monday. ""My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty."" Correction April 9, 2019
An earlier version of this story said Felicity Huffman and 13 other parents said on Monday that they would plead guilty in the college admissions scandal. In fact, it is Huffman and 12 other parents."
Rwandan's Trial In Boston Triggers Memories Of Genocide,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711341821/reporters-notebook-rwandan-s-trial-triggers-memories-of-genocide,"Embed Embed Transcript
Witnessing the sheer scale and brutality of the Rwandan genocide bruised my soul, it crushed my inherent faith in the goodness of humanity. It was also dangerous and there were a couple of way-too-close brushes with death.
Now, here I was, 25 years later, looking at one of those believed to be complicit in the atrocities. Teganya is now 48 years old, balding and wearing glasses. Back then, he was a medical student at a university hospital in Butare, the southern Rwanda town where I stopped for the night shortly after entering the country for the first time.
Any defense lawyer will tell you it is risky to put your client on the stand, but Teganya — wearing a well-fitting dark suit, white shirt and striped tie — was composed. He appeared smart and articulate and answered questions succinctly, elaborating only when necessary. Teganya maintained he had been just a hard-working student, helping wounded patients and protecting Tutsis from marauding Hutus. Teganya's father was Hutu, his mother a Tutsi.
I thought Teganya and his lawyer must have carefully rehearsed his testimony. But after three hours, it felt more as though Teganya had been rehearsing for this moment of reckoning for a much longer time — possibly ever since he fled Rwanda into neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo at the end of the genocide.
By the time the prosecution started questioning Teganya — confronting him with conflicting statements he had made — his testimony started to feel a little too smooth. His brisk, fulsome denials of taking part in rapes, in rounding up Tutsis or carrying out killings, started to ring false. A Reporter Reflects On Rwanda: 'It's Like A Madness Took Over'
I knew I hadn't sat in on the full trial so I hadn't heard Rwandan witnesses brought in by both prosecution and defense, nor the testimony of U.S. officials experienced at tracking down documentation to fully gauge whether Teganya was guilty. I felt myself starting to get upset, even angry as I sat in that courtroom. I worried how the passage of time — if witnesses' fuzzy memories — would affect the outcome of the trial.
As it turned out, the jury took less than three hours to convict Teganya for making false statements about his role in Rwanda's genocide on his asylum application for the U.S. He is due to be sentenced July 1. "

Quil Lawrence/NPR A Wisconsin combat veteran was driving down the highway in February when he suddenly found his name, license plate number and mental health information broadcast on the radio, on television and posted on electronic billboards across the state.
""It felt very violating. Because I didn't want everyone who doesn't know me to know I have problems. It made me want to crawl into a bigger hole,"" he told NPR.
But the ""Green Alert"" might have saved his life.
""It's still affecting me dramatically and negatively, but at the same time it's quite possible that it's why I'm here right now,"" says the former Air Force staff sergeant. ""It's kind of a double-edged sword.""
NPR is not divulging the man's name because he never consented to have his information made public. A new Wisconsin law allows authorities to put that information out the same way an AMBER Alert publicizes missing children or a Silver Alert does for people with cognitive impairment. It's the first Green Alert to take effect — green for the color of military fatigues — though many states are considering the program.
The Wisconsin law is called the Corey Adams Searchlight Act . Adams was an Afghanistan vet from Milwaukee who went missing in 2017. His family feared he was suicidal. But police didn't immediately treat him as a missing person, because unlike children, adults have a right to disappear if they want to.
Adams was found dead weeks later. His family mobilized around the idea of an alert system for veterans and it became law in Wisconsin last year. That attracted a powerful advocate – the retired commander of U.S. special forces in Africa, Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc.
""We do it for our elderly because we have a tremendous amount of respect for our elderly. We do it for our children because we love our children. And we need to do it for our veterans, too,"" says Bolduc, who served more than 30 years on active duty.

Andrew Harnik/AP Since his retirement in 2017, Bolduc has focused on the high suicide rate among veterans - which VA estimated is about 20 per day. He says the first 24 hours when someone goes missing are crucial to preventing suicide.
Bolduc got in contact with his New Hampshire senator, Democrat Maggie Hassan. Hassan has now co-sponsored a bill to promote Green Alerts nationally, with Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, herself an Iraq vet. Their bill would create a commission to suggest best practices for states setting up Green Alerts, incorporating concerns about veterans' privacy.
One state considering a Green Alert system is Connecticut, where Steve Kennedy is a veterans' advocate – and not a supporter of the program.
""I have struggled with these things. I have been suicidal myself. I've struggled with PTSD and depression,"" says Kennedy. ""The last thing I would have wanted when I feel like everything is falling apart and I'm just completely hopeless is to have all of that sent out to every person I have ever known.""
Kennedy says he's afraid lumping veterans in with lost children and those with cognitive impairment is stigmatizing. Plus, once a veteran has been Green Alerted, the news reports — potentially including information about the veteran's mental health — remain an enduring part of his online profile.
Only a few Green Alerts have actually been triggered - all in Wisconsin. One of them is the Air Force staff sergeant who spoke with NPR.
The former staff sergeant served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He's quick to say he never saw heavy combat, though his C-130 transport plane did get shot at.
Still, PTSD hit about a year after he got home in 2005. That's not unusual - the roots of post-traumatic stress aren't always clear. The majority of military suicides are people who didn't deploy or see combat .
He's been receiving care at the Madison, Wisc. VA, for over a decade and he likes it. But his problems haven't gone away, and in February, he says, he was suicidal, and on the phone with the VA's Veterans Crisis Line .
""They made clear they were going to do everything they could to find me,"" he says. And that was the point where they initiated that Green Alert and had my face and vehicle info and everything everywhere.
""Everywhere.""
He headed out of state, toward a fellow-veteran's house. When he got there his friend quietly called the police. And luckily, the former staff sergeant says, there was another veteran among the group of cops who showed up. That vet kept things calm and talked him into going to the hospital.
He's of two minds about the Green Alert
""It probably helped find me. But I don't know that it helped me, if that makes sense,"" he says, "" 'cause I still face on a daily basis a constant barrage of questions about my personal life.
""Someone walks up to me in the middle of a meal in a restaurant, and says, 'Hey are you that Green Alert guy?' And immediately I'm taken back to those emotions,"" he says.
""I certainly respect the gentleman's concerns,"" says retired Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc. But Bolduc believes the Green Alert system can be done right, to balance privacy with saving lives.
""Any program we can get to help them is worth pursuing, you know,"" says Bolduc. ""I want my loved one alive, right?"""
A Look At The Ongoing Battle For The Libya's Capital,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711536531/a-look-at-the-ongoing-battle-for-the-libyas-capital,"NPR's Ari Shapiro talks about the ongoing battle for Tripoli, the capital of Libya, with Frederic Wehrey, author of The Burning Shores: Inside the Battle for the New Libya.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Libya is sliding toward civil war. Troops from the east of the country are advancing on the capital, Tripoli. Their leader is a general named Khalifa Haftar. Frederic Wehrey is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He has interviewed General Haftar and spent a lot of time reporting in Libya. And before we dig into what's happening at this moment, he's going to help us walk through how Libya came to this precarious juncture.
Frederic Wehrey, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
FREDERIC WEHREY: It's great to be here. Thanks.
SHAPIRO: I'd like to start in 2011. Protests are sweeping across the Middle East and North Africa. It's described as the Arab Spring. What's Libya's role in this?
WEHREY: Well, Libya very quickly joined the Arab Spring. There were initially peaceful protests against Gadhafi.
(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)
WEHREY: They quickly spiraled into an armed revolution.
(SOUNDBITE OF WEAPON FIRING)
UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting in foreign language).
(SOUNDBITE OF WEAPON FIRING)
WEHREY: This dragged on for several months.
SHAPIRO: Moammar Gadhafi had been the dictator in charge of Libya for many, many years. And later that year, 2011, what happens to him?
WEHREY: He's overthrown. He's executed by rebels, who drag him out of a ditch.
SHAPIRO: And that was actually caught on video.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Speaking in foreign language).
SHAPIRO: What's the role of NATO, Western troops, in all of this?
WEHREY: NATO was decisive. NATO applied airpower to help the rebels on the ground, ostensibly to protect civilians. But the NATO intervention was crucial to the toppling of Gadhafi. And the big mistake was that NATO - and the United States - did not follow through after the overthrow.
SHAPIRO: You're not the only one calling it a big mistake. After President Obama left office in 2016, he told Fox News that this was probably his biggest mistake as president.
(SOUNDBITE OF FOX NEWS BROADCAST)
BARACK OBAMA: Probably failing to plan for the day after what I think was the right thing to do in intervening in Libya.
SHAPIRO: The day after resulted in pretty much a split country.
WEHREY: Absolutely - because Gadhafi really didn't leave any structure for governing. And so Libya - you know, fragmented militias filled the vacuum. And by 2014, absolutely, you had this split between east and west.
SHAPIRO: As this was playing out, I'm sure many listeners will also remember the 2012 assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, which led to the death of a U.S. ambassador and a political feeding frenzy in this country.
(SOUNDBITE OF MEDIA MONTAGE)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Tragedy in Benghazi, Libya, on...
HILLARY CLINTON: What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack.
MARK GEIST: Hillary as president - no thanks. I served in Benghazi.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You can never forget about Benghazi - ever.
WEHREY: The great tragedy of that is that it really resulted in the retreat of the United States. As Libya became such a political football, the U.S. really disengaged.
SHAPIRO: So this brings us to the present day. Libya has been a country divided, with a government in the West backed by the United Nations and a government in the east backed by Russia and others. It's been this uneasy stalemate for a long time. And now this man, General Haftar, begins an advance on Tripoli. He's got a really interesting background. Tell us a little bit about him. He lived for 20 years in Virginia, was trained by the CIA.
WEHREY: It's quite a story. It's both epic and tragic. He was one of Gadhafi's allies, co-conspirators when Gadhafi overthrew the Libyan monarchy in 1969. He broke with the dictator during this disastrous war in Chad. He briefly was trained by the CIA. Then, he fled and settled in Virginia for two decades.
And then, in the twilight of his life, with the 2011 revolution against Gadhafi, he senses an opening for a comeback. He comes back to Libya, tries to lead the revolution and is shunted aside by the rebels. And then he gets another chance in 2014, and he launches this campaign that splits the country into two. He spends many years consolidating his control in the east, and now he's moved on the capital.
SHAPIRO: You've sat down and talked with him. What's he like personally?
WEHREY: He's deeply ambitious, convinced of his role in the country. He's an old-school military man, I think - an authoritarian by temperament. You look at his ornate uniforms full of colorful medals, and you see that he's sort of a throwback to a different era. He has a real disinterest in electoral politics.
SHAPIRO: He doesn't want to be elected in a popular vote is what you're saying (laughter).
WEHREY: I think so. And I asked him once about the constitutional drafting process, and he dismissed it as empty talk. So he really puts the military on a pedestal. He sees the military as sort of the national savior for the country.
SHAPIRO: He has several countries backing him - the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Russia. The position of the U.S. in all of this is unclear. Where does the Trump administration stand?
WEHREY: It's ambivalent. Technically, the United States is backing his rival, which is this internationally recognized government in Tripoli. But ever since Haftar came on the scene, he has enjoyed support from parts of the U.S. government who see that, yes, in fact, he is going after terrorists.
The United States State Department and others very recently, in this last assault, have come out strongly against this attack, obviously for its humanitarian consequences. But it's also sending the price of global oil prices skyrocketing.
SHAPIRO: Do you think he could succeed at ousting the government in Tripoli and taking over the country?
WEHREY: Right now he's clearly encountered more resistance than he anticipated. His campaign is stalled. There's issues of logistics, and he can't apply the same kind of airpower in the Tripoli landscape that he did in the eastern part. But I think we're in for a very protracted campaign and perhaps a stalemate.
SHAPIRO: How worried are you that Libya could explode in an all-out civil war?
WEHREY: I'm very worried. There's obviously questions about how much outside states get involved. In the past, during his other campaigns, the United Arab Emirates conducted airstrikes. The French were helping him on the ground with intelligence personnel. So I think the outside support is going to be crucial. But I think we're really at a risk of a national conflict.
SHAPIRO: Frederic Wehrey is a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Thanks for walking us through this today.
WEHREY: My pleasure. Thank you.

Combatting Coastal Erosion In Cape Cod With Coconut Fiber Rolls,www.npr.org,"Dave Deconto, Director of Natural Resources, Sandwich, Mass.",04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711097302/as-dunes-disappear-fiber-rolls-protect-cape-cod-homes-from-coastal-erosion,"Enlarge this image Uncovered fiber rolls in front of a private home on Town Neck Beach in Sandwich, Mass.

Made from coconut fiber and filled with sand, they are designed to prevent beach erosion.
Hayley Fager/WCAI Along the East Coast, spring typically means serious erosion caused by strong storms. This year, homeowners on Cape Cod, Mass., are bracing for the worst.
Laura Wing lives in a beachfront home in Sandwich. She inherited the house from her parents 40 years ago, but the beach has changed a lot since then.
""The dunes went much further out on the beach, so over all this time it's just eroded away to what it is now,"" she said.
These days the water is 50 feet from her home at high tide. It's typical to have houses right on the shore on Cape Cod, and storms can cause a lot of damage.
Wing has a costly decision to make: whether to invest $30,000 in fiber rolls, the most resilient method for slowing erosion that Massachusetts homeowners are allowed to use.
The rolls are made from coconut fiber and are buried in sandy slopes in front of homes, to absorb wave energy and hold sand in place. They are filled with sand or coconut fiber and planted with grasses and shrubs; they end up looking like dunes.
Enlarge this image Laura Wing in front of her beachfront home in Sandwich. Wing has not installed fiber rolls. This natural dune helps protect her home from erosion for now, but spring storms could make it vulnerable. Hayley Fager/WCAI Hayley Fager/WCAI Laura Wing in front of her beachfront home in Sandwich. Wing has not installed fiber rolls. This natural dune helps protect her home from erosion for now, but spring storms could make it vulnerable.
Hayley Fager/WCAI But whatever Wing decides to do with her property could also affect erosion on nearby public beaches. According to Dave Deconto, the director of natural resources for Sandwich, there is a beach in town where public and private land meet. The private homes on the beach have fiber rolls in front of them — the beach next to the rolls is pretty washed out and has lost a lot of sand. That's because whenever you construct a dune, even a fiber roll dune, there's going to be more erosion where the dune ends and the beach begins.
Mother Nature's gonna do what Mother Nature does.
Dave Deconto, director of natural resources, Sandwich, Mass.
There are other options for slowing erosion. One method uses barriers to break up the wave action before it hits the coastline, but it hasn't been approved by Massachusetts environmental regulators.
Deconto says whatever homeowners decide, all of the fixes are temporary. ""Mother Nature's gonna do what Mother Nature does,"" says Deconto. ""Every town on the coastline of Massachusetts is dealing with it; every community along the Eastern Seaboard, and the Gulf Coast, and the West Coast of the United States are dealing with it.""
Fiber rolls are mostly being used by private homeowners right now because the high cost can be a barrier for small coastal towns and most buildings on public beaches are farther inland and not as vulnerable as beachfront homes.
Massachusetts officials recommend fiber rolls because they have a lower impact on natural habitats than other methods for slowing erosion. The good news is, they are biodegradable. The bad news is, that means they have to be reinstalled as often as every five years, though some may last decades. The price can vary from $200 to $2,000 per square foot, depending on where they are installed and the materials that are used.
Seth Wilkinson, who installs these systems, he says he has had some hard conversations with homeowners. ""And they're saying, 'I don't think I can afford to live here anymore. Repairing this bank or stabilizing this bank will cost more than the value of my home.' ""
Wing says she isn't going to install fiber rolls for now. ""I can't cover that kind of expense by renting the house, so that just comes out of my savings. And I'm retired."" She says she is taking things one year at a time and hopes she doesn't lose her home in a storm before she decides to sell."

Right-wing voters appear to be the key as Israel elects a new parliament. A retired general is trying to win some over as he seeks to oust longtime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Polls have closed in Israel, where the country is electing a new Parliament, which will choose the next prime minister. Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking a fourth consecutive term after already serving a decade in office. He's ruled with what's perhaps the most right-wing coalition in Israeli history. His main challenger is a retired general who says Israel needs a unifying leader and cleaner government. Both have spoken tonight claiming victory. It's still too close to call with any certainty, but two Israeli TV stations have predicted a Netanyahu victory.
NPR's Daniel Estrin joins us now from Jerusalem. Hey, Daniel.
DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: Hi.
CHANG: So what did the two candidates say tonight?
ESTRIN: Well, early in the night, Benny Gantz, Netanyahu's challenger, stood before his supporters, and he declared victory. He said he was going to wait for the final results but that he would lead a discourse of unity in the country as the next prime minister. But then a couple hours later, Israeli TV stations, as you said, were predicting a slight lead for Netanyahu's party. And the actual vote count was looking that way as well. And even though it's not the final results, Netanyahu came to greet his supporters in Tel Aviv. He gave a victory speech. And here's what it sounded like when he came into the hall.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED SUPPORTERS: (Chanting in foreign language).
ESTRIN: So his supporters were chanting, he's a magician, over and over. He said he was waiting for the final results as well, but he called it a night of incredible, incredible victory. He vowed to form a right-wing government and to make Israel one of the strongest countries in the world. And he said he already began calling right-wing parties to try to form a government. But again, this is still not final.
CHANG: Right.
ESTRIN: No final results yet.
CHANG: And Gantz has not conceded.
ESTRIN: Not yet.
CHANG: Well, I know that you've been walking around today, talking to voters. What kind of trends have you been noticing as you talk to them?
ESTRIN: I heard a lot of very different voices, but I heard something very interesting, which was that the people who were voting for Gantz, the main centrist candidate, tended to be older voters who were not really enthused about him. But they wanted to replace Netanyahu. Take a listen to 72-year-old voter Tzipi Mismoor (ph). Here's what she said about Benny Gantz.
TZIPI MISMOOR: He's not very clever, unfortunately. But maybe it's the only way to take Netanyahu down - maybe. I don't think so but maybe.
ESTRIN: And I heard that a lot from Gantz's voters. Contrast that with one woman, a 20-year-old soldier named Roni (ph), who was very excited about Netanyahu.
RONI: His relationships with the world, the way that he got Trump to get onboard with Israel, Russia - nobody has ever done this before - just that he's an amazing person. And that's it.
ESTRIN: So to sum up, Gantz's voters who I met tended to be older. And a lot of younger voters went for Netanyahu.
CHANG: So when these two candidates were closing their campaigns, what were their final arguments?
ESTRIN: Netanyahu made this very last-minute pledge that if he gets re-elected, he will annex all Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. And that would be a very dramatic move. It could make it very, very hard for Israel to reach a peace agreement with the Palestinians. It was an attempt by Netanyahu to consolidate right-wing votes right before the elections. And Gantz's closing argument was, we are on the brink of winning, and we are the alternative for ending Netanyahu's decade in power.
CHANG: And when do we expect the results to come in?
ESTRIN: The votes are going to be counted all night here, and it's still close. But what will now happen is that there's going to be several days and longer of haggling. The parties meet with the president, and the president gets to decide which candidate has the best chances of forming a majority coalition.
CHANG: Still more to come. That's NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem. Thanks, Daniel.

President Trump hosts the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, whose government has a track record of killing or jailing thousands in an ongoing crackdown. The U.S. has been a major backer of him.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
At the White House today, President Trump hosted his Egyptian counterpart, and the two addressed each other like old friends. That worries human rights groups. The Egyptian government has jailed tens of thousands of people as it cracks down on political activity, and it is trying to tighten state control even further. NPR's Michele Kelemen reports.
MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Describing President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi as my friend, President Trump said the two are working well together and making progress on counterterrorism efforts and on trade.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We've never had a better relationship, Egypt and the United States, than we do right now.
KELEMEN: Egypt has been a key regional ally to the U.S. for decades. President Sissi has become especially close with Trump, touting that relationship as he spoke through an interpreter in the Oval Office.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT ABDEL-FATTAH EL-SISSI: (Through interpreter) All of the credit goes to you, Mr. President. Thank you very much for your support on all fronts. This is what we're seeking to promote our bilateral relations in various fields - political, economic, military, cultural and others.
KELEMEN: The visit comes as Egyptians prepare to vote later this month on constitutional amendments that would give Sissi even broader powers and allow him to stay in power until 2034. President Trump was asked about that effort as his aides tried to get reporters out of the room.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Guys, we got to keep moving.
TRUMP: I think he's doing a great job.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Half the room is out.
TRUMP: I don't know about the effort. I could just tell you he's doing a great job.
KELEMEN: Trump ignored a shouted question about Egypt's potential purchase of new Russian fighter jets. An activist with the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, Mai El-Sadany, says by hosting Sissi at this moment, the administration is sending a signal that Egypt is a stable partner no matter what it does.
MAI EL-SADANY: And that no matter what you do is a very dangerous message to send, both to Egyptians inside the country who still believe in preserving democratic values and principles and to other - to the region - other autocrats who are watching.
KELEMEN: She says the Egyptian government has done a good job at saying the things the U.S. wants to hear. Sissi presents himself as someone who protects Christians and other minorities and promotes women's rights. Michele Dunne of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace disputes that.
MICHELE DUNNE: But I think there are those in the Trump administration - I mean, Ivanka Trump tweeted about this recently - who accept that, who believe that he is doing great things for women and for Christians inside of Egypt.
KELEMEN: Dunne doesn't see Trump pressing Egypt on human rights, though members of Congress are speaking out. Seventeen senators this week accused Egypt of unjustly detaining at least a dozen Americans, noting that the country receives $1.3 billion a year from the U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy on the Appropriations Committee is threatening to hold up the sale of new Apache helicopters until Egypt compensates an American who was badly injured in Egypt when the military mistakenly fired on her tourist group. Administration officials say they have raised that case with the Egyptians and are seeking the release of Americans detained in Egypt. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, the State Department.

Attorney General William Barr Says Redacted Mueller Report Will Be Out Within 1 Week,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711536461/attorney-general-william-barr-says-redacted-mueller-report-will-be-out-within-1-,"Attorney General William Barr told Congress on Tuesday a redacted copy of the Mueller report would be out within a week. He says the report will include notes explaining why certain details are shielded.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Attorney General William Barr was on Capitol Hill today for a public hearing. Technically, it was about the Justice Department's 2020 budget. But - no surprise - much of the hearing instead focused on the highly anticipated Mueller report.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
WILLIAM BARR: Within a week, I will be in a position to release the report to the public.
CHANG: That is a redacted version of the special counsel's report on the Russia investigation. NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas joins me now.
Hey, Ryan.
RYAN LUCAS, BYLINE: Hi there.
CHANG: OK. So other than the timeline of the release, what else did we learn from Barr today on the Mueller report?
LUCAS: Well, we got more details on how the department is handling the process of redacting the report before it's released to Congress and the public. Barr has said that there are four categories of material that are going to be blacked out before it's made public. He reminded lawmakers today of what those categories are. They are grand jury materials, information that U.S. spy agencies believe could reveal their sources or methods, information that could interfere with ongoing law enforcement investigations and information that touches on privacy or reputational interests of so-called peripheral individuals who weren't charged in the Russia investigation.
CHANG: Right.
LUCAS: Barr said he's not making these decisions alone. He described the review process as a team effort.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BARR: Right now the special counsel is working with us on identifying information in the reports that fall under those four categories.
LUCAS: Now, Barr also said that all of the redactions will have a note explaining why the information is being kept secret.
CHANG: OK. But is that going to be enough for House Democrats? - because all along, they've been pushing for the Mueller report to be released without any redactions.
LUCAS: Well - and that's not all. They also want all of the underlying documents from the investigation.
CHANG: Right - all the evidence.
LUCAS: Right. So during the hearing today, Democrats - they did raise concerns about how these redactions are being handled and how sweeping these redactions could be. One Democrat today described the category of privacy and reputational interests as an exception big enough to drive a truck through. Democrats also pressed Barr about redactions related to grand jury proceedings.
Now, there are strict federal rules that prohibit the release of those materials. But there are a couple of very narrow exceptions. Barr himself could seek court authorization, provide lawmakers some of the information developed during those grand jury proceedings. But today Barr told lawmakers that he has no plans to do that at all.
CHANG: All right. So this redacted report is heading our way very soon. At the same time, you know, the attorney general has said that he wants to be transparent with this report.
LUCAS: Right.
CHANG: How does he square that? - because, especially with the redactions, say, related to the reputational interests, where's the transparency?
LUCAS: Well, remember. Barr said that he wants to be as transparent as possible consistent with the law. That's a very important distinction. What Barr made clear today is that he wants to get a version of this report out so that people can see it. They can draw their own conclusions, make their own judgments.
But he also said that he's willing to talk to lawmakers down the road to see if he can provide them with more information from the investigation. That particularly applies to the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler. He has a subpoena in hand for the full report. He said today that he should get all of the materials from this. So there is definitely a potential fight brewing on this.
CHANG: Yeah. OK. So beyond the Mueller report, Barr mentioned another investigation today related to the Russia probe. What can you tell us about that?
LUCAS: Well, the Justice Department's inspector general is looking into alleged surveillance abuses in the Russia investigation. This has been a favorite topic of House Republicans. We've talked about it a lot, about their allegations. They allege that the department and the FBI abused their surveillance powers to target members of the Trump campaign. Barr said today that he expects the inspector general's investigation of these allegations to wrap up by May or June.
CHANG: OK. That's NPR's Ryan Lucas.
Thanks, Ryan.
LUCAS: Thank you.

14 Are Reported Killed In Sudan As Protesters Call For End To President's Rule : NPR,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711486025/14-are-reported-killed-in-sudan-as-protesters-call-for-end-to-presidents-rule,"14 Are Reported Killed In Sudan As Protesters Call For End To President's Rule Facebook
Protesters rally near the military headquarters on Tuesday in Khartoum, Sudan. Activists behind the anti-government protests say that security forces killed 14 people on Tuesday as troops moved to break up the demonstration. AP hide caption toggle caption AP Protesters rally near the military headquarters on Tuesday in Khartoum, Sudan. Activists behind the anti-government protests say that security forces killed 14 people on Tuesday as troops moved to break up the demonstration. AP
Demonstrations in the capital of Khartoum have been gaining intensity in recent days as protesters staged a sit-in in front of the military complex there.
Now the scene has turned violent. Security forces killed at least 14 people on Tuesday, activists involved in the demonstration told the Associated Press. At least eight others have been killed since Saturday, including members of security forces, the news service reported.
Sudan has been the site of protests since late December, when a protest began over the price of bread. The economic concerns have become political demands, and protesters want an end to the 30-year-rule of President Omar al-Bashir.
As the AP reports, activists are pushing their appeal with fresh vigor after nearly four months of protests: ""On Monday, for the first time, leaders of the protests called on the military's leadership to abandon al-Bashir and join their call for change. And on Tuesday, they invited military leaders to meet with their representatives to 'discuss arrangements for a transition' in Sudan."" Protesters Across Sudan Continue To Call For President's Ouster
Amid the crackdown, there are signs that the government's control could be weakening. Video that was being shared on Tuesday showed some members of the military shielding protesters and site of the sit-in, the AP reported.
NPR Africa Correspondent Ofeibea Quist-Arcton reports that the Sudanese interior minister told Parliament on Monday that 15 protesters and 42 security force members have been injured, and nearly 2,500 people arrested. Key sections of the security forces remain loyal to Bashir, Quist-Arcton notes.
The Sudanese Professionals Union, which is organizing the protests, said in a public letter that the government's security forces, along with Islamist militias, attacked the peaceful protest for over two hours on Tuesday. They had attacked the demonstration before, the union said, but this time it was larger and more violent.
The union wrote that the regime rules ""with complete tyranny, using violence and the security apparatus to guard itself against the people,"" and argues that the government ""has lost all legitimacy"" since the protests began.
And the union called on the international community to support their movement: ""The Sudanese people continue to stand alone in the face of the regime's brutal apparatus. We urge the international and regional community to stop turning a blind eye to the ongoing situation in Sudan and to respond in an appropriate way to the crimes committed by Bashir's regime.""
Bashir has governed Sudan since 1989, when he came to power in a military coup that toppled the country's last freely elected leader. In 2010, the International Criminal Court indicted Bashir for genocide and crimes against humanity committed in Darfur.
Reuters reports that a state news agency cited a Sudanese police spokesman as saying that police had been told ""not to confront citizens and peaceful gatherings.""
Women in particular have played a striking role in the Khartoum protests. The photo and video of a woman standing on car, dressed in white and leading a crowd in defiant song, has gone viral. — Lana H. Haroun (@lana_hago) April 8, 2019 Don’t know her name, but this Woman in #Sudan is leading rallies, standing on car roofs, and pleading for change against autocratic Bashir.Here she is singing “Thawra” (Revolution). Remember this voice: pic.twitter.com/0JG31Tp4rZ — Joyce Karam (@Joyce_Karam) April 9, 2019
Hind Makki, an interfaith educator in Chicago, explained on Twitter that the woman's clothing is highly symbolic.
""She's wearing a white tobe (outer garment) and gold moon earrings. The white tobe is worn by working women in offices and can be linked w/cotton (a major export of Sudan), so it represents women working as professionals in cities or in the agricultural sector in rural areas,"" Makki wrote. ""Her entire outfit is also a callback to the clothing worn by our mothers & grandmothers in the 60s, 70s, & 80s who dressed like this during while they marched the streets demonstrating against previous military dictatorships.""
The U.S., Britain and Norway released a joint statement on Tuesday that called on Sudan's government to respond to protesters' demands and deliver ""a credible plan"" for political transition. ""Failing to do so risks causing greater instability. The Sudanese leadership has a grave responsibility to avoid such an outcome.""
The three countries called on the government to lift the state of emergency, allow freedom of movement and release political detainees. The countries said they would support the process of political transition and ""in time could work to help resolve some of the long term economic challenges that Sudan faces.""
Amnesty International criticized the violent quashing of protest. ""The Sudanese authorities must stop firing at protesters peacefully exercising their freedom of expression. The killing of people who are simply taking a stand for what they believe in is completely unacceptable,"" Joan Nyanyuki, the organization's director for the region said in a statement .
The United Nations expressed concern about the reports that government forces were using live ammunition and tear gas on demonstrators.
A spokesperson for UN Human Rights said that it was ""again calling on the Government and security forces to ensure that the right to peaceful assembly is fully respected and the right to freedom of expression is respected, and that a genuine dialogue is undertaken to resolve this very complex situation with very real economic and social grievances of the public.""

DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Yeah, and look back to just a year ago - UVA was the laughingstock of the tournament.

NANTZ: Twenty-point lead and the greatest upset in the history of this tournament is going to happen - devastating.
GREENE: Yeah, really devastating. Last year, Virginia was at the top of its bracket, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County was at the bottom, and somehow, the UMBC Retrievers buried UVA. Virginia became the first No. 1 seed ever to lose to a No. 16 seed in the men's tournament. This year, though, a total 180 for UVA.
MARTIN: But most of last night's game was close. In the second half, Virginia pulled ahead by 10 points; that lead trickled away. They were behind by three late in the game, when UVA's De'Andre Hunter took aim.

JEROME: Last year, it drew us even closer together. So it wasn't like a rush to get to this championship game and then win it so we could prove all you guys wrong; it was more just, you know, we grew even more united.

Judge Rules Against Trump Policy Of Sending Asylum-Seekers To Mexico,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711331399/judge-rules-against-trump-policy-of-sending-asylum-seekers-to-mexico?station=KXJZ_FM,"A federal judge in California blocked the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocol policy that required asylum-seekers to return to Mexico as they await court hearings in the U.S.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
All right. As the Trump administration moves to take a harder stance on immigration, a federal judge in California has blocked the administration's policy requiring asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico as they wait for their court hearings in the United States. Officials say hundreds of asylum-seekers have been sent back to Mexican cities, from Tijuana to Juarez, under the president's so-called Migrant Protection Protocols. Reporter Max Rivlin-Nadler was in immigration court in San Diego when the judge's ruling came down.
MAX RIVLIN-NADLER, BYLINE: At 9 a.m. Monday, 19 Central American asylum-seekers, including families and small children, made their way from migrant shelters in Tijuana to the San Ysidro Port of Entry and then to a special courtroom in downtown San Diego. It was their first hearing in their immigration cases. None of them had lawyers. Many said they had tried to find one but couldn't; none of the pro bono lawyers on a list given to them by Customs and Border Protection would travel to Mexico to meet with them. Many said they were fearful of returning to Mexico, where they had been living since at least February, when they first entered the U.S. to apply for asylum. I'd rather be detained in the United States than have to return, said one father through tears, sitting next to his 10-year-old son.
Midway through the hearing, however, the judge was interrupted. A lawyer announced that the entire MPP program had been halted. An injunction had just come down from Judge Richard Seeborg in a federal court in San Francisco. Ian Philabaum is the program coordinator at the Innovation Law Lab, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit which resulted in the injunction. The suit claimed that the government was not correctly applying asylum law.
IAN PHILABAUM: The Trump administration was trying to manipulate the statute in order to further its efforts to impede asylum-seekers from being able to seek their protection that they are afforded under international and domestic law here in the United States.
RIVLIN-NADLER: Since first going into effect in January, the MPP policy has expanded to El Paso, Texas, and to Calexico, east of San Diego. In Mexicali, across the border from Calexico, one asylum-seeker waiting for her immigration hearing was Sairi Lemus (ph), a Guatemalan mother of three. She explained the process to KJZZ's Michel Marizco.
SAIRI LEMUS: (Speaking Spanish).
RIVLIN-NADLER: ""And then, well, they interviewed us, and everything but no,"" she said. ""They sent us to wait here. We have an appointment with the judge May 8 in San Ysidro."" Lawyers are still trying to make sense of the ruling - who can stay in the U.S., who can return to the U.S. There were 11 plaintiffs named in the lawsuit, and all are currently in Tijuana.
LISA KNOX: I'm not sure how broadly this is going to apply and who's going to be allowed to return.
RIVLIN-NADLER: Lisa Knox is an attorney at Centro Legal de la Raza. She represented plaintiffs in the case.
KNOX: So certainly, it could be that everyone's going to be allowed to return to the U.S. who's been through the Migrant Protection Protocols program. But the order is very clear that the 11 individuals named in the lawsuit have to be allowed to enter the U.S.
RIVLIN-NADLER: The ruling will go into effect at 5 p.m. on April 12. The federal government can appeal the injunction. For the 19 asylum-seekers in immigration court in San Diego when the ruling came down, the judge said they would be sent back to Tijuana for now, pending another round of interviews to determine whether their fear of returning is credible. They might be among the very last Central American immigrants returned to Mexico. For NPR News, I'm Max Rivlin-Nadler in San Diego.

Next DHS Chief May Be More Aggressive With Immigration Enforcement,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314463/next-dhs-chief-may-be-more-aggressive-with-immigration-enforcement?station=KXJZ_FM,"Rachel Martin talks to Mark Krikorian, who heads the Center for Immigration Studies, about the departure of the Homeland Security secretary, and what the administration should look for in a successor.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
We're going to focus now on the implications of the leadership change at the Department of Homeland Security - specifically, what Kirstjen Nielsen's departure as the head of DHS will mean for the president's immigration policies. Congress and the courts have been reining in the administration's immigration plans. Yesterday, a federal judge in San Francisco blocked Trump's plan to force asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico. What other steps might the president try in order to fulfill a campaign promise to limit immigration into the U.S.? Mark Krikorian is the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which has helped shape the Trump administration's policies on immigration. And he's in our studios this morning.
Thanks so much for being here.
MARK KRIKORIAN: Glad to be here.
MARTIN: Are you pleased to see Kirstjen Nielsen go at DHS?
KRIKORIAN: Yeah, I think it's long overdue. This job was not for her. She was in over her head. She's a cybersecurity person, and that she knows. And DHS does deal with issues like that. But the most pressing issues that DHS has been dealing with are, obviously, immigration-related issues. And she did not appreciate the urgency of this. We wrote about a year ago about how things were almost certainly going to be spinning out of control. And if we saw it, then they should have seen it, too.
MARTIN: Although she publicly backed all of the president's policies, including the very controversial policy of separating children from their families.
KRIKORIAN: This was something - it was a day late and a dollar short, I think, on her part. In other words, she came to appreciate the urgency to respond to this developing emergency on the border but much too late. And she just - I mean, she had to go. We really need a new approach - a more serious and urgent approach to deal with this developing emergency.
MARTIN: So what does that mean? When you say more serious and more urgent, what does that mean?
KRIKORIAN: There's a couple of things just that I think are worth touching on. First, we need to have a declaration and implementation of a mass migration emergency plan. That's actually something that exists. It's been developed for years - a response to mass arrival of people. It's been formulated to deal with seaborne migration emergencies, people from Haiti or Cuba arriving in huge numbers on rafts.
But this is the similar thing at the Mexican border. And what that would involve, for instance, would be tent cities the Army sets up next to existing detention facilities. So you hold people and don't let them go into the country 'cause that's really the key. We're letting people go, and then that's the end of the story. I mean, the rest - then they're gone, and that incentivizes people down in Central America to follow them because...
MARTIN: So you really can imagine the United States of America building tent cities to house asylum-seekers?
KRIKORIAN: Oh, absolutely. We've done it before. We - in Guantanamo, we did it with Cuban and Haitian rafters. And the point is that it - that by doing that, you take away the incentive for the mass arrivals 'cause the whole point is to use asylum as a - a claim of asylum as a strategy for illegal immigration to be released into the U.S.
The Guardian just had a story where they interviewed people - smugglers and prospective illegal immigrants in Guatemala. And they - and the people said, look. People - we're hearing from people who went to the border, were let in, released. And they're working. And they're - you know, they got away with it. And so more people will be following. That has to change.
MARTIN: What do you think more broadly - or do you believe that the U.S. asylum laws more broadly need to change?
KRIKORIAN: Absolutely. There's no question that it's too easy to use asylum as a way of getting illegally into the United States. And probably, the most important first change would need to be - and this is statutory; this is something Congress has to do - is raise the standards for the first cut - to make the first cut for asylum. It's called a credible fear interview. And the point is - you know, is your case even plausible? Now almost everybody gets approved. That can't continue because there is - it is unsustainable.
MARTIN: Do you believe that's the direction that the president wants to move in?
KRIKORIAN: I think so, clearly. I mean, there - but there's limit to what he can do as opposed to what Congress needs to do. One of the things that I think we're going to see a change - that we really do need to see a change is ICE changing its priorities, at least for now, so that what they do is they prioritize the return of failed asylum-seekers.
Now if you go through the process, you're turned down for asylum, there's really no consequences. Until people in Central America see failed asylum-seekers in large numbers being returned, they're just going to keep coming.
MARTIN: Conservative immigration activist Mark Krikorian - he is executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies.
Thanks so much.
KRIKORIAN: Thank you.

White House Cancels MLB-Cuba Deal Made Under Obama Administration,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314470/white-house-cancels-mlb-cuban-deal-made-under-obama-administration?station=KXJZ_FM,"The Trump administration has canceled an agreement that would have allowed Cuban baseball players in the U.S. without having to defect first. Officials say the agreement was illegal.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The Trump administration is striking out Major League Baseball, at least when it comes to players from Cuba. The White House is canceling a historic agreement that was signed just four months ago. It would have allowed Cuban players to join big league teams in the U.S. directly. They would no longer have to defect off the island before signing a baseball contract. Here's more from NPR's Carrie Kahn.
CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: The deal announced in December allowed Major League Baseball to sign players directly from Cuba's Baseball Federation. The Trump administration, however, called that deal foul, saying the Cuban Federation is an arm of the communist regime and, therefore, off-limits to do business with a U.S. company. According to a senior Trump administration official, the Obama-era negotiated deal was tantamount to official human trafficking and allowed the Cuban government to use the players as pawns.
In a statement, MLB defended the deal, saying, we stand by the goal of the agreement, which is to end the human trafficking of baseball players from Cuba. For decades, Cuban stars have had to find a way off the island, mostly at the hands of human traffickers and smugglers, before landing a contract. That's how right fielder Yasiel Puig defected from Cuba.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
JOE BUCK: Delivers to Puig, and he smashes another one - deep left center field. That is going, and that is gone. How do you like this guy?
KAHN: Fox Sports announcers touted the now Cincinnati Reds' two home runs last month in a spring season game against Cleveland. Puig's been playing in Major League Baseball since leaving Cuba in 2012, when he allegedly endured kidnapping by a Mexican cartel that rumored payments for years to middlemen, who smuggled him off the island.
Advocates for warmer relations with Cuba say Trump's cancellation of the MLB agreement will just encourage more of that same smuggling and human trafficking. James Williams of Engage Cuba - a group that advocates for closer ties with Cuba - says Trump canceled the landmark agreement without offering any alternative.
JAMES WILLIAMS: All it does is make it worse. And it's really just about politics, not trying to solve a real issue, which is human trafficking.
KAHN: Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida lobbied to end the agreement, arguing that the Cuban Baseball Federation is part of the Cuban government. The Obama administration had ruled it was independent. In a tweet, the Cuban Baseball Federation called the cancellation an attack with political motivations that will harm athletes, their families and the fans.

Federal Prosecutors Announce Guilty Pleas In College Admissions Scandal,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314456/federal-prosecutors-announce-guilty-pleas-in-college-admissions-scandal?station=KXJZ_FM,"Thirteen parents and one college coach have agreed to plead guilty in the college admissions cheating case that broke last month. One of the parents is actress Felicity Huffman.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
In some other news, federal prosecutors say 13 parents charged in a college admissions scandal have agreed to plead guilty in Boston federal court. Also pleading guilty is a former coach at the University of Texas at Austin. He is admitting he took bribes to accept a student on the tennis team.
Fred Thys from member station WBUR in Boston has more.
FRED THYS, BYLINE: One of the parents is actor Felicity Huffman. She's admitting she paid $15,000 to have someone else take her daughter's SAT exam. Huffman sent a letter to several media outlets in which she says, with deep regret and shame over what I've done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions.
The maximum penalty for the charge to which she's pleading guilty is 20 years in prison. But prosecutors are recommending Huffman serve a much lower sentence, in part because she's admitting her guilt. Law professor Douglas Berman teaches sentencing at Ohio State University.
DOUGLAS BERMAN: The government runs the numbers, so to speak, to result in a recommended sentencing range of four to 10 months of imprisonment, though they also say that they would only recommend the bottom of that range. So in a sense, they're calling for four months.
THYS: Huffman's attorneys are expected to ask for no prison time. The scandal has rocked the world of college admissions. Arun Ponnusamy, the chief academic officer of Collegewise, a national private college counseling service, says the lesson from this is much bigger than - parents should not bribe their children's way into college.
ARUN PONNUSAMY: I think the great lesson is to kind of let everyone kind of step back and think about, you know - what is the purpose of a college education, you know? What's the power of it transforming your life and who you can become?
THYS: No students have been prosecuted so far. But last week, the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, Andrew Lelling, said he and his prosecutors are still discussing whether to press charges against some students.
For NPR News, I'm Fred Thys in Boston.

Trump Finds Benefits With Officials Working In Acting Positions,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711330592/trump-finds-benefits-with-officials-working-in-acting-positions?station=KXJZ_FM,"Rachel Martin talks to Andrew Card, former chief-of-staff to President George W. Bush, about the impact of the Trump administration turnover. Card says it's disrupting to the cadence of government.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
When you look around the upper echelons of the Trump administration right now, there appear to be an awful lot of temps. Earlier this year, the president was asked why so many of his Cabinet officials are serving in an acting capacity. And here's what he said.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I sort of like acting - gives me more flexibility. Do you understand that? I like acting. So we have a few that are acting. We have a great, great Cabinet.
MARTIN: President Trump has replaced his attorney general and EPA administrator with permanent hires. But now there are two more vacancies, the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen. Whoever the president nominates for that particular role is going to have to deal with the backlash to the president's immigration policies, so it may not happen quickly.
Andrew Card served as chief of staff to President George W. Bush, and he is with us now on the line. Thank you so much for being with us this morning.
ANDREW CARD: Good morning, Rachel. It's great to be with you.
MARTIN: So do you think it matters to have a number of Cabinet members in their roles as - in an acting basis.
CARD: Well, it is destructing to the cadence of government doing its job. But this is also an important time for the president to have a team that he has confidence in, not only because he needs the team to help him, as he's president, he needs a team to be in place that he can count on doing the job when he's going to be distracted with the campaign. So I think it's important for him to have the people around him that he thinks can make a difference and do the job that he wants done - although it is disruptive.
It's particularly challenging, I think, for the Secret Service because this is a time when they have to beef up to get ready to protect a lot of candidates who may be running for president. So in addition to protecting the president and doing all of the other things the secret has to - the Secret Service has to do, they have to worry about staffing up to help presidential campaigns that they don't really want to have to help.
MARTIN: But especially when it comes to the Cabinet nominees - I mean, secretary of defense, currently in an acting capacity - and the interior secretary, currently in an acting capacity. I mean, what does the president mean when he says he likes the flexibility when it comes to these top jobs - I mean, especially jobs that are so urgent and important?
CARD: Well, when you're doing the job, whether you have the title acting or not, you have to do the job. So you are completely focused on doing your job. You don't really worry about the - the the fact that you may be acting, though there are challenges when you have to address Congress. And Congress - you'd like Congress to act quickly to get candidates confirmed that the president has nominated. I'm not sure that it's going to happen, but I suspect that Mitch McConnell will work hard to try to get things done quickly so that people can be fully confirmed in their positions.
MARTIN: Right - because there is a problem...
CARD: But you really want the person in the job to focus on doing the job for the president, and that's what's important. So they shouldn't be preoccupied whether or not their title is acting or the real job.
MARTIN: Right.
CARD: But it's also significant that the president is controlling the agenda. Everybody is talking about what's happening in the Cabinet right now. They're not talking about who's running for president. And that's also an ancillary benefit to have kind of the pot stirred all the time, and he has a great capacity to stir the pot.
MARTIN: But Cabinet secretaries in acting positions don't have to testify before Congress. I mean, that's significant. Is it not?
CARD: It is significant. And one of the things that happens when you have to nominate someone else to do a job and the hearings are going to be held on Capitol Hill, it takes the focus and gives your opposition the ability to have the focus be on the negative things that are happening, not the positive things. So yes, it's a challenge.
I think that Kristen (ph) Nielsen did a remarkable job. That's a tough job, Department of Homeland Security. She did a remarkable job, and she deserves a lot of kudos for what she did. But this is a time of change. And - and the president felt it was - a need to make a change there. I respect that. And I just hope that the organization itself focuses on doing their job rather than worries about what the changes mean.
MARTIN: What do you think she did well? - because she's gotten an awful lot of criticism, as you well know, for implementing the president's very controversial immigration policies, including separating children from families.
CARD: Well - and first of all, I think it's - it's an outrageous policy. But I also don't think there's a problem that - it's not easy to understand or to solve. And President Obama had a tough time dealing with this, and he had - didn't have anywhere near the magnitude of the problem that President Trump has.
So this is not an easy problem to address. And I hope cool, calm reflection on what is happening and what needs to be done will take place all across the aisle - Republicans, Democrats; in the executive branch and in the legislative branch - because this is a real challenge to be met. And I don't know that there are good answers. I think there - some problems are so great that there may be no good policy and answers. They may be just less bad policy answers.
MARTIN: President Trump has suggested he's making these changes at the Department of Homeland Security in order to go in an even, quote, ""tougher direction."" If he does bring in someone at DHS who's going to toe an even tougher line on immigration, can they get through the confirmation process right now?
CARD: Well, I think it's going to be very hard to get someone through the confirmation process unscathed, especially because it's an election year but even more significantly because of the nature of the policies that are being debated right now in the homeland security arena and the - the real problem at the (unintelligible) - at the border. There are real challenges at the border. I was just in Texas. And believe me; they - they can see the challenge every day.
MARTIN: Former Bush chief of staff Andrew Card. Thank you for your time this morning, sir. We appreciate it.
CARD: Thank you. Have a great day.
MARTIN: Thanks.

Egypt's President Visits White House As He Seeks Term-Limit Exception,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314484/egypts-president-visits-white-house-as-he-seeks-term-limit-exception?station=KXJZ_FM,"Egypt's leader Abdel Fattah el-Sisi sits down with President Trump at the White Tuesday. David Green talks to former State Department official Michele Dunne, who explains what is at stake.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
When, if ever, is it worth it for the United States to embrace an authoritarian leader? We're asking because President Trump is welcoming Egypt's leader, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, at the White House today. And this comes ahead of a crucial referendum that could change Egypt's constitution and allow Sissi to stay in office until the year 2034. Michele Dunne is with us. She served in the State Department for nearly two decades. She now runs the Mideast program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Welcome to the program.
MICHELE DUNNE: Thank you, David.
GREENE: So many consider Egypt's leader, I mean, even more authoritarian than his predecessors in Egypt. What is the argument for embracing him in moments like this?
DUNNE: First of all, Egypt is an important country. It's 100 million people in a very strategic location. And U.S. administrations often focus, in their Middle East policies, on Israel and on Iran. And that's certainly the case with the Trump administration. And they see the Arab countries, like Egypt, mostly as kind of instruments to be used in pursuing larger goals. So Egypt has always been particularly important regarding Israel. Obviously, it's had a peace treaty with Israel now for 40 years. And it's seen as an important player there, so it really can't be ignored.
That still doesn't justify inviting Sissi at a time when Sissi will really use this to show Egyptians he's got the full support of the United States to stay in power indefinitely, to take away the independence of the judiciary and give the military an even bigger role in the politics of the country. All of this will be now written into the constitution.
GREENE: So I know we're obviously only going to see part of this visit - like, the public part of it. Do you know if the Trump administration - even as, you know, we'll see the photo-ops and so forth - are they putting pressure on Sissi to reform, to do more for human rights behind the scenes?
DUNNE: I don't think this administration pursues this in any kind of a systematic way. I believe they do raise individual cases. For example, there are some - more than a dozen Americans held as political prisoners in Egypt right now. I think they pursue those cases. And they seem to have pursued, a bit, the draconian law on non-governmental organizations that Sissi put into place a couple of years ago. In fact, there was an announcement just before Sissi's arrival that they're going to abrogate that law and replace it.
Of course, that's just a promise. We don't know what will happen. But it seemed like they felt they had to say that before Sissi arrived. So there are a couple of specific things that the Trump administration will pursue on that file. I also think, David, that the Trump administration overestimates how much Sissi is going to be able to do for them on things like the Arab-Israeli peace process.
GREENE: Well, can you help me understand Sissi a bit better? I mean, you hear about complaints from human rights groups about his record all the time. But the Trump administration also has sort of portrayed him as a friend of women's rights, as an advocate for religious minorities, like Christians in his country. Are some of those characterizations fair?
DUNNE: Sissi does a really good job of talking the talk on issues like that. He says things. He makes public gestures like visiting a Christian cathedral on Christmas and things like that. So he does things like that in the public domain. But then when you look at his record - I mean, he's been in power for more than five years now. In terms of any changes in law, in government policies or practices, there's still a great deal of discrimination against Christians. Women's rights really haven't improved much. So he really hasn't done that much on those issues.
GREENE: Michele Dunne runs the Mideast program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Thanks a lot.
DUNNE: Thank you, David.

Iowa College Students Assess Democratic Presidential Primary Candidates,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314449/iowa-college-students-assess-democratic-presidential-primary-candidates?station=KXJZ_FM,"It's still very early in the Democratic presidential primary process. Young Democrats in Iowa tell us what they want in their 2020 presidential candidate. The conversation yielded some surprises.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
It's still very early in the Democratic presidential primary process; some likely candidates haven't even announced their running yet. But voters in states like Iowa that have early primaries and caucuses have already gotten an up-close look at a lot of the candidates who are in the race. NPR's Tamara Keith sat down with a group of students at The University of Iowa to get a sense of what issues matter most to them and which candidates are making a good impression.
TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: In the state that will make the first cut in the very large, historically diverse Democratic field, the nine students I met with take their responsibility seriously.
ALLISON MEYER: Hi, I'm Allison Meyer.
DANIELLE BEAVERS: Hi, I'm Danielle Beavers.
LAURYN SCHNACK: I'm Lauryn Schnack.
JENNA NELSON: Jenna Nelson.
ELLA DANIELS: I'm Ella Daniels.
GRACIE MAHONEY: Gracie Mahoney.
ANNA VAN HEUKELOM: I'm Anna Van Heukelom.
SARAH SCHOTT: My name is Sarah Schott.
JOHNNY MOLONEY: I'm Johnny Moloney.
KEITH: They range in age from 18 to 22, and all of them plan to caucus for Democrats next winter. Because they're in Iowa City, candidates come through all the time, says Daniels.
DANIELS: I didn't grow up in a super political environment, and then so coming here, with all the candidates that come through Iowa City, it's a lot of opportunity. It's really cool to see.
KEITH: Though Schnack says they can get jaded about all the attention.
SCHNACK: And when we see, oh, a candidate's coming; oh, but I am slightly busy that day, so I'll just wait because they'll be back.
KEITH: Having a few selfies with candidates on your cellphone is the norm for this group. Like many Democrats, President Trump is on their minds. In particular, Moloney says...
MOLONEY: The most important quality is just someone who's going to be able to beat Donald Trump (laughter).
KEITH: But what does that mean? Moloney suggests it needs to be someone who can stand up to Trump in debates. Meyer offers this.
MEYER: I'd say, honestly, the quality I'm looking for most is authenticity.
KEITH: Schott says she wants someone who represents her generation.
SCHOTT: I think that Donald Trump tapped into a lot of, like, old-people fear, and that was, like, a big base of his campaign and how he won. And I think that our generation is the generation that's going to be able to overcome that and work past fear as, like, a nation.
KEITH: They have a lot of ideas about who they want - someone who cares passionately about income inequality, someone who's in it for the greater good. Beavers is looking for someone who contrasts with President Trump's narrow focus on his base.
BEAVERS: When you are representing the entirety of the United States, which is supposed to be an open place for people of all different backgrounds, I think that you need to be super respectful. So I am looking for that in a candidate. So looking for women candidates or minorities is important to me, too.
KEITH: Or maybe this, says Nelson.
NELSON: I am kind of also looking for a candidate that will have qualities that can also be attractive to people on, like, the more moderate or right sides of the spectrum because, ultimately, you have to get the votes to win.
KEITH: Five of the nine say they donated to Bernie Sanders in 2016, just a few dollars, in a couple of cases, to get a sticker. But this time is different. Even though Sanders is near the top in most polls, only one of these young Iowans says she might caucus for him. Mahoney says last time, Sanders was the best of an uninspiring field.
MAHONEY: In 2016, it was really more of a function of - I supported him over Hillary - and who was the guy from Maryland? Like, yeah.
KEITH: Martin O'Malley.
MAHONEY: Martin O'Malley. Yeah, like, when that was my choice, yeah, sure, I supported Bernie, but this year it's different.
KEITH: But this time, Schott says there are a lot of other options, and she worries Sanders, who she was a fan of four years ago, is just going to rob support from candidates who she thinks have a better chance of winning.
SCHOTT: I just don't think that this is his campaign. All the candidates have very similar values but I think can go a lot farther with them than he can.
KEITH: As for the issues, the environment and climate change are high on the list; mass incarceration, LGBT rights and gun control rank, too. So who do they like? Van Heukelom is exploring a summer internship with Cory Booker.
VAN HEUKELOM: I went and saw him speak. He's really personable, and I think that he's really passionate, and he knows what he cares about.
KEITH: Mahoney followed Beto O'Rourke's Senate campaign.
MAHONEY: When he was campaigning for senator, he went to 252 counties in Texas. That's, like, a big deal, and he did it twice. He might be a little young, but he's in the spirit of compromise, and I really appreciate that.
KEITH: As our conversation goes on, it becomes clear the women candidates are barely getting a mention, even though there are half a dozen in the race. Moloney says he's following with interest Pete Buttigieg, the openly gay mayor of South Bend, Ind.
MOLONEY: He's been pretty good. He's - I forget what he said for his CNN town hall. It was like, I have more governing experience than the vice president, I have more military experience than anybody in Congress, and I have - there's another thing he said; I don't remember. And also that he's not super old, which is good.
KEITH: The debates are still months away, but I had to ask.
If you were caucusing today, who would you caucus for?
BEAVERS: Harris.
MEYER: Beto.
NELSON: Bernie.
SCHNACK: Yang.
MOLONEY: Buttigieg.
VAN HEUKELOM: Cory Booker.
SCHOTT: Beto.
DANIELS: Beto.
MAHONEY: Beto.
KEITH: One each for Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Andrew Yang, Cory Booker and Pete Buttigieg, and four for the former congressman from Texas, Beto O'Rourke. Though none of these voters say they're fully locked in yet.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:
The United States has blacklisted Iran's elite military branch, the Revolutionary Guard Corps, designating it a terrorist organization. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the announcement yesterday.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MIKE POMPEO: For 40 years, the Islamic republic's Revolutionary Guard Corps has actively engaged in terrorism and created, supported and directed other terrorist groups. The IRGC masquerades as a legitimate military organization, but none of us should be fooled.
GREENE: This new designation freezes out Iran's most powerful military force, limiting its access to the international arena. This also means new sanctions against Iran. We have one of the officials behind this policy with us. Brian Hook is the U.S. representative for Iran and works alongside Secretary Pompeo at the State Department.
Brian Hook, welcome back to the program.
BRIAN HOOK: Good morning, David.
GREENE: So this, as I understand, is the very first time the United States has named an element of a foreign government as a terrorist entity. I mean, this is something previous administrations have considered but not done. What is the evidence you can bring us that the Revolutionary Guard belongs right there, alongside groups like ISIS and al-Qaida?
HOOK: This is an organization that has been part of the Iranian regime. And it uses terrorism as a tool of statecraft. And it's been doing this for 40 years. That's what makes it fundamentally different from any other government. When you look at its history, going back even to 1983, they were behind the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut. They were behind the U.S. Embassy bombing annex and Khobar Towers in 1996. The IRGC is often the organization that's behind the wrongful detentions of U.S. citizens, dual nationals. They also bombed the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aries in 1992 and the Jewish center in Buenos Aries in '94.
That's just a fraction of what they've been doing, and so we thought that they met the statutory definition of a foreign terrorist organization.
GREENE: Can I just drill down on one thing you said, I mean, that the Revolutionary Guard can be responsible for holding Americans. Has - haven't U.S. diplomats had to negotiate with the Revolutionary Guard in the past to free Americans? And would that still be possible now if you can face criminal charges for dealing with them?
HOOK: Iran, the regime, since the time it took American diplomats hostage in 1979, has been using human beings as pawns in a political chess game. And so we think that's just an element of its foreign policy that we really can't try to strike deals with. It's something that we - they need to stop doing, and it's not just to the United States that it does it. It also does it to the nations all over the world. And so we...
GREENE: But can you still negotiate with them? Can that still happen in moments when it's necessary?
HOOK: Yes, it can. Doing this designation will not impede our diplomacy in any way. In the past, we've designated the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas - a range of organizations - and that has not impeded our diplomacy.
GREENE: So I want to talk about the implications of this or the possible implications. In response, Iran has now labeled the U.S. Central Command a terrorist organization. And the commander of the Revolutionary Guard Corps warned that he can basically now target the U.S. military the same way that they target groups like ISIS. Are U.S. troops at greater risk now?
HOOK: We don't believe so. Iranian aggression to the United States is a virtual constant feature of the - of Iran's foreign policy. If we apply pressure, they could try to make a display of strength. There's always that risk. But in the past, when we've eased up on pressure, as we did during the Iran nuclear deal, the IRGC took U.S. sailors hostage and humiliated them on camera. What we believe ultimately endangers American troops is an IRGC that operates with impunity and never gets deterred in the region. And we think this decision helps to build deterrents against the Revolutionary Guard's aggression against troops and our partners and allies in the region.
GREENE: I want to ask you about the timing of this. The response from Israel was quick and, I should say, pretty jubilant. I mean, Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is fighting for re-election in a very close race. Israelis are going to the polls today. He wrote on Twitter in Hebrew that President Trump was, quote, ""answering another of my important requests."" Is that what's happening here?
HOOK: The United States makes its national security decisions in the interests of Americans. We don't base it around elections or anything else. There are a number of nations that we think will benefit from designating the Revolutionary Guard. Israel is one of them. But I think many of our Sunni Arab partners in the region support this. We know that so many of our allies around the world are frustrated by the instability and the violence in the Middle East. And if we want to promote peace and stability in the Middle East, that can't be done without weakening the Revolutionary Guard Corps.
GREENE: I mean, we should say Iranians certainly see a connection with the Israeli election. I mean, Iran's foreign minister called this an election eve gift to Netanyahu. Even if the United States makes a decision based on national security, is this timing - is the timing of this announcement helpful to Benjamin Netanyahu?
HOOK: All I can say is that we make our national security decisions. This has been a process that's been in the works for many months. This was the earliest possible date that we could do it, at the conclusion of our interagency process.
GREENE: Brian Hook is a top State Department policy adviser on Iran, speaking to us about the decision to label Iran's Revolutionary Guard a terrorist organization.
Thank you so much for your time.
HOOK: Thank you.

14 People Who Pleaded Guilty Face Prison Time In College Admissions Case,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314428/14-people-who-pleaded-guilty-face-prison-time-in-college-admissions-case?station=KXJZ_FM,"Prosecutors are pushing for jail time for the 13 parents and one coach who have said they will plead guilty to using bribery and other forms of fraud as part of the college admissions scandal.
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
So the actress Felicity Huffman, most famous for her role on ""Desperate Housewives,"" is among a group of 13 wealthy parents who have agreed to plead guilty to charges of fraud in the college admissions scandal. Prosecutors are pushing for prison time for what court filings call a nationwide conspiracy that involve cheating on college entrance exams and also falsifying athletic achievements to get students into elite universities. Now those parents and the athletic coach who aided their supposed fraud could potentially face jail time. NPR's Elissa Nadworny covers education. She joins us this morning. Hi, Elissa.
ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.
GREENE: So what exactly does this mean for these parents who are pleading guilty here?
NADWORNY: Right. So more than a dozen parents and one college coach have agreed to plead guilty. They were charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in connection with the scheme. So according to prosecutors, those charges can carry a punishment of up to 20 years.
GREENE: Wow.
NADWORNY: But if parents cooperate with prosecutors, they're likely to get a much lighter sentence. Felicity Huffman's plea agreement, prosecutors recommended a prison sentence of, quote, ""the low end of the sentencing range."" In other cases, they recommend 12 to 18 months behind bars.
GREENE: OK. But she could still be serving, like, a year in prison, potentially. I mean, is she saying anything about this yet?
NADWORNY: So she released a statement with an apology, saying she was, quote, ""ashamed,"" and has, quote, ""deep regret"" over what she's done. She also says her daughter knew nothing about her actions, and she apologized to students who, quote, ""work hard every day to get into college.""
GREENE: So prosecutors talked about - I mean, they've charged 50 people here. I mean, this is $25 million scam, they said. What about everyone else?
NADWORNY: Yeah. So we're still kind of waiting to see. You know, there are some folks who appear to be fighting the charges, like Lori Loughlin, the actress best known for ""Full House."" It's pretty amazing to kind of see the attention that this story has captured. So I mean, I've just been kind of rapt as an education reporter.
GREENE: I'm sure.
NADWORNY: (Laughter).
GREENE: I mean, do you think it's deserved, that kind of attention? Like, does this feel like something momentous that could really - I mean, it's definitely brought up a big conversation about class and about the idea of college, which in our country, we want to believe is, like, a fair process. Right?
NADWORNY: Yeah. Exactly. It's interesting because, you know, these schools, these highly selective schools, they just serve about 1 percent of all college students. So it's been really interesting to see kind of how this is such a small group of students, but it's really captured our kind of frustration with wealth and privilege and what that means in terms of college access.
GREENE: As we started reporting on this, I mean, everyone in higher education seemed to say, like, yeah, it's a problem - we all knew that it was a problem for so long, and nothing has really changed the system, changed the culture. Could this be the moment? Or is there a feeling in the field of education that, I mean, it's just so entrenched that it's going to be very hard to change the system?
NADWORNY: Well, I have seen a lot of conversations about kind of how do we get low-income students to kind of get into college? It's certainly renewed a conversation around legacy admissions, which is the system that gives extra points to students whose parents or siblings already attended a specific school. And there's also a renewed interest in schools that don't require the college entrance exams like the ACT or the SAT, though the College Board, the company behind the SAT, says using an outside assessment actually makes it harder to pull off fraud.
But even this idea of college as nonprofit status, like, should they have this if they're not really an open-access organization or serving the greater public? So these are kind of the things that I'm keeping an eye on, and we'll see what happens.
GREENE: All right. Quite a story to follow. NPR education reporter Elissa Nadworny. Thanks so much.
NADWORNY: Thanks.

"After The Genocide, Author Witnessed How Rwandans Defined Forgiveness",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314421/after-the-genocide-author-witnessed-how-rwandans-defined-forgiveness?station=KXJZ_FM,"How have Rwandans navigated forgiveness in the 25 years since the genocide in that country? Rachel Martin talks to journalist and author Philip Gourevitch, who has been documenting that process.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
It happened 25 years ago - up to 800,000 people in Rwanda killed - mostly from the minority Tutsi community, all of that over the course of just a hundred days. Today the hundreds of thousands of people who carried out those killings live among their victims. Journalist and author Philip Gourevitch has witnessed the unique way Rwandans have defined and navigated forgiveness after the massacre. And for the majority of Rwandans who are too young to remember what happened, he says the genocide often shaped their lives in similar ways.
PHILIP GOUREVITCH: It's obviously a huge shadow over them. But the difference of not having direct memory changes the relationships. But you do feel that the weight of it on the young is quite differently distributed, that they feel it differently. But obviously, if you grew up an orphan or a child of rape or in a family where, instead of 50 people, there are five and they are deeply traumatized and impoverished - or you grew up in a family where you were carrying food to your father every day in prison and being looked at in the community as that boy, the child of a killer.
And then you both wind up, those two kids, let's say, in college from the same place. They recognize each other, and they find a way of relating to each other. That's pretty remarkable. And it happens on a regular basis. It's something that people talk about with a kind of sense of amazement at the same time as they talk about it with a shrug, as if it were normal. And I'm not sure which one gets them through better.
MARTIN: In order to navigate the aftermath of the genocide, the Rwandan government set up this nationwide reconciliation process. Can you describe how it worked?
GOUREVITCH: Essentially, there was a big question. Do you have trials? Do you hold everybody accountable or attempt to? Or do you essentially say - we're going to say this was the political order, and we're going to try and hold the people at the top accountable? And the rest, as we change the political system, we're not afraid of them.
And in Rwanda, there was the feeling - but no. There was a lot of agency in the local level. And the experience of the genocide was extremely localized. People were killed by neighbors. It was intimate. They knew each other. And to simply ignore that wouldn't work.
So they set up a system of community courts - without lawyers - to sort of repurpose a system that really had only been used for small claims mitigation in traditional Rwanda, called gacaca, and have open, communal - what we might call a town hall - format for trials. And then the idea was to hold people accountable and have a system of punishment. And this system banked very heavily on encouraging confession and rewarding it. But the confessions were supposed to be also verified by the community.
MARTIN: And what was the specific role of the victims or their surviving family members? They had to be there. And then, after verifying a certain account, were they expected to then make a public state of forgiveness or reconciliation?
GOUREVITCH: They weren't necessarily in a position to verify. Many of them knew that so-and-so was always said to have killed their family members. But they weren't direct witnesses because, by virtue of their survival, that usually meant that they were either somewhere else or well-hidden or had escaped or...
MARTIN: Not present, yeah.
GOUREVITCH: Yes. So in many cases, it's the testimony of other members of the community that would be specific and then these confessions, which were very, very graphic. And so the motto of the gacaca courts was, truth heals.
But as we know, truth can also be really traumatizing and, in this case, retraumatizing because, to go from the idea that - that person is the killer of my family, and I want him to answer for it - to then hearing him describe in quite gory detail and often quite coarsely how he'd gone about killing, let's say, your family members and, at that moment, be asked to accept and forgive him, that's an awful lot to ask at that moment.
But what's interesting to me, too, is - what does forgiveness mean? I mean, to some extent, when I went and I heard the word forgiveness, I thought it sort of meant you'd restore whatever the relationship was before.
MARTIN: Yeah.
GOUREVITCH: And they would say, no, that involves trust. That's a whole different thing. Forgiveness doesn't require trust. Forgiveness simply means letting go of the idea of getting even, forgoing the idea of revenge. Right? Now, even that's a big ask. But it means accepting coexistence.
MARTIN: Right. I mean, is there any way to determine if the gacaca reconciliation process was the reason why Rwanda was able to move forward? I mean, it was an exceptional, nationwide reckoning.
GOUREVITCH: There's never been as comprehensive a reckoning with such communal violence or mass atrocity. I think Rwandans at the time found it very tough. It created a lot of tension because it was an ongoing, multi-year confrontation with the past in the communities. I think in the aftermath of it, you find that the genocide is no longer an unaddressed, looming problem that, in a sense, is both behind and before them - that it was something that had to be done in order for whatever one might call reconciliation.
And one of the things that I often heard people say - you'd ask them how it was going. And they'd start to say, well, for me, it's really very tough still. You know, I'm not at all at ease with this or that or the other thing. But then they would say, even as they complained about much of what was being asked of them by having to live together, they would say - but you know, in general - in society, things are much better. I started to hear this, especially towards the end of gacaca and in the years since.
I took that as a very interesting thing - saying, well, you know, my pains are not gone; my struggles are not over. But the general balance is good. And that means that they felt like something had been gained even if they themselves were not fully at peace - in other words, that the societal peace had been served maybe better than any given individual peace.
MARTIN: It's a starting point.
GOUREVITCH: Yeah. Yeah, I think so - because one wants not to have to accept certain things. It feels like something should be unforgivable. And yet, confronted with that alternative, you can end up in a situation where, you know, just the urge for punitive resolution makes it impossible to continue.
MARTIN: Philip Gourevitch, thank you so much for talking with us.
GOUREVITCH: Thank you.

"News Brief: DHS Secretary, Iran's Revolutionary Guard, College Scandal",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711314414/news-brief-dhs-secretary-irans-revolutionary-guard-college-scandal?station=KXJZ_FM,"Replacing Cabinet secretaries has become routine. U.S. labels Iran's Revolutionary Guard a foreign terrorist group. In Boston, 14 people agreed to plead guilty in the college admission scandal.
RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:
Temporary employees fill a very specific need at a specific time, and they can give employers flexibility. But what happens when those temp workers are working at the highest levels of the U.S. government?
DAVID GREENE, HOST:
Well, back in January, President Trump acknowledged the number of people serving in his administration who are working in an acting capacity.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I sort of like acting - gives me more flexibility. Do you understand that? I like acting.
GREENE: While some of those roles have since been permanently filled - President Trump's picks for attorney general and EPA administrator were both confirmed by the U.S. Senate - but other vacancies now exist. And the Department of Homeland Security is particularly impacted. Tomorrow is Kirstjen Nielsen's last day on the job as secretary. Two other prominent agencies within the DHS, FEMA and ICE, still don't have Senate-approved leaders. So how long is it going to stay this way?
MARTIN: NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell is with us this morning. Hey, Kelsey.
KELSEY SNELL, BYLINE: Hey, there.
MARTIN: So we know that the head of Customs and Border Protection has been tapped by President Trump to replace Nielsen - or to step up in an acting capacity as the head of DHS. Any sense, at this point, who would be nominated to take the job permanently?
SNELL: No. And you know, that lack of, you know, certainty is creating a lot of turmoil in terms of when I talk to folks on Capitol Hill about what they expect to happen. The entire nominations process is actually very tense right now.
Last week, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved to make it easier to approve lower court and subcabinet appointees. And while that's speeding things along for some of these, like, lower court judges, it has everyone on high alert. And Democrats are going after the administration right now for constant churn in personnel. I think that this is causing a lot of tension among senators. And I think that's really, really well captured by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on the Senate floor.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
CHUCK SCHUMER: And what he's done by these constant firings and constant change of policy is simply created chaos at the border. Nobody knows what the policy will be from day to day and week to week and month to month.
SNELL: Yeah. So he's talking about just the feeling among members of Congress that they don't know what to expect from this administration. And that's going to make it really hard for President Trump to nominate somebody who is going to kind of sail through the process, which is what any administration would like - not to mention the fact that an immigration hard-liner would have an even more difficult task since Republicans and Democrats have been very skeptical of some of this president's policies.
MARTIN: Right. So let's talk about the specific vacancies. I mean...
SNELL: Yeah.
MARTIN: ...We mentioned a couple there in the intro. But there - I mean, the president has a lot of roles to fill. We should also just note that he fired the head of the Secret Service, which is under the Department of Homeland Security. He did that this week, too.
SNELL: Right. So there are acting secretaries at the Department of Defense, Interior, Office of Management and Budget, the Small Business Administration. And this is a lot of people in this Cabinet who are not permanent. And that doesn't even cover the judicial nominees and subcabinet appointments that are not filled.
Now, the president may favor this style, but it really does make lawmakers anxious. It's hard to negotiate with an administration and know who's calling the shots and make policy plans with temps.
MARTIN: Right. But it doesn't seem like President Trump - his personality - I mean, he's not someone who might care about making Congress anxious, shall we say? Do we have any sense of a timeline as to when any of these jobs would get filled?
SNELL: No, but there's a reason to move fast. Things are contentious now, but they won't get any better as the election draws near. So Republicans will want to get things moving pretty quickly.
MARTIN: NPR congressional correspondent Kelsey Snell. Thanks, Kelsey.
SNELL: Thanks.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
MARTIN: The Trump administration has been fixated on the threat it sees from Iran. And now the administration has made an unprecedented move.
GREENE: Yesterday, the U.S. designated an element of Iran's security forces as a terrorist organization. We're talking about Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This is Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
MIKE POMPEO: For 40 years, the Islamic Republic's Revolutionary Guard Corps has actively engaged in terrorism and created, supported and directed other terrorist groups. The IRGC masquerades as a legitimate military organization, but none of us should be fooled.
GREENE: OK. So this is part of Iran's government, the Revolutionary Guard, that will now be joining ISIS and Boko Haram on the terrorist list. It means that anyone who deals with them could run the risk of facing criminal charges. Among the many questions here is how the government in Tehran is going to be responding to this.
MARTIN: We've got NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul, who's been following this and can give us more context. Hey, Peter.
PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.
MARTIN: So David just said this - that the designation means anyone who deals with the Revolutionary Guard could run the risk of criminal charges. What else does the designation mean in practice?
KENYON: Well, what it means in practice - even on that trade question - is dependent on how aggressively the administration really wants to enforce this. As you mentioned, it could lead Washington to act against any company doing business with the Revolutionary Guard. And that could get complicated because the Guards have ties to the Iranian economy that aren't always apparent from the outside - or even necessarily from the inside sometimes.
So this could be another reason for companies to be cautious about trade with Iran. This is the first time it's happened, a foreign government element being declared a terrorist organization. It's due to happen on April 15. And Secretary of State Pompeo. Listed a string of attacks as justification. He talked about Khobar Towers in 1996, 19 U.S. servicemen killed in Saudi Arabia; a failed attempt in 2011 to kill the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. - Pompeo said ample justification for this decision.
MARTIN: Although those are examples that were years ago. Did they give any...
KENYON: Yes, they were.
MARTIN: ...Explanation for why they are making this designation in this moment?
KENYON: As for now, Iranians have some ideas about that. The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, called it another election eve gift to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli leader who's standing for re-election.
This is probably the most high-profile move from the Trump administration since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear agreement - reimposed sanctions on Iran, including on its oil and gas sector. The Europeans have tried to set up a workaround to help companies continue trading with Iran, but that's not really expected to have a major impact. And of course, even before this designation for the Revolutionary Guard Corps, there were already hundreds and hundreds of Iranian entities and individuals under U.S. sanctions.
MARTIN: So what are the broader implications of this? I mean, we're already seeing Iran kind of engage in a tit for tat here. Right?
KENYON: Yes. That's exactly right. As promised, Tehran responded with more or less identical steps against the U.S. The Iranian National Security Council dubbed the U.S. a sponsor of terrorism. It's designating CENTCOM - that's the U.S. Central Command - and its forces as terrorists.
In Iran, the U.S. move does appear to be pushing Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian president, closer to the Revolutionary Guards, who are not his natural allies. Rouhani is hailing the Revolutionary Guards as defenders of Iran. The speaker of the Parliament's quoted as calling the U.S. move the ""climax of stupidity and arrogance."" Lawmakers have been chanting death to America. Now the question is - will this escalate beyond a war of words? No sign of that so far, but we'll have to see.
MARTIN: NPR's Peter Kenyon for us this morning. Peter, thanks. We appreciate it.
KENYON: Thanks, Rachel.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
MARTIN: All right. The Department of Justice has confirmed that 13 parents, including the actress Felicity Huffman, have now agreed to plead guilty in the college admissions scandal.
GREENE: Yeah. Let's remember that big story that broke last month. Federal prosecutors revealed a multimillion-dollar scam that enabled wealthy families to allegedly bribe their way into elite colleges by having test scores and athletic achievements falsified. Fifty people were charged at the time. This is U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling unveiling the details on March 12.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
ANDREW LELLING: This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions through the steady application of wealth combined with fraud. There can be no separate college admissions system for the wealthy. And I'll add, there will not be a separate criminal justice system either.
MARTIN: We're joined in the studio by NPR's Elissa Nadworny, who's been following all this. Thanks for coming in, Elissa.
ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: Good morning.
MARTIN: So let's start with the news. Exactly what are these 13 parents - what are they agreeing to plead guilty to?
NADWORNY: Yeah. So more than a dozen parents and one college coach have agreed to plead guilty. And they were charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud in connection with this scheme.
So according to prosecutors, those charges carry a punishment of up to 20 years. But if parents cooperate with prosecutors, they're likely to get a much lighter sentence. Felicity Huffman, the actress best-known for the TV show ""Desperate Housewives""...
MARTIN: Yeah.
NADWORNY: ...Her plea agreement - in her plea agreement, prosecutors recommended a prison sentence at, quote, ""the low end"" of the sentencing range. In other cases, they've recommended 12 to 18 months behind bars.
MARTIN: But that means that people involved in this, including Felicity Huffman, could see jail time.
NADWORNY: Yeah, absolutely. And yeah, we've actually heard from Huffman. She released a statement with an apology saying she was, quote, ""ashamed and has deep regrets over what she's done."" And she also says her daughter knew nothing about her actions. And she apologized to students who, quote, ""work hard every day to get into college""
MARTIN: I mean, yeah, that's what this has been all about - right? - this huge awakening, really, about how privilege and class play into something that everybody aspires to get, like a college education in America.
NADWORNY: Yeah, absolutely.
MARTIN: I mean, how have you watched this all unfold - this reckoning, really, that's happening?
NADWORNY: Yeah. I mean, this has really tapped into a lot of frustrations over wealth and privilege and then how that mixes with this idea of higher education being accessible. So yeah. Exactly as you said, we love this idea that if we work hard, if we have talent, we're able to get into these schools. And this story has kind of shown that that's just not true. It's pretty amazing. These schools are almost mythical - you know, Yale, Stanford. Like...
MARTIN: Yeah.
NADWORNY: ...Students dream about getting in these schools. And that's despite the fact that just 1 percent of all college students go to these highly selective schools. So...
MARTIN: Right because there's data that says that for a certain segment of really wealthy, white students in particular - makes a marginal difference in your life. But for certain students who come from less privileged backgrounds, it can really change your whole trajectory.
NADWORNY: Absolutely. And it's been kind of a re-examination of then, like, if these schools are serving those wealthy students, like, you know - it's really hard for low-income students to actually get that path.
MARTIN: Right. So as this unfolds, where are you going to be looking to determine what changes are actually going to occur here - if any - like, on a systemic level?
NADWORNY: Yeah. Well, I think one thing we're watching is kind of what the sentences will be - if these folks will actually get prison time. I think, in the kind of larger conversation, we're looking at renewed conversations about equity and college access and kind of where all this fits. SATs - like, should colleges require tests like this? Those are some of...
MARTIN: Because this was at the center of the fraud...
NADWORNY: The fraud, exactly.
MARTIN: ...Like, fudging scores on standardized tests.
NADWORNY: Exactly.
MARTIN: All right. NPR's Elissa Nadworny for us this morning. Thank you so much. We appreciate it.
NADWORNY: Yep, you bet.

""Sometimes it's nice to put on TV and just escape,"" says Meghann Fahy, who plays Sutton. But the stars say what's special about The Bold Type is that it provides a space to tackle issues that affect women — as well as an escape.
""We try to have the happy medium of making it aspirational for people to watch, but also making sure that we do put in failures, and we do put in mess for these characters because that is what's real,"" Stevens says.
They're portraying young women living in 2019 America — but nobody ""wants to sit in the darkness of what that really looks like,"" she jokes.
Interview Highlights On the real Cosmopolitan
Aisha Dee: I'd go to the library with my mom all the time and like sneak into the magazine section because I knew she wouldn't approve of me reading it. ... I think Cosmo told me a lot about about life, and sex, and love.
Meghann Fahy: It's really a women's health magazine. Sometimes I think it gets a bad rap ... When we were young ... not being able to read it, or feeling like we had to hide it, was ... an oppression of, like, sexuality and sensuality and, like, what it is to be a woman and a girl who's learning about her body. ... On our show we sort of talk about how the magazine is so much more than [what people give it credit for].
On people comparing their show to Sex and the City
Katie Stevens: What's more cool to me is you see all those BuzzFeed quizzes that are like, ""Are you Miranda or a Carrie, or..."" you know. And now there are quizzes that are like, ""Are you a Sutton, Kat, or a Jane."" I think that ours is obviously like a refreshed, newer version. ... I could watch all of my favorite shows from that era and find problematic things about them. But I think ultimately what you take away from Sex and the City in terms of the women's friendships and them navigating their lives and their aspirations ... I think that you get the same feeling when you watch The Bold Type.
It's Been a Minute with Sam Sanders 'The Bold Type': Aisha Dee And Amanda Lasher On where their characters are headed in Season 3
Stevens: For Jane, when we left her at Season 2 she had some big decisions to make in terms of who she wanted to be with, and kind of navigating her health stuff in terms of freezing her eggs, and if she was going to do that or not. So in Season 3 she's finally made those decisions. ... I've learned so much from playing this storyline ... about women's health, and we touch a little bit more on that in Season 3.
Fahy: For Sutton in Season 3 I think she's really sort of grappling with what it is that she actually wants to be doing. I think she finally got into the fashion department and ... she doesn't want to be an assistant forever. So she's kind of trying to decide what it is that she does want to work towards. I think that's exciting we haven't actually seen her do that yet.
Dee: We get to see this woman, [Kat], who is described as being so strong and confident, but often we see characters like that and we don't feel the need to ask the question, ""Why they need to be so strong and why they need to be so confident?"" You get to see Kat be vulnerable and also kind of discover parts of herself in her 20s. ...
I love getting to see this woman who is an adult ... or is trying to be an adult — and she's still discovering who she is and still finding herself, and finding confidence, and falling in love for the first time, and falling out of love for the first time. It's been really a very special story to get to tell, and it's inspired me a lot.

Jihad Khaled is desperate for help getting Egypt to release her jailed mother, Hoda Abdelmoniem, a human rights lawyer.

Through the hallways of Capitol Hill, Jihad Khaled, 26, was desperately bouncing from one meeting to another, talking to Congress members as well as human rights activists and major news outlets. She hoped her efforts would help get her mother, Hoda Abdelmoniem, 60, released from an Egyptian prison.
""Death is much better than imprisonment. Death is fate. But when you're a political prisoner — that's just injustice,"" Khaled said in a recent interview with NPR.
Khaled and her husband have met with many U.S. legislators and human rights activists in Washington in hopes of getting help with her mother's release.

Before dawn on Nov. 1, 2018, Khaled was in Doha, Qatar, when she woke up frantically to a phone ringing. She picked up to hear her sister's voice panting. Their mother, Abdelmoniem, a prominent human rights lawyer and former member of Egypt's National Council for Human Rights, had been detained and taken to an undisclosed location by Egyptian state security forces after they raided her flat in Cairo.
""I felt numb. Frozen. I didn't realize what was happening, but I knew it wasn't something that can be solved in two days,"" Khaled said.
Twenty days after her detention, Abdelmoniem appeared in court for the first time. She told her family that she was being detained in an undisclosed location. Her last appearance in court was on March 26. During the time between court hearings, none of her relatives knew her whereabouts.
Khaled said the family has now learned that Abdelmoniem is being held at al-Qanater women's prison in Egypt's Monufia province, north of Cairo.

Egyptian prosecutors accuse Abdelmoniem of vague charges under the country's broad anti-terrorism laws, which human rights groups say the state frequently uses to target activists and journalists. Her family believes that the unspecific charges are meant to leave them defenseless.
The 60-year-old's health is getting worse. She has a blood clot in her leg and high blood pressure, causing her to lose balance and requiring medical care that she received in prison only recently, according to her husband and lawyer, Khaled Badawy.
The family's lobbying trips came before this week's return visit to Washington , D.C., by Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi.
Rights groups say Abdelmoniem's case is one of the latest examples of a sweeping crackdown by the Sissi government against a broad range of citizens.
The Egyptian Embassy in Washington did not respond to NPR's request for comment on the case.
But in a January interview with CBS' 60 Minutes , Sissi said:
""We don't have political prisoners nor prisoners of opinion. We are trying to stand against extremists who impose their ideology on the people. Now they are subject to a fair trial. And it may take years, but we have to follow the law."" Enlarge this image

Eighteen other human rights lawyers and activists were arrested in similar raids in Egypt the same day as Abdelmoniem, according to Hussein Baoumi, an Egypt researcher with Amnesty International. Eight women and 11 men are believed to have been forcibly disappeared during this wave of targeted arrests.
Baoumi said Egypt's government has systematically enforced disappearances not only of activists and journalists but also of a wide array of citizens suspected of any form of dissent.
Amnesty counted 1,700 cases of enforced disappearance between 2013 and early 2016. Baoumi described the estimate as ""very conservative"" because the organization follows strict procedures for documenting incidents and those procedures take a lot of time and effort and are difficult to apply to all cases.

Elshamy, an Al Jazeera journalist, was detained while reporting on a sit-in in Cairo. ""We bonded over surviving hardships together.

This is not the first time Khaled and her family have been desperate to save a loved one from Egypt's prisons. In August 2013, she was newly married when her husband, Al Jazeera journalist Abdullah Elshamy, now 30, was detained by Egyptian police while covering a sit-in in Cairo's Rabaa al-Adawiya Square, when Egyptian security forces violently suppressed several protests in the city, killing hundreds and injuring thousands.
Elshamy was later sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison by an Egyptian court. While in prison, he went on a hunger strike that lasted five months and that ended in his release in June 2014. Enlarge this image

Khaled remembers those days vividly as she recalls her mother's extensive support during her husband's detention.
""She was my only support system. She was the reason I remained strong and resilient during Abdullah's imprisonment,"" Khaled said. ""I thought it was the most horrible thing that could happen to someone, but now I know it's not like having your mom in prison. I feel broken."" Enlarge this image

Khaled also recalled when she was 6 and her father was sentenced to three years in prison after a military trial — an experience that she describes as a traumatic event that affected her entire family. ""That was a time when mama brought us all together and was the main support for baba ,"" she said.
For her father, Badawy, his experience in prison was nothing compared with what he is going through now. ""I didn't feel as much vanquish when I was in prison. Now my wife is in jail, and I feel helpless and broken,"" Badawy said.
""I try to remain hopeful and strong and fight for mama's release,"" Khaled says. ""But sometimes all doors seem closed and I lose hope.""

He said it is not just the family that is affected. With Abdelmoniem in prison, she is unable to carry out human rights work for other families whose relatives have been disappeared.
In January, Khaled was desperate for solutions. She decided, along with her husband, to fly from Doha, where they currently live, to Washington to advocate on her mother's behalf.
The U.S. has previously pressed Egypt on prisoners. In 2017, President Trump said he negotiated with Egypt's leader for the release of imprisoned Egyptian-American charity worker Aya Hijazi and her Egyptian husband.

That year, the administration denied tens of millions of dollars in aid and military funding to Egypt over the country's human rights violations and its relationship with North Korea. But last year, the U.S. reinstated its military aid to Egypt, and rights activists accused the administration of turning a blind eye on Egypt's human rights violations.
Human Rights Watch estimates that Egyptian prisons have detained at least 60,000 people on political grounds since the 2013 military coup.

Trump's Goal To Get Tougher On Immigration Will Have To Involve The Flores Settlement : NPR,www.npr.org,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711536545/trumps-goal-to-get-tougher-on-immigration-will-have-to-involve-the-flores-settle,"NPR's Ailsa Change talks about challenges to President Trump's desire for a more aggressive stance on immigration with Seth Grossman, former deputy general counsel at DHS in the Obama administration.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
President Trump told reporters at the White House today he does not plan to revive his administration's policy of separating migrant families who cross the U.S. border.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're not looking to do that.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Thank you.
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: You're not looking to bring it back?
TRUMP: But it does make - it brings a lot more people to the border. When you don't do it, it brings a lot more people to the border. We are not looking to do it.
SHAPIRO: But Trump says he does want to get tougher on immigration.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
To do that and still comply with the law, his administration will have to wrestle with a decades-old legal settlement. It's called the Flores settlement, and it dictates how long the government can keep migrant children in detention with or without their families.
SHAPIRO: It says within 20 days, the government has to release the children from detention either to an authorized adult or to a foster-care-type facility. Most immigration proceedings take longer than 20 days, which is why the administration has sought to reconsider the settlement.
CHANG: Now, the Obama administration was faced with a similar challenge during a surge in migration a few years ago. That's when Seth Grossman was deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security. Welcome.
SETH GROSSMAN: Thank you.
CHANG: The administration - the Trump administration's been seeking to modify the settlement. First of all, how would the White House have the authority to modify a court settlement that's been in place for two decades?
GROSSMAN: The administration has that authority because one of the parties to the settlement is the Department of Justice. So the Department of Justice can go to the judge who's in a district court in California who oversees this settlement and ask for modifications. And over the years, various administrations have sought modifications to the settlement. And that's what they have done here and previous administrations have done, as well.
CHANG: Now, does Congress have the power to change these rules - I mean, if they passed a law allowing the detention of families for say, three entire months?
GROSSMAN: So it is possible that Congress could pass legislation that would overturn the Flores settlement. And in fact, there have been bills proposed, at least in the last Congress, that would have done that in various ways. There are still constitutional concerns related to due process and other bases that would still be a basis for challenging this policy. And I think it's very likely, given the challenges that have come to other Trump administration policies, that we would see those challenges immediately. And so I think it's unclear whether, ultimately, such a statute would survive judicial review.
CHANG: I mean, if it is too much of an uphill battle to modify the settlement or if Congress cannot pass a new law, is it even feasible to get immigration proceedings down to fewer than 20 days?
GROSSMAN: It could be possible if they surge the amount of resources to hire a number of new immigration judges if...
CHANG: And asylum officers and ICE attorneys.
GROSSMAN: Exactly. Right. And if they then put these cases at the front of the queue, in terms of pending cases - you know, there's a huge backlog of cases in immigration courts...
CHANG: Exactly.
GROSSMAN: ...Which is often why these cases can take several years. So you would need to rejigger the queue and put them at the front of the queue. There's been various efforts in - at different times to try to do that. None of them have been all that successful. So is it theoretically possible? Yes. Is it in a reality possible? Probably no.
CHANG: So Seth, you were deputy general counsel in Homeland Security during the Obama administration. You wrestled with very similar challenges with the surge in migration a few years ago. Were there options that we haven't discussed yet, options in - whether it be modifying the Flores settlement or outside of that realm that aren't being considered actively right now by the Trump administration that you would suggest?
GROSSMAN: I think the Trump administration has put forth most of the likeliest options there, in terms of trying to seek to modify the settlement. They're seeking regulatory change. They've suggested they're going to speed up the cases. They're suggesting they're seeking congressional change. I mean, I think there are other options that may not align with their vision that could really help, using a greater use of alternatives to detention, such as ankle bracelets or other things to track people without actually detaining them. And then they could undertake efforts that have been undertaken in the Obama administration - to some degree, the Trump administration - and try to work with the countries about the reasons for the surges in people coming across, seeking asylum, dealing with the economic conditions and the violence.
You know, I think these are hard problems that, as you said, the Obama administration struggled with, and there are no easy solutions. I think there are some more humanitarian solutions that could better address the situation facing the people crossing, but may not have the deterrent effect that the Trump administration is clearly looking for.
CHANG: Seth Grossman was deputy general counsel at the Department of Homeland Security under President Obama. He's now at American University. Thank you very much for joining us today.
GROSSMAN: Thanks. It was my pleasure.

How White House Adviser Stephen Miller Has Played A Role In Shaping Immigration Policy,www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711536552/how-white-house-adviser-stephen-miller-has-played-a-role-in-shaping-immigration-,"President Trump's firing of DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen has again put a spotlight on White House aide Stephen Miller and the restrictionist immigration policies he's been pushing.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Now let's take a look at one of the architects of President Trump's immigration policy. White House aide Stephen Miller has stood by the president's side from the very beginning. NPR's Mara Liasson joins us now to discuss Miller's role in implementing Trump's vision on immigration.
Hi, Mara.
MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.
SHAPIRO: Remind us who Stephen Miller is.
LIASSON: Stephen Miller is a youngish aide. He's been with Trump since the beginning of the campaign. He worked for former Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the Senate, and he has been an immigration restrictionist since long before Trump ran. He has a kind of interesting background. He grew up as a conservative contrarian in liberal Santa Monica, Calif. And he became a right-wing media star while he was a student at Duke University.
But then he got an opportunity with Trump, and he is the strongest voice inside the White House on immigration. He really knows his brief. And he's also been one of the most fiercely loyal defenders of Donald Trump on television. And here he is in 2017 talking about the Muslim ban, which is the first big restrictionist immigration fight that the president picked.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
STEPHEN MILLER: Our opponents, the media and the whole world will soon see, as we begin to take further actions, that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned.
LIASSON: So the president's powers are substantial, but they are questioned by other institutions. And one of the reasons that Trump has been so frustrated is that while Kirstjen Nielsen, for instance, didn't push back against his immigration goals, she explained to him on several occasions that what he wanted to do was probably unconstitutional. She was a reality check he didn't want. But now, with the housecleaning at the Department of Homeland Security, Trump will be able to remake the personnel in charge of immigration more in his own image. And Miller will be guiding that.
SHAPIRO: OK. So President Trump is now talking about a tougher immigration policy, something that Miller certainly supports. What do the two of them mean by that? What does the president want?
LIASSON: Well, the president wants some big things that we know about. He wants a wall. He wants to stop the immigration lottery. He wants to stop chain migration. There's been some talk at the White House about creating an immigration czar. The president himself has talked about maybe stopping asylum altogether or closing the border, putting punitive tariffs on Mexico for not stopping immigration. But mostly, he wants to make it harder for asylum-seekers to get in so that he stops this surge at the border.
SHAPIRO: Some of these things would require congressional action. Right?
LIASSON: That's right. But a senior administration official who briefed reporters today argued that just by changing some regulations - if DHS could just, for instance, toughen up the criteria for credible fear, you know, which asylum-seekers have to prove...
SHAPIRO: Right.
LIASSON: ...Giving fewer work permits to people in the asylum process, changing the options that families have for staying together while they're applying for asylum.
The Trump - the White House believes that would make significant changes in the numbers of asylum-seekers. That would be a deterrent even without congressional actions. So the president wants to make regulatory changes that would - could result in families being separated without - as you just heard a few moments ago - without having it be an explicit policy.
One of the things, by the way, that this senior administration official complained about is that the career people at DHS were not mission-aligned - in other words, not committed enough to the president's vision - and that the political appointees they've put in that agency can't seem to work the bureaucracy.
SHAPIRO: And are we just talking about the border here? Or are we talking about the entire immigration system, meaning airports, other ports of entry, immigration as a whole?
LIASSON: Well, I think that they would like to deal with immigration at the whole. But right now they're focused on the border. Don't forget; we've already had a big upsurge in numbers of people crossing illegally. And they are expecting the April numbers to be even worse, maybe over 100,000 illegal apprehensions, which, on the one hand, helps the president make the argument that there's a crisis; on the other hand, it makes it look like he's not succeeding.
SHAPIRO: NPR's Mara Liasson, thanks a lot.
LIASSON: Thank you.

That NBC radio announcer didn't tell the whole story. Anderson's first choice of venue had been denied to her. The Daughters of the American Revolution refused to let her perform at Constitution Hall. The reason - because she was black.
SHAPIRO: Then first lady Eleanor Roosevelt stepped in. She quit the DAR, and others followed. And Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes invited her to sing before the statue of the great emancipator. He also gave opening remarks.

From
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called a public health emergency Tuesday — mandating vaccination for all people within a Brooklyn neighborhood with a spike in measles cases.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Today, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency to fight an outbreak of measles in a Brooklyn neighborhood. The city has been addressing the outbreak for months with education and outreach. Now this emergency declaration means all unvaccinated people in four zip codes where the measles cases are concentrated are required to receive inoculations. Gwynne Hogan of member station WNYC is covering this story and joins us now. Hi, Gwynne.
GWYNNE HOGAN, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.
SHAPIRO: How is this new order going to be enforced?
HOGAN: So within four zip codes of Brooklyn where we've seen almost all of the new measles cases in recent weeks, the city is requiring that all people who aren't vaccinated get the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine right away. If they don't, they could face fines of up to $1,000. But exactly how much enforcement they're going to do is still a little unclear. At the press conference today, Mayor de Blasio said their goal isn't to penalize people. It's to encourage vaccination.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
BILL DE BLASIO: The goal here is to send the message that people need to act immediately to get vaccinated and that vaccination is available readily here in the neighborhood and throughout the city.
HOGAN: And health officials also said that as they investigate cases of measles, unvaccinated people who've been exposed will be asked to get the MMR. And if they don't comply, then they could face fines.
SHAPIRO: This outbreak started last October, so what has changed recently to make this what de Blasio calls a public health emergency?
HOGAN: Well, right. You're right. So this dates back all the way to October. But we have seen a huge spike in the last six weeks or so. The number of measles cases has more than doubled since late February - up to 285. Also the number of hospitalizations has gone way up to 21, with five people in intensive care. And health officials also said today they had gotten reports of measles parties where kids were intentionally being exposed to the virus. And so with - this outbreak has mostly been concentrated within Brooklyn's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. So the Health Department is thinking this spike is also related to the religious holidays, like Purim. And with Passover coming up, more people will be congregating, so more opportunities for this virus to spread.
SHAPIRO: And so how are these communities reacting to the city's announcement that people will now be required to get vaccinated?
HOGAN: Well, outside the press conference today, there was a group of mothers who said they would still refuse to vaccinate their kids regardless of any fines. But these - the mothers that were there said their kids had already gotten the measles and had since recovered. They wouldn't give their full names, but there was another woman who walked by who I talked to - 22-year-old Blimie Klein. She said the people who oppose vaccination in their community are a small fraction.
BLIMIE KLEIN: They're a 1 percent. They're really a 1 percent - 99.9 percent in Williamsburg from Orthodox community is immunized. People are taking it very serious. It's because the mayor is saying it and because this is what our doctors are saying. And we know that we have to follow rules from our doctors.
HOGAN: And I reached out to some other religious leaders in the community, and they also said they supported the city's mandatory vaccination order. But interestingly enough, New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, says he's not so sure about mandating vaccines and wondered if the government had the right to do so.
SHAPIRO: Yeah. What kind of legal precedent is there? Does the government have the right to mandate this?
HOGAN: Well, you know, we've seen in Rockland County has been struggling with the same issue in recent weeks, and they tried to ban unvaccinated kids from public places, but that was legally challenged, and a judge struck that down. But there is a Supreme Court case that public health experts have cited repeatedly, a 1905 Supreme Court case. And in that instance, the court ruled that Massachusetts had a right to uphold its mandatory vaccination order during a smallpox outbreak, much as what New York City is doing here.
SHAPIRO: That's Gwynne Hogan, who covers health for member station WNYC. Thanks a lot, Gwynne.

New Report Takes A Deeper Look At How Latinos Experience Discrimination In The U.S.,www.npr.org,Hansi Lo Wang,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711536566/new-report-takes-a-deeper-look-at-how-latinos-experience-discrimination-in-the-u,"Latinos with darker skin tones are more likely than those with lighter skin to say they've been discriminated against, according to a new national poll by the Pew Research Center.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
A new report out today takes a deeper look at how Latinos experience discrimination in the U.S. It finds that Latinos with darker skin tones are more likely than those with lighter skin to say that they have been discriminated against. NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports on the results of this national survey by the Pew Research Center. And we should note there is one scene in this story that some listeners might find upsetting.
HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: In Leyda Diaz's family, there's a diversity in skin tones.
LEYDA DIAZ: I'm the lightest one of my siblings. We come from the darkest to the lightest. My mom is dark, and my father is very light skin-toned and - with red hair and freckles.
WANG: Diaz lives in Queens, N.Y., and identifies as Puerto Rican and Afro-Latino. Sometimes, though, she says, other people overlook her Latino identity, including during a recent shopping trip.
DIAZ: And this lady was asking for help, but she was saying it in Spanish. And she was with a friend. And she goes, ask her. She goes, oh, she doesn't speak Spanish. And I'm like, (speaking Spanish).
WANG: Diaz says others have also judged her brothers by their appearance.
DIAZ: They're black Hispanic - morenos, as they would say. So when you go to a bodega - oh, watch that moreno. He might steal. My brother says, (speaking Spanish). And then, oh, sorry. Oh, hey. You know, it's like, now you try to play it off. But - what? - I just walked in, and you had just classified me as a thief.
WANG: It's a kind of discrimination that the Pew Research Center says some Latinos and Latinas are more likely than others to say they've experienced because of their race or ethnicity. Latinos and Latinas with darker skin tones are more likely than those with lighter skin to say that they've been subject to slurs or jokes and that people acted as if they were suspicious of them. Juliana Horowitz is one of the co-authors of Pew's new report.
JULIANA HOROWITZ: The idea of colorism is something academics talk about, but it hasn't really necessarily been part of the more public debate about race and experiences with racial discrimination in the U.S.
WANG: These new survey results could help deepen that debate, according to Margaret hunter. She's a sociologist at Mills College in California, where she studies colorism. Hunter says in the Latino community, discussion about discrimination based on skin tone usually takes place within families, behind closed doors.
MARGARET HUNTER: You'll hear people say sometimes, oh, don't air the dirty laundry in public. But I don't think we have to think about it that way. I mean, we're all being influenced by the unconscious bias of racism.
GUESNERTH JOSUE PEREA: White supremacy or white privilege doesn't really have one country, and it's an international thing.
WANG: Guesnerth Josue Perea is the director of programs and communications for the AfroLatino AfroLatina Forum. It's an organization based in New York City that's trying to raise awareness of Latinos and Latinas of African descent in the U.S.
PEREA: There's a myth in the Latino community that we are this rainbow, multicolored ethnic group, that there's no racism in Latino communities because we are all mixed. It's not true. There's a lot of discrimination in many different ways.
WANG: Sthephany Paz of Brooklyn says sometimes she feels that from within the Latino community.
STHEPHANY PAZ: I'm fair-skinned. I have light eyes. I have long hair. I was told never to date a Latino from specific countries or anyone darker than me, you know? I was encouraged not to tan.
WANG: Paz says she thinks her appearance has helped her advance in her career as a wardrobe stylist. Christina Gomez, a sociologist at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, says addressing colorism begins with more open conversation about the problem. And she's noticing a generational shift.
CHRISTINA GOMEZ: Our young people today are really talking about this on college campuses and making it literally visual to all of us. And so they talk about Afro-Latinx people in a way that, 20 years ago, we weren't talking about it.
WANG: Gomez says when we talk about discrimination, it's not enough to know that someone is Latino or Latina. She says we also have to acknowledge what someone looks like. Hansi Lo Wang, NPR News, New York.

When the first Amazon Echo hit the market in 2014, users who asked Alexa to ""play the news"" would hear the most recent NPR hourly newscast. Starting today, thanks to a new partnership between NPR and Amazon, new Alexa owners have the opportunity to hear not only the hourly newscast but, immediately after it, a continuous listening experience that delivers a stream of the best and most up-to-date national and local content from Member stations and NPR powered by the NPR One systems and editorial workflows.
Now, new users who have not had an Alexa account previously will simply have to say, ""Alexa, play the news."" Alexa will then ask the users to select a source. If the user replies, ""NPR,"" Alexa will ask for a zip code and confirm a local Member station, which will then be linked to a flow of news.
Built by NPR, the new long-form news experience is expected to slowly roll out to 100% of Alexa devices by Monday, April 15. Existing Alexa account holders will also be able to access the new experience, though the utterance they use will need to be a little more specific: ""Alexa, play news from NPR.""
The new continuous stream is the latest in a growing list of voice skills and actions built by NPR. The others include:
Public Radio Streaming Action on Google Assistant
Public Radio Streaming Skill on Alexa
Flash Briefing Visual newscast on Alexa
Visual and Audio Newscast on Google Assistant
NPR One Skill on Alexa
Wait Wait Quiz on both Alexa and Google Home
More than 53 Million Americans 18 and older now own a smart speaker, and more than half of them own at least two ( NPR & Edison research 2019 ). NPR is committed to continuing to serve our audience and meet listeners where they are, providing the best mix of local and national news in these new platforms.
To get started, just say, ""Alexa, play news from NPR!"""

On Facebook, people linger long after death.
A friend's photo might pop up on a timeline. A child's video might show up in Facebook ""Memories,"" highlighting what happened on this date in years past. Sometimes these reminders bring a smile to the faces of friends and family left behind.
But Facebook's algorithms haven't always been tactful. Unless someone explicitly informs Facebook that a family member has died, Facebook has been known to remind friends to send birthday greetings, or invite a deceased loved one to an event.
Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg on Monday announced that the social network will use artificial intelligence to determine when someone has died, and stop sending those kinds of notifications. Sandberg didn't explain exactly how the new artificial intelligence features will work, but a Facebook spokesperson told NPR the company will look at a variety of signals that might indicate the person is deceased. The spokesperson wouldn't provide details on what those signals may be.
The new feature is part of Facebook's continuing attempts to deal with death. With more than 2 billion active users, the social media company also has millions of users who will never be active again. Facebook has long permitted users to ""memorialize"" a page by submitting proof of death — which stops the automatic birthday notifications. And in 2015 the company introduced features to help trusted users curate those pages after death.
But the company has also faced its share of missteps — for instance, when its year-in-review videos highlighted photos of family members who had recently died . Some users have found it difficult to convince Facebook that a family member really was dead. And in 2016 Facebook accidentally declared countless users dead — including founder Mark Zuckerberg. (The company called it a ""terrible error."")
Facebook says it has hundreds of thousands of memorialized accounts. But there are likely far more accounts that haven't been memorialized. Estimates vary, but the BBC reported in 2016 that more than 30 million Facebook users were likely dead.
Stories abound of users who've been asked to interact with someone who has died. If the new algorithms do their job, they have the potential to keep the profiles of deceased loves one from ""appearing in painful ways,"" Sandberg said.
Facebook is also adding features to memorialized accounts, such as a new ""Tributes"" section that will let visitors share posts in a new tab, while preserving the user's original timeline. ""Legacy contacts"" — a family member or friend who has been tapped to manage the page in case of death — will be able to change privacy settings on those posts.
The company will also restrict who can declare that a user has died. Up until now, Wired reports, anyone could memorialize an account, for instance by sending in a news story stating someone has died. Under the new rules, only friends and family will be able to request an account be memorialized.
""We hope Facebook remains a place where the memory and spirit of our loved ones can be celebrated and live on,"" Sandberg said. "
"Mayor Of Beira, Mozambique, Wants Trump To See The Damage From Cyclone Idai",www.npr.org,npr.org,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711536582/mayor-of-beira-mozambique-wants-trump-to-see-the-damage-from-cyclone-idai,"NPR's Ari Shapiro speaks with Daviz Simango, mayor of Beira, Mozambique, about the damage done by Cyclone Idai and how he wants President Trump to see it so that he can understand climate change.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Mozambique winds down Africa's southeastern coast just across the Indian Ocean from Madagascar. Beira is a bustling port city, home to about half a million people. At least it was bustling until Cyclone Idai came ashore last month. The storm killed hundreds of people across Southern Africa. Beira had invested in drainage canals and retention systems to prevent flooding. The storm overwhelmed it. An estimated 90 percent of the city's infrastructure was destroyed. And now Beira's mayor is asking the world for help rebuilding and preventing climate-related disasters. Mayor Daviz Simango, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
DAVIZ SIMANGO: Hello. Thank you.
SHAPIRO: The storm came ashore March 14. What does your city look like today?
SIMANGO: So it was really a terrible situation, and now we're starting rebuilding ourselves. The life is coming. I can see in the street people walking, driving. The market is working. The business is ongoing. It will take a long time, as you can understand. We have been building this city more than 100 years, and in a few hours, everything went out.
SHAPIRO: Wow.
SIMANGO: I'm really worrying about the economic sector because they lost their capacity of production, so people can lose their jobs. And maybe we can have crime in the city because people don't have jobs. We have to do something. We have some cases of cholera, which is worrying us. But I think it's under control.
SHAPIRO: Yeah.
SIMANGO: And also we are trying to make sure that the people can go ahead with their life.
SHAPIRO: Now, Mayor Simango, I know that Beira is used to floods, and you oversaw the construction of a massive drainage system under the city to deal with this issue. Why wasn't that enough to prevent the cyclone from flooding the city?
SIMANGO: Yeah, the big problem is the wind. We had resilience for flooding. I remember quite well two or three months ago, we had flooding, and less than 24 hours, all the water was out. Wind did everything - damage everything. We're talking about private houses, schools, hospitals. Our coasts, which has a lot of protecting infrastructure, like breaking walls, was - all of them were destroyed. So if there was no wind, maybe we could survive.
SHAPIRO: While it's impossible to attribute any specific weather event to climate change, we know that a change in climate will make natural disasters more intense. Do you expect events like Cyclone Idai to become more common in Beira?
SIMANGO: Yeah. We used to say what starts, it can continue any time (laughter). Cycle can come any time. So now we're working with the wet bank. We are coming up with the second phase of the drainage system. We're working with UN-Habitat for resilient houses against wind. So in the next weeks, we are going to have all kinds of rules - how to build resilient house against wind, how to rebuild again the houses against flooding. We also going to have rules where to stay and where not to stay. We are mapping all the areas in the city, mapping the vulnerable areas. We have this information - definitely nobody can stay there.
SHAPIRO: I know that your city is just beginning to dig out from this crisis, and you're facing challenges from displaced people to an outbreak of cholera. What is Beira's most pressing need right now?
SIMANGO: Yeah. You know, when you have these kind of disasters - flooding, raining, wind, damaging - so at the end of the day, you have different type of rubbish. And if you keep rubbish water together, the people will be drinking unproper water. So what we need as quick as possible is water, drinking water, food to avoid us against bad nutrition and, well, sanitation. But after that, we need to be clear that mosquito will come and malaria will take place. So we need to prevent us as well against malaria.
SHAPIRO: Is your city getting the support it needs from the international community?
SIMANGO: I hope yes. We had international humanitarian support, which is doing very well. But the question keeps on going. What is going to happen if they go? We're talking about rebuilding Beira. We need resources to rebuild the city and to support those families who lost everything.
SHAPIRO: Mayor Daviz Simango, thank you so much for talking with us and best of luck with the cleanup and recovery.
SIMANGO: Thank you. Thank you so much.

Amazon Independent Booksellers The new novel Trust Exercise opens with teenagers attending an elite performing arts high school in the 1980s.
There, the theater kids form heartfelt friendships and relationships, and then sabotage them. Their semi-tyrannical drama teacher both inspires and manipulates them — with his ""trust exercises.""
Midway through, the book leaps forward in time and perspective. One of the students, Karen, is now an adult, re-thinking her past.
Trust Exercise is Susan Choi's fifth novel. She wanted to explore what happens when you look back on decisions that you made as an adolescent — when you felt like a grown-up, but may not have been as in control of your life as you had imagined.
Interview Highlights On the teenage mind
Book Reviews Teen Years Echo Through A Lifetime In 'Trust Exercise' Author Interviews Steamy Novel An 'Education' In Youth, Love And Mistakes It's so hard to just decode the world. And when we're teenagers, I think that we're wildly improvising. We're just sort of grabbing standards of judgment, we're grabbing values out of the air, and hoping that they fit. And we are really, really, I think, prone to make mistakes. I hate speaking for all teens, but I have to say: As a teen myself, I made loads and loads of real mistakes about the values that I held, the things that I thought were important versus dumb, the people that I thought were admirable versus silly. I really was basing my judgments on pretty limited experience. But it was so important to make those judgments. Remember? That's what it was all about. That's what growing up is all about. ... And we're supposed to! I mean again, that's what we're supposed to do ... because that's what growing up is.
On discovering the music of David Bowie
As a teen, it was very important for me to understand about music. And I remember being confronted by David Bowie . ... I remember David Bowie being this amazing conundrum, where I was like: Is this the kind of thing lots of people like? Is this a secret that I've discovered? Is this — I think I like it, I think that's OK, I think I'm brave enough to choose this as one of the things that I like. So that was what we were constantly trying to do. But with ... a very small toolbox.
On Karen's high-school experiences, in hindsight
Karen is a student who has an experience that I think could be recognized by some people who have struggled to know how to feel about a relationship they were involved in, in the past when they were young. Karen is really torn between — to put it most simply — blaming the adult in the room at the time, and blaming herself, because she felt so much like another adult in the room at that time. But now that she's really an adult, it's impossible for her not to understand that she was a child. ...
What Karen is really struggling with, that I really struggle with, is that she had an experience of agency, of choosing. ... And what do you do with that? Once you grow up, what do you do with that? And so that was something that I — I didn't want to give the reader a pat answer because I don't think there is one.
On how some women feel about other women coming forth with accusations of misbehavior later in life, in this passage:
Karen's attitude toward them is violently mixed. She might defend them to David, but in her bowels she scorns them, these young women who made a bad judgment and now want to blame someone else.
The thing that's really complicated about this — and I would never want a reader to imagine that that sentiment of Karen's is in some way a sentiment being endorsed by the book — what I wanted to express is that I think that sentiment is really real. I think it's one of the reasons that people who experience abuse or misconduct at whatever level struggle so much with figuring out how to tell the story to themselves before they even try to tell the story to others.
I think a lot has changed for young women today, and I think a lot hasn't. I think a lot is exactly the same as it was when I was a young woman. I think that there's every reason for a young woman to feel very strongly that allying herself with a powerful man, regardless of how she has to do it, might be her path forward — might sometimes be her only path forward. And forming that alliance may be a decision she makes when she is less experienced, and a decision that she is able to recognize for how compromised it was later in life, but we still have to recognize that there's this whole baked-in social and cultural structure that's pointing her toward that decision. Just identifying all the ""bad men"" and putting them into a time-out isn't really going to address the ways in which sexism is baked into our society.
On if younger generations are more cognizant of structural sexism
Oh yeah, definitely. I don't think that I would have written this book without my students. And I think the experience of teaching younger people — my students [at Yale University] are all 17-20 years old, and I've been teaching for quite a while — their way of seeing and their way of thinking is totally different. And I'm so grateful from it. ...
There are a lot of things that I take for granted that I realize: I shouldn't take them for granted. I shouldn't just go, ""Oh, well that's just the way it is."" My students will go, ""No. Uh-uh. We don't like it. We don't like this. It shouldn't be like this."" And it's like having the wool pulled from my eyes, where I've most often end[ed] up going, ""Wow, they're right. I don't know why I would've accepted that.""

Scrutiny Continues For Santa Anita Race Track After 23 Thoroughbreds Die In 3 Months,www.npr.org,Tom Goldman,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711536538/scrutiny-continues-for-santa-anita-race-track-after-23-thoroughbreds-die-in-3-mo,"Scrutiny Continues For Santa Anita Racetrack After 23 Thoroughbreds Die In 3 Months Scrutiny Continues For Santa Anita Racetrack After 23 Thoroughbreds Die In 3 Months Embed Embed
The famed Santa Anita racetrack in Southern California is under scrutiny after a spike in thoroughbred deaths. Santa Anita hosted its biggest race day of the year this past weekend.
AILSA CHANG, HOST:
Santa Anita Park in Southern California has been out of the headlines for a few days. That's welcome news at the famous horse racing track. Over the past three months, 23 thoroughbreds have died, mostly due to injuries from racing or training. The track was shut down for most of March, but it was open this past weekend for a major event. Still, the scrutiny from Congress to the LA County district attorney continues. And as NPR's Tom Goldman reports, throughout the racing industry, there's concern the future of the sport is at stake.
TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: Santa Anita is nicknamed the Great Race Place, and Saturday, it was easy to see why.
UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: And Lemoona's in the back.
GOLDMAN: From the grandstand along the stretch, a visual feast - a bright blue California sky, the San Gabriel Mountains, muscular thoroughbreds rumbling by on the dirt track.
(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)
GOLDMAN: Beneath this festive scene, though, there was anxiety among those connected to the track. Their mantra had been just get through Saturday. Meaning, after 23 thoroughbred deaths, Santa Anita certainly didn't want another, not on a day when a national TV network would broadcast the Santa Anita Derby, a big prep race for the Kentucky Derby next month. This was jockey Joel Rosario after he rode in one of the day's early races.
JOEL ROSARIO: You know, just hopefully everything, you know, go nice and smooth and then, you know, we don't have any, you know, any problem, you know.
GOLDMAN: Steve Bazela was among the 30,000-plus paying and gambling customers on this day. He's been coming to Santa Anita since the 1960s, and he certainly didn't want to see what he saw just a week before - the catastrophic injury to a thoroughbred named Arms Runner, the most recent to die.
STEVE BAZELA: All you got to do is see that once or twice in your life, and it changes you. I saw a horse break down at the finish line about eight years ago here. I just literally walked to the parking lot I was so upset. I mean, they give you everything they got.
GOLDMAN: It changes you, but you're back.
BAZELA: Yeah.
GOLDMAN: You still love this sport.
BAZELA: Oh, I love it.
GOLDMAN: How'd it change you, then?
BAZELA: It just makes you more aware.
UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And they're off in the Santa Anita Derby.
GOLDMAN: The big race didn't disappoint. Horses trained by Hall of Famer Bob Baffert finished 1-2 and qualified for the Kentucky Derby. Baffert, the face of horse racing in this country, was thrilled and grateful for the fans who turned out and saw an entire day of injury-free racing.
BOB BAFFERT: We needed a lift. I know I did.
GOLDMAN: Catastrophic injuries happen in horse racing, but these spikes in deaths are not the norm, which is why Baffert warned against overreacting.
BAFFERT: You don't have to burn the house down just because the pipes are bad, you know? And so, you know, we're going to work through this, but I really think the weather really caused a lot of this.
GOLDMAN: He's not wrong. In January and February, Southern California got a ton of rain. It affected the multilayer dirt track at Santa Anita and posed a potential risk to the massive horses who need those layers just right in order to protect their legs. But Dr. Rick Arthur says you can't just blame the rain.
RICK ARTHUR: Frankly, we shouldn't have run on some of the days that we had a bad track.
GOLDMAN: Arthur is an equine veterinary specialist who's been based at Santa Anita for more than four decades.
ARTHUR: And some of the days when the track wasn't as good as it should have been, trainers shouldn't have trained their horses.
GOLDMAN: Those decisions, Arthur says, are driven by a reality that goes beyond Santa Anita to many of this country's racetracks, where the focus, he says, is more on economics than on horses. That, he says, is horse racing's real problem.
ARTHUR: Racing has become more competitive over a period of time. Horses are worked faster, and there's fewer horses to fit the slots that are available, so there's more pressure on the horses to race more frequently.
GOLDMAN: Getting the horse racing industry - track managers, owners, trainers - to buy into less racing and resting horses more, that's going to take a culture change, Arthur says. But he adds, if that doesn't happen and horses keep dying at higher rates, there's a unanimous belief in what will happen.
ARTHUR: If we don't make racing safer, I don't think the public's going to allow us to continue the sport.
(CHEERING)
GOLDMAN: There've been nine straight days of racing and training at Santa Anita without a horse dying. Considering the last three months, that's a big deal. The weather now is warm, and Arthur says the track is in great condition. The group that owns Santa Anita has implemented new rules regulating medication - always a controversial issue in horse racing. Also more veterinarians have been dispatched to observe training sessions.
Even the industry's harshest critic, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, praises the ownership group's action. But PETA is now turning its attention to Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby. In a statement yesterday, PETA said, quote, ""Kentucky is on notice. Churchill Downs has the second-worst death rate for horses in the country."" The organization says change is overdue, and it needs to come now. Tom Goldman, NPR News. Copyright © 2019 NPR.

New York Declares Health Emergency As Measles Spreads In Parts Of Brooklyn,www.npr.org,Vanessa Romo,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711432792/new-york-declares-health-emergency-as-measles-spreads-in-parts-of-brooklyn,"Facebook Vows To Quash Anti-Vaccine Misinformation
Mistrust over the safety and alleged side effects of vaccines has played a significant role in outbreaks among wealthier nations around the world, where parents are choosing not to vaccinate their children, often citing popular but debunked misinformation — as opposed to forgoing immunization for lack of access to the vaccine, which is what tends to promote the spread of the disease in poorer countries. Similarly, tightly clustered religious communities, insulated from mainstream society, also tend to suffer higher flare-ups of the highly contagious virus because the group's level of immunity has fallen.
To achieve what is called herd immunity , which protects even those who are not vaccinated, a population must reach a 93 percent to 95 percent immunity rate .
In Williamsburg, the immunization rate is particularly low among the Hasidic and Orthodox Jewish communities, causing the virus ""to increase at an alarming rate,"" according to the Health Department.
The vast majority of the city's cases are children under 18 years of age. In most cases, the patients were unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated. While no one has died, a handful have been admitted to intensive care.
""This outbreak is being fueled by a small group of anti-vaxxers in these neighborhoods. They have been spreading dangerous misinformation based on fake science,"" Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot said in statement. ""We stand with the majority of people in this community who have worked hard to protect their children and those at risk. We've seen a large increase in the number of people vaccinated in these neighborhoods, but as Passover approaches, we need to do all we can to ensure more people get the vaccine."" N.Y. Suburb Declares Measles Emergency, Bars Unvaccinated Minors From Public Places
Recent steps by the city to try to stem the fast-growing outbreak have been unsuccessful despite efforts taken by the Health Department to stop it, including orders excluding unvaccinated children from attending preschools and day care programs ""because a high rate of people living within Williamsburg have not been vaccinated against measles.""
Health officials in Rockland County, a northern suburb of New York City, last month also banned unvaccinated children from visiting public places for 30 days. The order was temporarily halted by a judge last week.
Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, less than four decades after the vaccination was first made available in 1963. But travelers bring in new cases. The CDC reports measles is still common in many parts of the world, including some countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific and Africa.
Three 2018 outbreaks in New York state and New Jersey, which contributed to most of the cases recorded last year, were all associated with travelers who brought measles back from Israel, where a large outbreak is occurring .
According to New York City's Health Department, ""five cases, including the initial case of measles, were acquired on a visit to Israel."" Two people contracted measles while in the U.K. and one in Ukraine."

Mexico's hard swing to the left in this month's national elections also swept in some other historic firsts. Women won key positions across the country, including, for the first time ever, the mayor of Mexico City.
Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, 56, will assume arguably the second most important political post in Mexico, after capturing nearly 50 percent of the vote in the July 1 elections.
She may not be unprecedented for a woman to hold the office. Rosario Robles served out part of a Mexico City mayoral term , from 1999 to 2000, when her boss resigned to run for president.
But it is the first time a woman has been elected the capital's mayor, considered a stepping stone to the presidency. And it comes as more and more women are seeking active roles in Mexican politics , transforming a male-dominated field. Women also won half the seats in the national and state legislatures and are expected to make up an even share of cabinet posts in the new government of President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador. In Mexico's Elections, Women Are Running In Unprecedented Numbers
Sheinbaum beat out six other candidates for the job — just a couple of them male.
Her route to mayor has been anything but traditional. Sheinbaum holds degrees in physics and energy engineering. She did doctoral studies at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, took part in a United Nations climate change panel that shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore and is a well-respected researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.
But she doesn't want people to think she's just a science nerd. Looks can be deceiving, as she frequently pointed out in her campaign this summer.
""Don't think because you see this skinny scientist up here that we won't be strong enough to take on the subject of crime fighting,"" Sheinbaum told a group of supporters at a Mexico City park.
Despite her science background, Sheinbaum is no political novice. She has long ties to leftist politics and to López Obrador. He appointed her his environment minister when he was mayor of the capital in 2000. Five years later she took over one of Mexico City's largest districts, Tlalpan.

However, there she ran into controversy, especially after a 7.1 earthquake struck the capital last September, which hit her district hard.
One of the more visible reminders of the destruction in Tlalpan is an abandoned 12-unit apartment building. Twenty-two-year-old medical student Leonardo Sánchez walks by the crumbling complex every day. He's not happy Sheinbaum won for mayor.
""She couldn't even take care of this one simple building, how is she going to deal with the district or an entire city,"" he says.
More than 300 people were killed in the earthquake, including 19 children and seven adults who died when a school collapsed in Sheinbaum's district."
Texas Tech Medical School To End Use Of Race In Admissions,www.npr.org,Richard Gonzales,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711639323/texas-tech-medical-school-to-end-use-of-race-in-admissions,"Enlarge this image Kimberly Vardeman/Flickr Kimberly Vardeman/Flickr Texas Tech University's medical school has agreed to end its consideration of race in selecting candidates for admission, an outcome actively sought by the Trump administration.
The Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center submitted to pressure from the Education Department's Office on Civil Rights, which had conducted a 14-year probe into the use of affirmative action in admission policies at the medical school. The agreement is the first reached by the administration and a school to stop using race as an admissions factor.
The investigation was prompted by a complaint filed in 2004 by the Center for Equal Opportunity, a conservative think tank opposing affirmative action.
The Center's general counsel, Roger Clegg, praised the agreement.
""It shows again that the Trump administration is serious about enforcing the civil-rights laws so that they forbid discrimination against all racial and ethnic groups, and will not turn a blind eye toward politically correct racial discrimination in the way the Obama administration did,"" Clegg wrote in the National Review .
Civil rights advocates blasted the decision.
""It is disturbing that the federal government apparently coerced an agreement that goes beyond applicable constitutional restrictions to bar any consideration of race in admissions,"" said Thomas A. Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ""By going beyond the law to enshrine an extreme agenda, this agreement represents a federal government that seeks to preserve white privilege rather than to secure equal opportunity.""
The Resolution Agreement was signed in February, but it was only made public Tuesday in a report by The Wall Street Journal .
The agreement said the medical school ""will discontinue all consideration of an applicant's race and/or national origin"" in admission policies. It called for the admissions staff and other staff to be informed of the policy change by March 1. The school also agreed to revise all admissions and recruitment material reflecting the change by Sept. 1.
In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that schools can consider an applicant's race, but such policies are still subject to court scrutiny.
In a letter accompanying the agreement, the university endorsed diversity in academic medicine as ""a necessity nationally"" and maintained that its admissions process complies with the Supreme Court's ruling. Nevertheless, it said it ""is willing to sign the Resolution Agreement in an effort to resolve this matter and focus on educating future health care providers.""
The Education Department's Office on Civil Rights is also investigating whether the use of race in admissions at Harvard and Yale work to the disadvantage of Asian-American applicants. Last summer the department, under the leadership of Secretary Betsy DeVos, revoked Obama administration guidelines supporting schools who want to use race in admissions to foster diversity in their student bodies."
Trump Weighs Tougher Immigration Enforcement After Homeland Security Shake-Up : NPR,www.npr.org,President Trump,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/09/711446892/trump-administration-mulls-tougher-immigration-policies-amid-dhs-shake-up,"Enlarge this image With a shake-up at the Department of Homeland Security, President Trump is indicating that he wants tougher immigration enforcement.

Jacquelyn Martin/AP With a dramatic shake-up at the highest levels of the Department of Homeland Security, President Trump has signaled that he wants to get even tougher on immigration.
But how much tougher can he get?
Trump has been frustrated with the inability of DHS to stop a surge of Central American migrant families and children from crossing the Southern border.
On Tuesday, Customs and Border Protection announced what it had predicted for days: The number of migrants apprehended at the border last month surpassed 103,000 — the highest level in more than a decade.
The president signaled that he plans to take the department in a new direction after he accepted the resignation of Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and pulled the nomination of Ronald Vitiello to be director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
A senior administration official said on Tuesday that the department wasn't doing enough about the border crisis or acting with enough urgency.
I'll tell you something — once you don't have it, that's why you see many more people coming. They are coming like it's a picnic, because 'Let's go to Disneyland.'
President Trump
Now the White House is discussing new steps that could be taken to slow the flow of migrants, including bringing back a version of separating migrant families at the border. Another option on the table: ramping up deportations of immigrants already living in the U.S. illegally who have an outstanding order of removal.
Politics Kirstjen Nielsen Leaving Homeland Security Post As Border Crossings Surge National Tension And Anxiety In Border Cities After Trump Threatens Closure Speaking briefly to reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said he is not looking to reinstate the controversial family separation policy he suspended last year but then implied it was an effective means of stemming unauthorized border crossings.
""I'll tell you something — once you don't have it, that's why you see many more people coming,"" Trump said. ""They are coming like it's a picnic, because 'Let's go to Disneyland.' ""
'Binary choice' proposal
White House officials say they are looking at a variation of the policy that gives parents more of a say in the process.
The so-called ""binary choice"" proposal would dramatically expand immigrant detention and give parents a choice: Their children would be separated from them and later released to live with a relative or sponsor in the U.S., or the family could stay together in detention until their day in immigration court.
Critics say the modified version of family separation is still cruel and is likely to be challenged in court.
In addition, the White House is looking at a stricter screening process for asylum-seekers that would make it tougher for them to pass the first stage of the process, the credible-fear interview.
Most migrants are able to convince an asylum officer that they have a credible fear of returning home, and they are released to live in the U.S. while their case plays out.
But Trump faces some major head winds.
While the White House has been pushing Congress to change immigration law to make it easier to detain and deport asylum-seekers, Congress doesn't appear ready to take up the immigration debate, and previous attempts under Trump have failed.
Similarly, Trump frequently returns to his wish list — a border wall, ending policies that make it easier to bring family members to the U.S. and stopping the green card lottery. But those proposals have all languished.
Moreover, many of the actions that the Trump administration has taken on its own have been blocked by the courts.
On Monday, a federal court in Northern California temporarily blocked the ""Remain in Mexico"" program, which forced some asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico while their claims were pending in U.S. immigration court.
Pushing an even tougher approach
But immigration hard-liners are ready for Trump to take an even tougher approach. Here are three possible scenarios, according to several conservative policy analysts who are influential with the administration:
— Change the rules so that migrant families can be detained indefinitely while their immigration cases are adjudicated. Build tent camps along the border to house them because there is not enough room in ICE detention facilities. Currently, there is a limit on how long children can be held in detention, and critics say DHS had been slow-walking efforts to change that.
— Flood the border zone with asylum officers, immigration judges and ICE attorneys. This would allow officials to put asylum-seekers on a so-called rocket docket. Most asylum claims are ultimately denied, so this would speed that process, which can take years given the current backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases.
— Focus on deterrence. This would include returning to a version of family separation, rebranded as a ""binary choice."" Overall, the endgame would be to convince Central American migrants that it's no longer a good idea to cross the border without authorization.
An opportunity
R.J. Hauman is government relations director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for strong immigration enforcement. Hauman says Trump has ""an opportunity to correct the sins of his administration."" He said Nielsen, whose specialty is cybersecurity, was a ""neophyte"" on immigration and didn't champion Trump's agenda.
Mark Krikorian is the director of the Center for Immigration Studies, another organization that promotes tighter immigration rules. He also advises the president on immigration policy. On NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday, he said the most pressing issue facing DHS, a sprawling department, is immigration.
""[Nielsen] came to appreciate the urgency to respond to this developing emergency on the border but much too late,"" Krikorian said. ""She had to go. We really need a new approach, a more serious and urgent approach to deal with this developing emergency.""
On Monday, outside her home in Virginia, Nielsen said that she was working to ensure a ""smooth transition"" and that she shares the president's goal of securing the border. ""I will continue to support all efforts to address the humanitarian and security crisis on the border,"" she said.
Nielsen's last day is Wednesday."

Amazon Independent Booksellers The new novel Trust Exercise opens with teenagers attending an elite performing arts high school in the 1980s.
There, the theater kids form heartfelt friendships and relationships, and then sabotage them. Their semi-tyrannical drama teacher both inspires and manipulates them — with his ""trust exercises.""
Midway through, the book leaps forward in time and perspective. One of the students, Karen, is now an adult, re-thinking her past.
Trust Exercise is Susan Choi's fifth novel. She wanted to explore what happens when you look back on decisions that you made as an adolescent — when you felt like a grown-up, but may not have been as in control of your life as you had imagined.
Interview Highlights On the teenage mind
Book Reviews Teen Years Echo Through A Lifetime In 'Trust Exercise' Author Interviews Steamy Novel An 'Education' In Youth, Love And Mistakes It's so hard to just decode the world. And when we're teenagers, I think that we're wildly improvising. We're just sort of grabbing standards of judgment, we're grabbing values out of the air, and hoping that they fit. And we are really, really, I think, prone to make mistakes. I hate speaking for all teens, but I have to say: As a teen myself, I made loads and loads of real mistakes about the values that I held, the things that I thought were important versus dumb, the people that I thought were admirable versus silly. I really was basing my judgments on pretty limited experience. But it was so important to make those judgments. Remember? That's what it was all about. That's what growing up is all about. ... And we're supposed to! I mean again, that's what we're supposed to do ... because that's what growing up is.
On discovering the music of David Bowie
As a teen, it was very important for me to understand about music. And I remember being confronted by David Bowie . ... I remember David Bowie being this amazing conundrum, where I was like: Is this the kind of thing lots of people like? Is this a secret that I've discovered? Is this — I think I like it, I think that's OK, I think I'm brave enough to choose this as one of the things that I like. So that was what we were constantly trying to do. But with ... a very small toolbox.
On Karen's high-school experiences, in hindsight
Karen is a student who has an experience that I think could be recognized by some people who have struggled to know how to feel about a relationship they were involved in, in the past when they were young. Karen is really torn between — to put it most simply — blaming the adult in the room at the time, and blaming herself, because she felt so much like another adult in the room at that time. But now that she's really an adult, it's impossible for her not to understand that she was a child. ...
What Karen is really struggling with, that I really struggle with, is that she had an experience of agency, of choosing. ... And what do you do with that? Once you grow up, what do you do with that? And so that was something that I — I didn't want to give the reader a pat answer because I don't think there is one.
On how some women feel about other women coming forth with accusations of misbehavior later in life, in this passage:
Karen's attitude toward them is violently mixed. She might defend them to David, but in her bowels she scorns them, these young women who made a bad judgment and now want to blame someone else.
The thing that's really complicated about this — and I would never want a reader to imagine that that sentiment of Karen's is in some way a sentiment being endorsed by the book — what I wanted to express is that I think that sentiment is really real. I think it's one of the reasons that people who experience abuse or misconduct at whatever level struggle so much with figuring out how to tell the story to themselves before they even try to tell the story to others.
I think a lot has changed for young women today, and I think a lot hasn't. I think a lot is exactly the same as it was when I was a young woman. I think that there's every reason for a young woman to feel very strongly that allying herself with a powerful man, regardless of how she has to do it, might be her path forward — might sometimes be her only path forward. And forming that alliance may be a decision she makes when she is less experienced, and a decision that she is able to recognize for how compromised it was later in life, but we still have to recognize that there's this whole baked-in social and cultural structure that's pointing her toward that decision. Just identifying all the ""bad men"" and putting them into a time-out isn't really going to address the ways in which sexism is baked into our society.
On if younger generations are more cognizant of structural sexism
Oh yeah, definitely. I don't think that I would have written this book without my students. And I think the experience of teaching younger people — my students [at Yale University] are all 17-20 years old, and I've been teaching for quite a while — their way of seeing and their way of thinking is totally different. And I'm so grateful from it. ...
There are a lot of things that I take for granted that I realize: I shouldn't take them for granted. I shouldn't just go, ""Oh, well that's just the way it is."" My students will go, ""No. Uh-uh. We don't like it. We don't like this. It shouldn't be like this."" And it's like having the wool pulled from my eyes, where I've most often end[ed] up going, ""Wow, they're right. I don't know why I would've accepted that.""

Hayley Fager/WCAI Along the East Coast, spring typically means serious erosion caused by strong storms. This year, homeowners on Cape Cod, Mass., are bracing for the worst.
Laura Wing lives in a beachfront home in Sandwich. She inherited the house from her parents 40 years ago, but the beach has changed a lot since then.
""The dunes went much further out on the beach, so over all this time it's just eroded away to what it is now,"" she said.
These days the water is 50 feet from her home at high tide. It's typical to have houses right on the shore on Cape Cod, and storms can cause a lot of damage.
Wing has a costly decision to make: whether to invest $30,000 in fiber rolls, the most resilient method for slowing erosion that Massachusetts homeowners are allowed to use.
The rolls are made from coconut fiber and are buried in sandy slopes in front of homes, to absorb wave energy and hold sand in place. They are filled with sand or coconut fiber and planted with grasses and shrubs; they end up looking like dunes.

Hayley Fager/WCAI But, whatever Wing decides to do with her property could also affect erosion on nearby public beaches. According to Dave Deconto, the Director of Natural Resources for Sandwich, there is a beach in town where public and private land meet. The private homes on the beach have fiber rolls in front of them — the beach next to the rolls is pretty washed out and has lost a lot of sand. That's because any time you construct a dune, even a fiber roll dune, there's going to be more erosion where the dune ends and the beach begins.
Mother nature's gonna do what mother nature does.
Dave Deconto, Director of Natural Resources, Sandwich, Mass.
There are other options for slowing erosion. One method uses barriers to break up the wave action before it hits the coast line, but it hasn't been approved by Massachusetts environmental regulators.
Deconto says whatever homeowners decide, all of the fixes are temporary. ""Mother nature's gonna do what mother nature does,"" says Deconto. ""Every town on the coastline of Massachusetts is dealing with it, every community along the eastern seaboard, and the Gulf Coast, and the West Coast of the United states are dealing with it.""
Fiber rolls are mostly being used by private homeowners right now because the high cost can be a barrier for small coastal towns, and because most buildings on public beaches are further inland and not as vulnerable as beachfront homes.
Massachusetts officials recommend fiber rolls because they have a lower impact on natural habitats than other methods for slowing erosion. The good news is, they are biodegradable. The bad news is, that means they have to be reinstalled every 5 years.
Seth Wilkinson installs these systems and he says he's had some hard conversations with homeowners. ""And they're saying, 'I don't think I can afford to live here anymore. Repairing this bank or stabilizing this bank, will cost more than the value of my home.'""
Laura Wing says she isn't going to install fiber rolls for now. ""I can't cover that kind of expense by renting the house, so that just comes out of my savings. And I'm retired."" She says she's taking things one year at a time, and hopes she doesn't lose her home in a storm before she decides to sell."

But despite the mayor's signature, Pittsburgh's fight has just begun. Supporters of the legislation faced immediate resistance from gun rights advocates who say the city doesn't have the authority to issue such a ban.

— NRA (@NRA) April 9, 2019 Pittsburgh tried to regulate assault-style rifles over 20 years ago. But the courts have rejected those laws. State judges ruled that gun laws can be regulated only in the state's capital.
Mayor Bill Peduto has said it is time for the city to do something about the city's gun laws. ""If we didn't challenge laws, women wouldn't be able to vote,"" Peduto said after the signing.
City officials originally sought an outright ban on assault-style rifles and ammunition and accessories. But the resistance was almost immediate.
In January outside Pittsburgh's city hall, hundreds of protesters chanted, ""We will not comply."" Many were strapped with the weapons that would be banned by the law. The protesters say the gun laws aren't legal.
Gun rights activist Justin Dillon, who organized that rally, says laws like this are a political stunt. ""If a politician really cared about its people,"" he said, ""they would have done something before the synagogue shooting and not waited for a tragedy to happen.""
Elected officials agree only the state can regulate firearm possession. So in March they came up with a new strategy: banning the use, not the ownership, of the guns.
City Councilman Corey O'Connor introduced the bill and its amendments.
Law Bump Stock Ban Takes Effect As Gun Rights Groups Ask Supreme Court For Delay World New Zealand Introduces Gun Control Bill Expected To Become Law Within Weeks ""I think they're on the run and this is the first time that more and more, not just cities, but elected officials and communities are starting to fight back,"" he said.
But the new law offers a broad definition of use. It bans not just firing the gun, but even having it loaded in public. That means many of the protesters who opposed the law at the January rally would have been breaking it.
Dillon admits his gun was loaded. ""It's kind of pointless not to have a gun that's loaded,"" he said.
The NRA has filed a lawsuit sharing the same complaints as the protesters. A representative was unavailable for comment, but in a statement the group said, ""Pittsburgh residents have a right to carry the self-defense tools that best suit their needs.""
Peduto says that to have new gun laws, the city will have to go to court. ""The only way that a society progresses is by challenging what is accepted during their time,"" he said.
Not every local official supports the legislation. Three of the council's nine members voted against it. And in January, District Attorney Stephen Zappala told the city council it does not have the power to regulate guns. The city's law will go into effect in 60 days if a judge allows it to pass."
Pence Meets With Opposition Leader Juan Guaido,www.npr.org,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/02/25/697839176/pence-meets-with-opposition-leader-juan-guaido,"Pence Meets With Opposition Leader Juan Guaido Pence Meets With Opposition Leader Juan Guaido Embed Embed
In Colombia, Vice President Mike Pence meets with the man the U.S. is backing in an effort to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:
Today in Bogota, Colombia, Vice President Mike Pence met with the man the U.S. hopes will replace Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. That's Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido. Pence and Guaido met after a dramatic weekend on the Venezuelan border with Colombia. Volunteers tried to bring food and medicine into the country. The military shot and killed at least four people. Two aid trucks were torched. Many people were tear-gassed.
Today Pence and Guaido called on Venezuela's military to join the opposition. They hinted at military intervention if the military refuses. Reporter John Otis is in Bogota and joins us now. Hi, John.
JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: Hi, Ari.
SHAPIRO: This weekend's actions by Juan Guaido seem to be a big gamble, trying to get aid across the border in hopes that there would be mass defections from the military. Those defections did not materialize. So what did he and the U.S. vice president suggest could be the next move here?
OTIS: Well, when the two men met, Pence suggested that it may very well be a long, hard slog to bring about regime change in Venezuela. Pence announced some new sanctions against four Venezuelan state governors who the U.S. blames for promoting some of the violence over the weekend. He said more sanctions would be announced. And he also said that the U.S. hasn't given up on moving food and medicine into Venezuela and that they're studying some new areas along the border where they might try again.
But Pence also came out with some carrots. He urged Venezuelan military officials who are propping up Maduro to turn against his government and take up Juan Guaido's longstanding offer of amnesty. Over the weekend, about 150 officers and soldiers did defect. However, you know, as you mentioned, there weren't the massive military defections that Guaido's people were hoping for.
SHAPIRO: OK, so one big question hanging over all of this is will the U.S. take military actions to bring about regime change in Venezuela. What did Vice President Pence have to say about that today?
OTIS: He said he hopes military force isn't necessary but that it remains an option. Now, this is something the Trump administration has been saying for a long time. So it wasn't really an escalation in rhetoric. Pence did make some quite interesting comments about Colombia, which borders Venezuela and was the launching point for that failed aid convoy. And let's listen to what he said.
(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: Colombia is our strongest partner in the region. And any who would threaten her sovereignty or security would do well not to test the commitment to our ally or the resolve of the United States of America.
OTIS: What Pence seems to be saying there is that the U.S. could be drawn into a conflict with Venezuela should there be any kind of major cross-border incidents with Colombia. And, you know, as we saw over the weekend, it's not that hard to imagine something like that happening.
SHAPIRO: Pence is not the only foreign leader in Bogota today. There are also dozens of representatives of other countries backing Juan Guaido, including other Latin American countries. What's the broader feeling about the prospect of military intervention in Venezuela?
OTIS: Latin American diplomats are saying that they're open to things like tougher sanctions. Pence wants them to, for example, restrict visas to Maduro officials, to confiscate state oil company assets in their countries, to close off their banking systems. But even before today's meetings, Latin American leaders - including the vice president of Brazil - were explicitly ruling out military intervention in Venezuela.
You know, right now there's a lot of unity in many parts of the world in terms of backing Guaido and isolating Maduro. And so there's a danger that this solidarity could break apart if there's a major push, either from within the Venezuelan opposition or the U.S. - or from some other country - to send in troops.
SHAPIRO: And so what is Guaido's next move here?
OTIS: Well, Guaido's in a tough position. He has a lot of international support but no real power. In fact, it's unclear whether Maduro's even going to let him back into Venezuela. There are efforts to open up negotiations with the Maduro government for a peaceful transfer of power. But in many past attempts at talks, Maduro has used negotiations to stall for time.
SHAPIRO: That's reporter John Otis in Bogota, Colombia. Thanks so much.
OTIS: Thank you. Copyright © 2019 NPR. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Opioid Maker Charged With Fraud In Marketing Drug As Less Prone To Abuse,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711669778/opioid-maker-charged-with-fraud-in-marketing-drug-as-less-prone-to-abuse,"Eamon Queeney/The Washington Post/Getty Images Eamon Queeney/The Washington Post/Getty Images
Federal prosecutors late Tuesday charged British drug maker Indivior with felony fraud and conspiracy for its marketing of opioid products including Suboxone. The company allegedly created a ""nationwide scheme"" in the U.S. designed to convince doctors and government insurance providers that Indivior's patented opioid medications are safer and less prone to abuse than cheaper generic alternatives.
""The indictment alleges that, rather than marketing its opioid-addiction drug responsibly, Indivior promoted it with a disregard for the truth about its safety and despite known risks of diversion and abuse,"" said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt in a statement.
Federal prosecutors claim Indivior bilked Medicare, Medicaid and other health care providers out of billions of dollars as they paid for a more expensive version of the drug, believing it to be safer. The criminal charges, filed in the western district of Virginia, stem from a joint investigation that included the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Virginia's state attorney general office, and other agencies.
The company issued a statement denying any wrongdoing. ""Key allegations made by the Justice Department are contradicted by the government's own scientific agencies,"" Indivior said on Tuesday, adding that the firm ""will contest this case vigorously and we look forward to the full facts coming out in court.""
At the heart of the 28-count indictment is Indivior's effort, beginning in 2007, to popularize a new method of delivering its Suboxone medication, which is used to treat patients suffering from opioid dependency. With a cheaper generic tablet form of the drug expected to go on sale, the company developed a dissolvable film that could be placed under the tongue, describing the new delivery system as ""less abusable"" with a ""lower risk.""
Prosecutors now say the company knew the dissolvable film version of Suboxone was potentially more dangerous, more susceptible to abuse, and included a higher risk that children might be exposed to the drug. The firm also developed a program that allegedly connected opioid-dependent patients with doctors who prescribed Suboxone ""in high doses and in suspect circumstances.""
Federal prosecutors say if Indivior is found guilty, the company should forfeit at least $3 billion in penalties. In its response, Indivior said the company acted responsibly and has played a crucial role responding to the deadly opioid epidemic. The firm also says it tried to negotiate a settlement before the charges were filed.
""We are extremely disappointed in this action by the Justice Department, which is wholly unsupported by either the facts or the law,"" Indivior's statement said."
Teenage Sisters Get Global Respect For Campaign To Rid Bali Of Plastic Bags : Goats and Soda,www.npr.org,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/01/26/688168838/how-teenage-sisters-pushed-bali-to-say-bye-bye-to-plastic-bags,"Teenage sisters Melati and Isabel Wijsen of Bali have received many honors for their efforts to ban plastic bags.

Five years ago, two young women decided they were going to do something about the plastic problem on their island of Bali.
How young? So young one of them couldn't make it to our midweek interview. ""She's at school,"" explained 18-year-old Melati Wijsen, talking about her 16- year- old sister Isabel.
""She's just halfway through grade 11 and she's putting her focus more into graduating high school.""
About 'The Plastic Tide'
NPR is exploring one of the most important environmental issues of our time: plastic waste. Click here to read more about the topic.
Bali is part of the island nation of Indonesia, which is the world's second biggest polluter when it comes to marine plastic , trailing only China. And when ocean currents carry that plastic to the tourist island of Bali, it's a public relations nightmare. This video taken by British diver Rich Horner last year pretty much sums up the scale of the problem as he tries to navigate through a sea of plastic just below the water's surface. A New Weapon In The War Against Plastic Waste
The two sisters got the idea for Bye Bye Plastic Bags in 2013 after a lesson at school about influential world leaders — change-makers — including Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi.
""My sister and I went home that day thinking, 'Well, what can we do as kids living on the island of Bali?' "" Melati Wijsen says.
""You see, we didn't want to wait until we were older to start making a difference. It wasn't even a question, really. It was more like, what can we do, as kids, right now.""
The answer was right in front of them. Literally. On the beach in front of their home.
""It got to the point where on weekends when we would go to our childhood beach, if we went swimming there, a plastic bag would wrap around your arm, Wijsen says. ""And you say just, enough is enough.""
They went online and discovered that over 40 countries had already banned or taxed plastic bags.
""We thought, 'Well, if they can do it, c'mon, Bali! C'mon, Indonesia! We can do it, too!' "" Wijsen says. ""So, without a business plan or a strategy or a budget, like my mom will tell you, we went forward with a pure passion and intention to make our island home plastic bag free.""
They got some friends together, went online to start a petition and got 6,000 signatures in less than a day, Wijsen says. They spread awareness through school and community workshops. The organized massive beach cleanup campaigns , all the while drawing international attention and that of local politicians too. Especially when they decided to up the ante optics-wise.
""I think one of the biggest tools that pushed us forward was our decision to go on a food strike,"" Wijsen says, inspired, she says, by one of the tools used by Gandhi. ""He also had peaceful ways of reaching his goals, of getting attention, So that was a huge inspiration for us.""
The sisters put the word out about their plan on social media. Local media picked it up, and that's prompted the governor at the time, I Made Pastika, to do what any savvy politician would do when faced with two teenage girls threatening a hunger strike. He invited them to come see him. ""Within 24 hours, we had a phone call and then the next day we were picked up from school and escorted to the office of the governor,"" Wijsen says. Teen Inspires Youth Demonstrations Across Europe, Demanding Action On Climate Change
Pastika signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the sisters to work toward eliminating plastic on the island — and later pledged to rid Bali of plastic bags by 2018. That didn't happen, but the sisters kept engaging government at every level — local, municipal and national — to keep up the pressure. Melati Wijsen says she learned a lot about dealing with politicians in the process.
""Yeah, well, being 14 and skipping school on a Tuesday because I had to learn about draft regulations and suggestions really was an interesting learning curve for me,"" she says. Dancing with politicians, she says, is like three steps forward, two steps back and again, and again. It's almost like the cha-cha. I learned a lot of different things.""
Wijsen says that in the past year she's spent about 100 nights on the road with speaking engagements to get out the anti-plastic message and to talk about youth empowerment as well. The sisters have given a TED talk , spoke at the U.N. in New York and again last year at the IMF World Bank Forum in Bali. World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva called Melati ""a girl that is changing the world around her.""
They've also been named among the world's most influential teenagers by Forbes , Time magazine and CNN.
And just last month, the new governor of Bali announced a law banning single-use plastic in 2019, thanks in part to the sisters' efforts and those of like-minded NGOs.
Businesses have six months to comply or face having their business permits revoked.
Melati Wijsen was thrilled with the news. But she says there's still lots of work to be done spreading the no-plastic gospel not just in Bali and Indonesia but around the globe.
So Bye Bye Plastic Bags is multiplying. ""We're actually now in 28 locations around the world, and it's all led by young people,"" Wijsen says. ""We've created a starter kit and a handbook that guides them through this process of how to start a movement.""
She says this global expansion is one of the most inspiring parts of being part of Bye Bye Plastic Bags ""because ... we literally prove that kids can do things, and Bye Bye Plastic Bags has become this platform where kids can feel like their voices are being heard.""
She wants to continue being heard — and demanding change. And she wants other young people to do the same: ""For us, everything is happening in our lifetime, right? So we have to be the ones to start working toward the future and the world that we want to be a part of.""
In addition to efforts in Bali, the Indonesian government has pledged to do its part in eliminating the scourge of plastic pollution. It's committed to reducing plastic pollution by 70 percent by 2025. Melati Wijsen will be closely monitoring their efforts.
She's graduated from high school but is committed to her campaign: ""This is my No. 1 focus right now,"" she says. ""It consumes almost every thought in my body. I mean, it's like a full-time job.""
Is she obsessed or just focused? ""A healthy chunk of both,"" she says, laughing, adding that her mother helps keep her balanced. ""Some days, she'll just be like, 'Melati, take a day off, like go to the beach with your friends and just don't pick up the plastic, just sit there.' "" She is going to the beach — on Feb. 16, when Bye Bye Plastic Bags is planning its biggest beach cleanup ever. Correction Jan. 27, 2019
An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled three references to Melati and Isabel Wijsen's last name as Wisjen."

Editor's note: On Thursday, President Trump said on Twitter he had canceled a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing intensifying Russian aggression toward Ukraine.
In late September, the Ukrainian navy announced that two of its vessels had successfully traveled from the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov, passing through waters controlled by the Russian ""aggressor"" and exercising Ukraine's maritime rights under international law. Notes Crimea, which Russia seized in 2014, is shown with stripes on the map.

A Ukrainian news channel hailed the move as ""a brilliant and risky operation under the enemy's nose,"" while Russian media mocked the ""rusty"" ships that had ""crawled"" past the Crimean Peninsula.
On Sunday, three more Ukrainian vessels attempted to make the same journey. This time, the Russian coast guard intercepted the Ukrainians, ramming a tugboat and firing on the gunboats.
Russian authorities said that unlike before the passage in September, the Ukrainian vessels had failed to request permission and ignored orders to stop. Russia seized the three boats and took the two dozen crew members prisoner, several of whom had been injured in the clash.
Ukraine insisted on its freedom of navigation and said its seamen had become the victims of an unprovoked attack.

It is not by chance that the 4 1/2-year conflict between Ukraine and Russia has taken on a naval dimension. For Kiev, keeping the Sea of Azov open to its ships is more than just a matter of legal principle — it's a strategic and economic imperative. For the Kremlin, the challenge posed by Ukraine's tiny navy is almost entirely symbolic.
While there are real fears in Kiev of all-out war, neither country could afford a serious escalation. Following fierce combat in the first year of the conflict, the Kremlin has largely stuck to prosecuting a low-level war with occasional flare-ups. The naval skirmish over the Sea of Azov is primarily about Russia imposing on Ukraine the irreversibility of its annexation of Crimea.
The Sea of Azov is a shallow body of water that Ukraine shares with Russia. Its only access to the open seas is through the Kerch Strait, which connects it to the Black Sea.

After Russia occupied and seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, the Kremlin gained de facto control over both sides of the Kerch bottleneck — even if practically no other country recognized the Russian annexation de jure. In May, Russian President Vladimir Putin personally opened a 12-mile-long bridge over the Kerch Strait . The Crimean Peninsula, which juts into the Black Sea from the Ukrainian mainland, was literally cemented to Russia.
Putin's bridge is a symbol of Russia's claim on Crimea. Since Sunday's skirmish, it has also become the physical gateway to the Sea of Azov. To prevent the three Ukrainian boats from passing under the bridge, Russia placed a cargo ship below it.
Ukraine depends on the port of Mariupol to export grain and steel via the Sea of Azov. After Ukrainian authorities said Russian forces were disrupting shipping in that sea, the government in Kiev announced its intention to build a naval base at the port of Berdyansk. Enlarge this image

""Russia's purpose is to occupy the Azov Sea, the same way it did Crimea. This is a brutal violation of international law, and we cannot accept it,"" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told The Washington Post in September. ""We have absolutely clear legal status in the Azov Sea. Russia has no right to attack or stop our vessels.""
When the first two Ukrainian naval boats passed under the Kerch bridge to the Sea of Azov that same month, Poroshenko thanked the crews for a ""perfectly executed order"" and said the two aging vessels would be stationed at the new base. A few days later, Poroshenko traveled to Baltimore to officially receive two U.S. Coast Guard patrol boats that will be delivered to Ukraine next year.
Ukraine is no match for Russia in terms of sea power.
After Ukraine gained independence from Moscow in 1991, most of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet ended up going to Russia. In an agreement that would later prove fateful, Ukraine allowed Russia to use the Crimean port of Sevastopol as the main base for the Russian Black Sea Fleet. When Putin ordered the occupation of Crimea in February 2014, Russian forces with unmarked uniforms and vehicles fanned out across the peninsula from Russian Black Sea Fleet facilities.
Putin justified Russia's takeover as the free choice of Russian-speaking Crimeans who feared Ukrainian nationalists coming to power after street protests in Kiev brought down a Kremlin-backed government. Putin also said he couldn't countenance the presence of ""NATO sailors"" in Sevastopol should Ukraine one day join the U.S.-led alliance. Enlarge this image

Ukraine's navy estimates it lost at least 80 percent of its assets and capabilities after the annexation of Crimea, as its most important bases were located on the peninsula. Russia's seizure of the two gunboats on the weekend is a further blow.
After the clash, Poroshenko called Russia's actions at sea "" a new stage of aggression ."" If Russia's war against Ukraine had previously been clandestine, he said, Sunday's incident was an open attack. Poroshenko warned that new intelligence suggested ""an extremely serious threat of a land-based operation against Ukraine"" that warranted the imposition of martial law.
Domestic opponents of the unpopular president accused him of planning to use martial law as a way to suspend an election scheduled for March 31. Poroshenko only got Ukraine's boisterous parliament to approve the measure once he had watered down his proposal by reducing martial law — which entered into force Wednesday — to 30 days from 60, limiting it to border regions and promising not to postpone the election.
Sonya Koshkina, the editor of the Kiev news site lb.ua, wrote that Poroshenko's lack of transparency in pushing through martial law had increased ""the gap between the government and the Ukrainian people."" Ukrainian journalist Maxim Eristavi warned that martial law itself could crush Ukraine's fledgling democracy .
While Putin blamed Poroshenko for a pre-election ""provocation"" to boost his sagging popularity, the flare-up in tensions doesn't exactly hurt the Russian president domestically either.
After his triumphant re-election to a fourth term in March, Putin's approval ratings have taken a hit amid anger over the government's raising of the retirement age, rising fuel prices and tax hikes. The portion of Russians who say they trust Putin has dropped 20 percentage points to 39 percent within less than a year, according to the independent Levada Center. His popularity was at an all-time high after the annexation of Crimea.
Ukraine's biggest problem in its struggle with its giant neighbor is keeping the world's attention — especially that of the United States.
While the leaders of NATO, the European Union and Germany spoke out against Russia's seizure of the Ukrainian boats and their crews, President Trump left it to his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, to condemn the move as an ""outrageous violation of sovereign Ukrainian territory.""
In a Monday interview with The Washington Post , Trump suggested he may cancel a meeting with Putin planned for later this week as a result of the naval clash.
But in a White House briefing the next day, national security adviser John Bolton made no mention of any cancellation and indicated that Haley had spoken the administration's final word on the Kerch Strait incident."
The Legacy Of 'The Godfather' At 50: How It Sparked One Afghan Man's Imagination,www.npr.org,,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/03/09/701734022/opinion-how-the-godfather-sparked-imagination-in-afghanistan,"Mario Puzo is the author of The Godfather .

It's hard to forecast the influence a work of art may have. Fifty years ago, Mario Puzo wrote a book in his basement after his first two novels had won splendid reviews but sold poorly.
In 1969, The Godfather was published.
One of the more than 30 million copies sold wound up in a pile of books on the street in Kabul, Afghanistan, in the mid-1990s. All Western literature, from Cervantes to Shakespeare to, well, Puzo, had been removed from the library during Afghanistan's civil war. Afghans would buy the books to burn the pages for heat, then tie the covers around their feet as makeshift shoes.
A young student named Zalmai Yawar saw a copy of The Godfather and placed it in a heap of books he hauled off in his arms for about 8 cents. Zalmai says that because it was a paperback, it wouldn't make good shoes, so he decided to try to read it.
He didn't read or write English. English education had been forbidden under Soviet domination, but Zalmai still had his father's old English-Pashto dictionary and translated the novel, in secret, word by word.
And he loved it. He saw The Godfather as a story of tribal rivalries, blood grudges and family loyalties.
When the Taliban came to power in 1996, Zalmai says he learned to look away from the religious police, who often beat people on the street for imagined disobedience, because he recalled a passage from The Godfather in which Don Vito Corleone counsels, ""Never let anyone ... know what you are thinking.""
When producer Peter Breslow and I came to Kabul to report on the war in 2002, Zalmai was our indispensable interpreter and guide. After he told us how he loved The Godfather , we began to call him ""consigliere"" and ""Zally,"" à la ""Sally,"" a name straight out of the story.
I remember a night in the hills of Bamiyan, where the Taliban had blown up statues of Buddha and left behind mass graves. Zally told me to look into the sky and said, ""When you live in the mountains, like we do, the stars become your neighbors.""
During Afghanistan's civil war, Zalmai Yawar translated The Godfather using his father's old English-Pashto dictionary. David Riese hide caption toggle caption During Afghanistan's civil war, Zalmai Yawar translated The Godfather using his father's old English-Pashto dictionary. David Riese
Zalmai Yawar came to the United States after Peter and I returned. He graduated from Amherst College in 2006. He's studying for his Ph.D. in geology at Indiana University, where Zally and his adviser help a group of geologists analyze images from the Mars Science Lab.
I think Mario Puzo would appreciate how an old copy of his book about blood and love wound up on a pile on another side of the world, just in time to nourish a young man's imagination. Art can lead to the most amazing places."

The 40 days of Lent, which began last week, are a time when many Christians around the world decide to voluntarily give up bad habits or luxuries. This year, it might be time we all consider how to give up – or at least reduce – our reliance on disposable products .
A year ago, I decided to create a more environmentally friendly and sustainable kitchen, focusing particularly on reducing my use of disposable products such as plastic sandwich bags, aluminum foil and paper towels.
It's worth the effort: Americans toss 185 pounds of plastic per person each year while also going through 13 billion pounds of paper towels as a nation. Aluminum foil sounds like a ""natural"" alternative to a lot of people, but it can actually take a hundred years or more to biodegrade. If composting kitchen scraps or reusing old coffee grounds for a body scrub seems like a step too far, there are a few simple ways to reduce the environmental footprint of your kitchen without sacrificing modern conveniences.
I'm not going to sugarcoat my experience. It takes commitment and a willingness to change long-held habits. In creating my sustainable kitchen, I tried a lot of different alternative products and some plain old common sense; the result, however, has been worth the effort. I'm recycling more and relying less on single-use products. The kicker: I'm saving money too.
Want to reduce reliance on plastics in your kitchen? Here are four steps that I found can stand the test of time:
Invest in alternative storage. I'm not kidding when I say that I used to really love plastic storage bags, from snack-size to gallon-size zip-top bags — so this was, perhaps, the biggest challenge for me. Switching to reusable storage bags was a financial investment up front, but the cost was reasonable considering that I previously spent at least $100 annually on disposable plastic bags and wrap. My favorites: Stashers, heavy-duty reusable silicone zip-top bags that can go from the freezer to the microwave ($10 to $20 each), and Food Huggers, silicone disks that slip over the ends of cut pieces of fruits and vegetables ($12.95 for a set of five), are functional and durable (except for that avocado-shaped Hugger, which I want to love but it never really fits correctly). Fabrics coated in beeswax are handy for wrapping sandwiches or oddly shaped pieces of food and for covering bowls; variety packs from Bee's Wrap, Abeego, and Etee all run about $18, while Trader Joe's has a pack for under $10, but you can also make your own . For packing lunches, consider the highly affordable Japanese bento box , designed with food compartments that negate the need for disposable wraps. The proof is in the pudding: I haven't purchased any disposable plastic bags for a full year.
Recycle. Really recycle. Americans are estimated to recycle just 30 percent of the recyclable materials that they consume each day. Plastic and glass bottles and jars, aluminum cans and newspaper are common items that we've gotten used to throwing in the recycling bin, but milk, eggs, Tetra Pak cartons, pizza boxes and plastic deli and pet food containers are also items that may be accepted at local recycling centers ; check online periodically in your local jurisdiction for recycling updates. TerraCycle offers a pack-and-ship zero-waste box for a wide variety of non-organic kitchen items, from party supplies to silicone or mixed-material food containers. The company recommends getting together a group of friends, neighbors or co-workers to purchase and contribute to the box. (They cost from $130 to $475 and range in size from 11"" x 11"" x 20"" to 15"" x 15"" x 37"", but the largest box — split among a group or sponsored by an employer — can be the most cost-effective.) Once the filled box is returned to TerraCycle, the company will sort the waste into four categories (fabrics, metals, fibers and plastics) that are then recycled, upcycled or reused — depending on the type of material. The company also works with a wide range of manufacturers to offer free recycling of individual hard-to-recycle items, like Brita water filters and Clif Bar energy bar wrappers.
Keep it clean and eco-friendly at the same time. I'm a clean freak and used to go through an unseemly amount of paper towels on a daily basis, but it's easy enough to take old T-shirts or towels and cut them up to use to wipe down surfaces. (If you're cleaning surfaces that have been in contact with raw meat, poultry or fish, throw those towels in the washing machine to get them really clean.) I'm also a fan of bamboo paper towels, which have the look and feel of traditional paper towels, yet are made from a highly renewable source and also break down in landfills in just 45 days. Better yet, they can be reused up to 100 times. I can attest to how sturdy they are because I bought a single roll of bamboo paper towels for $7 a full year ago and still have more than half the roll left, using a single bamboo towel to clean my countertops and stove for a few weeks until it's worn out (rinse the sheet in hot water, then wring and let air dry). When I consider that I probably spent up to $15 a month on single-use paper towels before, that roll of bamboo paper towels was a huge bargain. As for kitchen sponges, keep an eye out for those made with natural materials, because typical polyurethane sponges cannot be recycled and end up in landfills.
Think before you buy. In our disposable society, it's easy to purchase items that are convenient but not sustainable — and more environmentally friendly options are generally available once you know what to look for. Juice boxes that include plastic straws, dishwasher tabs individually wrapped in plastic and coffee makers that use K-Cups are all examples of items that can create additional waste. When grocery shopping, ask yourself if you really need to use individual plastic bags in the produce section for those lemons, potatoes or apples. Consider packaging as you peruse the shelves for your favorite purchases, from cookies to pasta to frozen pizza. For instance, the plastic window on that pasta box may make it convenient for you to see what the pasta inside looks like, but the mixed-material container can be a problem for some recycling facilities. When purchasing bulk pantry or other household items online from companies like Amazon or Jet, ask to have them shipped in as few boxes as possible to cut down on the number of boxes you receive, and if you get a single small item sent in a huge box, let the company know that you'd prefer that it pay more attention to how it is packaging items for delivery.
