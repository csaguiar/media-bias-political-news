Resignation of Homeland Security's acting deputy secretary continues Trump shakeup,www.foxnews.com,Gregg Re,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-homeland-security-shakeup-continues-with-acting-deputy-secretarys-abrupt-resignation,"Claire Grady was technically the next in line to replace Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned Sunday. But Trump chose Kevin McAleenan, the head of Customs and Border Protection, as acting secretary. That meant Grady had to resign or be fired. Two officials with direct knowledge of the decision, speaking anonymously to The Associated Press, said Grady was pressed to quit.

In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Nielsen said Grady had offered her resignation, writing that ""her sound leadership and effective oversight have impacted every DHS office and employee and made us stronger as a Department.""
Nielsen added: ""I am thankful for Claire’s expertise, dedication & friendship & am filled w gratitude for her exemplary service to DHS & to our country. I wish her all the best in her future endeavors.""
Grady is a longtime civil servant with more than 28 years&apos; experience at the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security.
On Monday, in another DHS shakeup, officials said Secret Service Director Randolph Alles was stepping down.
Sources told Fox News on Monday that Alles was notified 10 days ago to ""prepare an exit plan,"" in a signal that a transition in leadership at Homeland Security was imminent.
Trump has long signaled his displeasure with the rising number of illegal immigrants attempting to enter the country. The U.S. Border Patrol this week said it has set a new monthly record for apprehensions of families at the southern border, driven primarily by a surge of parents and children leaving Central America.

The agency said Tuesday that it apprehended 92,607 people at the U.S.-Mexico border in March.
Just over 53,000 of the people apprehended were parents and children traveling together, which the Border Patrol refers to as ""family units."" That breaks a record set in February, when the agency apprehended 36,000 parents and children. Another 8,975 were children traveling alone.
The large numbers of families have forced many line agents into humanitarian roles and have strained detention facilities built when the Border Patrol primarily apprehended single adult men.

"Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan says China is America's biggest threat, and southern border situation an 'emergency'",www.foxnews.com,Paulina Dedaj,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/acting-defense-secretary-patrick-shanahan-says-china-is-americas-biggest-threat-and-southern-border-situation-an-emergency,"Published 9 mins ago Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan says China is America's biggest threat, and southern border situation an 'emergency' Shanahan: The best possibility for peace in Afghanistan is at hand Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan said China is the No. 1 threat to U.S. security. He also spoke about America's immigration situation, saying that sending troops to the southern border is not an unprecedented mission. In an exclusive interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier on Tuesday, Shanahan seemed to echo President Trump's sentiment that the biggest threat America faces is the modernization of China.
“China is a threat economically and diplomatically. I think it's time we address some of these issues -- militarization of the South China Sea, the Communist Chinese Party launching cyberattacks against the U.S., theft of intellectual property, and a significant expansion of military capability.”
WHO IS PATRICK SHANAHAN? A LOOK AT TRUMP’S NEW ACTING SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
“It’s a world we need to confront.”
On another subject, Shanahan addressed the escalating tensions at the southern border, which Trump visited last week.it. He disputed reports of a tense confrontation between Trump and Kirstjen Nielsen, who resigned from her position as Homeland Security secretary over the weekend.
He also called circumstances at the border -- scene of surging numbers of asylum seekers and migrants -- as an “emergency” that calls for some focused conversation.
“I saw a lot of intensity to solve a problem, that's not tension,"" he said. ""This is a very focused effort. The border is a serious situation.”
Shanahan said it isn’t unusual that the president would ask for troops to be sent to the southern border. He noted that the two previous administrations had similar arrangements: “This isn’t a new one.”
KIRSTJEN NIELSEN MAKES FIRST PUBLIC COMMENTS AFTER RESIGNATION AS DHS BOSS
Shanahan also spoke about military strategy in the Middle East and suggested that while the U.S. is still actively “at war,” peace talks are underway. This, in spite of a Taliban attack that killed three Army soldiers on Monday.
“They gave the ultimate sacrifice for which we can never repay,” he said, offering his condolences. “We’re at war. What you see are the casualties of war. In parallel, there is a peace negotiation process, and probably the best possibility of peace in 40 years is at hand.”
Shanahan said that the DOD is exercising the “South Asia Strategy,” which requires peace talks with the Taliban to work. Video
“I'm hopeful, this is a real possibility for peace.”
He did not comment on the potential for future deployments, saying he and the president “don’t talk troop movements and we don’t talk troop levels.”
Shanahan, who was a Boeing executive, was asked whether his experience with the company affected his work as acting secretary."

Capri Cafaro: Tim Ryan is the 2020 Democrat that Republicans should worry about,www.foxnews.com,Capri Cafaro,04-09-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/capri-cafaro-tim-ryan-is-the-2020-democrat-that-republicans-should-worry-about,"Democratic Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan introduced himself to the nation on the daytime talk show, ""The View."" He followed his public announcement with a rally in his congressional district and an obligatory appearance on one of the Sunday shows. I’m sure there are some out there who are rolling their eyes at the prospect of yet another candidate in an already crowded Democratic primary. Even more are probably asking, “Who is Tim Ryan and why should I care?”
Tim Ryan is my congressman, and you should care because he is one of the few Democrats, if not the only one, who has a real shot taking on President Trump in a general election. I have known Tim Ryan for the better part of two decades. We are from the same county and both served our community — four years apart — in the same state Senate seat.
Before I go any further, I want to make some things very clear. Tim Ryan did not ask me to write this article. We have not discussed what I would say in this column. I did alert him to the fact that I was planning to write a piece on his presidential bid. That’s as far as it goes. So I want you to know this article is not some inside job set up by the Ryan camp. It also has nothing to do with any future political aspirations some think I have. I am simply stating my views about a candidate who I think can win and why.
Ryan has been the underdog throughout his political career. He won a seat in the state Senate by beating much more well-known and established candidates. His success was built on sheer sweat equity — by going door to door and developing a grassroots movement from scratch.
A few years later, Ryan beat a long-time incumbent for a congressional seat that changed due to redistricting. No one thought a kid under 30 was going to beat a seasoned member of Congress, but he did. Ryan’s underdog story can similarly propel him to defy the odds on the national stage.
What makes Ryan different from the rest of the Democratic field? He grew up in the heart of the American industrial Midwest. He represents communities in northeastern Ohio that voted Democrat for generations — until Donald Trump came along. Unlike many candidates who are veering to the far left, Ryan understands that the economy, education and health care are the issues that drive heartland voters.
From the first interviews of his presidential campaign, Ryan has been speaking out about the perils of China, the need to reform trade, and to invest in reinvigorating communities that have been left behind. On CBS’ ""Face The Nation,"" Ryan noted that such revitalization efforts would need a balanced partnership between the public and private sector.
A well-executed 50 state delegate strategy could spell primary victory for Ryan.
Tim is an approachable, straight-talking former football star turned public servant. Tim could be your brother, your neighbor, or your kid’s coach. He is also quick to tell you about his yoga practice and commitment to mindfulness.
In some ways, Tim Ryan is the Gen X answer to Joe Biden. He can connect with working men and women in a genuine way while understanding the nuances of 21st century American culture, politics and economic innovation. Ryan can connect with our roots while embracing our future.
Over the last few months, Democrats have gone through love affairs with a variety of presidential hopefuls, from Kamala Harris to Beto O’Rourke. I happen to think this crowded Democratic primary plays to Tim Ryan’s advantage. With so many candidates occupying the progressive corner of the party, it opens up an opportunity for someone more moderate to consolidate votes and campaign contributions from across the country — while the progressives are competing over the same slice of electoral pie. A well-executed 50 state delegate strategy could spell primary victory for Ryan.
Ryan is the Democrat best positioned to beat Trump because he is young, from the Midwest and able to win with Democrats who voted for Trump in 2016. And the GOP is already showing signs of concern about Ryan. The Republican National Committee wasted no time to take shots at him, calling Ryan a “backbencher … who has no chance of becoming president.”
It sounds like Ryan becoming president is exactly what Republicans are worried about.

Japan lifts evacuation in parts of Fukushima plant hometown | Fox News,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/japan-lifts-evacuation-in-parts-of-fukushima-plant-hometown,"Email TOKYO – Japan has partially lifted an evacuation order in one of the two hometowns of the tsunami-wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant for the first time since the 2011 disaster. The action taken Wednesday allows people to return about 40 percent of Okuma. The other hometown, Futaba, remains off-limits as are several other towns nearby.
Decontamination efforts have lowered radiation levels significantly in the area about 7 kilometers (4 miles) southwest of the plant where three reactors had meltdowns due to the damage caused by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.
Many former residents are reluctant to return as the complicated process to safely decommission the plant continues. Opponents of lifting the evacuation orders in long-abandoned communities say the government is promoting their return to showcase safety ahead of Tokyo Olympics. Trending in World"

"Barr assembles 'team' to look into counterintelligence investigation on Trump campaign in 2016, official says",www.foxnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barr-assembles-team-to-look-into-counterintelligence-investigation-on-trump-campaign-in-2016-official-says,"Last Update 10 hours ago Barr assembles 'team' to look into counterintelligence investigation on Trump campaign in 2016, official says Attorney General Barr says he will release a redacted version of the Mueller report Barr testifies as Mueller report release approaches; Catherine Herridge reports from Capitol Hill. Attorney General William Barr has assembled a ""team"" to investigate the origins of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, an administration official briefed on the situation told Fox News on Tuesday. Republicans repeatedly have called for a thorough investigation of the FBI's intelligence practices and the basis of the since-discredited Russian collusion narrative following the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe -- and they now appear to have assurances that a comprehensive review was underway.
The FBI's July 2016 counterintelligence investigation was formally opened by anti-Trump former FBI agent Peter Strzok. Ex-FBI counsel Lisa Page, with whom Strzok was romantically involved , revealed during a closed-door congressional interview that the FBI “knew so little” about whether allegations against the Trump campaign were “true or not true” at the time they opened the probe, noting they had just “a paucity of evidence because we are just starting down the path” of vetting the allegations.
GOHMERT UNLOADS ON 'SMIRKING' STRZOK, ASKS IF HE LIED TO CONGRESS LIKE HE LIED TO HIS WIFE WHILE CHEATING ON HER
Page later said that it was “entirely common” that the FBI would begin a counterintelligence investigation with just a “small amount of evidence.”
Former FBI Director James Comey would testify later that when agency initiated its counterintelligence probe into possible collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government, investigators ""didn't know whether we had anything"" and that ""in fact, when I was fired as director [in May 2017], I still didn't know whether there was anything to it.""

Barr told lawmakers at a contentious hearing earlier Tuesday that he was reviewing the bureau's “conduct” in particular during the summer of 2016. The attorney general's explosive testimony marked his first Capitol Hill appearance since he revealed the central findings of Mueller’s investigation, and he indicated the full report -- with redactions -- would be made public within the week.
Mueller's investigation completed last month without securing the indictment of a single American for collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice, ""despite multiple offers from Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign.""
“I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016,” Barr said at the hearing.
FBI BLAMES SYSTEM-WIDE SOFTWARE FAILURE FOR MISSING STRZOK TEXTS; STRZOK'S MUELLER PHONE TOTALLY WIPED
Barr also was questioned about the initial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants approved to surveil members of the Trump campaign, including former Trump aide Carter Page.
Republicans have called for a careful review as to whether the FBI, in violation of Page's constitutional rights and FBI procedures, misled the FISA court or withheld exculpatory information, and Barr testified that a DOJ review of the FBI's FISA practices was in progress.
The FBI's ultimately successful October 2016 warrant application to surveil Page, which relied in part on information from British ex-spy Christopher Steele – whose anti-Trump views are now well-documented – flatly accused Page of conspiring with Russians. Page has never been charged with any wrongdoing, and he since has sued the Democratic National Committee (DNC) for defamation. President Trump vows to release FISA documents
What could we learn from them? Republican strategist Ned Ryun weighs in.
The FBI assured the FISA court on numerous occasions -- in the October 2016 warrant application and in subsequent renewals -- that other sources, including a Yahoo News article, independently corroborated Steele's claims, without evidence to back it up. It later emerged that Steele was also the source of the Yahoo News article, written by reporter Michael Isikoff.
The FBI also quoted directly from a disputed Washington Post opinion piece to argue that Trump's views on providing lethal arms to Ukraine, and working towards better relations with Russia, was a possible indicator that the campaign had been compromised.
The Trump campaign, at the time, supported only providing only defensive arms to Ukrainians, and rejected a single Republican delegate's proposed platform amendment that called for providing lethal arms. Later, the Trump administration changed course and approved lethal arms sales to Ukraine.
The FBI did not provide its own independent assessment of whether the Washington Post opinion piece contained accurate information, and did not mention that the Obama administration had the same policy towards arming Ukraine as the one Trump's team supported.
The FBI also did not clearly state that Steele worked for a firm hired by Hillary Clinton's campaign. Instead, the FBI only indicated that Steele's dossier was prepared in conjunction with a presidential campaign.
TRUMP VOWS TO DECLASSIFY, RELEASE FISA DOCS, RELATED MATERIALS NOW THAT MUELLER PROBE IS OVER
Fox News exclusively obtained internal FBI text messages last month showing that just nine days before the FBI applied for the Page FISA warrant, bureau officials were battling with a senior Justice Department official who had ""continued concerns"" about the ""possible bias"" of a source pivotal to the application.

Fox News also has been told the Justice Department's Inspector General (IG) was looking separately into whether Comey mishandled classified information by including a variety of sensitive matters in his private memos.
A DOJ court filing on Monday night revealed that Comey incorporated into his private documents, among other key details, the name and code name of a confidential human source.

"Jobs, caste and giveaways: Indian voters go to the polls",www.foxnews.com,ASHOK SHARMA,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/jobs-caste-and-giveaways-indian-voters-go-to-the-polls,"The last time the BJP sought a second term was 2004, when it spent millions on an ad blitz projecting India as an economic powerhouse. The voters didn&apos;t buy it. Election results showed that people voted according to their caste, an ancient hierarchy in India that is outlawed by the constitution but still vital in Indian politics.
Hindus comprise about 80% of India&apos;s 1.3 billion people, so the BJP is invoking its Hindu nationalist roots, with Modi at the forefront against the threat of Pakistan, India&apos;s Muslim-majority archrival.
Voting will take place in seven phases over six weeks beginning Thursday. Nearly 900 million people, including 15.9 million first-time voters, are eligible to cast ballots in the world&apos;s largest democratic exercise. Around a million polling stations will be set up, and voters will choose 543 members of the Lower House of Parliament.
A look at some of the key election issues and factors:
___
JOBS
Even though India continues to be one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, the Modi-led government&apos;s performance on the economy has come under criticism.
A November 2016 demonetization program aimed to curb black market money by taking some rupee notes out of circulation. But it ultimately hurt the poor, and India&apos;s central bank said later that most of the illicit funds had re-entered the banking system.
According to the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy, employment contracted in the year following demonetization by 3.5 million jobs. The think tank said unemployment reached 7.4% in December 2018, its highest rate in more than two years.
Public subsidies to farmers have failed to steady India&apos;s agricultural sector.
The first item in the opposition Congress party&apos;s election manifesto describes a plan for creating jobs. It also promises an income subsidy program for the poorest families and for farmers.
___
KASHMIR
Amid growing scrutiny of Modi&apos;s economic record, a suicide attack in Kashmir killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers in February, helping the BJP hone its nationalist pitch.
Analysts say Indian airstrikes inside Pakistan in response to the attack gave Modi a pre-election boost. BJP leaders quickly made national security a central plank of their campaign.
In northern parts of the country bordering Pakistan, anti-Pakistan sentiment has always been strong because of the bloodshed during the countries&apos; partition in 1947 and three wars since then.
But anti-Muslim sentiment in India has become more common and more violent since the BJP came to power in 2014. At least three dozen Muslims have been lynched by self-styled Hindu vigilante groups or mobs on suspicion of illegally moving cows, sacred to Hindus, or eating beef, according to Human Rights Watch.
___
CASTE
The BJP is mainly supported by upper-caste Hindus, while struggling to make headway with lower-caste voters and non-Hindus.
Successive governments have sought to redress discrimination against those on the lower rungs by setting up quotas for government jobs and university spots.
Currently, just under half of all government jobs and places in state-funded schools are allocated to the lower castes.
With an eye toward elections, Modi&apos;s government last year passed a law carving out 10% quotas for lower-income Indians belonging to higher castes.
___
POLITICAL PUZZLE
Modi has been on an electoral blitzkrieg across this vast country, promoting government development projects while blasting the alleged corruption within the opposition Congress party, a dynasty that began with India&apos;s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.
Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi ruled the country for about a half a century after India won independence from Britain in 1947. Rajiv Gandhi&apos;s son, Rahul Gandhi, is now the Congress party leader and a potential candidate for prime minister if the opposition can stitch an alliance to stop the Modi juggernaut.
That&apos;s easier said than done. Despite Congress victories in three key state elections in December, bucking a string of losses to the BJP since 2014, Gandhi has struggled to marshal widespread support for his beleaguered party, even after bringing his popular sister, Priyanka Gandhi, into the fold.
The Gandhis would have to unite the opposition in order to take on BJP candidates in the vote-rich states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Delhi. A split in opposition votes would likely benefit the BJP.
___
GIVEAWAYS
Giveaways are essential in Indian politics.
Some 270 million people — roughly 22% of the country&apos;s population — live in poverty, making giveaways particularly attractive to voters.
In the past, farmworkers were offered cows and goats.
In its interim budget in January, the Modi-led government announced that farmers would be paid 6,000 rupees ($85) annually, benefiting as many as 120 million households.
The Congress party waived farmers&apos; bank loans in the three states it won in December. It promised in its election manifesto to waive outstanding farmer loans elsewhere, and to decriminalize farmer loan defaults.
___
SYMBOLS
A ladder, hand pump, bicycle, bow and arrow, bungalow, book, mango and banana are just some of the many objects voters will see on their electronic ballots, symbols of the dozens of political parties and independent candidates in the fray.
Since only about a fifth of India&apos;s population could read or write at the time of the country&apos;s first election in 1951, the symbols were introduced on ballot papers to help the unlettered cast their votes.
Nearly three-quarters of Indians can now read, but the icons remain evocative political symbols.
Among the best-known symbols are the lotus flower for the governing BJP, and the outstretched palm-facing hand for Congress.
The Aam Aadmi Party, or the Common Man&apos;s Party, which rules the state of Delhi, chose a broom as its election symbol, reflecting its pledge to sweep the political system clean of corruption.

"Leslie Marshall: Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez are in a power struggle, with Pelosi winning News",www.foxnews.com,Leslie Marshall,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/leslie-marshall-pelosi-and-ocasio-cortez-are-in-a-power-struggle-with-pelosi-winning,"While Pelosi is a practical politician looking to pass legislation that can become law, Ocasio- Cortez seems more interested in advocating revolutionary changes that can excite those on the far left – but have no chance of becoming law. In an interview published Monday in USA Today , Pelosi didn’t criticize Ocasio-Cortez by name, but it was obvious who the speaker was referring to her when Pelosi said: “While there are people who have a large number of Twitter followers, what&apos;s important is that we have large numbers of votes on the floor of the House.”
USA Today also Quote: d Pelosi as saying: “I’m a progressive from San Francisco. I think I can have some credentials on the left, as a person who has represented a very liberal city. But you have to govern mainstream.”
Ocasio-Cortez, a freshman House member who calls herself a socialist and represents part of New York City, has nearly 4 million Twitter followers. She’s been the focus of an enormous amount of media attention and received both praise and criticism for her advocacy of radical positions, such as supporting big tax increases for the wealthy and massive new government programs.
One of the programs Ocasio-Cortez has called for is the Green New Deal, which would dramatically alter American society in an effort to reduce climate change and income inequality.
The Green New Deal calls for ending the use of oil, natural gas and coal to produce energy in 10 years; creating a single-payer health care system for everyone in the U.S.; guaranteeing everyone who wants to work a federal job; providing a guaranteed income even to people “unwilling to work;” providing universal access to healthful foods; upgrading every home and commercial building in the nation for energy efficiency; tuition-free public colleges; and other actions.
Pelosi is 79 and nearing the end of her long career. Ocasio-Cortez is only 29 – young enough to be Pelosi’s granddaughter – and is just beginning what seems to be a very bright (and potentially long) political future.
Critics say the Green New Deal would be impossible to achieve and unaffordable, costing as much as $93 trillion – or the equivalent of $600,000 for every U.S. household.
At the start of the current congressional session in January, it seemed that Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez were going to be sisters-in-arms, fighting for the Democratic agenda and against President Trump. The strong women shared the cover of Rolling Stone magazine with smiles on their faces. And Ocasio-Cortez cast her vote for Pelosi to become speaker of the House.
But what has transpired since seems to be a power struggle between two women with two entirely different backgrounds and two very different political styles.
Pelosi is 79 and nearing the end of her long career. Ocasio-Cortez is only 29 – young enough to be Pelosi’s granddaughter – and is just beginning what seems to be a very bright (and potentially long) political future. She’s too young to run for president, but her most enthusiastic supporters have called for her candidacy once she hits the minimum age of 35 to be eligible to hold our nation’s highest office.
One could argue that Pelosi is looking at what she and the Democratic-controlled House can accomplish in the short-term, helping to secure her legacy. In contrast, Ocasio-Cortez is looking at far-reaching ideas to transform America in the long run. In other words, Pelosi is concerned with today, Ocasio-Cortez with tomorrow.
For those keeping score, Pelosi – with the power of the speakership – has been winning the battles between her mainstream Democrats and Ocasio-Cortez’s smaller socialist faction of the party. Sometimes it seems like Pelosi is the adult in the room, schooling the newcomer as to how things are done in Washington.
Let’s take a look at the Green New Deal. Although Ocasio-Cortez proposed it, she must realize it has little chance of approval even in the Democratic-controlled House, and no chance of approval in the Republican-controlled Senate. And to no one’s surprise, President Trump has made clear that he opposes it.
Pelosi is clearly a strong believer in the old saying that “politics in the art of the possible.” She understands that the Green New Deal is not only too ambitious to become law but faces too many hurdles to be funded and implemented.
And Ocasio-Cortez has at times acted more like an outsider protesting the status quo than an insider elected to pass legislation. Last November – after she was elected but before she took her House seat – she joined environmental activists storming Pelosi’s office and live-streaming the event. Pelosi calmly said she supported the enthusiasm of the demonstrators, but clearly stood her ground.
Ocasio-Cortez stood down. And when Pelosi put together a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, she selected Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., to lead it. Ocasio-Cortez isn’t even on the committee, which will consider legislation dealing with climate change.
Pelosi has proven for decades that she an extraordinarily skilled negotiator and legislative tactician. She has earned respect from leaders in both parties, including President Trump, who we caught kissing her on the cheek after their most recent meeting.
And while Ocasio-Cortez is focused on far-left ideological purity in the Democratic Party – she was elected by defeating a veteran mainstream Democratic House member in a primary – Pelosi is focused on ensuring Democrats keep majority control of the House with as many seats as possible. That means Pelosi will support Democratic moderates who can win in districts that voted for Trump in the presidential election.
For now, Pelosi and Ocasio-Cortez can coexist in the Democratic Party. But in the 2020 general election the two will have to learn how to unite – not only on issues, but in support of candidates who can win.
Without unity among Democrats – in the center, left and far left – Democrats could face a repeat of the 2016 election, when Republican Trump captured the White House and Republicans kept majority control of both the House and Senate. That’s the last thing any Democrat should want to see.

Tukwila Police released footage Tuesday that showed the moment when Tom and Linda Cook’s Ford Edge was struck by the wooden utility pole with live wires.
Police responded to the emergency call Friday at around 3:50 p.m. that the vehicle was struck by a powerline. First responders had to wait about an hour to pull the Cooks from the SUV because they had to wait for the power to be turned off.

“Just by looking at the damage to the vehicle on scene, it appeared that the injuries would be serious and or even fatal,” Tukwila Police said in a statement.
""Seeing the photos of the vehicle, if I had seen those photos as a bystander or after the fact and I looked at the photos, I would have said somebody died in the car,"" Tom Cook told KOMO-TV.
Two people were trapped in the SUV for about an hour after several power poles came crashing down on East Marginal Way on Friday, according to Tukwila police. (Ellen M. Banner/The Seattle Times via AP)
“The firefighters said... had it hit to the left or the right, it would have come down on one of us.""
The two were rushed to a nearby hospital where they were treated for minor cuts and bruises and released that same night.
Seattle City Light later revealed that 26 utility poles came down on Friday, affecting approximately 16,500 people. Those poles had last been inspected in 2016 and none were identified as “posing a public safety hazard” at the time.

Red Cross visits to Venezuela jails include military prisons,www.foxnews.com,JOSHUA GOODMAN and JAMEY KEATEN,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/red-cross-visits-to-venezuela-jails-include-military-prisons,"The fact that the visits include military prisons, which hadn&apos;t been previously reported, was confirmed to The Associated Press by a human rights lawyer and family members of those detained. International Red Cross President Peter Maurer on Wednesday wraps up a five-day visit to Venezuela, where the Geneva-based group is among international organizations trying to carve out a space to deliver badly needed humanitarian aid and technical assistance free of the winner-take-all politics contributing to the country&apos;s turmoil.
Red Cross representatives visit prisons every year in more than 100 countries, following an established protocol allowing it to verify conditions of confinement and hold private conversations with inmates in which they can voice complaints and send messages to loved ones.
But the group had been denied access in Venezuela at least since 2012.
The renewed visits in Venezuela began March 11 when a Red Cross delegation visited a model prison in Caracas, the Simon Bolivar Center for the Formation of New Men. Eighty-seven foreigners are being held.
But more significant was the visit two weeks later to the military-run Ramo Verde prison outside Caracas, which holds 69 people the opposition considers political prisoners.
Sandra Hernandez, whose husband, Sgt. Luis Figueroa, has been jailed at Ramo Verde since January for leading a military uprising against Maduro, was present last week when a white-colored vehicle emblazoned with the international Red Cross&apos; logo pulled up to the prison entrance.
She was there for her once-a-week visit, delivering basic staples — pasta, rice and cheese — that have become harder to afford since she was fired from her $7-a-month job as a teacher in what she said was retaliation for her husband&apos;s opposition to the government.
She said that if not for remittances sent by a relative in Spain, her husband could starve on the scant rations provided by prison authorities.
While her husband told her he wasn&apos;t among the small group of prisoners allowed to speak with the Red Cross representatives, she was hopeful the visit would help improve dire conditions for all inmates, many of whom she said are suffering from lack of medical attention and claim to have been tortured. The AP was unable to independently verify those claims.
""It&apos;s very important they talk to prisoners and see firsthand what&apos;s happening inside,"" she said.
Red Cross officials declined to comment and the group has made little mention of the prison visits, saying only in a Tweet that it had begun visiting jails under the auspices of civilian penitentiary authorities. It made no mention of the visits to the military-run facilities. The organization commonly avoids describing such visits except in a ""confidential dialogue"" with officials
Prisons Minister Iris Varela has said the visit to the civilian facility, and others to come, were part of an effort to share with the world Venezuela&apos;s positive experience rehabilitating inmates.
Left unsaid by both sides was that the Red Cross had also secured access to military detention facilities.
The majority of people held at the Ramo Verde are military personnel accused of plotting to overthrow Maduro. Many more, including five oil executives with U.S. passports, are being held in the basement jail of the military counterintelligence headquarters in the capital.
""This is an important first step, but make no mistake, it&apos;s also an attempt by Maduro to gain legitimacy with the international community,"" said Alfredo Romero, a human rights lawyer who was told of the Red Cross visit by prison workers when trying to visit clients at Ramo Verde. ""It&apos;s not in itself going to change the government&apos;s willingness to improve conditions.""
A senior government official played down the significance of the Red Cross visits, describing them as part of a broader push to work more closely with several international agencies, including the World Food Program and the Pan American Health Organization. The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to lack of authorization to discuss those talks publicly.
The international Red Cross&apos; sister organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, recently said it had received a waiver from Maduro to deliver aid to some 650,000 people in Venezuela beginning this month. Maduro has long denied a humanitarian crisis, considering aid offers a ""Trojan horse"" to pave the way for a foreign military intervention.
Similarly, opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who is recognized by 50 nations as Venezuela&apos;s rightful leader, has tried to control the distribution of U.S.-supplied aid in a bid to weaken Maduro&apos;s grip on power.
In another attempt to counter growing criticism, Maduro last month welcomed a delegation sent by the United Nations&apos; High Commissioner for Human Rights. He previously had called such visits a politically biased threat to Venezuela&apos;s sovereignty.

Hughes risked disbarment when he told a judge in 2007 about the confession, after the client, Jerry Cashwell, had died. ""If you believe what my client told me, and I believe my client, that Mr. Hunt didn&apos;t do this, then it just becomes so terrible and so sad,"" Hughes told The Associated Press.
Hunt, 59, died alone Feb. 13 at Rex Hospital in Raleigh, where he had been taken about a week earlier for treatment of heart problems, his daughter, Heather Allen, told the AP. Prison officials didn&apos;t tell Hunt&apos;s relatives that he&apos;d been moved from Maury Correctional Institution to the hospital until the family got word he had died, Allen said. He&apos;d spent more than half his life in state prisons.
The AP received a tip that Hunt had died and is the only news organization to interview members of the families of both Hunt and the Matthews&apos; couple since his death.
Hunt, Cashwell and a third man were convicted in the deaths of Roland and Lisa Matthews, who were shot and stabbed in their home in Fayetteville. Their 2-year-old daughter was found in a bedroom, physically unharmed.
Prosecutors said the couple was killed because Roland Matthews stole marijuana from Hunt, who ran a drug ring.
The only physical evidence tying Hunt to the crimes was a lead-content comparison of bullets that Hunt owned to bullets found at the crime scene — a comparison technique the FBI abandoned in 2005 after the method faced scientific criticism. Other evidence included testimony from an associate who received immunity and from a prison informant.
That&apos;s not to say Hunt had no criminal history.
In November 1985, Hunt was sentenced for felony drug possession and other charges. He was released in September 1986. Less than a month later, on Oct. 17, 1986, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Hunt&apos;s supporters were certain the lack of physical evidence, along with Cashwell&apos;s posthumously released confession, would eventually free him in the murder case.
But it didn&apos;t. Judges repeatedly ruled against him. North Carolina&apos;s unique Innocence Inquiry Commission couldn&apos;t take his case because there was no new evidence, said Chris Mumma, executive director of the nonprofit N.C. Center on Actual Innocence, which handled Hunt&apos;s case at one point.
Yet Hunt believed until the end that he would be exonerated, his daughter said. ""He never let go of hope,"" Allen said.
He told her ""If they don&apos;t find out while I&apos;m here, hopefully the truth will come out when I&apos;m not here,"" she said. ""... He always talked about the Lord and he always believed things would come to a light one day.""
Hughes, now 67, kept Cashwell&apos;s confession secret because of attorney-client privilege until after Cashwell died by suicide in prison in 2002. Hughes signed an affidavit for Hunt&apos;s attorneys in 2004. When Hughes came forward at a hearing for Hunt in 2007, the judge admonished him and reported him to the State Bar, which declined to take action against him.
Last fall, Hughes visited Hunt for the first time in prison. They talked for more than two hours.
""He completely understood the situation I was in,"" Hughes said. ""He bore me no ill will.""
But in his last few phone calls with his daughter, Hunt shared his worries about his health and the lack of care he believed he received behind bars, Allen said. When Allen received his personal belongings from prison officials, she found complaints about his medical care.
Correction Department spokesman John Bull said laws prohibit him from discussing a prisoner&apos;s health record. He said he&apos;d share the Hunt family&apos;s concerns with prison medical officials.
The victims&apos; family, meanwhile, is certain of Hunt&apos;s guilt and relieved he&apos;s finally gone.
Roland Matthews&apos; sister, Paula Holland of Hope Mills, believes Hughes lied about Cashwell&apos;s confession. When asked what trial evidence convinced her of Hunt&apos;s guilt, Holland responded: ""Because of who he is. Because of who he was. Because of his reputation.""
Holland said her niece, Crystal Mayfield, was 22 months old when her parents were killed. She was found sitting on her bed, with her dog.
And when an exonerated ex-prisoner commented in a public Facebook post that Hunt died an innocent man, Mayfield responded: ""I am very relieved that justice has finally been served and my family can have some peace now.""
Mayfield didn&apos;t reply to a Facebook message from the AP. Her relatives said she didn&apos;t want to be interviewed.
It&apos;s not uncommon for prisoners who have evidence of innocence to die in custody. Responding to an email query, lawyers nationwide listed cases in multiple states where prisoners with strong evidence, including DNA, have died awaiting a chance to prove their innocence.
At least 21 people have been exonerated posthumously, with about half dying in prison, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.
Hunt, who learned to read and write in prison, was a woodworker. He enjoyed reading about log cabins and talked about the one he&apos;d build when free, his family said. He used plastic knives and wood from pallets to carve animal figures, then dyed them with coffee grounds and decorated them with pastel crayons, Allen said.
The victims&apos; family thinks Allen is lucky to have those memories.
""Lee Wayne Hunt was very fortunate,"" Holland said. ""His family could go to prison and visit him. The only joy we had left was putting flowers on my brother&apos;s grave. I hate it for them, but I hate it for us, too ... We didn&apos;t take his life. ... We just had to wait and bide our time.""
Hunt&apos;s supporters believe time did him no favors.
""Everything I knew about this case makes me believe he didn&apos;t do this,"" Hughes said. ""And that&apos;s pretty terrible. I had hoped this would turn out different. And it didn&apos;t. It just turned out overwhelmingly sadly.""

Bodycam footage may be shown at Minneapolis officer's trial,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/bodycam-footage-may-be-shown-at-minneapolis-officers-trial,"Mohamed Noor and his partner did not have their body cameras turned on when Noor shot Justine Ruszczyk Damond, a dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia. She was shot just minutes after she called 911 to report a possible assault in the alley behind her home in July 2017, and the officers switched on the cameras after the shooting. The judge hearing the trial initially ruled that the footage would be shown only to the jury, citing Damond&apos;s privacy and the fact that the footage shows her partially unclothed as the officers try to resuscitate her. The judge relented Monday after a challenge led by media outlets.
Noor, 33, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Damond&apos;s death. In opening statements Tuesday, his attorney said Noor was reacting to a loud noise and feared an ambush, calling the shooting ""a perfect storm with tragic consequences.""
Noor and his partner were rolling down a dark alley in response to the 911 call from Damond when a bicyclist appeared in front of them and they heard ""a bang,"" defense attorney Peter Wold said.
""It is the next split second that this case is all about,"" Wold said.
Noor fired a single shot, killing Damond, whose death rocked both countries and led to changes in the Minneapolis Police Department. The shooting came just two weeks after an officer in New York was ambushed and killed in a parked vehicle.
Attorneys for Noor, who was fired after being charged in the case and has never talked to investigators about what happened, argued that he used reasonable force to defend himself and his partner from a perceived threat. But prosecutors say there is no evidence he faced a threat that justified deadly force.
Prosecutor Patrick Lofton, in his opening remarks, questioned a statement from Noor&apos;s partner, Matthew Harrity, that he heard a thump right before the shooting. Lofton said Harrity never said anything at the scene about such a noise, instead mentioning it for the first time some days later in an interview with investigators.
Investigators found no forensic evidence to show that Damond had touched the squad car before she was shot, raising the possibility that she had not slapped or hit it upon approaching the officers, Lofton said.
Besides Noor and Harrity not having their body cameras on until after the shooting, other officers who responded to the scene did not consistently have their cameras switched on either, Lofton said.
A sergeant taking statements had her camera on when she talked to Harrity, but it was off when she talked to Noor.
""We&apos;ll never hear what he said,"" Lofton said.
Damond, 40, was a life coach who was engaged to be married in a month. Noor is a Somali American whose arrival on the force just a couple of years earlier had been trumpeted by city leaders working to diversify the police force.
Damond called 911 twice that night, then called her fiance and hung up when police arrived, Lofton said. One minute and 19 seconds later, she was holding her wounded abdomen and saying, ""I&apos;m dying,"" Lofton added.
Damond&apos;s fiance, Don Damond, was the first witness for prosecutors. Damond sobbed as he described calls from investigators the night of Justine&apos;s death, saying he wasn&apos;t told an officer had shot her until a second phone call.
He said calling Justine&apos;s father in Australia was ""painful, and traumatic, and the worst phone call I&apos;ve ever had to make in my life."" Members of Justine&apos;s family from Australia, including her father, stepmother, brother and sister-in-law, were in the courtroom Tuesday. Her father cried during portions of Damond&apos;s testimony.
Justine Damond had taken her fiance&apos;s name professionally before their marriage.
Noor&apos;s attorneys have not said whether he will testify. If he does, prosecutors may be able to introduce some evidence that the defense wanted to keep out of the state&apos;s case, including that he has refused to talk to investigators. They also could bring up a 2015 psychological test that showed Noor disliked being around people and had difficulty confronting others. Despite that test, a psychiatrist found him fit to be a cadet officer.
The shooting raised questions about Noor&apos;s training. The police chief defended Noor&apos;s training, but the chief was forced to resign days later. The shooting also led to changes in the department&apos;s policy on use of body cameras.

Lawmakers to honor victims of Pittsburgh synagogue massacre,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/us/lawmakers-to-honor-victims-of-pittsburgh-synagogue-massacre,"Last Update 7 hours ago Lawmakers to honor victims of Pittsburgh synagogue massacre Email HARRISBURG, Pa. – Victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue attack that killed 11 people last year will be remembered during a memorial service in the Pennsylvania Capitol.

Israel's Netanyahu appears headed toward 5th term as PM,www.foxnews.com,,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israels-netanyahu-appears-headed-toward-5th-term-as-pm,"The outcome affirmed Israel&apos;s continued tilt to the right and further dimmed hopes of a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Re-election will also give Netanyahu an important boost as he braces for the likelihood of criminal charges in a series of corruption scandals. With 97.4% of the vote counted, Likud and its traditional political allies were in command of a 65-55 majority in parliament. A couple of small parties were still teetering along the electoral threshold and fighting for their survival, so the final makeup of the next parliament has yet to be decided. In any case, the country now faces what could be weeks of political negotiations over the composition of a ruling coalition.
But under nearly every scenario, Netanyahu was the big winner.
The long-time Israeli leader had fought a tight, ugly race against centrist ex-military chief Benny Gantz, whose nascent Blue and White party emerged as a viable alternative to Netanyahu&apos;s decade in power. The near-final results showed it deadlocked with Likud at 35 seats. But most of its support seems to have come at the expense of the venerable Labor and leftist Meretz parties, who both earned historic lows in Tuesday&apos;s election.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu waves to his supporters after polls for Israel's general elections closed in Tel Aviv, Israel, Wednesday, April 10, 2019. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)
Together with his current Jewish ultra-Orthodox and nationalist partners, Netanyahu should have no trouble building a coalition government that has a majority in the 120-seat parliament.
With a victory, Netanyahu would capture a fourth consecutive term and fifth overall, which this summer will make him Israel&apos;s longest-ever serving leader, surpassing founding father David Ben-Gurion.
""It&apos;s a night of tremendous victory,"" Netanyahu told supporters early Wednesday. ""I was very moved that the nation of Israel once again entrusted me for the fifth time, and with an even greater trust.""
He said he had already begun talking to fellow right-wing and religious parties about forming a new coalition.
""I want to make it clear, it will be a right-wing government, but I intend to be the prime minister of all Israeli citizens, right or left, Jews and non-Jews alike,"" he said.
Netanyahu&apos;s message of unity was a sharp contrast from his campaign theme in which he accused Gantz of conspiring with Arab parties to topple him. Arab leaders accused Netanyahu of demonizing the country&apos;s Arab community, which is about 20 percent of the population.
His attacks on the Arab sector fueled calls for a boycott and appeared to result in relatively low turnout by Arab voters.
Though the Palestinian issue was rarely mentioned in the raucous campaign, Netanyahu had in the final stretch pledged for the first time to annex parts of the occupied West Bank in a desperate bid to rally his right-wing base. Netanyahu has welched on election eve promises before, but should he follow through on this one, it would mark a dramatic development and potentially wipe out the already diminishing hope for Palestinian statehood.
The 69-year-old prime minister has been the dominant force in Israeli politics for the past two decades and its face to the world. His campaign has focused heavily on his friendship with President Donald Trump and his success in cultivating new allies, such as China, India and Brazil.
But his corruption scandals created some voter fatigue. Along with two other former military chiefs on his ticket, Gantz was able to challenge Netanyahu on security issues, normally the prime minister&apos;s strong suit, while also taking aim at the prime minister&apos;s alleged ethical lapses.
Israel&apos;s attorney general has recommended charging Netanyahu with bribery, breach of trust and fraud in three cases. He will only decide on indicting him after a legally mandated hearing. Legal experts expect at least some charges to be filed, which could set the stage for a short term for Netanyahu and another round of elections soon.

The fighter jet went off the radar while flying off the eastern coast of Aomori, just about half an hour after taking off the Misawa air base with three other F-35As.
It remains unclear what caused the crash, Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya told reporters, adding that 12 other F-35s at the base will be grounded.
“We have collected parts from the jet fighter&apos;s tail fin so we [believe] it crashed,” Iwaya said, according to the BBC .
“We have collected parts from the jet fighter's tail fin so we [believe] it crashed.”

Some have warned that the crashed jet could have caused major security concern had the wreckage been first discovered by China or Russia, both of which long hoped to get their hands on the state-of-the-art military technology produced by the U.S.
Iwaya said that the pilot sent a signal to abort the mission, according to the broadcaster. Shortly after the signal, all communications with the fighter jet were lost.
Japanese military began deploying the U.S.-made F-35s since last year in an effort to ramp up defense spending amid threats from North Korea and China.
The government of Japan is also seeking to 147 F-35s, including 105 F-35As, costing about $90 million each.

When Fernand Drapeau’s wife and son reached the U.S.-Canada border on March 31, authorities stopped and searched the car. Inside they found Drapeau, who appeared to have died from a heart attack at least a day before arriving at the border, the Vancouver Sun reported.
The family cited the high cost of U.S. health care, plus the cost of shipping the body back to Quebec as the reason for not stopping at a hospital, CTV News reported.
Border officials said it was the first time that such an incident has occurred.
No charges have yet been filed in the case. Authorities are continuing to investigate. Trending in US"

Saikawa and other Nissan Motor Co. executives bowed deeply at a Tokyo hotel Monday, April 8, 2019, where the extraordinary shareholders' meeting was being held. (Sadayuki Goto/Kyodo News via AP, File) TOKYO – The lawyers for Nissan's former Chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was sent back to detention while out on bail, have filed a protest with the Japanese Supreme Court. The appeal was filed Wednesday.
Lawyer Junichiro Hironaka told reporters that Ghosn's fourth and latest arrest is unfair.
Ghosn was arrested in November, released on bail last month but re-arrested last week.
Multiple arrests and long detentions are routine in Japan, but arresting a suspect who cleared bail is unusual.
Ghosn's detention has been extended through Sunday but may be prolonged. He is charged with falsifying financial documents and breach of trust. He says he is innocent.
The latest arrest is over suspicion Nissan money paid to a dealership that was diverted to a company effectively controlled by Ghosn. Trending in World"

German news agency dpa reported that the raids early Wednesday were mainly centered on Brandenburg state and the region around Cottbus, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) southeast of the capital.
According to Brandenburg police, the investigation focuses on about 20 people with ties to Germany's hooligan, martial arts and right-wing extremist scene.
Cottbus has a comparatively large neo-Nazi scene affiliated to the city's main football team, Energie Cottbus.
The raids come a day after authorities in Austria searched dozens of homes in several states, seizing weapons and large amounts of banned propaganda material.

In this photo taken Wednesday, March 6, 2019 in Raleigh, N.C. Heather Allen holds a photo of her father, Lee Wayne Hunt, from his memorial. Even though Lee Wayne Hunt died as a prisoner found guilty of a double murder, his family says he never gave up hope of proving his innocence. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome) RALEIGH, N.C. – Lee Wayne Hunt died a prisoner, officially deemed guilty of a double murder — even though a co-defendant absolved him in a conversation with a lawyer that remained secret for decades. Attorney Staples Hughes said a client who also was convicted in the case told him not long after the 1984 slayings of a Fayetteville couple that Hunt wasn't involved. Hughes risked disbarment when he told a judge in 2007 about the confession, after the client, Jerry Cashwell, had died.
""If you believe what my client told me, and I believe my client, that Mr. Hunt didn't do this, then it just becomes so terrible and so sad,"" Hughes told The Associated Press.
Hunt, 59, died alone Feb. 13 at Rex Hospital in Raleigh, where he had been taken about a week earlier for treatment of heart problems, his daughter, Heather Allen, told the AP. Prison officials didn't tell Hunt's relatives that he'd been moved from Maury Correctional Institution to the hospital until the family got word he had died, Allen said. He'd spent more than half his life in state prisons.
The AP received a tip that Hunt had died and is the only news organization to interview members of the families of both Hunt and the Matthews' couple since his death.
Hunt, Cashwell and a third man were convicted in the deaths of Roland and Lisa Matthews, who were shot and stabbed in their home in Fayetteville. Their 2-year-old daughter was found in a bedroom, physically unharmed.
Prosecutors said the couple was killed because Roland Matthews stole marijuana from Hunt, who ran a drug ring.
The only physical evidence tying Hunt to the crimes was a lead-content comparison of bullets that Hunt owned to bullets found at the crime scene — a comparison technique the FBI abandoned in 2005 after the method faced scientific criticism. Other evidence included testimony from an associate who received immunity and from a prison informant.
That's not to say Hunt had no criminal history.
In November 1985, Hunt was sentenced for felony drug possession and other charges. He was released in September 1986. Less than a month later, on Oct. 17, 1986, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.
Hunt's supporters were certain the lack of physical evidence, along with Cashwell's posthumously released confession, would eventually free him in the murder case.
But it didn't. Judges repeatedly ruled against him. North Carolina's unique Innocence Inquiry Commission couldn't take his case because there was no new evidence, said Chris Mumma, executive director of the nonprofit N.C. Center on Actual Innocence, which handled Hunt's case at one point.
Yet Hunt believed until the end that he would be exonerated, his daughter said. ""He never let go of hope,"" Allen said.
He told her ""If they don't find out while I'm here, hopefully the truth will come out when I'm not here,"" she said. ""... He always talked about the Lord and he always believed things would come to a light one day.""
Hughes, now 67, kept Cashwell's confession secret because of attorney-client privilege until after Cashwell died by suicide in prison in 2002. Hughes signed an affidavit for Hunt's attorneys in 2004. When Hughes came forward at a hearing for Hunt in 2007, the judge admonished him and reported him to the State Bar, which declined to take action against him.
Last fall, Hughes visited Hunt for the first time in prison. They talked for more than two hours.
""He completely understood the situation I was in,"" Hughes said. ""He bore me no ill will.""
But in his last few phone calls with his daughter, Hunt shared his worries about his health and the lack of care he believed he received behind bars, Allen said. When Allen received his personal belongings from prison officials, she found complaints about his medical care.
Correction Department spokesman John Bull said laws prohibit him from discussing a prisoner's health record. He said he'd share the Hunt family's concerns with prison medical officials.
The victims' family, meanwhile, is certain of Hunt's guilt and relieved he's finally gone.
Roland Matthews' sister, Paula Holland of Hope Mills, believes Hughes lied about Cashwell's confession. When asked what trial evidence convinced her of Hunt's guilt, Holland responded: ""Because of who he is. Because of who he was. Because of his reputation.""
Holland said her niece, Crystal Mayfield, was 22 months old when her parents were killed. She was found sitting on her bed, with her dog.
And when an exonerated ex-prisoner commented in a public Facebook post that Hunt died an innocent man, Mayfield responded: ""I am very relieved that justice has finally been served and my family can have some peace now.""
Mayfield didn't reply to a Facebook message from the AP. Her relatives said she didn't want to be interviewed.
It's not uncommon for prisoners who have evidence of innocence to die in custody. Responding to an email query, lawyers nationwide listed cases in multiple states where prisoners with strong evidence, including DNA, have died awaiting a chance to prove their innocence.
At least 21 people have been exonerated posthumously, with about half dying in prison, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.
Hunt, who learned to read and write in prison, was a woodworker. He enjoyed reading about log cabins and talked about the one he'd build when free, his family said. He used plastic knives and wood from pallets to carve animal figures, then dyed them with coffee grounds and decorated them with pastel crayons, Allen said.
The victims' family thinks Allen is lucky to have those memories.
""Lee Wayne Hunt was very fortunate,"" Holland said. ""His family could go to prison and visit him. The only joy we had left was putting flowers on my brother's grave. I hate it for them, but I hate it for us, too ... We didn't take his life. ... We just had to wait and bide our time.""
Hunt's supporters believe time did him no favors.
""Everything I knew about this case makes me believe he didn't do this,"" Hughes said. ""And that's pretty terrible. I had hoped this would turn out different. And it didn't. It just turned out overwhelmingly sadly.""

Tara Aven, 46, left, and Briar Aven, 24, right, were arrested Tuesday for allegedly killing the family's grandmother and cashing her monthly checks, police said. (Yavapai County Sheriff's Office) An Arizona mother and daughter were arrested Tuesday for allegedly killing the family’s 77-year-old grandmother two years ago and continuing to cash monthly checks in her name, authorities said. Tara Aven, 46, and Briar Aven, 24, were taken into custody after officers conducted a welfare check at Sandra Aven’s home in Prescott, police said. A concerned neighbor told police he hadn’t seen the 77-year-old in a long time and was worried about her.

When police questioned Briar Aven, who lived next door to the elderly women with her mother, who is Sandra’s daughter, she said her grandmother was ""out of town and unavailable,"" police said.
Investigators found several inconsistencies in both women’s stories and entered the home, where they found the body of a deceased person believed to be Sandra Aven, the Arizona Republic reported. The body has yet to be positively identified and there was no information on a cause of death.
While being interviewed by police, the mother and daughter allegedly confessed to killing Sandra Aven in late 2017 and cashing numerous monthly payment checks in her name since then, KNXV-TV of Phoenix reported.

Gypsy Rose Lee’s son recalls moment he discovered Hollywood filmmaker Otto Preminger was his real father,www.foxnews.com,Stephanie Nolasco,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/gypsy-rose-lees-son-recalls-moment-he-discovered-hollywood-filmmaker-otto-preminger-was-his-real-father,"“Like almost any 17-year-old I suppose, I wanted a car,” the now-74-year-old recalled to Fox News. “But… my mother wouldn’t get it for me. So I went to the man whose name was on my birth certificate, who I understood was my father, although I already heard some rumors. I asked him for money to buy a car. I was seeing a therapist at the time ... and the next time I saw my therapist he said Mr. Kirkland wanted me to know that he was not my father and he couldn’t give me a car. So that got the ball rolling.” Preminger’s life from the beginning was far from ordinary. His mother was world-famous striptease artist Gypsy Rose Lee , whose life inspired the Broadway musical “Gypsy” and the 1962 film carrying the same title starring Natalie Wood . Decades later, in 1984, he would publish the memoir “Gypsy and Me” about growing up with the star (the book was republished in 2004 with the title “My G-String Mother” ).
On Wednesday, April 10th, Preminger is presenting “At Home and on the Road with Gypsy Rose Lee” at the Hollywood Heritage Museum , which highlights his personal home movies featuring his late mother. Burlesque star Dita Von Teese , who has named Lee as one of her inspirations, will be in attendance to participate in an interview with Preminger. The event will also kick off the 2019 Turner Classic Movies (TCM) Film Festival, which opens in Hollywood the following day.
While Lee wasn’t afraid to bare nearly all on stage, she initially refused to reveal the identity of Preminger’s father.

“When I finally confronted my mother with this and asked her who my father was, she said she wasn’t going to tell me,” chuckled Preminger. “‘None of your business’ is the way she put it.”
ACTRESS JOI LANSING HAD A SECRET ROMANCE WITH A YOUNG STARLET Growing up, Preminger always knew his mother was different from others. In fact, up until he was about 17 in 1961, he never really left her side.

“When I was 6 months old, my mother put me next to her on the front seat of the car and drove to Cleveland where she was playing an engagement,” said Preminger. “I was with her constantly until I was 13. And then whenever she worked in the summers until I was 17, I was by her side.”
“When did I realize she was different? Probably around five, but it wasn’t the kind of realization you would expect,” continued Preminger. “Whatever kids do on a daily basis, that’s normal. If that means being backstage and helping your mom change from one scene to the next, well, that’s normal too!”
Preminger described Lee as a doting mother who always took him on tour. And while he was exposed to the racy world of nightclubs before turning double digits, he also witnessed what made his mother a sought-after stage star.

“What made her different really from the beginning of her career in burlesque was that she had these comedic routines that she would recite as she was taking off her clothes,” said Preminger. “... So at the end of the act, she still had on her outer dress and her blouse, which covered her breasts... So you never really saw her. There would be a brief flash at the end where she pulled the dress away and go behind the curtain. But that was the finale.”
“I never try to stir up the animal in them,” Lee once said about her fans, as reported by The New York Times . “Did you ever, hold a piece of candy or a toy in front of a baby — just out of his reach. Notice how he laughs. That’s your strip audience… Bare flesh bores men.”

Preminger said that as a teen, he was determined to learn who his real father was. And after Lee extracted a promise from her son that he would never contact him, Preminger learned that his father was Hollywood filmmaker Otto Preminger .
“I was raised in nightclubs,” said Preminger. “I hardly went to the movies…. I had never seen one of my father’s pictures. I barely knew the name.”

According to Preminger, Otto knew Lee had given birth to his child in 1944. By 1948, Lee was married to her third husband, Julio De Diego, a Spanish artist who “banished” Otto from the household.
“He didn’t like Otto coming around,” said Preminger. “And although Otto had offered to help support me, my mother refused. She really wanted to be the one who raised me. She wasn’t one for dividing authority… And as for why she kept [the paternity] a secret, given her profession, given the era, it would have been a horrible scandal.”
“… After a couple of minutes, she suggested we take a walk — we being Otto and me. Otto loved to walk. We’re getting ready to go out and she says, ‘You need your coat.’ I said, ‘I don’t need my coat.’ Because I was embarrassed by it. Otto says, ‘If my son doesn’t need a coat, I don’t need a coat.’ I cannot say that without getting emotional…. We spent the next three hours walking around Paris at night with the lights, the beauty — just everything — talking about the past and future. It really was like a fairytale.”
Erik Lee Preminger said he served as his mother's dresser while on tour. (Courtesy of Erik Preminger)
As for Lee, Preminger remained close with his mother, a figure who happily tantalized her audience, but also possessed a more private side few saw.
“My mother lived a very proper life,” he said. “She never had boyfriends around. I don’t think she had a relationship aside from her third husband during my entire life. It wasn’t the way she operated. She was kind of prudish. When my girlfriend moved in with me, she was terribly upset.”
In the ‘30s Lee attempted a career in Hollywood using her less glamorous real name Louise Hovick. However, Preminger insisted his mother truly shined when she was on stage.

“She was not an actress,” he explained. “She was a personality. She had this energy and vitality — it entranced people… She talked to the audience like they were all her best friends and they loved her back.”
Lee retired from burlesque at age 42, way before her death in 1970 at age 59 from cancer. People magazine reported that Preminger shared “she decided that she was too old to take her clothes off in front of strangers anymore."" Still, Lee kept busy throughout the rest of her life, spending her final years in California, where she hosted a talk show from 1965 until 1967. She also went to Vietnam to entertain the troops and was celebrated as a writer.
People magazine added that in 1970, Otto legally adopted his son. For four years, Preminger worked for his father and learned that his infamous reputation of “Otto the Terrible” was the real deal.

“My father was an extraordinarily warm, generous, loving father,” he said. “[But] he was possibly the worst, bossiest, bullying, demanding person you can imagine. Two sides of the same coin. … He just didn’t have any patience. Whenever anybody made a mistake, grab on because you were going to hit a hurricane.”
Otto passed away in 1986 at age 80. Preminger said that toward the end of his life, his father had dementia and eventually “drifted away.”

Today, Preminger is in the process of writing about the relationship he shared with his father. And when it comes to his own life, he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“I am the luckiest person I know,” he said. “I’ve had a life that’s been blessed from birth. It’s still blessed… I just feel so lucky at every stage. Not that there weren’t some difficult moments looking back. God knows they were…. But if I would have been born into any other family, I certainly wouldn’t have had the life I lived.”

Minnesota Democrat Ilhan Omar is facing backlash after her speech at a Muslim rights group’s event in which she described the September 11, 2001 terror attacks as “some people did something.” Omar spoke at a Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) fundraiser last month, where she called upon other Muslim Americans to “make people uncomfortable” with their activism and presence in the society and criticized the Jewish state.
REP. ILHAN OMAR PROBED FOR ALLEGEDLY SPENDING $6,000 OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS ON DIVORCE ATTORNEY, PERSONAL TRAVEL
But another part of the speech surfaced on social media earlier this week, in which Omar described the terror attacks perpetrated by al Qaeda.
“CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,” Omar said at the event.
The comments from the Minnesota freshman Democrat, still reeling from a number of anti-Semitic controversies, prompted Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw to slam Omar for her description of the terror attacks.
“First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as 'some people who did something,'” Crenshaw wrote in a tweet. “Unbelievable.”
NETANYAHU, ILHAN OMAR SPAR OVER ROLE OF AIPAC'S POLITICAL MONEY: 'IT’S NOT ABOUT THE BENJAMINS'
Others have also jumped on to criticize Omar's language, urging Democrats to condemn her remarks about the largest terror attack on U.S. soil that left nearly 3,000 people dead.
""9/11 terrorists & the terror attacks they conducted are described as simply 'some people did something'? Every Democrat should be asked by the media if they disavow @IlhanMN’s statements. Every one of them,"" tweeted Andrew Pollack, father of a Parkland high school shooting victim.
""Ilhan Omar isn’t just anti-Semitic – she’s anti-American. Nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives to Islamic terrorists on 9/11, yet Omar diminishes it as: 'Some people did something.' Democrat leaders need to condemn her brazen display of disrespect,"" said GOP chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.
CAIR has been infamously listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in funding of Hamas, stemming from the case against the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development which led to millions of charitable dollars getting funneled to the Palestinian terrorist organization.
Omar’s speech at CAIR in Southern California drew hundreds of protesters waving Israeli flags and denouncing the congresswoman’s comments about Israel that were perceived as anti-Semitic.
She first came under fire for tweeting in 2012 that “Israel has hypnotized the world, may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel.”
She then drew bipartisan uproar in February after she suggested politicians in the U.S. were bought by AIPAC, a non-partisan organization that seeks to foster the relationship between the U.S. and Israel.
Omar then reignited the controversy, saying groups supportive of Israel were pushing members of Congress to have “allegiance to a foreign country,” echoing the anti-Semitic trope of dual loyalty.

New Zealand Parliament votes to ban semi-automatic weapons,www.foxnews.com,Associated Press,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/new-zealand-parliament-votes-to-ban-semi-automatic-weapons,"A bill outlawing most automatic and semi-automatic weapons and banning components that modify existing weapons was passed by a vote of 119 to 1 in the House of Representatives after an accelerated process of debate and public submission. The bill needs only the approval of New Zealand&apos;s governor general, a formality, before becoming law on Friday.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern spoke emotionally during the bill&apos;s final reading of the traumatic injuries suffered by victims of the March 15 attacks, whom she visited in Christchurch Hospital after the shootings.
""I struggle to recall any single gunshot wounds,"" Ardern said. ""In every case they spoke of multiple injuries, multiple debilitating injuries that deemed it impossible for them to recover in days, let alone weeks. They will carry disabilities for a lifetime, and that&apos;s before you consider the psychological impact. We are here for them.""
""I could not fathom how weapons that could cause such destruction and large-scale death could be obtained legally in this country,"" she said.
A 28-year-old Australian man, Brenton Tarrant, has been charged in the attacks.
Ardern, who has won international praise for her compassion and leadership since the shootings, was able to win rare bi-partisan support for a bill that makes it illegal to own a military-style semi-automatic rifle. The only dissenting voice was from the libertarian ACT Party, which has one lawmaker in Parliament.
The law includes a buy-back scheme under which owners of outlawed weapons can surrender them to police in return for compensation based on the weapon&apos;s age and condition.
Anyone who retains such a weapon after the law formally passes on Friday faces a penalty of up to five years in prison. Some exemptions have been allowed for heirloom weapons held by collectors or for professional pest control.
Ardern said lawmakers had a responsibility to act on behalf of victims of the shootings.
""We are ultimately here because 50 people died and they do not have a voice,"" she said. ""We in this house are their voice. Today we can use that voice wisely.""
""We are here just 26 days after the most devastating terrorist attacks created the darkest of days in New Zealand&apos;s history,"" she said. ""We are here as an almost entirely united Parliament. There have been very few occasions when I have seen Parliament come together in this way and I cannot imagine circumstances where that is more necessary than it is now.""
Ardern said that there was some opposition from firearms owners, but that the response to the proposed legislation was overwhelmingly positive.
""My question here is simple,"" she said. ""You either believe that here in New Zealand these weapons have a place or you do not. If you believe, like us, that they do not, you should be able to believe we can move swiftly. ""An argument about process is an argument to do nothing.""

UK's Theresa May to request Brexit delay as deadline looms,www.foxnews.com,Jill Lawless,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/world/what-next-uks-may-seeks-brexit-delay-but-eu-wants-answers,"With Brexit once again engulfed in uncertainty, a look at what could happen next: DELAY EXIT DAY
For two years, Britain was scheduled to leave the EU on March 29, 2019. But after Parliament three times rejected the divorce deal agreed between the U.K. government and the bloc, May admitted defeat and asked for more time.
Last month, the EU gave Britain until April 12 — this Friday — to pass a deal, come up with a new plan and seek a further extension, or leave without an agreement or a transition period to smooth the way.
Now May wants a bit more time. She has asked the EU to delay Brexit until June 30, in hope that&apos;ll be enough time to secure, approve and implement a deal.
The 27 other leaders of the bloc will consider the request at an emergency Brexit summit in Brussels Wednesday evening. Few favor the June 30 date. Some want a longer extension, to avoid repeated crises every few weeks.
If they fail, May says she will let Parliament vote on a variety of options, including the government&apos;s proposed deal, in hope something can command a majority.
If Britain&apos;s politicians reach agreement around a so-called ""soft Brexit,"" it could quite likely get through Parliament, and would be welcomed by the EU, allowing Britain an orderly departure in the coming months.
But it could also blast open rifts within both Conservatives and Labour. Pro-Brexit government ministers could resign, and pressure would grow on May to quit. The prime minister has already said she will resign if her Brexit deal is passed and Britain leaves the EU, and rivals are already circling, eager to succeed her.
Corbyn, meanwhile, would face rebellion from a large number of Labour lawmakers who want a new referendum on Britain&apos;s EU exit.
That instability increases the chance of an early British election, which could rearrange Parliament and break the deadlock — or result in still more stalemate.
NO BREXIT
Among pro-EU Britons, there is rising hope that Brexit can be stopped.
With one Brexit day gone and another likely to follow, the government has lost control of the timetable.
This week the government started preparing to take part in elections for the European Parliament in late May — acknowledgement that Britain likely won&apos;t have left the bloc by then, and may not leave anytime soon.
Support is growing for the idea that any Brexit deal agreed by Parliament should be put to public vote in a ""confirmatory referendum,"" with the other option being to stay in the EU. The proposal is backed by Labour and other opposition parties, plus some of May&apos;s Conservatives.
The government has ruled out holding another referendum, saying voters in 2016 made their decision to leave. But with divisions in both Parliament and in May&apos;s Cabinet, handing the decision back to the people in a new plebiscite could be seen as the only way forward.

Ilhan Omar (D-MN) calls Stephen Miller a ‘white nationalist’ on Twitter President Donald Trump on Tuesday appeared to agree with his former campaign adviser that Rep. Ilhan Omar , D-Minn., targeted ""Jews"" after she called White House aide Stephen Miller a white nationalist . Trump quoted Jeff Ballabon in a tweet that said it was ""unacceptable"" for Omar to target ""Jews""-- including Miller. Ballabon was on Fox Business Network's ""Varney & Co.""
Omar responded to Trump a few hours later, saying: “In the words of my 6 year-old daughter, “Knock it off. You’re the president.”
Omar on Monday leveled her criticism of Miller, who is Jewish, over his push for tough immigration and border security policies. In recent days, he has reportedly been influential in the political appointments of Department of Homeland Security officials. He reportedly pushed Trump to remove top department officials following the resignation of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Sunday.

“Stephen Miller is a white nationalist,"" Omar tweeted. “The fact that he still has influence on policy and political appointments is an outrage.”
Republicans have condemned Omar for her remarks on Miller. Trump called for her to resign in February after she criticized Israel, leading to accusations of anti-Semitism and drawing rebuke from both parties.

SUNA reported Wednesday that the National Congress Party is planning a rally for Thursday in the capital, Khartoum. The planned rally could trigger clashes with rival protesters who have been holding a large sit-in outside the military&apos;s headquarters in the capital since the weekend.
Attempts by security forces to break up the sit-in have killed at least 22, including five soldiers who protest organizers said were defending the sit-in.
The protests initially erupted last December with demonstrations against a spiraling economy, but quickly escalated into calls for an end to al-Bashir&apos;s 30-year rule."

Sean Hannity: Barr will hold the Deep State actors accountable and criminal indictments are coming,www.foxnews.com,Sean Hannity,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sean-hannity-barr-will-hold-the-deep-state-actors-accountable-and-criminal-indictments-are-coming,"Hannity: Day of reckoning is coming for the deep state An avalanche is coming. It will destroy any credibility - if there's any remaining - of the tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists and the rage media mob in this country, along with their allies in the Democratic hate-Trump left. And to those who have abused power inside and outside of government, you are about to face the justice that many of you deserve. What will be made public in the coming days and weeks, beyond the Mueller report, will prove correct the reporting and investigation that have gone on on ""Hannity"" for over two years. It will confirm all the investigative reporting on the show from our ensemble team. It will prove that we have been accurate and correct all along while the media mob and the Democratic mob have lied to you repeatedly for two and a half years.
This is just a short list of what will soon be made public. Criminal referrals this week by Devin Nunes. Attorney General William Barr pledging an investigation of the FBI's Russia investigation of President Trump -- this has been long overdue. Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report on FISA abuse, the report on the issue of leaking classified information, and of course, the release of more closed-door testimony, thanks to Congressman Doug Collins.

Also, FISA applications, Gang of Eight materials -- they are all coming out. And also, the Ukraine deal, which is surfacing, that has so much evidence that goes right to the doorstep of Joe Biden. This will all come cascading down on all these bad actors and drown all of those people that have abused their power.
Let's start with Capitol Hill. Barr On Tuesday testified before the House Appropriations Committee , and he was there to talk about the DOJ's budget. But the conversation soon turned to the Mueller report. We're faced with the undeniable fact that Trump-Russia collusion was a giant hoax. We have the FBI's nine-month investigation, the House Intel investigation, bipartisan Senate investigation, and the Mueller investigation. Every single one of these investigations says there was no Russia collusion whatsoever. None. The words are clear.
And everyone in the media mob got it wrong. So now, they are shifting to new conspiracy theories. We want Donald Trump's taxes. Oh, maybe the attorney general is covering up major, phantom crimes hidden deep within the special counsel's full report. The president obstructed justice, even though the attorney general and deputy attorney general said, no, it did not happen.

And, by the way, Rachel Maddow, the leader of this tinfoil hat conspiracy brigade, and others are once again lying to their viewers and hyping a pack of twisted lies. The Washington Post and The New York Times are not much different, once again pushing articles based on hearsay from anonymous sources. The left is demanding that the full report be released immediately.
But the attorney general testified that the full report will be released within a week. No request for executive privilege by the president has been made, the only reactions were applied based on strict, legal guidelines. They don't want to give away sources and methods. They are not allowed to leak or give out grand jury information -- that's against the law.

President Trump has nothing to hide. The same can't be said for the high-ranking FBI and DOJ officials, just the upper echelon, responsible for the witch hunt against the Trump campaign. The major news came Tuesday when Attorney General Barr vowed to hold them accountable. This is key in what the Hill's John Solomon called, ""the single sentence Russia bombshell"" that Barr delivered to Congress that very few in the media picked up on. Video
Barr said the following: ""The Office of the Inspector General has a pending investigation of the FISA process in the Russian investigation. And I expect that that will be complete in -- probably, in May or June, I am told. More generally, I am reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all of the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016.""
Reportedly, Barr will form a team to review the FBI's actions during the so-called phony collusion probe. The pendulum is swinging. The boomerang is now headed right back to the top, the Deep State actors. They will all be held accountable. Mark my words: Criminal indictments are coming.
