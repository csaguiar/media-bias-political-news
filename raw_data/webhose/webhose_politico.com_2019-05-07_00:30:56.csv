The resistance to change that Dem's represented stemmed from the brainwashing of the electorate by Republicans labeling Dem's as ""tax & spend"" where Repubs billed themselve as ""the party of fiscal governance"". Well, that's all ""Gone with the Wind"" now as the Repub's spend $750-billion/yr gearing up for war with Russia because none of those bastards has the good sense to find out what Russia is really all about. None has the brains to realize the revolution of 1917 is over and that Russia is far more Democratic now than the US. They need to keep the military/industrial war machine fed that has ruled the gov't since 1947. President Eisenhower told us in 1960 not to let it take over, but it did.

The same has been the case with policy-oriented liberals like George McGovern in ‚Äô72 and Michael Dukakis in ‚Äô88."" In other words: In most instances, the more the public sees a Democrat actually doing policy, and the more familiar they are with the person over time, the less they like him/her. I actually predicted this when Hillary announced her run. I knew enough people in exactly the right states liked the _idea_ of Hillary way more than they were going to like the reality, and the more they saw of her, the more they were not going to be able to stand her. And that's exactly how it turned out. So why is this, exactly, if the author's thesis and its corollaries are correct, which I think they mostly are? What does it mean that people like the ""feel"" they get from somebody like O'Rourke, or Bill Clinton, or whoever? (At least Clinton had run a state. I'm not making a comparison on the merits, experience, etc., here.) And what does it mean that they play into that ""feel"" and away from the details?

After the Wall Street Crash and the ensuing depression, Hoover had no chance of success as Presdient. But then I remember Hoover's role in the Coolidge Administration: As the effective Economic Czar. Back then, as today, the Treasury Secretary traditionally had the most economic influence in the Cabinet. Interesting, back then - due to the huge number of people who lived on farms - the Agriculture Secretary was the 2nd most influencial economic Cabinet Secretary. But Coolidge broke tradition by coming to rely most on Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover. Whenever an economic issue or decision reared its head, Coolidge went to Hoover . Since Coolidge is quite possibly our laziest President, Hoover operated with much autonomy. The Coolidge economy, with all if its fragility, was Hoover's economy. Once I remind myself of that, I am less charitable toward Hoover vis-a-vis the Great Depression. The economy that imploded while Hoover was Presdent,was - in significant part - Hoover's economy."
