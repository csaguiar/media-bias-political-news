Colbert Unloads on Trump for Saying Obama Separated Families,www.thedailybeast.com,matt.wilstein@thedailybeast.com (Matt Wilstein),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/colbert-unloads-on-trump-for-saying-obama-separated-families,"‘MONSTROUS ACT OF CRUELTY’ Colbert Unloads on Trump for Saying Obama Separated Families ‘The Late Show’ host has rarely gotten so upset about one of President Trump’s many lies. 04.09.19 10:08 PM ET CBS
Stephen Colbert admittedly spends an inordinate amount of time going after President Trump. But he rarely gets as worked up as he did on Tuesday after the president’s blatant lie that his predecessor Barack Obama was the one who separated immigrant families at the border.
“President Obama separated the children,” Trump told reporters unprompted earlier in the day. “Those cages that were shown, I think they were very inappropriate. They were built by President Obama’s administration. Not by Trump.” He added, “I’m the one that stopped it. President Obama had child separation. I was the one that changed it.”
“No, you didn’t!” Colbert shot back. “Obama didn’t have a family separation policy.” The host reminded Trump that the policy was announced by his former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who called it “zero tolerance, as in your feelings toward Mexicans.”
“It was the brainchild of Stephen Miller and John Kelly,” Colbert said, “who told Kirstjen Nielsen to implement it, and now she’ll be scraping that hot black tar off her soul for the rest of eternity.”
“It didn’t stop people from coming, it was a monstrous act of cruelty and ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge,” he continued, “but for some reason you are now pushing to reinstate broader family separation policies and today you publicly defended it in the same meeting where you claimed it was all Obama’s fault.”
In response to Trump’s argument that without family separation migrants would try to cross the border just to go to Disneyland, Colbert imagined a parent saying, “My kids love not being terrorized by a narco-syndicate, but my favorite part has got to be the Tea Cups.”
Finally, the host admitted that Obama was “no angel,” pointing to “ample evidence of Barack taking kids from their parents.” As adorable images of Obama entertaining kids in the Oval Office appeared on screen, Colbert accused him of subjecting them to “harsh interrogations” and “confiscating all of their hugs.”
“I miss you,” he whispered into the camera."

Right-Wingers Spread Lie That Pete Buttigieg Isn’t a Real Christian,www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/right-wingers-spread-lie-that-pete-buttigieg-isnt-a-real-christian,"Right-Wingers Spread Lie That Pete Buttigieg Isn’t a Real Christian And it’s not because he’s gay. 04.10.19 4:28 AM ET Bloomberg/Getty
On the campaign trail, South Bend Mayor Peter Buttigieg has actively highlighted his own religious faith, and called for a resurgence of a “religious left” in the United States.
“The left is rightly committed to a separation of church and state… but we need to not be afraid to invoke arguments that are convincing on why Christian faith is going to point you in a progressive direction,” Buttigieg told USA Today in a recent conversation about religion and faith, characterizing conservative Christians as “saying so much about what Christ said so little about, and so little about what he said so much about.”
But an increasing number of right-wing figures, displeased that Buttigieg has taken to pointing out the plank in their eye , have begun undercutting Buttigieg’s religiosity by dismissing him as not “really” Christian—not because he’s gay, but because, like 11 American presidents, he’s an Episcopalian.
“He says he’s a traditional Episcopalian, whatever that means these days,” Fox News host Laura Ingraham said in a segment that dismissed Buttigieg as “but another creation of a media apparatus desperate to oust Trump.”
“If Buttigieg thinks evangelicals should be supporting him instead of Trump, he fundamentally does not understand the roots of Christianity,” conservative commentator and reformed #NeverTrump Republican Erick Erickson tweeted on Sunday. “But then he is an Episcopalian, so he might not actually understand Christianity more than superficially.”
After online Episcopalians and their defenders chased Erickson’s tennis ball into traffic, the commentator—who previously accused Buttigieg of thinking “Jesus would be okay with beastiality [sic]”—has since mounted a days-long crusade of tweets and blog posts on his website The Resurgent deriding the Episcopal Church , its leadership and laity.
Buttigieg, Erickson said in one post, “is not really Christian so much as he is Episcopalian.”
As evidence that the Episcopal Church is no longer, in his view, a Christian one, Erickson pointed to some Episcopal leaders supporting access to abortion and the openness of some Episcopal priests to questions about the physical resurrection of Jesus, which Erickson considers heretical.
“The Episcopal Church itself is no longer a Christian institution and those who remain will either walk into a Christian denomination or walk into atheism potentially with a helping of spirituality,” Erickson wrote in a blog post on Tuesday, prompted by a request from The Daily Beast for him to elaborate on his feelings regarding the Episcopal Church.
“The people remain behind [sic] are a bunch of rich, white people who want to feel good about themselves by feeling morally superior to their neighbors who really believe that whole ‘Jesus died for me’ stuff,” Erickson said.
Among the rich, white people sitting in Episcopal pews: President Donald Trump, whose third marriage was held at Bethesda-by-the-Sea, an Episcopal church in Palm Beach where the first family often attends Christmas and Easter services. (Trump identifies as a Presbyterian, although he’s not particularly doctrinal .)
As a religiously devout son of the American heartland and Afghanistan veteran, Buttigieg has complicated traditional right-wing narratives about Democratic presidential hopefuls as effete coastal elitists. But as his fundraising and poll numbers have risen, so too has negative coverage from the right. Opposition researchers and political analysts have told The Daily Beast that attacks on Buttigieg’s sexuality would almost certainly backfire , but long-simmering doctrinal and cultural differences between mainline Protestants and evangelical Christians might be an easier fault line to exploit.
“In our time, the Episcopal Church is a generally progressive denomination that ordains gay and lesbian bishops, makes room for liberation theology, was never part of the Christian Right, and lost the conservative congregations that hated these developments,” Prof. Gary Dorrien, who teaches social ethics, theology, and philosophy of religion at Union Theological Seminary, told The Daily Beast.
“The history of that division is a theological,” added the Rev. Dr. Kelly Brown Douglas, dean of Episcopal Divinity School at Union Theological Seminary. “The Episcopal Church faith tradition has been concerned with salvation as it talks about issues of social justice and issues of freedom—a movement toward ‘God’s Just Earth,’ so that the issues that really become central to our concern are issues of how one treats those who have been marginalized.”
That espousal of the so-called “Social Gospel,” Dr. Douglas said, generally stops short of more doctrinaire views of social issues like abortion and same-sex relations—“we leave people the ability to makes choices... which in evangelical and Catholic faith traditions, they don’t generally do”—has left evangelical Christians skeptical of the legitimacy of the Episcopal Church.
“Sometimes righteousness becomes self-righteousness,” Dr. Douglas said. “These things divide us theologically, and so I think that’s what you see, is an historical theological divide, because of the way we understand the centrality of the Gospel message.”
But beyond those long-held philosophical and religious differences, Dr. Douglas said, Buttigieg’s status as a gay Christian is likely inseparable from the critiques against the Episcopal Church at large.
“The very fact that Mayor Pete is a gay man and he professes to be Episcopalian, well, that would be the rub for evangelical Christians, because fundamentalists—and not all evangelicals, to be clear: fundamental evangelicals, the right-wing branch—they are not going to accept someone that claims to be Christian and also gay,” Dr. Douglas said. “We need to be clear as to what the rub is in this regard.”
For Buttigieg, whose personal distaste for religious hypocrisy runs deep, attacks on his faith are almost definitionally unworthy of direct engagement.
“I think good faith is so important,” Buttigieg told The Daily Beast last month in a conversation about his relationship with Vice President Mike Pence. “Even when I have a very stark disagreement with somebody, it’s just a lot easier on both sides I think for us to navigate it if we both understand where the other is coming from, and believe that those different opinions are something we came by honestly.”
Accordingly, Buttigieg’s campaign told The Daily Beast that Erickson and Ingraham’s broadsides against the Episcopal Church don’t merit engagement.
“We’ll let whatever that meltdown was speak for itself,” said Lis Smith, Buttigieg’s communications director. “The mayor has spoken extensively about his faith and how it guides him as a human being and elected official. It’s not surprising that this administration’s defenders are sensitive about being called out for their hypocrisy.”"

Wrestling is fake, insofar as its soap-opera narratives are scripted and its outcomes are predetermined. Yet as Viceland’s Dark Side of the Ring elucidates, reality and fantasy often collide in and out of the squared circle—with disastrous consequences .
Tackling some of the industry’s most infamous incidents, Jason Eisener’s six-part documentary series (premiering Wednesday, April 10) is a behind-the-curtain peek that reveals the havoc caused when wrestlers fail to maintain stable boundaries between their public personas and private lives. Equal parts nostalgia trip, investigative inquiry and tabloidy exposé, it revisits stories and stars that are defined by their notoriety. In doing so, it affords a fascinating glimpse at the unique dynamics that make wresting so popular .
And, also, so ideally suited for tragedy.
Death hovers over Dark Side of the Ring , as four of its installments concern untimely demises due to some combination of drugs, murder and unfathomable misfortune. Eisener sets his tone with his debut episode, “The Match Made in Heaven,” about the tumultuous relationship between Randy “Macho Man” Savage and Miss Elizabeth (i.e. Elizabeth Ann Hulette), who worked together for years as grappler and manager (respectively), and also lived, unbeknownst to fans, as husband and wife. Randy and Elizabeth’s on-screen 1980s love affair was one of the defining elements of Vince McMahon’s World Wresting Federation (now known as World Wresting Entertainment)—he the “paranoid schizophrenic” beast and she the demure, loyal beauty. At their peak, they weren’t just stars; they were foundational icons upon which a skyrocketing business was built.
It’s long been public record that the couple eventually split, and that Elizabeth died of a drug overdose (while involved with WCW headliner Lex Luger) in 2003, while Savage perished in a car accident (after a heart attack behind the wheel) in 2011. Dark Side of the Ring uses tons of superb archival footage and new interviews with Jake “The Snake” Roberts, Jim Cornette, Scott Hall, Bruce Prichard (aka Brother Love) and other wrestling luminaries to underline how, in their case, art imitated life, which then imitated art, resulting in doom. Naturally protective of his wife, Savage made his character egomaniacally jealous of Ms. Elizabeth—only to find his fictional storylines about betrayal (specifically with Hulk Hogan ) echoed in his real marriage. With lines blurring, catastrophe was just about inevitable.
Narrated by Dutch Mantel (save for one episode handled by Mick Foley), the show benefits not only from copious clips and photos, but from staged recreations—using top-notch lookalikes—that are shrouded in shadow, the better to impart a sense of mythic charisma and impending calamity. The latter comes in a variety of forms in Dark Side of the Ring , though usually via loss of life. “The Killing of Bruiser Brody” details the untimely fate of the late-‘70s/early-‘80s wild man, who was fatally stabbed in a Puerto Rico locker room shortly before an event. “The Mysterious Death of Gorgeous Gino,” meanwhile, reopens the case of the early-‘80s heel (i.e. villain), whose body was found under puzzling circumstances in his apartment. In the former, Brody’s crazy-barbarian reputation (and vicious feud with rival José González) seems to have contributed to his slaying. In the latter, Gino’s desire to live the life of his cocky-cokehead-playboy alter ego turned out to be a lethal mistake.
The suggestion forwarded throughout Dark Side of the Ring is clear: striving for authenticity in art can be a double-edged sword, and losing sight of what’s legitimate and what’s make-believe is rarely a recipe for happiness or longevity. As depicted in “The Last of the Von Erichs,” attempting to live up to a wholesome-religious-Texan image—and a famous family legacy—destroyed four of Kevin Von Erich’s wrestler brothers (this after a fifth died in adolescence). Now a gaunt man enjoying a peaceful existence in Kauai, Hawaii, Kevin remains shaken by his siblings’ passing, which came about at least partly because they couldn’t reconcile who they were with who they wanted to be.
If there’s a weak link here, it’s the concluding “The Fabulous Moolah.” Eisener addresses charges that the female wrestling legend was a bully who pimped out her protégés for cash, as well as screwed them out of money and championships—just what you’d expect from someone with her nasty in-ring reputation. Yet it never settles on a coherent viewpoint; like the Gorgeous Gino installment, it offers ominous suggestions and unconvincing “conclusions” in place of definitive answers. Nonetheless, even those episodes are bolstered by entertainingly candid and profane interviewees who don’t hold back when discussing the cutthroat business, their backstabbing compatriots, and their own expertise. ““If you could cross a genius with P.T. Barnum and Donald Trump, you would get the love child that would be Vince McMahon.””
In that regard, Dark Side of the Ring peaks with “The Montreal Screwjob.” Arguably the most controversial moment in modern wrestling history, Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels’ 1997 SummerSlam title bout was marked by treachery, when the former—refusing, on the eve of his departure to rival WCW, to lose his belt to the hated Michaels—was blindsided by a three count ordered by WWE owner Vince McMahon. “Say what you want about wrestling—that was real. I really screwed that guy,” crows Cornette, who continues to feud with writer Vince Russo over credit for devising the ruse. Regardless of responsibility, Hart claims in a new chat that “the innocence of wrestling changed,” and everyone more or less agrees, because the ensuing fallout exposed the boardroom machinations behind the spectacle. The illusion of reality (known in wrestling lingo as the code of “kayfabe”) was forever shattered.
Fueled by bitter grudges and corporate competition, “The Montreal Screwjob” highlighted the chaotic downside to blending the personal and the professional, and it ultimately did change fans’ perception of wrestling. Ironically, however, that change wasn’t a death knell for the industry; on the contrary, it gave birth to an era of popular self-referential storylines in which Vince McMahon exploited his newfound villainous status to become the evil “Mr. McMahon” (“If you could cross a genius with P.T. Barnum and Donald Trump, you would get the love child that would be Vince McMahon,” smiles Cornette). There’s no doubt that, in trying to create characters and conflicts that resonated as believable, many wrestlers lost control of their careers, and lives. But for proof that wrestling’s appeal hinges on the push-pull between truth and invention, one need look no further than Dark Side of the Ring itself. READ THIS LIST"
“fbi surveillance” – Google News: AG William Barr: ‘I Think Spying Did Occur’ on Trump Campaign – Daily Beast,www.thedailybeast.com,mikenova,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/attorney-general-william-barr-i-think-spying-did-occur-on-trump-campaign,"COME AGAIN? AG William Barr: ‘I Think Spying Did Occur’ on Trump Campaign The comment came after Barr reportedly created a team to look into the FBI’s handling of the Russia investigation. 04.10.19 11:33 AM ET
Attorney General William Barr believes the Obama administration spied on the Trump 2016 campaign.
The comment came after reports that Barr will create an internal Department of Justice team to investigate “controversial counterintelligence decisions” made by the DOJ and the FBI in the Russia probe, including those made by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team.
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) questioned Barr on his decision to convene such a team. “News just broke today that you have a special team looking into why the FBI opened an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections,” she said. “I wonder if you can share with this committee who is on that team, why you felt a need to form that kind of a team and what you intend to be the scope of their investigation?”
“I am going to be reviewing both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign during 2016,” Barr responded. “One of the things I want to do is pull together all the information from the various investigations that have gone on... and see if there are any remaining questions to be addressed.”
Sen. Shaheen then questioned Barr further: “You’re not suggesting, though, that spying occurred?”
And Barr replied: “I don’t—well, I guess you could. I think spying did occur, yes. I think spying did occur.”
The attorney general continued, hedging that he wants to determine whether such alleged surveillance was legal or not. “There were a lot of rules put in place to make sure that there’s an adequate basis before our law-enforcement agencies get involved in political surveillance,” he said. “I’m not suggesting that those rules were violated, but I think it’s important to look at that. And I’m not talking about the FBI necessarily, but intelligence agencies more broadly.”
He added: “Congress is usually very concerned about intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies staying in their proper lane, and I want to make sure that happened.”
The attorney general’s suggestion echoes President Trump’s longstanding claims that the feds spied upon his campaign.
Shortly after taking office, Trump infamously tweeted an unfounded claim that Obama ordered a wiretap of his campaign. “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” he wrote .
Last year, the president tweeted : “I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!”
And on Wednesday, Trump told reporters that the Mueller probe was an “ attempted coup .” And he praised Barr’s decision to look into the FBI and DOJ’s actions: “He’s doing a great job getting started on going back to the origins of exactly where this all started because this was an illegal witch hunt... and what they did was treason.”"

Board Ruling",www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeffrey-rosen-trumps-nominee-for-deputy-attorney-general-refuses-to-say-if-he-supports-brown-v-board-ruling,"NO COMMENT Trump’s Nominee for Deputy Attorney General Refuses to Say if He Supports Brown v. Board Ruling When asked about the landmark segregation ruling, Jeffrey Rosen said it wouldn’t be ‘a productive exercise’ for him to say ‘which ones are right and which ones are wrong.’ 04.10.19 11:52 AM ET REUTERS
Jeffrey Rosen, President Donald Trump’s nominee to be second-in-command at the Justice Department, declined on Wednesday to tell the Senate whether he thought the Supreme Court ruled correctly in Brown v. Board of Education .
The remark came during Rosen’s confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, pressed Rosen on Brown v. Board of Education , the landmark ruling that found school segregation to be unconstitutional; and Roe v. Wade , the ruling that affirmed that abortion access is a constitutional right.
“Would you agree that Roe v. Wade was correctly decided?” Blumenthal asked.
“What I would agree with is that it’s the precedent of the Supreme Court for better than 40 years now and unless and until that changes, it’s the law,” he replied.
Blumenthal then pressed him on whether it was decided correctly, and Rosen said he didn’t have anything more to say.
“Was Brown v. Board of Education correctly decided?” Blumenthal asked.
“Senator, I don’t think that it would be a productive exercise for me to go through the most–thousands of Supreme Court opinions and say which ones are right and which ones are wrong,” he said.
“These are pretty simple questions,” Blumenthal said. “They’re answerable by yes or no. Most lawyers, I suspect, would agree based on knowledge of the law that these two cases, pillars of our jurisprudence, were correctly decided by the United States Supreme Court.”
“I, um, I have views about lots of Supreme Court cases,” Rosen said, “but I’m not being nominated for this position to be the Solicitor General nor a judge and I think in this context the point I’m trying to make is that, whatever the law is, whether it’s a decision I would favor or disfavor, I see it as the role of the Department of Justice to uphold the law such as it is, unless Congress or the courts change it.”
Rosen’s reticence distinguishes him from Attorney General Bill Barr, who noted in his confirmation hearing that he previously said Roe was “wrongly decided,” added that he didn’t expect it to be overturned, and was committed to enforcing legislation that protects women’s access to clinics that provide abortions.
But it puts him in the same camp as Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, who also declined to weigh in on Brown during his confirmation hearing, as The Atlantic noted . Judge Wendy Vitter, who was sworn in last year as a district judge, also refused to comment on the decision. Several other judicial nominees fielded the question in the same way, as Slate has reported . But Supreme court Justice Brett Kavanaugh praised it during his confirmation, calling it “inspirational.”
Rosen is nominated as deputy attorney general, the post Rod Rosenstein now holds. As the second-in-command, he would oversee the day-to-day workings of the Justice Department—a uniquely powerful position.
After the hearing, Sherrilyn Ifill—president and director-counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund—called on senators to oppose his confirmation, citing his comments on Brown .
“This is an unprecedented and completely disqualifying action for anyone seeking to be confirmed to a leadership position in the U.S. Department of Justice,” she said in a statement. “As Deputy Attorney General, Jeffrey Rosen would oversee the Solicitor General’s Office and the Civil Rights Division, making his views on this seminal civil rights decision both relevant and critical.”"

Pentagon’s Space Development Agency Admits Satellite Plan Might Not Prevent Chinese or Russian Attacks,www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/pentagons-space-development-agency-admits-satellite-plan-might-not-prevent-chinese-or-russian-attacks,"PIE IN THE SKY? Pentagon Admits Plan to Launch 1,300 Satellites Might Not Prevent Chinese or Russian Attacks The Space Development Agency’s own director said it probably was ‘no panacea’ against an enemy attack. 04.10.19 11:42 AM ET Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/The Daily Beast/Getty
A new Pentagon space agency wants to launch nearly 1,300 small satellites and, in the process, totally reinvent the way the military operates in orbit.
The goal: to help the U.S. satellite constellation survive a sneak-attack by China or Russia. With hundreds of satellites in orbit, no single satellite is critically important, or so the thinking goes. If the Chinese or Russians were to knock out one or even dozens of satellites, scores more could take their place.
But the new “mega-constellation” plan from the Space Development Agency might not actually work. The agency’s own director, Fred Kennedy, said it probably was “no panacea” against an enemy attack.
It could be prohibitively expensive to deploy so many sats. Rocket launches are getting cheaper. But they might not yet be so cheap that the Pentagon could afford to conduct hundreds of them in a short span of time.
In any event, the agency’s plan is advisory. The Pentagon could just ignore it. But the idea is interesting if no for other reason than its contrarianness.
Today the U.S. military and other government agencies, universities and private companies together operate around 850 satellites, according to a count by the Massachusetts-based Union of Concerned Scientists. Second-place China has 280 satellites and Russia, in third place, has 150.
But America’s satellites increasingly are vulnerable to attack, according to military officials. “China and Russia both are building direct-ascent weapons that can shoot down our satellites,” U.S. Air Force general John Hyten, the head of U.S. Strategic Command, said on Tuesday at the annual Space Symposium conference in Colorado Springs.
“Direct-ascent weapon” is military parlance for “rocket.”
That’s not all. Hyten also said Russia and China also are building lasers that can blind American spacecraft and jammers that cut the satellites’ links to controllers on the ground plus “on-orbit” weapons—in essence, kamikaze satellites that can ram into American sats.
Not only are Moscow and Beijing building arsenals for taking down America’s space assets, they’re “doing it aggressively and quickly,” Hyten said.
To be clear, the U.S. military has anti-satellite weapons of its own. And American sats aren’t exactly defenseless. Starting in 2018, the Air Force spent a billion dollars adding “resilience features” to some of its spacecraft. Resilience features might include better thrusters, allowing the spacecraft to maneuver more quickly in order to avoid attack.
They may also include extra sensors on the spacecraft that act as a sort of orbital home-security system, monitoring the approach of potential assailants, according to James Oberg, an independent space expert and former NASA mission control specialist.
“Now that autonomous mini-satellites can approach other satellites, sometimes without detection from the ground, space-based detection must be installed on the potential targets,” Oberg told me. The sensors could include cameras, radars, radio-signal detectors and “sniffers” that can track the energy from other satellites' thrusters, Oberg added.
But the Space Development Agency, a small research organization that opened shop in March, wants to take a different approach. The Pentagon asked Congress for $150 million to fund the new agency through 2020.
Rather than beefing up individual spacecraft, under the mega-constellation plan the military would simply buy lots more small, inexpensive satellites, reinforcing or replacing the roughly 170 large, expensive sats the armed forces currently operate.
Speaking at the Colorado conference on Tuesday, Kennedy said he wants to see the Pentagon deploy “hundreds, perhaps even a thousand or more small satellites exhibiting a host of capabilities.”
A graphic Kennedy displayed broke down the numbers of different kinds of spacecraft in the proposed mega-constellation. In all, 1,258 small satellites would crowd low orbit, scanning the Earth and space and relaying radio communications. Three copies of an “advanced maneuvering vehicle”—presumably some version of the Air Force’s secretive X-37B robotic mini-shuttle—would orbit above the other sats.
Artificial intelligence would help ground-based controllers to maneuver and coordinate the hundreds of spacecraft, Kennedy said.
But the plan hinges on very cheap space launches. Lots of them. In 2018, U.S. entities launched just 31, mostly big, satellites—many of which might remain in orbit a decade or longer. Since small satellites might last just a year or two, to build the mega-constellation the military could need to expand its launch activities by a factor of 20.
It could be pricey. According to a 2018 paper by NASA researcher Harry Jones, the price per pound of a satellite launch has decreased from around $24,000 in the 1980s and 1990s to just $1,200 in 2019. But launching 600 or more satellites annually instead of 30 could more than offset the falling per-pound price of a launch.
Kennedy acknowledged the downsides of his agency’s satellite plan. “We recognize that this isn’t the sum total of the nation's space construct,” he said. ""We should not jump to extremes.”
But even experimenting with a new approach to deploying satellites could result in better technology and methods that could make it harder for Russia or China to knock out America’s spacecraft, Kennedy said. “This puts us on a wonderfully disruptive path.”
Kennedy said his agency would begin conducting conducting war games in order to test out the mega-constellation concept starting in 2022. READ THIS LIST"

Barr Sounds More and More Like Trump’s Roy Cohn The attorney general contradicts himself on Mueller and obstruction and starts talking like a true-believer on intelligence agencies ‘spying’ on the Trump campaign. opinion Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Shutterstock
Attorney General William Barr’s testimony before Congress on Wednesday highlighted the inherent contradiction in his letter about Robert Mueller’s investigation . The problem is not that Mueller did not make a charging decision about obstruction. The real problem is that Mueller did make a charging decision about conspiracy.
Barr was asked questions about Mueller’s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia relating to interference with the 2016 election. Barr seemed to move interchangeably between the view that, on the one hand, a president cannot be indicted while in office, and, on the other hand, that the Russia investigation should be analyzed like any other criminal case. But these are two different things. You can’t have it both ways. If a sitting president cannot be indicted, then Congress gets to decide whether to charge a crime through impeachment , not a prosecutor through the normal analysis of criminal statutes.
Barr’s March 25 letter to Congress stated that Mueller concluded that his investigation did not establish conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the election, but that Mueller refrained from making a “traditional prosecutorial judgment” when it came to obstruction. (Again, a president can’t be indicted.) Barr wrote Mueller’s decision “leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime.” Congress and the public still do not have access to Mueller’s report, and it has been unclear why Mueller’s declination to make a decision meant that the decision was to be made by Barr.
On Wednesday, Sen. Patrick Leahy pressed Barr to explain why Mueller’s decision meant that the attorney general must decide the question. After all, since the Department of Justice taken the position that a sitting president cannot be indicted, isn’t the only recourse for a president’s misconduct for Congress to decide whether it amounts to a high crime or misdemeanor for which impeachment is appropriate? And wasn’t the whole point of appointing a special counsel to insulate the decision-maker from the executive branch chain of command to avoid a conflict of interest?
During the hearing, Barr conceded that when Mueller submitted his report, Mueller did not say that he intended to leave the obstruction decision to Barr. But Barr would not concede that Mueller intended to leave the obstruction decision to Congress. Instead, Barr said that he made the decision himself because “that’s generally how the Department of Justice works. Generally, grand juries are to investigate crimes and a prosecutor’s role at the end is binary. There are charges or no charges, or is this a crime or not a crime?” And for good measure, he added, “I’ve had some experience in that field.”
But a special counsel’s investigation of a president is anything but the general practice of the Department of Justice. A special counsel’s role is not binary. In fact, one could argue that a special counsel should make no charging decision at all, instead, collecting the evidence and then turning it over to Congress to decide whether the facts amount to a high crime or misdemeanor for which impeachment is appropriate.
Barr’s letter dissects the elements of the criminal statute for obstruction, applies the Justice Department’s Principles of Federal Prosecution that are used in normal criminal cases, and uses the standard of proof as guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. But these are the standards that apply in a normal criminal case, not in an impeachment proceeding. It seems that by taking the position that a sitting president cannot be indicted, it follows that the standard for analyzing alleged misconduct of the president should not be the standard that is used to obtain indictments. Instead, Congress should be permitted to analyze the conduct under its own standards. “But all of this talk about obstruction masks the real point, which is that if Mueller had no business deciding the obstruction question, then why did he decide the conspiracy question?”
Barr’s decision should also be viewed with some skepticism because of the unsolicited 19-page memo he sent to DOJ leadership last summer in which he expressed the somewhat unique view that a president cannot obstruct justice as a matter of law if he is exercising executive power, such as by asking the FBI director to stop investigating a matter or firing him. Barr’s March 25 letter stated that he reached his decision “without regard to, and is not based on, the constitutional considerations that surround the indictment and criminal prosecution of a sitting president,” citing the 2000 Office of Legal Counsel memo regarding prosecution of a sitting president. His letter did not say, however, that he reached his conclusion without regard to the position taken in his 19-page memo.
Barr raised further concerns about his objectivity when he referred to the FBI investigation into Trump’s campaign as “spying.”
He stated that he would be “reviewing both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign during 2016,” even though a “substantial portion” of these matters are already being investigated by DOJ’s inspector general. Although the FBI’s conduct should not be immune from scrutiny, government officials typically refer to intelligence activities as “surveillance” or “collection.” The use of the loaded term “spying” raises skepticism of his impartiality.
In addition, Barr stated, “I think there was probably failure among a group of leaders there at the upper echelon.” He has reached this conclusion even though he hasn’t “set up a team yet” to investigate. Barr’s testimony revealed a mindset that is consistent with the Trump narrative of an FBI that is out to get him. This is the attorney general appointed by Trump after Trump criticized Barr’s fired predecessor, Jeff Sessions, for failing to protect him. Does Trump finally have his Roy Cohn?
But all of this talk about obstruction masks the real point, which is that if Mueller had no business deciding the obstruction question, then why did he decide the conspiracy question? Unless Barr provides members of Congress with Mueller’s full report, they are unable to fulfill their duty to serve as a check on the president and will have no choice but to conduct their own investigation into both questions.

Black Woman Sues Miami PD After Violent Arrest: ‘I Don’t Feel Safe Calling the Police’,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dyma-loving-sues-miami-police-department-after-violent-arrest-caught-on-video,"FIGHTING BACK Black Woman Sues Miami PD After Violent Arrest: ‘I Don’t Feel Safe Calling the Police’ ‘This lawsuit is a message to say stop treating our woman as if they are subhuman,’ Dyma Loving’s attorney said Wednesday. 04.10.19 2:57 PM ET Dyma Loving
A black woman has filed a federal civil-rights lawsuit against the Miami-Dade Police Department and the two officers she says violently arrested her after she called the cops for help last month.
Dyma Loving, a 26-year-old mother-of-three, said she called the police after getting into a verbal altercation with a white neighbor who threatened her and a friend with a rifle. But instead of getting protection, Loving was treated like a violent criminal: A now-viral video shows a Miami-Dade officer pushing her against a metal fence and putting her in a headlock before forcing her to the ground.
“I just want piece of mind that there is still someone I can call when I am in trouble,” Loving told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. “Right now, I have no one to call because I don’t feel safe calling the police.”
Her lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleges the two Miami police officers, Alejandro Giraldo and J.F. Caleron, wrongfully arrested Loving and deprived her of her civil rights when they reacted violently to her request “to make contact with her children.”
The two officers, Miami-Dade County, and the Miami-Dade County Police Department are all named in the federal suit.
“This lawsuit is seeking justice for myself, but more importantly for women everywhere. Black women, white women, and all women who feel like they are not safe from law enforcement,” Loving said.
Her lawyer, Justin Moore, added that they named all four parties in the lawsuit to address “the complete and total breakdown of the officers’ inability to serve and protect her properly.”
On March 5, the 26-year-old and a friend, Adrianna Green, were walking by the home of a white neighbor, Frank Tumm, when he allegedly began to yell at them.
“He called us hookers, called us racial slurs and suddenly he turned around and put a shotgun in our faces,” Loving previously told The Daily Beast . “He told me he was going to shoot my burnt black ass face off my neck.”
Fearing for their lives, Loving said she quickly called the authorities. But when the police arrived, they began to hurl questions at the two women instead of Tumm, the lawsuit alleges.
“The moment she was racially profiled after calling 911 due to her life being placed in danger by Frank Tumm; physically attacked and violently manhandled by the officers that she called for help; unlawfully arrested; falsely imprisoned and forced to spend 15 hours in jail; having to endure video of this violent attack going ‘viral’ on the internet, with some iterations having near 1 million views,” the complaint states.
In the video, Officer Alejandro Giraldo can be heard telling Loving she “need[s] to chill out or you will be arrested” before abruptly becoming physical.
“She needs to be corrected if anything,” one of the cops says off camera.
With the help of two other Miami police officers, Giraldo and Cameron can be seen “grabbing her by the neck, obstructing her breathing, whipping her by the neck and arms to the hard pavement, and drilling their bodies into her back while she was lying on the pavement,” the lawsuit states.
Loving said Wednesday that she’ll “never forget that pain and the feeling of having multiple people pushing me down on the hot sidewalk.”
After her arrest, Loving was driven to the police station and left in the squad car for four hours while waiting to be booked, she said. Finally, she was charged with two misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest without violence and held at Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center until she posted $1,500 bail.
On March 14, Tumm was charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, according to WPLG TV .
Five days later, the Miami-Dade State Attorney’s Office finally dropped the charges against Loving, saying they “could not be supported by the evidence.”
Giraldo has been “relieved of his duty and his role as a training officer” with pay and is currently on an administrative assignment while the police department investigates the incident, Miami-Dade Police Department Director Juan Perez said in a statement.
Calderon remains on active duty, the police confirmed Wednesday, declining to comment on the lawsuit or the investigation, as it is “ongoing.” Both officers did not respond to The Daily Beast’s multiple attempts for comment.
The lawsuit claims the violent takedown injured Loving’s shoulder, arms, head, face, and legs, and made it difficult for her to “obtain employment and housing equivalent to people who do not have a criminal record.”
“We like to say we have magic as black women but we are also human beings,” Christina Roye, one of Loving’s lawyers, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday. “And as human beings we hurt and I think it is important to see Dyma as a human being and not as a narrative of another unjust act.”
“This lawsuit is a message to say stop treating our woman as if they are subhuman,” Moore added.
The lawsuit is seeking prosecution and termination of the two officers, new guidelines to police training, and damages in excess of $75,000.
“Your uniform stands for something and right now keeping these men on the force shows that what they did to me was right. Nothing about what happened to me was right,” Loving said. “In my eyes, they just came to arrest some black people. Nothing about the approach was ethical. I had a gun pointed at me and they didn’t even ask me if I was OK.”"
Fox News Hosts Back Mnuchin in His Testy Exchange With Maxine Waters,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-hosts-back-mnuchin-in-his-testy-exchange-with-maxine-waters,"OF COURSE Fox News Hosts Back Mnuchin in His Testy Exchange With Maxine Waters ‘He set a meeting for five o’clock, he wanted to keep that meeting, and they wanted to keep harassing him.’ 04.10.19 2:15 PM ET Fox News
A day after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin engaged in a tense and fiery exchange with House Financial Services Committee chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), Fox News hosts Pete Hegseth and Katie Pavlich wholeheartedly backed the Trump cabinet official and called for a law limiting the length of congressional hearings.
During a Monday committee hearing in which he was grilled over Democrats’ demand for President Trump’s tax returns , Mnuchin bickered with Waters over time constraints, claiming he needed to leave for an appointment with a Bahrain official.
The pair went back and forth over whether he’d stay or leave to attend his “important meeting,” resulting in the two arguing about how Waters should conduct her own hearing.
On Tuesday, Fox News daytime chat show Outnumbered covered the kerfuffle, with liberal Fox News contributor Marie Harf first saying she felt “uncomfortable” with how Mnuchin showed “disdain for congressional oversight,” prompting her colleague Dagen McDowell to burst out laughing.
“I think he’s a rich dude who shows disdain for everybody, quite frankly,” she chuckled.
Harf went on to say that congressional oversight is “how the system works,” causing Hegseth, the show’s “One Lucky Guy” panelist, to complain about Democrats demanding six years of Trump’s tax returns.
Such a demand “isn’t oversight,” he said, “this is harassment.” Harf, however, explained that there is a statute allowing the House Ways and Means Committee to request the tax returns of any American.
Pavlich, meanwhile, chimed in to claim it cannot be done for “vicious political reasons” before offering up a new law of her own. “I think they should make a law that congressional hearings should be no longer than three hours anyway,” she declared. “Because they’re too long.”
“Yeah!” Hegseth exclaimed. “He set a meeting for five o’clock, he wanted to keep that meeting, and they wanted to keep harassing him.”
Co-host Melissa Francis, meanwhile, looked directly into the camera and laughed as the Fox & Friends Weekend host gave his full-throated defense of Mnuchin’s behavior."
"Elizabeth Warren Raises $6M, Cooling Talk of a Stalled Campaign",www.thedailybeast.com,sam.stein@thedailybeast.com (Sam Stein),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elizabeth-warren-raises-dollar6m-cooling-talk-of-a-stalled-campaign,"BOUNCE BACK? Elizabeth Warren Raises $6M, Cooling Talk of a Stalled Campaign Her policy-centric focus may have finally broken through with voters, or, concerns over her financial struggles compelled donors to rush to her support. Or both. 04.10.19 1:59 PM ET Carlos Barria/Reuters
Senator Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) presidential campaign, much rumored to be in need of defibrillation, has found itself on solid footing in recent weeks after enjoying a wave of grassroots financial support.
The Massachusetts Democrat announced on Wednesday that she had raised more than $6 million in the first quarter of 2019. Of that total, more than $1.4 million came in the last week of the quarter, suggesting that her policy-heavy messaging had broken through with voters or that whispers of her financial struggles had compelled donors to rush to her support—or both.
Either way, donors gave.
Warren has forsworn hosting big-dollar fundraisers or even making phone calls to big-pocketed donors, choosing to rely on a grassroots model. The results have been 135,000 individuals donating to her campaign, making a total of 213,000 donations.
That places Warren well behind Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)—who has capitalized on the grassroots fundraising paradigm to raise $18.2 million from more than 520,000 donors—but it places her firmly within other top-tier candidates. Warren has roughly the same number of donors as Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and the same number of donations as former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX), though the latter started campaigning far later.
With respect to the quantity of giving, Warren also closed the quarter strong. In the final week, her campaign received more than 50,000 new donations.
A prolific fundraiser during her Senate career, Warren had raised a paltry sum when she announced her presidential campaign, sparking suggestions that she wasn’t clicking with voters. But the first-quarter numbers should quiet some of that chatter. At a minimum, Warren appears to have a foundation to sustain a campaign operation for the foreseeable future.
She heads into the second quarter with $11.2 million cash on-hand, thanks to a transfer of $10.4 million from her Senate campaign. All told, Warren spent $5.2 million in the first quarter, below the amount she brought in."
"Lara Logan Returns to TV as a Right-Wing Heroine at Sinclair, Condemning ‘Moral Cowards’ at CBS",www.thedailybeast.com,lloyd.grove@thedailybeast.com (Lloyd Grove),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/lara-logan-returns-to-tv-as-a-right-wing-heroine-at-sinclair-condemning-moral-cowards-at-cbs,"Taking Sides Lara Logan Returns to TV as a Right-Wing Heroine at Sinclair, Condemning ‘Moral Cowards’ at CBS Reporter Lara Logan, who is joining Sinclair Broadcast Group, condemns her critics at former employer CBS, and claims her flawed Benghazi story has ‘over time been proved right.’ exclusive Richard Brian/Reuters
It has been, for Lara Logan , a long and bruising tumble from CBS News’s 60 Minutes —the pinnacle of broadcast journalism, where she was a much-lauded and undeniably courageous war correspondent until her brilliant career exploded in a scandal over sloppy reporting—to a temporary gig at Sinclair Broadcast Group .
There, Logan will cover the immigration controversy for the Donald Trump-friendly television conglomerate’s 191 local stations.
“Nobody else is asking me to do that down on the border, and that’s a story that needs to be told, right? There’s a lot happening down there,” the 48-year-old Logan told The Daily Beast on Tuesday night as news of her deal was announced.
“My stories are going to be on CBS and ABC and NBC and Fox,” Logan added—although they will actually appear on local Sinclair stations affiliated with those national networks. “They’re affiliates, but they’re still carrying the banner of CBS, they’re still carrying the banner of ABC, they’re still carrying the banner of NBC,” she argued, “and none of those organizations asked me to go and report down on the border.”
She added with a laugh: “It’s a new battlefield.”
Logan, who has emerged in recent weeks as a vocal critic of the mainstream media for their faultfinding portrayals of the 45th president, has signed a three-month contract to produce around 24 reports for the publicly traded media company.
Sinclair is best known for its enforced fealty to Trump and for requiring its hundreds of local anchors across the country to recite from the same script (written by executives at corporate headquarters outside Baltimore, Maryland) parroting Trump’s complaints about “ biased media,” “fake stories” and “false news.”
Given Trump’s effusive praise for Sinclair—“So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased,” he tweeted in April 2018—it was a shock last July when his handpicked Federal Communications Commission chairman, Ajit Pai, blocked the company’s widely expected purchase of Tribune Media.
This merger would have created a right-wing media powerhouse of more than 230 stations reaching 70 percent of U.S. viewers.
Six months after Logan’s CBS contract quietly expired—her final 60 Minutes piece, an investigation of rhinoceros poaching in Africa, aired last May—it hardly comes as a surprise that she landed at Sinclair.
There, Logan will join her former colleague Sharyl Attkisson —another CBS News correspondent who became something of a heroine to conservatives when she wrote a 2014 tell-all claiming that CBS News had gone toothless, swooning over the arrogant obfuscations of President Obama and his minions while thwarting the worthy efforts of public-spirited reporters.
“I'm very excited to have her contribute some pieces and keep her in the mix. She’s an excellent reporter,"" said Attkisson, who left CBS in March 2014, and hosts Sinclair’s Sunday public affairs program Full Measure .
In Sinclair, Logan will be working for a company that requires its stations to run the five-day-a-week pro-Trump cheerleading of decidedly untelegenic loyalist Boris Ephsteyn , and whose chairman, David Smith, once told future-president Trump : “We are here to deliver your messages.”
Indeed, during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner reportedly boasted to a group of business executives that he’d struck a deal with Sinclair for favorable coverage in return for regular access to the candidate. “They know exactly what they’re getting. They’re getting an independent, honest journalist who’s not owned by the left, and I’m not owned by the right either”
“I didn’t know about that—but anyway,” Logan said about Kushner’s boast. “David Smith owns Sinclair and he can do whatever he wants…I don’t care. I have absolute freedom with this, and no one has suggested in the slightest way interfering with my stories…They know exactly what they’re getting. They’re getting an independent, honest journalist who’s not owned by the left, and I’m not owned by the right either.”
As for sharing screentime with Ephsteyn, “I have no influence over what he does or doesn’t do,” Logan said, noting that she has never watched Ephsteyn’s commentaries and doesn’t plan to.
“To me, a guy standing in front of a camera giving his opinion is very obviously a guy standing in front of a camera giving his opinion, and I don’t think anyone would be so concerned about that if his opinion was a very liberal one and he hated Trump, right? If he was the anti-Trump man of record, nobody would care in the media. It’s such hypocrisy and such a double standard.”
Logan added that many establishment journalists are motivated by “abject hatred of this administration” and that “many of those people are propagandists, pretending to be experts.”
It is now 5 ½ years since the catastrophically flawed Oct. 27, 2013 60 Minutes segment that derailed her career. Logan’s report presented a supposed witness’s false account of the lethal terrorist attack on the American diplomatic post, and the death of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, in Benghazi, Libya.
The segment was withdrawn by CBS News and earned Logan and her longtime producer, Max McClellan, a disciplinary suspension after an internal CBS News investigation concluded that they improperly relied on the fabricated testimony of State Department security contractor Dylan Davies (who was promoting a book about the attack under a pseudonym, published by an imprint of the CBS subsidiary Simon & Schuster), and failed to properly vet his assertions.
“The fact that the FBI and the State Department had information that differed from the account Davies gave to 60 Minutes was knowable before the piece aired,” wrote CBS News standards and practices director Al Ortiz in a damning summary of findings.
“But the wider reporting resources of CBS News were not employed in an effort to confirm his account. It’s possible that reporters and producers with better access to inside FBI sources could have found out that Davies had given varying and conflicting accounts of his story.”
Ortiz also singled out Logan for a speech she gave in October 2012, a month before starting work on the Benghazi story, “in which she took a strong public position arguing that the U.S. Government was misrepresenting the threat from Al Qaeda, and urging actions that the U.S. should take in response to the Benghazi attack.”
Ortiz added: “From a CBS News Standards perspective, there is a conflict in taking a public position on the government’s handling of Benghazi and Al Qaeda, while continuing to report on the story.”
As the scandal was erupting, Logan was compelled to apologize for the bogus report on CBS This Morning , telling cohost Norah O’Donnell: “The most important thing to every person at 60 Minutes is the truth, and today the truth is that we made a mistake. That's very disappointing for any journalist. It's very disappointing for me.”
Yet, surprisingly, in a lengthy interview with The Daily Beast, Logan passionately defended the discredited report, claiming it was largely accurate and her career-damaging error was insignificant—that airing Davies’ fabrications was relatively unimportant.
“The attack on me and 60 Minutes was so intense it tells me that they regarded the substance of our report to be extremely threatening,” Logan said.
“You know the harder they come after you, the more you know you got it right. And I’m not defending one person’s account in the story that was the least important and only parts of which have been called into question. I’m not defending that. I’m saying that over time, our story has been proved right…All those people who said my Benghazi mistake was a result of shoddy reporting—my reporting on Al Qaeda was absolutely true.” “A former CBS executive who doesn’t have the balls to put their name to what they’re saying? They’re cowards, they’re moral cowards. And I don’t care how angry they are”
A former CBS News executive who asked not to be further identified responded: “I am so angry about all of this. Where does someone get the nerve to do this after completely inventing a phony story about what happened at Benghazi? A story that could have easily been debunked by one phone call to a government agent. And she did not do that because she was biased and wanted that story to be true. She turned into a right-wing ideologue as she covered these wars and hung out further and further with all these right wing military guys…She is off the rails.”
Logan scoffed: “A former CBS executive who doesn’t have the balls to put their name to what they’re saying? They’re cowards, they’re moral cowards. And I don’t care how angry they are. Their anger is their problem. It’s not my problem.”
A year after her close friend from the war zone, retired four-star general and former Defense Intelligence Agency director Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty to a felony—lying to the FBI—Logan continues to defend him.
“Does anyone honestly think that Mike Flynn didn’t know that his conversation [with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak] was recorded?” Logan demanded. “Journalists say Sally Yates was concerned that Flynn was vulnerable to being blackmailed by the Russians? How? How was he vulnerable? What could they have known that the CIA and our own organizations didn’t know?”
Logan conceded: “He did plead guilty to lying to the FBI and I don’t know all the details of that circumstance and how that came about... It’s been reported widely that the two FBI agents who spoke to Mike Flynn both concluded that he wasn’t lying… I don’t know why Mike pled guilty. But they accused him of a lot of things. They accused him of treason. They accused him of being a Russian agent.”
It is sentiments such as those that have made Logan a very welcome guest on Fox News and other right-leaning outlets, where she regularly dismisses mainstream journalists as “propagandists” who have joined in an unholy alliance with the liberal press watchdog Media Matters for America and operatives of the Democratic Party.
On Tuesday afternoon, appearing on pugnacious former Trump White House aide Sebastian Gorka ’s syndicated radio show, Logan compared Trump’s journalistic critics and political adversaries to insects.
“The good part about this is that people all across America are seeing this for what it is,” she asserted. “It was almost like the lights came on in the wake of the election and all the cockroaches went scurrying.”
Logan is especially censorious of CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter. She accuses him, along with such journalists as Politico ’s Michael Calderone and magazine writer Joe Hagan (who wrote an epic 2014 New York Magazine profile of Logan ’s odyssey from swimsuit model in her native South Africa to swashbuckling witness to wars), of conspiring with Media Matters to spread liberal propaganda and punish reporters they disagree with.
“These people all work together. They all mirror the talking points of Media Matters for America,” Logan asserted, calling the non-profit founded by David Brock “the most powerful propaganda organization in this country….They have a staff of people working day and night to target me.”
Stelter and other press critics, meanwhile, are apparently colluding with Media Matters to slime independent journalists, Logan claimed. “Either it’s a miracle that rivals the Second Coming, or it’s by design,” she said. “They target other journalists and people they disagree with, with little regard for the truth.” “I don't get why she's now blaming other journalists years after admitting she was misled by a source and made a mistake”
Stelter shot back: “Labeling facts as partisan propaganda, or pretending those facts don't exist, doesn't change the truth.”
A Media Matters spokesperson told The Daily Beast: “These days Lara Logan is talking about Media Matters a lot more than Media Matters is talking about Lara Logan. In fact, until Logan publicly and repeatedly attacked us in February of this year, she hadn’t been tagged in a piece of content on our website since 2014.”
Calderone said: “I don't get why she's now blaming other journalists years after admitting she was misled by a source and made a mistake.”
Hagan declined to comment.
Among some former colleagues at CBS, Logan continues to command respect for her willingness to put herself in harm’s way in pursuit of journalism, while bullets fly and bombs fall.
She seems just about recovered from the horrific sexual assault—by a vicious mob of men—that she sustained in Cairo’s Tahrir Square during the 2011 Egyptian revolution that toppled dictator Hosni Mubarak. In the aftermath of the attack, Logan said, she made multiple hospital visits to treat internal injuries, and even consulted a psychiatrist, who pronounced her psychically healthy and emotionally grounded.
Logan, who said she’s also working on a book proposal with Washington’s Javelin literary agency (fired FBI director James Comey’s agents), described herself as “the breadwinner” for her family of five.
She lives in the wilds of the Texas Hill Country with three kids and her second husband, Joseph Burkett, a secretive former defense contractor she met in Afghanistan and began dating amid the war in Iraq, who she says has suffered from post traumatic stress disorder.
She is held in high regard by such CBS News veterans as Bernard Goldberg, who accused the network of tilting left back in 1996, when he published a Wall Street Journal op-ed that enraged his CBS bosses (and nearly got him fired), and later wrote a best-selling book of media criticism, titled Bias .
“I’m a big fan of Lara Logan,” Goldberg, who until last year was a Fox News contributor, told The Daily Beast. “I think what she’s saying is true, that too many journalists in the mainstream media really don’t like Donald Trump and are out to get him. Of course, Donald Trump brings a lot of this on himself with his pettiness, his dishonesty and his vindictiveness.”
Since February—when Logan, freshly jobless, burst upon the scene as a relentless center-right media critic in a 3 ½-hour long podcast with former Navy Seal Mike Ritland—she has appeared on Fox News programs so often (four times on Hannity , twice on The Ingraham Angle , and once each on Watters World and Life, Liberty and Levin ), to say nothing of the favorable mentions on Tucker Carlson Tonight and The Five , that media observers assumed she was publicly campaigning for gainful employment, or at least signaling her availability.
“Why do I need to signal that I’m available?” Logan demanded, noting that her longtime agent, Carole Cooper of UTA, has been testing the market since her CBS contract was ending. “Do these people know anything about this business? For goodness sake. Apart from everything it’s just stupidity to think that. Why do I need to signal it? My agent has relationships with these people going back 40 years…And does it look like I’m in desperate need of trying to get people to hire me? Come on!”
And now Sinclair has come knocking. The next chapter of Logan's tumultuous career story has begun.

Ilhan Omar Calls Out Fox News and GOP for ‘Dangerous Incitement’ Over Her 9/11 Comments,www.thedailybeast.com,olivia.messer@thedailybeast.com (Olivia Messer),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-crenshaw-rnc-attack-ilhan-omar-for-911-comments,"ATTACK Ilhan Omar Calls Out Fox News and GOP for ‘Dangerous Incitement’ Over Her 9/11 Comments The Somali-American congresswoman received several death threats this year before right-wing media’s new broadside over comments she made that referenced the terror attack. 04.10.19 12:53 PM ET REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst
Rep. Ilhan Omar on Wednesday called the conservative attacks lobbed against her “dangerous incitement” after Republicans and Fox News insinuated she was downplaying the 9/11 terror attack.
Omar, a Democrat and Somali-American from Minnesota, is under fire by the right for comments she made last month. At a fundraiser for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in Los Angeles, Omar said, in part, that “CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.” The comments circulated in right-wing media this week, with conservatives interpreting them as minimizing the terrorist attack.
On Wednesday, Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade questioned if the Somali-American is “an American first.” Then he proceeded to lecture her about her religious faith. “As a Muslim-American, you should be more outraged because they sullied your religion,” he said. “In the name of religion they killed Americans and still do it on a daily basis.”
Kilmeade later attempted to backtrack , tweeting, “I didn’t intend to question whether Rep. Omar is an American - I am questioning how any American, let alone a United States Congresswoman, could downplay the 9/11 attacks.”
On Tuesday, the chair of the Republican National Committee, Ronna McDaniel called Omar “anti-American.”
“Nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives to Islamic terrorists on 9/11, yet Omar diminishes it as: ‘Some people did something,’” she wrote. “Democrat leaders need to condemn her brazen display of disrespect.”
Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) called the comments “unbelievable.”
“First member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as 'some people who did something,’” he wrote.
Omar responded to critics on Wednesday afternoon on Twitter.
“I hope leaders of both parties will join me in condemning it,” she wrote. “My love and commitment to our country and that of my colleagues should never be in question. We are ALL Americans!”
Omar, the first of two Muslim women to serve in Congress, has been attacked by the right long before her CAIR comments.
Last month, Fox host Jeanine Pirro went on an Islamophobic rant , attacking the congresswoman for wearing a hijab. “Omar wears a hijab. Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?”
Fox News briefly suspended the host, issuing a statement at the time: “We strongly condemn Jeanine Pirro’s comments about Rep. Ilhan Omar. They do not reflect those of the network and we have addressed the matter with her directly.” She returned to even higher ratings.
Last week, a Trump supporter was arrested for allegedly threatening to assassinate her . The West Virginia GOP came under fire last month after setting up a display in its capitol rotunda with a meme that showed planes crashing into the World Trade Center that said “‘Never Forget’—You Said.” Below it, a photo of the congresswoman read “I am proof—you have forgotten. In February, federal prosecutors said a right-wing extremist put her name on a hit list of Democrats."
Benjamin Netanyahu ‘The Magician’ Is Re-elected Israel’s Prime Minister–But at What Price?,www.thedailybeast.com,Neri Zilber,04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/with-help-from-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-the-magician-is-re-elected-israels-prime-ministerbut-at-what-price,"THE GREAT ESCAPE Benjamin Netanyahu ‘the Magician’ Is Re-Elected Israel’s Prime Minister—but at What Price? Netanyahu, facing multiple indictments, may keep himself out of jail by annexing the West Bank. But what happens to 2.5 million Palestinians there? And to Israel’s identity? 04.10.19 12:09 PM ET Sebastian Scheiner/Getty
TEL AVIV–At exactly 2:00 a.m. in the deep dark before dawn on Wednesday, Benjamin Netanyahu finally strode on stage at a half-filled sports arena outside Tel Aviv and the crowd of supporters erupted in raucous cheers. “He’s a magician! He’s a magician! He’s a magician!” they chanted.
The Israeli premier had done it again–securing a fourth straight term as prime minister (and fifth overall dating back to the 1990s), overcoming three looming corruption indictments and three former military chiefs who had joined forces to unseat him.
Netanyahu’s Likud party topped a wave of nationalist parties–his “natural partners,” he called them–who together will surely give the premier a strong right-wing majority in parliament. But the “magician” will likely need to offer up some tantalizing new tricks–annexation of swaths of the West Bank, for instance, with Trump administration support–to keep even this coalition loyal and intact through the legal circus ahead. “Not one Trump administration official pushed back against Netanyahu’s newly stated intentions; the silence speaks volumes.”
After all, Netanyahu called this snap election last Christmas Eve precisely to forestall the expected decision by the attorney general to indict him on bribery, fraud, and breach of trust charges. The attorney general’s decision came regardless in early March, in the midst of an election campaign described by many as a referendum on the incumbent. That the public has now had a chance to look closely at Netanyahu, and returned him to office, will be used as ammunition in the legal and political wars to come.
“I'm very touched that the people of Israel gave me their vote of confidence for the fifth time, and an even bigger vote of confidence than previous elections,” Netanyahu said last night, flanked by his grinning wife Sara, also the subject of an ongoing corruption case. “Twenty-three years ago, for the first time, Sara and I stood here, and here we are again because of you.”
“Bibi, King of Israel,” the crowd kept chanting, using Netanyahu’s nickname, and nobody–not on this night–could dispute it. With the victory still fresh, Netanyahu’s loyalists are already trying to leverage the political win into the legal realm, and with good reason: Netanyahu’s final hearing in front of the attorney general is fast approaching in July.
“The people decided that the cases [against Netanyahu] aren’t criminal in nature,” one Likud backbencher argued today . “The people are sovereign.”
There is already speculation that Netanyahu will force all his potential coalition partners to support a law conveniently shielding incumbent prime ministers from prosecution, including retroactively for any previous crimes. Which is where Donald Trump likely comes in.
In return for such a law–and continued support through his legal travails–Netanyahu may make his right-wing partners an offer they can’t refuse: immunity for him in return for annexation of the West Bank. The issue of annexation reared its unprecedented head in the final days of the campaign, with Netanyahu repeatedly saying his plan (if re-elected) was to extend Israeli sovereignty to all the settlements in the West Bank. He tied it directly to Trump’s recent decision to recognize Israeli sovereignty on the Golan Heights, contrasting it (favorably) with the Obama administration’s past hostility to any such moves.
There was now, Netanyahu said, a “possibility to undertake this [West Bank] plan in a gradual way, I prefer with American recognition.” Crucially, not one Trump administration official pushed back against Netanyahu’s newly stated intentions; the silence speaks volumes. Such a move by Israel would likely mark the death knell for any negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Trump’s inscrutable “Deal of the Century” included. The Palestinian Authority would face severe strain, up to possible collapse; Israel, in turn, would have to do something with the 2.5 million Palestinians living in the territory, imperiling its own status as both a Jewish and democratic state.
One far-right party head and likely coalition partner, Bezalel Smotrich, argued today that his two goals for the upcoming government were annexation of the West Bank and a law allowing parliament to bypass the Supreme Court’s decisions.
The former is a long-standing settler wish, the Supreme Court being a thorn in their side due to the myriad illegalities of seizing private Palestinian land. For Netanyahu, however, such legislation is essential to ensure his immunity ploy is rammed through despite the court’s inevitable opposition.
Annexation of the West Bank may simply be the price for Smotrich’s (and others’) loyalty as the legal process unfolds. By law a sitting prime minister does not have to step down even if indicted. He would only have to leave office after all appeals are exhausted – which turns the question into a primarily political concern for Netanyahu in the immediate term.
In addition to Smotrich, there are several other right-wing leaders that need to be swayed. In the past, one other potentially key coalition partner (Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon) as well as a few senior Likud ministers signaled their disquiet with such “personalized” legislation only benefiting the premier. And of course, Israel’s is a parliamentary system requiring a majority governing coalition: the horsetrading to form such a coalition is legendary and much will depend on the final allocation of seats.
Yet the real power dynamic, for now at least, has to favor “King Bibi.” Standing on stage last night, a large screen played images of Netanyahu meeting with various world leaders he terms “personal friends,” including several with Trump.
“When did we get so many mandates?” the newly returned premier asked the crowd. It was partially a brag, and partially a warning to the Likud officials seated below him. “The right-wing bloc will continue to lead Israel for four more years. … We will continue turning Israel into one of the strongest among the nations of the world.”
You need me, he intimated to everyone watching – especially his future partners in government – and I intend to serve out my entire new term.
Massive sparklers fired up, confetti rained down from the rafters, the magician was done speaking. He was now on to his next great escape."
Scouted: Made In Cookware’s Carbon Steel is Cast Iron’s Lightweight Cousin — And It's Worth Investing In,www.thedailybeast.com,jillian.lucas@thedailybeast.com (Jillian Lucas),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/tom-colicchio-talks-carbon-steel-cookware-from-made-in,"By The Beast Sean Hong
Cast iron has been the gold standard of long-lasting cookware and stainless steel is known as the kitchen workhorse. But across the pond in France, a hybrid of both has taken hold in kitchens, and direct-to-consumer cookware brand Made In is here to change our western cooking sensibilities. Enter: Carbon Steel .
When it comes to the advantage of using carbon steel over cast iron or stainless steel, the answer is simple according to the acclaimed chef, restauranteur, and host of Top Chef Tom Colicchio, who is on the Advisory Board of Made In. “Carbon steel has the heat retention properties of cast iron without the weight of the other two,” Colicchio says. As someone who had to carry home their own Carbon Steel Skillet after being given one to test out, I can attest that it’s surprisingly lightweight for a piece of cookware.
Made In makes cooking with an unfamiliar material like carbon steel easy. Included in each package is a simple how-to to get you started and to make sure you’re getting the most out of your new cookware. The biggest thing you’ll need to do is season it. Made In's carbon steel, like some cast iron pans too, doesn’t come pre-seasoned because it allows you as the cook to customize and season whichever makes the most sense for you. There are even step-by-step instructions available to teach you their method using your oven and a little bit of patience.
Cast iron has its own set of rules when it comes to taking care of it, as does carbon steel. carbon steel can take a little elbow grease if you have some stuck-on gunk. “In most cases, you can scrub them out with a light steel wool,” Colicchio says. But he warned, “Absolutely do not put them away wet as they will rust (but if they do, a little steel wool will take it right out).”
The Made In skillet is an amazing starting point for carbon steel as it has the traditional skillet shape you know and are used to. It comes in the classic 10” or 12” style. But if you’re feeling adventurous, the newest member of the carbon steel family is the $99 wok . Made for rapid movement and high heat, you’ll impress your friends and family with your stir fry skills in the kitchen with this wok that’s made to perfectly fit on your stovetop.
If you’ve been wanting to break out of your reliance on the typical cast iron and stainless steel cookware that’s making you yawn, give the blue-tinted carbon steel Made In skillet a try.

Scientists Photograph Black Hole for the First Time Ever,www.thedailybeast.com,Victoria.Albert@thedailybeast.com (Victoria Albert),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-the-first-ever-black-hole-picture-from-the-event-horizon-telescope,"WOW Scientists Photograph Black Hole for the First Time Ever The image of a black hole 500 million trillion kilometers from Earth and larger than our solar system was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope. 04.10.19 9:23 AM ET Event Horizon Telescope
A team of 200 scientists unveiled the first-ever picture of a black hole from the Event Horizon Telescope on Wednesday—a remarkable leap in astrophysics that provides an unprecedented glimpse into the depths of the universe’s abyss.
“We have seen what we thought was unseeable,” Shep Doeleman, the director of the Event Horizon Telescope project, said at a press conference. “We have taken a picture of a black hole.”
The photo of a glowing, irregular orange ring surrounding a small black circle, shows a massive black hole at the center of the nearby Messier 87 galaxy.
It’s impossible to actually see the black hole, because it’s so dense that it sucks in all the nearby light. Instead, the picture shows the hole’s silhouette, cast against the intense brightness of the hot gases and plasma that scientists think surround it. At some point, those gases cross the hole’s “event horizon”—the point at which nothing can escape its powerful gravitational pull—and are drawn into the blackness.
“Even though those processes are things that could happen, we have not seen any of them happening in front of our eyes to be able to understand it,” Dimitrios Psaltis, an Event Horizon Telescope project scientist at the University of Arizona, told The Verge before the image was released. “By taking a picture very, very close to the event horizon, we can now start exploring our theories of what happens when I throw matter onto a black hole.”
The irregular shape of the orange glow seems to support Einstein’s theory of special relativity, which postulates that matter moving towards us will appear brighter than matter moving away from us.
“Einstein told us 100 years ago exactly what the size and the shape of that [black hole's] shadow should be, Doeleman said at SXSW last month . If we could lay a ruler across that shadow, we’d be able to test Einstein's theory of the black hole boundary.”
Getting this picture wasn’t easy. While the hole is millions of times more massive than the sun, it’s also tens of thousands of light years away.
To get the picture, scientists needed a telescope about the size of the Earth. They approximated that with a global network of massive radio telescopes scattered across the globe, in places like in Chile, Antarctica, and Hawaii, that picked up radio waves cast off by the hole.
The telescopes captured about five petabytes of data,on half a ton of hard drives—which the University of Arizona's Dan Marrone likened to “all of the selfies that 40k people will take in their lifetime.”
The data was so massive that it couldn’t even be transferred digitally—it had to be flown in, which caused problems when winter storms in Antarctica made the data inaccessible for months. And it reportedly took so much computing power that scientists had to wait for hard drive technology to catch up before they could process their results.
But in the end, the millions of gigabytes of data were mashed together in a supercomputer—creating the final picture shown today.
The first time the researchers saw the final image, Doeleman said, there was a sense of “astonishment and wonder.”
“There was such a buildup, there was a great sense of release, but also surprise,” he added. “When you work in this field for a long time, you get a lot of intermediate results. You could have seen something that was unexpected—but we didn't see something that was unexpected, we saw something so true [...] I think any scientist in any field would know what that feeling is, to see something for the first time.” READ THIS LIST"

For anyone wondering just what new avenues the split between the courts of Harry and Meghan and William and Kate might open up, fresh evidence emerges today in the shape of news that Prince Harry is to partner with Oprah Winfrey to make a new television series about mental health and wellness for Apple TV.
Oprah is a friend of Meghan’s from the Hollywood circuit and was a guest at last year’s royal wedding.
Harry’s role as executive producer was revealed in an Instagram post on his new account where the project was unveiled. He is also likely to be a star interviewee on the show.
Harry has spoken at length about the extreme mental health difficulties he faced in the aftermath of his mother’s death; first as a child but also as a young man in his twenties, when, he said, he felt his life was at risk of descending into “chaos” as he battled his demons.
It was in large part the trauma of coping with his mother’s death that inspired Harry to set up the Heads Together charity, with his brother, focused on mental health. READ THIS LIST"

Cops told The Daily Beast he could now face charges. 04.10.19 8:04 AM ET Reuters / Jorge Silva
A man reportedly wearing a Donald Trump shirt visited one of the New Zealand mosques which were targeted in last month's horrific massacre to scream abuse at Muslim worshippers and survivors of the attacks , according to reports coming out of Christchurch.
The news website stuff.co.nz reported that the unidentified man, reportedly wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan “Trump For New Zealand,” turned up outside the Masjid Al Noor mosque Wednesday afternoon. The mosque was where more than 40 of the 50 victims of the terror attack lost their lives as they attended Friday prays on March 15.
According to people who said they were at the scene, the apparent Trump fan shouted obscene language, accused all Muslims of being terrorists, and told those visiting the mosques—still in mourning for the dozens of friends and relatives that they lost—that they “all need to leave” New Zealand.
“He was there for about 15 minutes, he also kicked and tried to damage some of the memorial items along Deans Ave in front of the Masjid,” according to one unnamed person who said he witnessed the incident and discussed it on a local Muslim community page on Facebook. He posted a photo of a man in a Trump shirt next to two cops.
The report claims police—who have been stationed at the mosque with guns since the attack—decided not to arrest the man so as not to “potentially inflame the situation at that significant location.”
However, a police spokesperson told The Daily Beast: “Police are aware of a man who acted in a disorderly manner on Deans Avenue today, and are actively seeking him. He could face a disorderly behavior charge.”
Yasmeenah Safiya, 17, said she received a call from one of her friends who was at the scene, explaining to the Stuff website: “She was like, ‘a guy just came in wearing a Trump shirt and he was shouting abuse at all of us.’”
She added: “I just want the people of New Zealand to know that racism is still here, and it frustrates me when people say that racism is not us because it's been happening for years.”
Fifty people died in the two consecutive terrorist attacks at at the Al Noor and Linwood mosques. The suspected attacker 28-year-old Australian Brenton Harrison Tarrant, is facing 50 charges of murder and 39 of attempted murder.
The self-described racist flashed a white power sign during his first court appearance last month. READ THIS LIST"

Disgraced Former NBC Anchor Matt Lauer Comes Out of Hiding for Jeff Zucker’s Birthday Bash,www.thedailybeast.com,Barbie.Nadeau@thedailybeast.com (Barbie Latza Nadeau),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/disgraced-former-nbc-today-anchor-matt-lauer-comes-out-of-hiding-for-jeff-zuckers-birthday-bash,"PARTY TIME Disgraced Former NBC Anchor Matt Lauer Comes Out of Hiding for Jeff Zucker’s Birthday Bash The former NBC anchor has been hiding out in the Hamptons since he was fired from the network in 2018 over sexual harassment allegations. 04.10.19 7:14 AM ET Evan Agostini/GETTY Images
Disgraced former NBC Today anchor Matt Lauer made a rare public appearance over the weekend to celebrate his pal Jeff Zucker’s 54th birthday, according to Page Six . The bash was held at the posh Speakeasy Magick hotel, hosted somewhat appropriately by a “master deceptionist.”
Page Six , quoting party goers, reports that Lauer, who attended the party without a date, had a “great time” and enjoyed “a lot of laughs.” Several current NBC personalities attended the birthday party.
Zucker was Lauer’s former executive producer at NBC before climbing the network hierarchy and eventually joining CNN as the chief.
Lauer was fired from his $25 million a year job at NBC in 2018 after a number of women accused him of sexual harassment.
Lauer has been keeping to himself and spending time with his three children in the Hamptons since his fall from grace. He is currently going through a divorce with his second wife, reportedly as a result of the accusations that he sexually harassed women at NBC. Most famously, the Today Show star allegedly had a button under his desk that he could use to lock his door without getting up.
Page Six reports that the woman who outed the anchor is now “shopping around a tell-all book.”
Several women have come forward since Lauer was fired from the network to bolster claims against him. One woman has accused the anchor of giving her a sex toy as a gift with the implied intention of using it on her, according to Variety . Another woman said that Lauer once dropped his pants with a full erection and then “reprimanded her for not engaging in a sexual act.”
Lauer has repeatedly said that the any sexual contact with women was consensual, but he has apologized for the pain caused to his family. “I have made no public comments on the many false stories from anonymous or biased sources that have been reported about me over these past several months,” he said last year in a statement to the Washington Post in late 2018. “I remained silent in an attempt to protect my family from further embarrassment and to restore a small degree of the privacy they have lost.”
“But defending my family now requires me to speak up. I fully acknowledge that I acted inappropriately as a husband, father, and principal at NBC. However I want to make it perfectly clear that any allegations or reports of coercive, aggressive, or abusive actions on my part, at any time, are absolutely false.”"

With today’s release of the new $90 Kindle , Amazon continues to make it harder to resist owning its e-readers. This latest addition to the Kindle family is most notably now equipped with a front light, in that sense arguably placing it on equal footing with its enhanced and slightly pricier siblings.
The Kindle (just Kindle, yes) packs more than just the adjustable front light that lets you read in the dark (without bothering your bedmate, I might add). Bluetooth connectivity allows you to connect your headphones to the Kindle and listen to an audiobook . If you’re like me and fall for the discounted and complementing Audible audiobooks you get when you buy most Kindle books, you might have both. And while you could do so with your Kindle app, too, having both means you can seamlessly switch between reading and listening at a click’s notice, without your phone. It’s got 4 GB of storage , which is plenty to hold thousands of books but less when you start packing it with audiobooks. If you want to choose bigger hard drives, you can opt between 8 GB and 32 GB with the $130 Kindle Paperwhite and the $250 Kindle Oasis . But if you don’t need that storage (you don’t have to store more than the book or books you’re reading on your actual device), this $90 Kindle covers most of your needs and now gives you that venerable front light.
If you’ve been waiting to upgrade your Kindle or introduce someone to the vast world of digital readers, this new Kindle release is perfect.

Meghan Markle Plans Home Birth,www.thedailybeast.com,tom.sykes@thedailybeast.com (Tom Sykes),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/meghan-markle-plans-home-birth,"Meghan Markle Plans Home Birth Meghan will prove her alternative credentials by having a home birth, reports suggest. 04.10.19 5:51 AM ET WPA Pool
There has been much speculation in recent days that Meghan Markle will not choose to give give birth at the same hospital used by Kate Middleton , London’s exclusive Lindo Wing.
It had been reported that she was planning to use a hospital nearer her and Harry’s new home in Windsor but there are now reports that she will confirm her reputation as a royal trailblazer and aficionado of alternative ways of doing things by giving birth at home.
Ironically, however, a home birth will also mark a return to a lost tradition as the Queen was born at home, as were all four of her children.
Home birthing has enjoyed a boom in popularity in recent years, as many couples increasingly believe it provides a much less stressful environment in which to welcome a child into the world.
A friend told the Daily Mail that Meghan has sailed through her pregnancy and that home birth “is her favoured choice, but it obviously depends on how things are nearer the time.”
The Mail says Harry and Meghan have definitively ‘ruled out’ the Lindo Wing, saying it felt too much like a “goldfish bowl.”
Although home births only account for around 2.3 per cent of births in England, that number was almost zero a decade ago.
Community midwives are available on the Britain’s free health service for women who opt for home births, but it is likely Meghan will hire a private midwife and dhoula. She has made it clear she does not want the queen’s team of male obstetricians, Alan Farthing and Guy Thorpe-Beeston, closely involved in the actual birth.
“When it comes to giving birth, every woman has to decide what’s best for her and what’s best for her baby. The Queen’s team will be involved, but it has not been decided how much yet,’ the Mail ’s source said .
Statistically, home birth does increase the risk of serious problems for the child–from five in 1,000 for a hospital birth to nine in 1,000 for a home birth. READ THIS LIST"
"As a Prosecutor, Amy Klobuchar Once Threatened Kids: Go to School—or Court",www.thedailybeast.com,Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey),04-10-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/amy-klobuchar-as-a-prosecutor-once-threatened-kids-go-to-schoolor-court,"HARSH As a Prosecutor, Amy Klobuchar Once Threatened Kids: Go to School—or Court ‘For most kids, having the court get involved in their lives is a powerful incentive to get back to school,’ she wrote in 2004. 04.10.19 4:36 AM ET Photo Illustration by Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast/Getty
For a time, the refrigerators of some Minneapolis families featured an everyday object bearing a foreboding message: a magnet that reminded children that if they didn’t go to school or obey curfew, they’d be going to court.
The vaguely threatening kitchen decoration was courtesy of the office of Amy Klobuchar, who was the top prosecutor for Minnesota’s most populous county from 1999 to 2007. Klobuchar, now a Democratic U.S. Senator and 2020 presidential candidate , recalled in a 2010 interview with Politico that the magnet was “hot” with parents.
“They loved putting it up on the wall and saying, you know, if you don't follow these rules, you could get prosecuted,” said Klobuchar. “Whether or not it actually happens, it changes a culture, and that's part of what we're trying to do here.”
But the tchotchke represented something darker to local activists who saw a policy that burdened the poor and people of color, and had the potential to create more chaos in the lives of the children the state was purporting to protect.
As Hennepin County Attorney, Klobuchar made it a priority to use the power of her office to tackle chronic school absence, or truancy, a perennial problem for schools, especially those in low-income, predominantly minority schools in cities like Minneapolis.
Even though truancy is not a crime in Minnesota, Klobuchar frequently called truancy a “gateway to crime” or even “the kindergarten of crime;” in a 2004 op-ed, she urged readers to call the police if they saw truant children out during the day.
Like the other former prosecutor in the 2020 race, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Klobuchar and her prosecutorial record have been scrutinized in light of the ongoing reckoning over the “tough-on-crime” era and its contribution to the injustices of mass incarceration.
Sensitive to criticisms of her record, particularly from communities of color, Klobuchar is now working to establish herself as a leading advocate for criminal justice reform in the 2020 field. On the day of her appearance last week at the National Action Network conference organized by Rev. Al Sharpton, Klobuchar wrote a CNN op-ed calling for further reforms to the justice system, leaning on her experience as a prosecutor to boost her credibility.
But unlike Harris, who has faced significant criticism for her declaration in 2010 that she would prosecute truancy like a crime, Klobuchar’s record on the issue has gone unexamined.
That does not sit well with some back in Minnesota. Bill English, a longtime community activist from Minneapolis’ North Side, said Klobuchar’s truancy approach “showed a total lack of sensitivity to poor parents of color, who often have to leave for work early without transportation, aren’t able to get their kids off to school.”
A campaign spokesperson defended Klobuchar’s record on the issue. “As Hennepin County Attorney, Senator Klobuchar was committed to helping students stay in school, which is why she developed and expanded programs and services to support kids and families and prevent truancy. Her truancy initiatives were never focused on punishing students or parents–they were instead focused on prevention, early intervention and support services to help families and school officials develop strategies to keep individual kids in schools on a case-by-case basis.""
After winning office in 1998 on promises to crack down on ills from violent crime to truancy, Klobuchar worked early in her tenure with school officials to push a new policy that threatened students with failing grades if they missed four days of school without an excuse. A student in Minnesota is considered chronically absent if they miss 10 percent or more of the days they are enrolled.
Klobuchar developed new intervention initiatives designed to put truant students and their parents in front of counselors, who would warn them of the consequences of not staying in school and provide services and items—like alarm clocks—to help them maintain attendance.
If those interventions failed, chronically absent students were referred to the county attorney’s office. In the 1999-2000 school year, Klobuchar’s first on the job, her office received just over 1,300 truancy referrals from county school districts. In a 2003 report, the county attorney office stated that it received roughly 1,600 referrals annually.
Most referrals resulted in a student and their parent or guardian being required to appear in court. A 2003 report from Klobuchar’s office explained that a truant student and/or their parent could face a range of punishments. “For a student who is judged truant, sanctions can range from community service or work squad duty to fines or driver’s license suspension to, in rare cases, out-of-home placement,” read the paper.
Klobuchar backed a policy championed by then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty (R) to make a student’s attendance record a factor in whether or not they receive a driver’s license. A September 2004 story from the AP reported that Klobuchar’s office used the policy to suspend or deny licenses to truants on 200 occasions that year.
“Out-of-home placement,” which removes a student from their home and temporarily places them in foster care or another supervised environment, is a recourse in some jurisdictions for students who are judged truant, often because child protective authorities discover adverse conditions at home in the course of a truancy proceeding. English remembers truant students from the North Side being temporarily placed in foster homes outside the city. “That was unconscionable to me,” he said. A spokesperson for Klobuchar said that out-of-home placement was not solely a response to truancy.
Armed with statistics suggesting truant students were highly likely to commit crimes later in life, Klobuchar and her county attorney’s office argued that an aggressive response to students who missed school would push them off a path of involvement in drugs, gangs, and other criminal activity.
Though Klobuchar pushed programs to bring services to truant students, she was unafraid to dangle the threat of court. “For most kids, having the court get involved in their lives is a powerful incentive to get back to school,” she wrote in an op-ed. “But the sanctions have to be real; kids catch on right away if all they face is a legal paper tiger.”
According to data provided by the Minnesota Department of Education, truancy rates remained relatively consistent through Klobuchar’s tenure as county attorney. In her first school year, roughly 8.5 percent of all students in Minneapolis Public Schools were chronically absent. By the 2005-2006 school year, her last full year in office, that figure had declined to 7.5 percent.
Some individual schools reported more dramatic results. A 2001 report prepared by the Minneapolis Police Department touted the results of a partnership with Klobuchar’s office, targeted at Minneapolis’ North Side, where some schools had truancy rates of 25 percent or higher in the mid-1990s. In a pair of schools, the report said, truancy rates dropped after one year of the new program, which implemented several steps of interventions from school advisers before referring a student to the attorney’s office.
But in the eyes of top city officials, truancy remained a problem through Klobuchar’s tenure as prosecutor. In 2006, when Minneapolis saw the highest spike in violent crime of any city in the Midwest, then-Minneapolis Police Chief Tim Dolan wondered if more money for anti-truancy programs would help solve the problem.
Today, education experts are skeptical of the wisdom of bringing the force of a prosecutor’s office to bear on tackling truancy. According to William Koski, director of the Youth and Education Law Project at Stanford University, student advocates have long frowned on the designs of prosecutors like Klobuchar and Harris on the issue.
“We don’t want the criminal justice system involved with kids, especially with something like truancy,” Koski told The Daily Beast. “Whether it’s mental health, substance abuse, homelessness, a lot of reasons kids are truant, from the perspective of a child advocate, I think the judicial system is not a way to address those.”"

Music festivals encapsulate the best and worst of summer. To do the festival circuit right is to lean into all of its intensity. If you want to have the weekend of a lifetime, you best believe you will, even if that means waiting in line for a Porta Potty while a teenager next to you is chugging vodka out of a crinkled plastic water bottle.
The festivals this year are as diverse as the lineups. Want to suntan while watching Cardi B dominate the stage? Head to Hangout Fest. Looking to mingle with the best of Black Hollywood? Essence Fest in New Orleans is your spot. And if you’re an A Star is Born stan, there’s no way you can miss Stagecoach where Jackson Maine once performed. Dates: April 12-14 and April 19-21 Location: Indio, CA Headliners: Ariana Grande, Childish Gambino, Tame Impala
Does possibly new bi queen Ariana Grande headlining Coachella negate the festival’s notoriously anti-LGBT owner ? No, absolutely not. But that won’t stop thousands of teenagers, USC students ( Olivia Jade so graciously offered her style tips there last year ) and celebrities from descending upon California’s Colorado Desert hours outside of Los Angeles. Weekend and VIP passes are sold out, but you can still snag a tent without having to go to StubHub."

A 21-year-old named Holden Matthews has been arrested in connection with fires that destroyed three Louisiana churches in the span of two weeks, local news outlet KATC reports.
Throughout the end of March and in early April, three churches in rural St. Landry Parish were burned down. Matthews is reportedly the son of a St. Landry Parish Deputy, and he was booked into St. Landry Parish jail at about 5:30 this evening. Holden’s father is a St. Landry Parish sheriff’s deputy. (His family declined to comment to The Daily Beast.)
On a Facebook page that appears to belong to Matthews, he was active in black metal and pagan pages. Although both scenes are predominately apolitical, both have large neo-Nazi fanbases. Matthews commented on two memes about Varg Vikernes, a far-right (and self-described former neo-Nazi) metal musician who served 15 years in prison for burning churches in Norway and killing a fellow metal musician.
Vikernes, a practitioner of pagan beliefs, described the arsons as having been ""revenge"" for Christian actions against pagan Viking graves. Vikernes has been cited by other far-right killers. Norwegian white supremacist Anders Breivik sent Vikernes a copy of his manifesto before going on to kill 77 people. Atomwaffen Division, a U.S.-based neo-Nazi group with multiple murders to its name, has cited Vikernes books on paganism on their website.
Matthews commented on two memes about Vikernes. Neither comment was particularly revealing, but they indicated his familiarity with the fringe figure. The pagan circles Matthews and Vikernes frequented can be popular with neo-Nazis . Matthews frequently posted about pagan beliefs, and recently uploaded a picture of a gun and a knife with the caption ""I carry this maybe not legally but I only truly follow the law of Odin which says as you said,arm yourself Odins advice> modern law."" Odin is a pagan Norse god.
One of the pagan pages Matthews was active on specifically forbade racism and ""nazi stuff."" Matthews also appeared aware of the religion's white supremacist associations. In one post, a group member noted that a drawing of a pagan figure had a swastika-like design on his belt. ""well yea the belt gives him extra strength and power white power lmao jk jk I had to,"" Matthews wrote.""
In the span on 10 days, three predominantly black churches were destroyed in what officials described “suspicious” fires, according to The New York Times . The fires occurred at St. Mary Baptist Church, Greater Union Baptist Church, and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church on March 26, April 2, and April 4, respectively. Another “intentionally set” fire was also reported on April 7 at the predominantly white Vivian United Pentecostal Church a few hours away.
“There certainly is a commonality, and whether that leads to a person or persons or groups, we just don’t know,” State Fire Marshal H. Browning reportedly said in a news conference last week. The FBI and ATF have also investigated the fires.
Rev. Gerald Toussaint, pastor at Mount Pleasant Baptist Church, told the Times the only parts left of the church were a brick wall and a corridor.
“I’m trying to find out who did it, why they did it, did it have anything to do with me,” Toussaint said. “I don’t know none of this.”
St. Landry Parish, reportedly a rural area in Louisiana, is 41 percent black and 56 percent white. Toussaint told the newspaper relations between the races were good on the whole.
On Tuesday, NAACP president Derrick Johnson called the fires evidence of “domestic terrorism” targeting people of color and their religions.
“The spike in church burnings in the Southern states is a reflection of emboldened racial rhetoric and tension spreading across the country,"" he said in a statement, according to ABC News . “But this is nothing new. For decades, African-American churches have served as the epicenter of survival and a symbol of hope for many in the African-American community. As a consequence, these houses of faith have historically been targets of violence.”
Rep. Clay Higgins (R-LA) called the apparent arsons an “affront against God himself and his children.”
“If you participated in this, you have succumbed to evil,” Higgins said, according to the Lafayette Daily Advertiser . “You will be caught. You will be arrested. You will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
According to KATC, Louisiana State Fire Marshal’s Office will hold a press conference on Thursday along with Governor John Bel Edwards and officials from St. Landry Parish, the FBI, and ATF. READ THIS LIST"

Ilhan Omar visits Stephen Colbert's 'Late Show.' CBS
At the end of yet another controversy-filled day , Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) sat down with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show and tried to show the world she’s not actually as scary as Fox News wants you to think she is .
Colbert began the interview by noting that he had booked his guest “a long time ago,” before she had become a “lightning rod” for those on both the right and the left.
“If you think about, historically, where our nation is right now, there are many members of our community that their identities are a lightning rod,” Omar, the first of two Muslim women in Congress, said, explaining that immigrants, refugees, women of color and others are being used as “political footballs.” She “just happens to embody all of those identities.”
Beginning with the comments that some have deemed anti-Semitic , Colbert asked Omar what it was like to be “used as a political cudgel” from the very start of her first term as a congresswoman.
“This whole process really has been one of growth for me,” Omar replied, acknowledging that she was not always aware of the tropes that may have been offensive to some Jewish people. “When you tell me you are pained by something that I say, I will always listen and I will acknowledge your pain,” she said. But the same should go in the other direction.
“When you have people on Fox News question whether I am actually American or I put ‘America first,’ I expect my colleagues to also say, ‘That’s not OK’ and call that out,” she continued, referring to comments earlier Wednesday morning from Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade . To those who question her loyalty to America, Omar said, “I took an oath to uphold the Constitution. I am as American as everyone else is.”
She went on to call out the “double standard” of criticizing her supposed “insinuations” but not going after “people like the folks on Fox & Friends who actually say those words.”
“They actually said that I might not be an American, that my loyalties might not be to this country,” Omar continued, “but I get called out. They don’t. They get to keep their show.”
One recent comment that got Omar in trouble was when she referred to Trump adviser Stephen Miller as a “white nationalist.” That made Colbert aware of the double standard she referred to when he thought to himself, “Haven’t I said that?”
“You see this outrage when I speak the truth,” Omar said in response. “Everybody else’s truth is allowed, but my truth can never be.”"

Samantha Bee has made her views about Kellyanne Conway known in the past. This week, she took a long, hard look at the White House counselor’s relationship with her Trump-hating husband .
“We all know Kellyanne Conway,” Bee said on Wednesday’s Full Frontal . “She’s both the first woman to ever lead a presidential campaign to victory and an intrepid time traveler who must carry the burden that she alone created the Bowling Green Massacre . But while Kellyanne has made a lucrative career of spitting into Jake Tapper’s mouth on behalf of Donald Trump, her husband, lawyer, and Martin Short character George Conway has not been shy about hating her boss.”
“To be fair, it’s natural for couples to disagree on issues,” the host added. But while she and her husband Jason Jones keep their internal debates private, she said, “Kellyanne and George Conway make their disagreements public for everyone to see. It’s hard to see how a couple could tear each other down like that in public and still be happily married. It’s almost like, oh my god, they’re getting off on this, aren’t they?”
As Bee put it, “The Twitter feuding doesn’t put a kink in their relationship, it is the kink in their relationship.” She imagined them going after each other all day online and then coming home and getting “nasty” with Trump as “the third in their cyber-threesome.”
“You’d think that a feud between her husband and her boss would be deeply upsetting to Kellyanne Conway—to which I say, she loves it,” Bee said later, calling her defense of Trump over her own husband a “new level of psychological foreplay.”
Bee insisted that she is not trying to “kink-shame” the Conways, she just wishes they would keep their conflict “behind closed doors.” Plus, she’s worried this is all building towards something “truly disgusting: their own Fox News show.”"

Justin Baragona 04.10.19 10:14 PM ET
Reacting to Attorney General William Barr’s shocking claim that he believes “spying did occur” on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election, CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Wednesday night that this was further proof the Republican Party establishment was beholden to Fox News and its top star.
During Wednesday’s Senate Appropriations hearing , Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) asked Barr about his decision to convene a team to investigate why the FBI opened an investigation into Russian election interference in the 2016 election. Barr replied that he was reviewing the “conduct of intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign” before saying, “I think spying did occur.”
This claim that the Obama administration used the FBI and intelligence agencies to spy on the Trump campaign has been pushed by President Trump and his allies for over two years now, starting with Trump’s infamous tweet—and unfounded claim —that he “found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory.”
Fox News host Sean Hannity, meanwhile, has been one of conservative media’s leading traffickers of the theory that an anti-Trump ‘Deep State” in the government tried to take down Trump before the election, devoting countless on-air segments to it.
Discussing Barr’s testimony on CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360 , anchor Anderson Cooper asked Toobin what he made of the Attorney General echoing Trump’s rhetoric and using the word spying, noting that Barr is “not someone who says something by accident.”
“This is a classic demonstration of the Fox News-ification of the Republican Party,” Toobin exclaimed. “That even an establishment figure like Bill Barr, someone who comes out of the George Herbert Walker Bush administration, talks like Sean Hannity.”
The legal analyst criticized Barr for using a “loaded term” that was “completely false,” adding that Barr not only said there was spying but that the attorney general is going to conduct an investigation into it.
“That is a President Trump talking point,” Toobin declared. “There's already been an inspector general's investigation, so I don't know what he's going to investigate, but you know, his use of this term shows how much the paranoid lunacy of the right wing is now moved right in to the Department of Justice.”
Toobin also took Barr to task for bringing up Uranium One, which he noted has long been “another Fox News fantasy about Hillary Clinton.”
This wasn’t the first time Toobin invoked Hannity on Wednesday while discussing Barr’s testimony. Earlier in the day on CNN , he said the attorney general was sending a “dog whistle to Sean Hannity.” READ THIS LIST"

Former White House counsel Greg Craig is bracing for an indictment on lobbying charges soon in connection with a case referred by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office.
In statements to the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post , Craig’s lawyers said they expect federal prosecutors in Washington, DC to charge their client with making false statements related to his work on a report commissioned by former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort . In anticipation of the move, Craig’s attorneys blasted the “misguided abuse of prosecutorial discretion” and say he was under no obligation to register as a foreign agent for his work on a 2012 report for powerhouse law firm Skadden Arps .
The report featured prominently in the special counsel’s Washington, DC case against Manafort . Prosecutors alleged that the report, paid for by the government of Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, was one part of a broad lobbying effort waged by Manafort on behalf of his clients in Kiev. The report examined Yanukovych’s prosecution of his former rival Yulia Tymoshenko and, in the eyes of the special counsel’s office, whitewashed the move as in keeping with norms of the rule of law.
Craig spearheaded the writing of the report and, in the opinion of the Justice Department, ventured from analyst to lobbyist when he reached out to The New York Times to ask if a reporter would take a call from a lobbyist on the case and delivered a copy of the report to the Times . In a civil settlement with Skadden, Justice Department officials wrote that Craig’s outreach was “consistent with Ukraine’s media strategy” and that he “had an obligation to register with the Department of Justice” under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
But sources close to Craig have pushed back aggressively on that characterization to the Journal and CNN. They argue that Craig never billed his clients for the time he spent talking to the Times and that the discussions were only an attempt to correct misinformation circulating about the report and not an extension of the Ukrainian government’s media strategy.
Prosecutors took issue with that explanation in their January 2019 settlement with Skadden. They wrote that Craig’s “false and misleading statements” included his claim that he spoke to reporters “only in response to requests from the media and spoke to the media to correct misinformation about the report that the media was already reporting.”
The Journal reported that the National Security Division has taken up the Craig case after prosecutors in New York, who originally investigated the case after it was referred by the special counsel’s office, declined to press charges.
Craig resigned from Skadden in April 2018, shortly after Alexander Van Der Zwaan , a former Skadden lawyer who worked on the report, was sentenced for lying to the special counsel’s office about his interactions with Manafort’s associates. Skadden fired Van Der Zwaan in 2017. READ THIS LIST"
Could Jeff Bezos Finally Crush the National Enquirer?,www.thedailybeast.com,julia.arciga@thedailybeast.com (Julia Arciga),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/could-jeff-bezos-finally-crush-the-national-enquirer,"PISSED OFF THE WRONG BILLIONAIRE Could Jeff Bezos Finally Crush the National Enquirer? It’s a bad day for Trump’s favorite tabloid as American Media Inc. looks to sell the Enquirer and Jeff Bezos reportedly talks to prosecutors about his extortion and hacking claims. 04.10.19 9:05 PM ET Bloomberg/Getty
American Media Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer , is seeking to sell the embattled tabloid just as Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is reportedly meeting with New York federal prosecutors over extortion and hacking claims that he and his associates have made against the publisher.
Earlier this year, the Enquirer enraged the billionaire after it ran a story on his alleged extramarital affair with media personality Lauren Sanchez. Bezos fired back with a scathing post on Medium in which he claimed that the Enquirer had tried to extort him with dick pics. Bezos’ security consultant, Gavin de Becker, also accused AMI of being “in league” in Saudi Arabia in a Daily Beast op-ed.
On Wednesday evening, American Media Inc. said it was exploring “strategic options for its National Enquirer (U.S. and U.K. editions), Globe and National Examiner brands” in a press release. The publisher said it expected a sale to occur “in the near future.”
“We have been keenly focused on leveraging the popularity of our celebrity glossy, teen and active lifestyle brands while developing new and robust platforms including broadcast and audio programming, and a live events business, that now deliver significant revenue streams,” AMI President David Pecker wrote in the release. “Because of this focus, we feel the future opportunities with the tabloids can be best exploited by a different ownership.”
However, The Washington Post reported that the internal decision for AMI to sell the Enquirer was driven by hedge fund manager Anthony Melchiorre, who has an 80 percent stake in AMI. A source told the newspaper that Melchiorre was “really disgusted” by the Enquirer ’s reporting on Bezos’ extramarital affair.
The Enquirer allegedly paid Sanchez’s brother for photographic evidence of her affair with the mogul—and, Bezos claimed in a blog post earlier this year, tried to blackmail him before it ran its story on the tryst.
“Any personal embarrassment AMI could cause me takes a back seat because there’s a much more important matter involved here,” Bezos wrote. “If in my position I can’t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?”
De Becker and Bezos have also hinted that Bezos might have been a target for the Saudis due to the CEO’s ownership of the Post . Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for the Post who was deeply critical of the Saudi government and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed late last year in Istanbul’s Saudi Arabian consulate. In his op-ed, de Becker wrote that the “Saudi government has been intent on harming Jeff Bezos since last October, when the Post began its relentless coverage of Khashoggi’s murder.”
“Our investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence that the Saudis had access to Bezos’ phone, and gained private information,” de Becker wrote. “As of today, it is unclear to what degree, if any, AMI was aware of the details.”
Bezos will be addressing both his allegations of extortion and de Becker’s allegations of hacking in meetings with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, according to CNN .
Federal prosecutors have already been probing Bezos' extortion claim, and have yet to come to any conclusions. To investigate the hacking claims, the New York federal prosecutors are reportedly seeking to gain access to Bezos's electronics and Bezos has been “in negotiations” with prosecutors. Matthew Schwartz, a lawyer for Bezos, did not respond to CNN's request for comment. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office and the FBI also reportedly declined to comment.
Beyond the Bezos incident, AMI acknowledged paying ex- Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 for her story about her alleged affair with President Trump—a Pecker pal—in a catch-and-kill scheme. The deal was allegedly made in order to prevent the story from being published and “influencing the election.” AMI was also involved with a similar catch-and-kill deal with adult film star Stormy Daniels —who also claimed she had an affair with Trump.
On top of all the scandals, the Enquirer tabloid is also reportedly facing massive debt and a huge dip in their circulation numbers—selling 516,000 copies per issue in 2014 to 218,000 copies per issue in December."

Why Is She Getting a Health Show?,www.thedailybeast.com,Daniel Summers,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/oprah-pushes-junk-science-why-is-she-getting-a-health-show-with-prince-harry,"MEDICAL MISINFORMATION Oprah Pushes Junk Science. Why Is She Getting a Health Show? Winfrey and Prince Harry are creating a show about mental health and wellness. But should we look to a woman who’s promoted Jenny McCarthy, Dr. Phil, and Dr. Oz for health advice? 04.10.19 8:59 PM ET Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast/Getty
When it comes to giving an issue attention, it’s hard to imagine a duo with more star wattage to contribute than Prince Harry and Oprah Winfrey.
For an issue as important as mental health, the combination of their massive celebrity appears to be a very good thing. Breaking news that the two will be joining forces to create a show about mental health and wellness for Apple TV would seem to be cause for celebration. Reducing the stigma around mental illness, giving people more information about their own mental health, and directing people toward resources they may not have known existed are all worthy goals.
Yet I greet this news with no small amount of skepticism.
Oprah’s track record on health information is riddled with missteps. While it’s too early to tell what the show’s content will eventually include, looking back at the voices she’s chosen to amplify and people she’s chosen to elevate gives me serious pause.
With a measles outbreak in New York City severe enough to lead to an emergency declaration , it’s hard to think of a more glaring source of medical misinformation than Jenny McCarthy. McCarthy is one of the most famous faces of the movement pushing the fallacious link between vaccines and autism, going so far once as to say “ we will stand in line for the fucking measles ” rather than accept a vaccine she wrongly considered unsafe. Reports of parents holding “measles parties” to infect their kids (and thus put them at risk of a progressive, incurable neurodegenerative disease years later ) show just how dangerous that message can be.
Yet Oprah was all set to give McCarthy the huge platform of her own syndicated talk show several years ago. The deal eventually fell through, which according to McCarthy was because she walked away , not because there was any objection to the kinds of things she was likely to say. Even now you can read all about her “warrior spirit” on Oprah’s website, in an article rife with misinformation about how her son’s autism was supposedly cured through a combination of an elimination diet, organic foods, and vitamins.
Had things panned out with McCarthy, she’d have followed on the heels of two other famous names whose celebrity is due almost entirely to Oprah. Both Dr. Phil McGraw and Dr. Mehmet Oz owe their success to the exposure they got on her program, eventually leading to deals with her production company for shows bearing their own names . Neither are encouraging predictors for what may be in store for her.
Dr. Phil’s often exploitative, confrontational, intervention-heavy approach has led to some troubling outcomes, including a much-criticized decision to show up at Britney Spears’ hospital during an earlier mental health crisis. Several years ago he advised a mother whose son liked to play with Barbies to correct his “confusion” by only buying him “boy things,” advice that as a pediatrician I firmly reject. Dr. Phil’s capacity to deliver harmful messages like these to a wide audience is directly linked to Oprah’s decision to promote him in the first place.
Few people have more thoroughly trashed their credibility as medical professionals as Dr. Oz. His show is a steady source of pseudoscience and oversold health claims. The misinformation he has dispensed on his show was egregious enough to land him in a Senate hearing where he was lambasted by Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO). The degree to which he has leveraged his credentials as a physician to promote quackery once led a group of doctors to send a letter to the dean of Columbia University’s medical school requesting it rescind his faculty appointment there.
Without Oprah, none of this would have happened.
Where she will get material to include in the new show is reason for concern. She’s chummy enough with Gwyneth Paltrow, touter of vaginal steaming and no slouch in the medical misinformation department herself, to be the first guest on the GOOP podcast . (Where is it filed on the website? Under “wellness.”) A celebrity-driven approach to the topic of mental health could go awry in all manner of ways.
If my concerns are unfounded, and Oprah takes an evidence-based approach to the content she features on her show, I will be the first to applaud it. (The effect of Prince Harry’s involvement is hard to determine, but he clearly takes the issue of mental health very seriously, and has been refreshingly open about his own history .) Mental illness affects millions of Americans , and far too many lack access to appropriate care. I’m all for a show that draws focus to this problem, with the hope that some may find their way to care they’d otherwise have lacked.
But I’m not ready to celebrate yet. Oprah has too often amplified messages and promoted messengers more deserving of scorn than attention, and it’s too early to know if the announcement of this new show counts as good news. READ THIS LIST"
Britain’s Hottest New Rapper Jimothy Lacoste Plays Off Brexit Fears and Normcore Nostalgia,www.thedailybeast.com,Hannah Moore,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/britains-hottest-new-rapper-jimothy-lacoste-plays-off-brexit-fears-and-normcore-nostalgia,"Britain’s Hottest New Rapper Jimothy Lacoste Plays Off Brexit Fears and Normcore Nostalgia Darren Gerrish/Getty He raps about eating healthy meals, not doing drugs, and feeling ""hella English."" Meet Jimothy Lacoste, Britain's new cult star. Hannah Moore 04.10.19 8:23 PM ET
J imothy Lacoste is mundane; deliberately so. The north London rapper’s signature track, Getting Busy! is an ode to being boring. “It’s amazing how good you feel/ When you’ve got a schedule and you’re eating healthy meals,”his voice drawls over the zippy synth-filled beats he makes on his laptop. “Life is getting quite exciting.”
Over the past year or so, Jimothy (real name Timothy Gonzales) has grown in status from YouTube oddity to cult star in Britain. At major music festivals like Reading and Leeds last summer, thousands of teenage fans moshed along to his mild-mannered anthems like Drugs , which combines the sentiment of a government health campaign with the swagger of a London rude boy. To a sparse drum machine beat: “You’re getting wrinkles, you're looking dry/ Baby take it easy, stop getting high.”
His homemade, low-budget videos amassed hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube before he got a record deal. He is championed by cool-kid publications MixMag , Dazed and i-D . Adidas posted his face on billboards across London. And now he’s signed to music label Black Butter, the home of DJ Khaled, pop star Jess Glynne, and Wiley, the “Godfather of grime.” Jimothy is going to be getting genuinely exciting.
It might seem to contravene the codes of credibility that a kid who espouses the benefits of eating four oranges a day, who takes cold showers “for my willpower,” and who styles himself like a posh version of Arthur the cartoon aardvark (corduroy trousers and a neat button-up shirt is his signature style) recently sold out his first UK stadium tour. But Gonzalez’s brand of boyish self-parody is bang on trend.
The same sense of irony has been playing out on TV, too, where our current national hero is Danny Dyer, an actor-cum professional cockney caricature lauded for calling former Prime Minister David Cameron a “twat” on live national television. Dyer’s latest exploit, this week, was upstaging his reality-star daughter (first name: Dani) at the launch of her new book, by revealing to T he Sun the details of their colonic irrigations: “You’re sitting in a surgery with someone putting a tube up your a*** and you think, ‘What am I doing?’” So dear is Dyer to the nation’s hearts that in January the BBC granted him his own TV show, Danny Dyer ’s Right Royal Family , in which he cavorted about Tudor palaces in pantaloons and a codpiece, to trace his rather tenuous connection to the ancient British monarchy.
In times of acute uncertainty, it feels safer to retreat into comedic, idealized visions of our past than to consider our present, in which Britain seems to be falling blindly out of the European Union. Last summer, during the football World Cup , the song Three Lions , by comedians Baddiel and Skinner, resurfaced as a kind of unofficial British anthem. Its lyrics, celebrating England’s one and only World Cup victory, in 1966, were already nostalgic when the track was released in the 1990s. In 2018, the lyrics seemed ever more appropriate; they allowed us to hold on to the “glory days” of football, the so-called “national game,” and so convince ourselves that the nation itself was unified. From the football terraces to the royal palaces ( Prince William tweeted some of the lyrics) people chanted, “It’s coming home, it’s coming home,” and for a few hot summer weeks, English people bathed in a nostalgic display of false national glory, knowing that this would likely be the country’s last summer as part of the EU. “ “Rocking Burberry socks, now I’m feeling hella English,” raps Jimothy on his latest track, 'Getting Burberry Socks.' The fashion brand, like Jimothy himself, has built its riches on Brit nostalgia. ”
“Rocking Burberry socks, now I’m feeling hella English,” raps Jimothy on his latest track, Getting Burberry Socks . The fashion brand, like Jimothy himself, has built its riches on Brit nostalgia, with advertising campaigns that feature male models dressed as Beefeaters—the Queen’s official guards—in fluffy black hats and postbox-red jackets; in others, young lovers in ruffled shirts prance around England’s green (and pleasant) land like fantasies from a Brontë novel. And those fantasies have turned into huge profits: the luxury brand made £173 million (around $225 million) last year, mainly from foreign customers.
As Burberry asserts its Englishness to the world, so too does Jimothy in the Burberry Socks video. Dressed in a 1990s-style Burberry check puffer jacket, he strolls about New York city flashing the St. George’s Cross painted on his belt buckle and repeating “English, English, English,” in the faces of commuters on the subway, who, like true New Yorkers, pay him no attention. If this loutish display sounds spookily like something far-right activists Britain First might do, that’s the point. Gonzalez is making fun of those who voted for Brexit on the belief that Britain is a fearsome world power, better off alone than as part of the EU. When Jimothy chants, “English, English,” no-one listens, just as when vociferous Brits shout about “Taking our country back!” By now, it feels like the EU is so tired of the screams that it merely shrugs its shoulders and replies: you ’re welcome to it. Through retro styling and retrograde chants, Jimothy is figuratively “taking us back” to the past. You can’t help but laugh at the bleakness of his efforts: What does it mean to be, “hella English,” anyway?
We still don’t know what’s happening after the current Brexit deadline of April 12. After failing three times to push her withdrawal deal through, Theresa May is now begging EU leaders to extend Britain’s deadline again, to June 30. Amid the uncertainty, at least we’ll have Danny Dyer acting drunk and rambling on TV. At least we’ll have beer and beige meat snacks, grey skies and relentless football chants, even when we’re losing.
At least we’ll have Jimothy.
Jimothy’s first video , Getting Busy! —released on YouTube in 2017—begins with a command to “watch and listen in good volume to hear the dirty bass,” and continues with the same type of well-executed homemade charm that has become Gonzalez’s signature. The camera starts at his feet, in a pair of Adidas Samba sneakers. From this, we can tell that Jimothy is a cool kind of kid—he appreciates the sleek, 69-year-old utilitarian shoe design. He’s an astute man of the people.
Then the camera moves up, shakily, to reveal something a little surprising—Jimothy’s in bright red, straight-cut cords; the kind that a privately educated finance bro might wear at the weekend. You know the type—the more Pimm’s they drink, the more ruddy their face gets, until eventually it exactly matches the color of their trousers.
Into the trousers, Jimothy has tucked a neat, blue-and-white striped cotton button-up shirt. His braids are freshly twisted, his eyes shielded in black cat-eye sunglasses. The camera spins shakily around his face and Jimothy starts skanking, and flexing his index fingers in time to the beat. “What am I gonna do on Monday, Monday?” he asks, his upmarket London voice slurring over plonking synths, using slang from the streets where he grew up: “Boy I'm finna/ Get yes paid.”
Jimothy’s class is difficult to pinpoint—and that is what seems to mystify most of the journalists who write about him. They can’t work out why he shoots his videos on council estates, and bus stops, yet has a distinctly upper-class accent. Why he wears affordable trainers with Burberry gilets worth thousands of dollars. How he was raised in Primrose Hill, one of the fanciest parts of London, but emphasizes in interviews that his mum was a single parent, relying on state benefits.
What they often do not pinpoint is that Gonzalez is playing on established tropes—those of the UK Garage scene. UK Garage, or UKG (not to be confused with garage rock) is a style of music that originated in Britain’s inner cities the early 1990s, along with the spread of pirate radio stations. Taking influences from jungle, house, and R&B, ramped up to a rapid 130bmp, it normally features MCs toasting lyrics over the top in area-specific British slang. Although its popularity faded for much of the 2000s—becoming seen as a sort of cuddly comedy uncle to its more serious successor, grime—the genre has had a mainstream revival in the past few years, with artists like Craig David and The Streets returning to huge acclaim and sold-out shows.
Like many urban music styles, UKG is about aspiration. It’s about wearing the brashest designer clothes you can—think Moschino print pants and matching bomber jackets, Burberry check bucket hats, D&G crop tops, and gold Fendi belts. It’s about drinking Moët and Hennessy, and driving a Bentley—or if you can only afford a Peugeot 206, it’s about pimping that out with a fat subwoofer and blue LEDs. “ Gonzalez is making fun of those who voted for Brexit on the belief that Britain is a fearsome world power, better off alone than as part of the EU. ”
When Jimothy wears a bright yellow jumper with LACOSTE printed on it, a Burberry gilet, or Prada trainers, he’s showing he’s UKG. It doesn’t matter whether he’s got money—he’ll find a way to look flash. “Dressing like a rich guy even though you’ve got no money is fun,” Gonzalez told Loud and Quiet magazine, while being followed around expensive clothes shops by one of its journalists. “No-one in my family has money. But when I was dressed like a rich guy, I just felt amazing. I felt amazing.”
His video Fashion takes the “rich boy” act further, parodying all the cliched excess you’d expect from a standard hip-hop video. Jimothy dances beside a big white Bentley, hands in the air. He wears a fake fur coat and crystal-encrusted sunglasses, and is flanked by two model-slim women, who nod benignly as he boasts that he is, “looking like a million pounds.”
But instead of throwing dollar bills around, Gonzalez makes computer-generated £20 notes rain from the top of the screen in a pixelated blur. Instead of popping champagne in a hot tub, Jimothy is seen stealing a cheap bottle of prosecco from his local Sainsbury’s supermarket. A zebra appears at one point. And again, Jimothy’s dorky cords take a starring role, this time in red, blue and yellow versions, as the rapper shuffles about the set, swinging his arms round and round like the blades of a windmill. If 1980s wonky-pop trio The Human League remade the Blurred Lines video, I’d guess it would look a bit like this.
Garage might not have the budget or credibility of much mainstream U.S. hip-hop, but it has got a sense of humor. Listen to tracks like The Streets’ Don’t Mug Yourself , a witty play on dating that takes place over a plate of scrambled eggs and fried tomato in a greasy spoon cafe; or Oxide and Neutrino’s Bound 4 Da Reload , which samples the theme music from the long-running TV hospital drama Casualty . These are the sounds of everyday British life that are so rarely articulated in mainstream music. When Jimothy takes a trip to the fast food shop Chicken Cottage; when he dances on top of a double decker bus; when he runs away from cops outside Burger King on Holloway Road (as in the video for his track Getting Carjacked ), he’s reflecting our very ordinary lives back at us.
At a time when Britain’s identity feels so in flux, it’s particularly comforting to see such mundane images. Through them we can pretend that Britain is not a nation divided by social class (“everyone” goes to Burger King), and that it will not change after Brexit (red double decker buses will surely survive.)
That’s not to say that his work—or Garage music for that matter—doesn’t translate outside Britain. The success of the BBC comedy series People Just Do Nothing , in which a group of Garage-obsessed mates run a rubbish pirate radio station called Kurupt FM, proves that it can. The show has been picked up by Netflix in the U.S., and Amazon is currently working on an American version that will be set in Las Vegas’ EDM community. Similarly, Jimothy translates, because everybody knows that an English guy rapping over beats he’s probably made on GarageBand is faintly ridiculous—no matter how skillful he is. “ Lovely Jimothy, whose dreams are those of every quiet-living middle class Brit—to settle down with a worthy life partner and shop at the upscale supermarket Waitrose, “nearly every day.” ”
“Clothes is there, you might as well take advantage of it/ It's just fun, bro,” Jimothy tells us in a monologue at the beginning of the video for Fashion. His face is multiplied in the frame, so that one Jimothy is speaking to another, in a manner recalling Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody , or Abba’s Knowing Me, Knowing You , where the band’s faces appear like specters. Gonzalez puts nostalgic touches like this all over his videos. In Getting Busy! he busts old school dances like electric boogaloo and body wave; he throws 1990s-style computer graphics all over the place, making text appear on the screen and then rotating or flipping it, just because he can. Gonzalez clearly knows his pop history—and takes his video making seriously. He just doesn’t seem to take himself that seriously.
In interviews, he’s often asked: is this a joke? Because, it’s difficult to tell whether Jimothy is a character that Gonzalez plays, or an extension of his actual personality. “It pisses me off when people say that,” he told The Guardian in January, emphasizing the work he puts into writing, producing and making videos. “And then someone says it’s just a joke. So that really, really offends me when people say that.”
Even this could be a double bluff. Gonzalez never seems to break character as Jimothy—not in interviews, nor in his YouTube web diaries, where he talks in particularly earnest, Jimothy-esque terms about how much he admires his mum, and how he loves “dressing like a little millionaire.” He told The Guardian : “I’m just there being me, really. In the videos and the live shows, it’s literally like…my most powerful me, coming out.” I’m still not sure if he’s laughing at himself, or at us.
What’s certain, though, is that Jimothy seems like a nice guy. “If I don’t take you out, don’t take it personal,” he sings on Future Bae , “need to sort my life out, then we’ll get personal.” As Jimothy says, he’s not your “typical bro,” the type to slide into a girl’s DMs late at night. No, he’s going to make some dough, then invite you round to “cook and bake.”
Lovely Jimothy, whose dreams are those of every quiet-living middle class Brit—to settle down with a worthy life partner and shop at the upscale supermarket Waitrose, “nearly every day.” That’s why he’s a poster boy for normcore teenagers; he says what many of them probably want to—that spending Friday nights watching Midsomer Murders re-runs with your mum is probably more fun than trying to have a “mad one” out in town with your mates.
“This is mind blowing to me. I can't come to a conclusion on what I think of this﻿,” writes a commenter on the Future Bae video, posted to YouTube. It’s pretty typical of the reactions Jimothy elicits—wonder, fascination, and confusion in equal measure. People see him as an underdog figure, with laughable lyrics and cheap beats; they also see in Gonzalez a meticulous musician with a slick flow, who knows exactly the game he’s playing.
Britain’s vote to leave the EU is one of the biggest decisions the country has made in decades. It will affect the economy, trade deals, migration, and security, but more than that, it will force us to reassess our nation’s identity—how we define ourselves against the rest of the world.
You know what it’s like when you’ve got a tough job to do, though: procrastination takes over. It’s amazing how clean my house gets when I’ve got a work deadline looming. Suddenly, bleaching the loo seems the most appealing thing to do. Rather than think about our future, we would rather hide under the duvet and dream—of a cozy past that probably never existed."

A Killer Canadian Vacation Starts With This Prison Tour,www.thedailybeast.com,Jennifer Bain,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/kingston-pen-a-killer-canadian-vacation-starts-with-this-prison-tour,"LOCK ME UP A Killer Canadian Vacation Starts With This Prison Tour It was Canada’s most famous prison, holding those who committed unspeakable crimes. Dickens was a fan, Hemingway broke news there, and it inspired Atwood. Now it’s open for tours. 04.11.19 2:41 AM ET Courtesy St. Lawrence Parks Commission
It’s a classic Canadian start to a tour of the maximum-security federal prison that once held our most notorious criminals—we politely sing “Happy Birthday” to a stranger. “I don’t know why your family brought you to prison for your birthday,” tour guide Amy Zurrer teases Colleen Smith, “but we’ll make it very special.”
Don’t translate “special” as “lurid.” These tour guides take the privacy act seriously, so can’t legally dish dirt on famous criminals without permission. Yes, the late serial child killer Clifford Olson, the “Beast of British Columbia” did time here, but our guide will only quietly confirm that he was an inmate. We will not speak of serial killer/serial rapist Paul Bernardo, who committed his sickening crimes with his then wife Karla Homolka. We are not to ask about the more recent serial killer Russell Williams, the former colonel of CFB Trenton, Canada’s largest air force base.
Our guide placates us with promises that we will hear about one of the prison’s most colorful cons, but only because we have permission from his family and because he illustrates an important story. “This is a historical tour,” Zurrer stresses. “We will honor the victims and the families and not make a celebration out of a horrible crime.”
Well, then, let’s get started and learn what we can from Canada’s only federal prison tour, and its oldest and most notorious prison, three hours east of Toronto and taking up prime real estate on the shore of Lake Ontario in Kingston.
You know that saying “If these walls could talk?” Well here they do. The visitation room has a freaky juggler and Mickey and Minnie Mouse striking retro rap poses painted on the wall beside a sign declaring this is a children’s play corner where adults are prohibited unless supervising their kids, and where the television must be turned off if no kids are around. There’s an all-caps memo still on the wall from when the prison was active: “Please do not interact with other people’s children without their consent. Thank you.”
There’s that famous Canadian politeness, again.
America has well-oiled prison tours to places like Alcatraz and Yuma. Crumlin Road Gaol in Belfast does multiple daily tours as well as weddings and “jailhouse rock” shows and even has a restaurant called Cuffs Bar & Grill. Canada, by comparison, mainly has an assortment of under-the-radar penal history museums in decommissioned jails and lockups. (Canadians go to federal prisons for serious crimes, and sentences of more than two years, and provincial jails for less serious crimes and shorter sentences.)
This tour, its first major foray into dark tourism, is about to launch its fourth season and is still anything but slick. Tours are run as a partnership of the City of Kingston, Correctional Service of Canada and the St. Lawrence Parks Commission, which delivers earnest tours through student guides and retired corrections staff like Pat Boudreau who says: “It’s an honor to come back and show her off.”
“Her” is “KP,” also known as Kingston Pen. Convicts built her from limestone they quarried and cut, and she opened in 1835, more than three decades before Canada became a country. Author Charles Dickens visited in 1842 and called her “an admirable jail… intelligently and humanely run” in American Notes for General Circulation . A young Ernest Hemingway, working as a reporter for a Toronto newspaper, covered a jailbreak here in 1923.
The prison once housed women and children, not just men, and inspired Canadian author Margaret Atwood to write Alias Grace . It was declared a National Historic Site in 1990 but was closed by the government in 2013 because of aging infrastructure, and her final 441 inmates were shipped elsewhere. KP was decommissioned to save the government money, stripped of anything that could be reused in another institution (excluding an X-ray machine that can’t legally be resold), and then left as is.
This means you will see original graffiti—everything from “Fuck all” and “Mueler is a bird. Scams his own freind (sic). Don’t trust him,” to a haiku of sorts: “Hell’s going with you. Write it on your back. All this will fade to black.”
In a cell block once known as G-Range, retired guard Vern Thibedeau talks about how inmates here “were the bottom of the totem pole” — pedophiles, child killers, informants and even ex-policemen who couldn’t survive in other prisons.
“The writing on the walls and in the cells, anything on the walls, that’s all by inmates. We didn’t run around adding anything since 2013. Well, we did cover up a few things that were overly graphic.”
If an inmate left personal stuff behind, like a sexy poster of actress Parker Posey, a clock radio, Star Wars books and a puzzle in progress, you can view it through the bars. Okay, probably, they compiled a bunch of stuff that was left behind and recreated one cell.
Thibedeau urges me to spend a few moments in an empty cell—which should give me the chills and is definitely sobering, but also makes me feel fairly foolish—and sends me off with the business card that details his memoir called The Door: My Twenty Six-Years Working Inside Canada’s Prison . It was not condoned by his bosses and detailed things like being taken hostage and suffering from extreme stress. It ruffled a few feathers so is not for sale in the tour gift shop, but you can buy it online.
What Thibedeau and the other retirees want people to know is that Canadian prisons aren’t like in the books or movies—with the possible exception of the room where visitors could talk to cons on phones, safely separated by glass.
Federal inmates eat in their cells, not dining halls, and smoking was banned years ago. Inmates here wore jeans and blue golf shirts (without names or numbers), not orange jumpsuits. Family visitation units with small yards—funded by inmates, not taxpayers—allowed some cons to host relatives for 72 hours. An indigenous sweat lodge did allow inmates to use tobacco for sacred rituals. Cells got bigger over the years.
Zurrer tells tales of riots, hostage takings, killings and the occasional escape. Soldiers were called in to quell a 1954 riot. During a four-day riot in 1971, six correctional officers taken hostage and two inmates killed by other inmates. Escapes weren’t common but the late bank robber Ty Conn duped guards in 1999 with a dummy in his bed and is to thank for the rule that inmates must stand up and be counted. He got over the prison fence and escaped for two weeks until he accidentally shot himself in a standoff with police in Toronto.
We hear about free high school courses and flip through an old Business Mathematics in Canada textbook. We tour workshops where cons once learned upholstery, carpentry, furniture making, welding and plumbing and made things that could only be sold to government agencies and not-for-profits—like mail bags for Canada Post.
The biggest revelation: Cons made my high-school lockers.
The biggest success story: One retired guard still gets his hair cut by a former inmate who learned to be a barber here and went on to raise a family and stay out of trouble.
If this is too tame for you, duck across the road to Canada’s Penitentiary Museum, housed in the first official warden’s residence for Kingston Pen and built by inmate labor in 1873. Its contraband room shows off a pile of shanks, makeshift guns, home-brew gear and a hollowed stack of food trays that one clever inmate hid in to escape.
Canada abolished corporal punishment in 1972, but the museum declares: “Only by analyzing where we have been can we intelligently consider what we should do with the future.” Its corporal punishment room has straps and a strapping bench, a rack-like whipping post known as “the Triangle,” a straightjacket and a coffin-shaped box used at Kingston Pen more than 800 times between 1847 and 1849 for anywhere from 15 minutes to nine hours at a time.
Looking around the museum makes me think of Justin Piché, the associate professor of criminology at the University of Ottawa, who has spoken out about this tour and about penal tourism in general. He wants people to think critically about the commodification of punishment. He wishes captives—not just captors—could be humanized on tours and maybe even some who’ve done their time could be hired to be part of tours. He wants prison tours like this one to at least touch on the limits of, and problems with, incarceration. My tour does show how cells have gotten larger, and how corporal punishment rules softened over the years, but as a historical tour it doesn’t delve into controversial issues like prison labor, solitary confinement and the way that black and indigenous Canadians are over-represented behind bars.
Unlike similar tours around the world, Kingston’s prison tours only run from late spring to late summer, partly as the buildings aren’t heated in winter. “It’s not for everyone, certainly,” says my student guide. Tours attracted 59,000 people in 2016 and 105,000 in 2017 before scaling back in 2018 to find a “sweet spot” around 68,000. Tickets are now on sale for this season , which runs May 8 to Sept. 1.
“Like all great tours, you are going to be exiting through the gift shop,” Zurrer tells us as a farewell, hastening to add that sales help support the United Way and homeless youth initiatives. The shelves are pretty bare during my end-of-season tour and there are just a few tastefully branded souvenirs, so you’re better off dashing across the street to the penitentiary museum’s more extensive shop if it’s novelty handcuffs and handcuff-themed jewelry that you’re after.
As for our birthday girl, Smith lives near another federal prison and has a relative who trained drug-sniffing dogs that once worked at Kingston Pen, so she comes by her fascination with incarceration honestly. She tells me she definitely wants the historic limestone prison that once housed Canada’s worst criminals to keep running tours here on this coveted lakefront spot: “I would hate to see it become condos.” READ THIS LIST"
How Many White Dudes Does It Take to Run for President?,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick) Sam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com (Sam Brodey),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/beto-orourke-to-bernie-sanders-how-many-white-dudes-does-it-take-to-run-for-president,"How Many White Dudes Does It Take to Run for President? The answer: All of them. 04.11.19 2:06 AM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Getty
The Democratic Party’s field of presidential contenders might be the largest and most diverse in history, but that new phenomenon hasn’t foreclosed a much older one: white men asking, why shouldn’t I be president, too?
The result has been a heavily white, decidedly XY chromosomal surge among those entering or thinking of entering the 2020 primary. Aftera series of high-profile women and people of color jumped into the contest, almost half a dozen Democrats, all of them white men, have either announced bids of their own or begun inching toward making a run.
Former Vice President Joe Biden , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) have all visited key early states and are probably on the brink of kicking off their campaigns. The two newest candidates in the race, meanwhile, are white men with modest records in Congress: Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) and Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH).
These bids have renewed sensitive questions from both observers and rival campaigns about pre-existing power structures and how voters, the media and even Democrats themselves judge issues of electability in the age of the self-identified über white male: Donald Trump. Mostly, however, it has left people wondering what it will possibly take to break up the patriarchy that is presidential politics.
“We have 250 plus years of history in this country of white guys looking in their mirrors and seeing a future president,” Stephanie Cutter, former deputy campaign manager for President Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign, told The Daily Beast. “We are starting to see a generational shift with more diverse people building the right experience and national support to be president. But, as you can see by the recent coverage of this race, we still have a lot of work to do.”
With roughly 300 days to go before the primary voting begins, no one is quite certain how Democratic voters will value ideological purity or experience when making their decisions. Less clear is the degree to which diversity itself will come to define the party. In addition to the wave of new entrants into the primary, public opinion polls currently place two septuagenarian white former presidential candidates—former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)—in the lead.
Even the news coverage of the race has drawn criticism for the way it has prioritized and described the men in the race (as this piece may well too, being written, as it is, by two white male journalists). A recent analysis by Northeastern University’s School of Journalism found that the percentage of positive words being used to describe female candidates was lower than for male candidates. Others have also found that a number of male candidates have completely dominated recent news cycles.
It is, at times, a more complicated image than critics suggest, since a large share of recent coverage of Biden was centered around testimonials of women feeling uncomfortable in his presence. But it’s been enough to lead some Democrats to wonder whether the lessons of 2018—in which a historic number of women candidates won federal office—have been forgotten in a matter of months.
“With the record wins for women and minority candidates, Democrats in 2018 showed they were pretty sick of having white guys in Congress, so I’m not sure what makes these dudes think the White House will be different,” an aide working for a current Democratic campaign told The Daily Beast. “They’re much more the Rick Santorum model than Barack Obama: run for president to get famous, become known, and stop getting buried in obscurity as a House backbencher. They understand our media environment won’t really punish them for giving it a go, but they will not be the Democratic nominee, and if they were being honest they’d tell you they know that, too.”
For those white men actually running, questions of race and gender have proven tricky. Swalwell, a fourth-term congressman from the Bay Area and a familiar presence on cable news, defended his right to jump into the race as he hopped in a car to address a union event on Wednesday. “I don’t think anyone’s identity should keep them from running,” he said. “But I think you better see all the other identities out there.""
O’Rourke, meanwhile, has spoken candidly about the privilege afforded to him because of his race and gender. But the fact that he was immediately heralded as a potential 2020 contender even while former Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum and former Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams were left out of the 2020 conversation, has stirred immense frustration among others in the party.
“I think it’s frankly a travesty that folks have rushed to elevate Beto O’Rourke,” Symone Sanders, who served as national press secretary for Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) campaign in 2016, told The Daily Beast. “I wanted Beto to beat Ted Cruz just like every other good Democrat, but I don’t think that there was anything inherently special about him that made him better or different than Stacey Abrams or Andrew Gillum.”
Sanders, who is not working for any campaign currently, was not dismissive of any candidates jumping into the race who believed that they had something to offer voters. She just stressed that they needed to be aware of the challenges for minorities in the field.
“When it comes to the highest level of politics, whether we want to believe it or not, there’s still an asterisk by people of color,” she said. “There’s still an asterisk by women. There’s still an asterisk by people in the LGBTQ community.”
In an attempt to thwart criticism that they’re not bringing anything new to the field beyond the stature of the office they hold, some white male hopefuls have already begun to outline specific themes for their candidacies.
Bennet, who recently received a prostate cancer diagnosis, has signalled a run based on bipartisan efforts to fix the health care system. Swalwell is planning to put gun control at the center of his bid and hopes to leverage his age—he’s 38—to brand himself, in his words, as a “generational” candidate.
Moulton, a three-term congressman best known in Washington for his failed attempts to oust Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic leader, wants to be the national security candidate. “I’m the only person running or considering running who’s even talking about national security,” said Moulton, who is a decorated Iraq War veteran. And Ryan, who represents a blue-collar district in northeast Ohio and is also best known for trying to unseat Pelosi, is explicitly casting himself as the Democrats’ best candidate to win back working-class white voters who fled to Trump.
These Democratic longshots don’t believe their identities pose a serious obstacle to getting traction in this historically diverse field. “I don’t think that identity politics should keep anybody in or out of the race,” said Moulton. “It’s all about how you can best serve the country.”
And, for the most part, their Democratic colleagues believe they’re right to be imbued with a sense of confidence in their mission. After all, the American presidency is fundamentally a story of white men realizing their dreams of grandeur. As one Democratic lawmaker of color put it: “I mean, look at Trump.”

"The Whole Grain King: Bob Moore, the 90-Year-Old CEO of Bob's Red Mill",www.thedailybeast.com,,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bobs-red-mill-ceo-bob-moore-is-the-90-year-old-whole-grain-king,"The Whole Grain King: Bob Moore, the 90-Year-Old President of Bob’s Red Mill Courtesy Bob’s Red Mill We sat down with the co-founder of the ubiquitous line of healthy grains to discuss how his products went from hippie staple to supermarket bestseller. Anna Archibald 04.11.19 3:25 AM ET
A t some point in the 1950s, Charlee Moore decided it was time to heed her grandmother’s advice and start eating healthier. Her grandmother—like many grandmothers before and after her—had been sending Charlee and her husband Bob books on the importance of incorporating whole grains into their diets.
Charlee started by baking loaves of bread with whole grains she managed to track down in a local health food store, which, at the time, were few and far between. The bread was a hit with her two sons and with Bob, and the family soon began incorporating more natural foods into their diet.
Inspired by Charlee’s mission to get the family eating healthier, Bob began to read everything about natural foods and grain mills he could get his hands on. A couple of decades after baking that first healthy loaf, the couple embarked on a new business venture selling whole grains.
While you probably don’t know the Moores by their full names, you’d no doubt recognize Bob if you saw him in person. He’s the smiling, frosty haired gentleman adorning each package of Bob’s Red Mill products, from flour to pancake mix to cups of microwavable oatmeal. There’s now a selection of 400 different products under the Bob’s Red Mill label, some of which have become ubiquitous in grocery stores. You’re now as likely to find a bag of the brand’s whole wheat flour in the most bohemian of health food stores as you are in Walmarts across the country.
Though Bob is the name and face of the company, he credits Charlee, who died last year, with setting them on the path to founding Bob’s Red Mill in 1978—a time when white bread and frozen TV dinners were still the norm. Though whole grains, healthy eating, and wellness are now trendy, Moore’s hope is that what he and Charlee built is inspiring others to eat healthier and enjoy doing it.
“I think there’s always going to be people that are willing to feed themselves and people who like to be creative with cooking and baking,” says Moore. “I don’t think we’re ever going to lose people who go to the store to buy raw foods and use their creative juices to make things. Gosh, I think that’s one of the things that makes the world go ’round.”
Despite the challenges Moore has faced in the last year since his wife’s passing, the work ethic that helped him build and grow the company, and earn him the crown of whole grain king persists. He can still regularly be found in his office at the company’s Milwaukie, Oregon, headquarters or traveling to trade shows.
In February, the company threw Moore a birthday bash as they do every year, but this one was particularly notable, marking his milestone 90th birthday. (He was “backed up by a brass band doing Dixieland—my favorite!”)
Here are a few things you should know about the de facto grandfather of healthy eating and how keeps his body and mind in fighting shape. He Used to Be a Smoker and Ran an Automotive Shop
Before Moore opened a grain mill, his life was different. For many years, he lived in California and ran an auto shop. His diet was also quite different: Whole grains were scarce and he was a regular smoker. When he was in his early thirties, he decided it was time for a change.
“Somewhere in there I was pretty troubled with myself and began to think in terms of eating better,” he says. He started reading the books recommended by his wife’s grandmother, including The Health Builder , an encyclopedia of health by J.J. Rodale, and Let’s Get Well and other titles by Adelle Davis. “Her grandmother sent her a copy of [Rodale’s book] with comments about how important this whole grain stuff is—these books were ahead of their time.”
That’s when Charlee starting baking and changed the family’s diet for good: “I think her secret motive in all of this was to get me off of those cigarettes, and it was successful,” he says.
The most formative book for Moore, however, was John Goffe’s Mill by George Woodbury , a title he still keeps in his office more than 50 years later.
“I read the book and was thrilled by it,” says Moore. “He had so much fun getting this [traditional] mill going. When he got these millstones going making these real, healthy, whole grain products, he said the public beat a path to his doorway. I thought what a wonderful way to make a living, making healthy foods that have personality.” He Now Starts Every Day at 6 a.m. With a Hearty Breakfast
Moore is still as committed to his eating habits as ever. Every day—even on the weekends, he’s sure to point out—he wakes up at 6 a.m. and usually eats his favorite breakfast: a hearty bowl of steel cut oats with bananas, natural brown sugar, flaxseed meal, walnuts and skim milk.
In the last year, he’s added three days of physical therapy exercise to his weekly routine, so he’s also added a little more protein to his breakfast. “I get up and that’s when I have my peanut butter on Dave’s Killer Bread, then I go in and exercise for an hour,” he says. “I did 22 pushups the other day! They’re hard as hell to do.”
After his workout, he’ll also enjoy one of his brand’s new oat cups, which he admits took him a little time to warm up to: “They’re quite tasty—I’ve gotten used to them,” he says. “I didn’t like ’em at first—too modern and convenient.”
But even Moore has his “cheat days” when he’ll go for eggs and grits over his usual oats or toast. Whatever it is he’s eating, however, it needs to “get the job done.” His Reputation Precedes Him—for Good Reason
Over the years, Moore has amassed a reputation as a do-gooder through his philanthropic work and by the way he supports the employees of Bob’s Red Mill. In fact, he turned over the ownership of the company to his employees in 2010.
He even stepped in when his local senior center lost its state funding in the fallout of the 2008 recession and took complete financial responsibility for it. He’s been working on the Milwaukie Center March for Meals for even longer. It’s a fundraising event for Meals on Wheels America, which first took place in 2004 at the Bob’s Red Mill bakery and store and continues today.
“That’s probably one of the things you’ve heard about Bob is that he’s benevolent—I don’t want to quit that for anything,” says Moore. “To do unto others as you would have them do unto you is one of the most profound instructions that’s humanly possible to give to one another—and it’s common sense if you think about it.”
Moore is also committed to mentorship. When asked for career advice, he’s a straight shooter: There is no substitute for thoroughly planning and outlining projects and he has no patience for anyone looking for shortcuts.
“I’m a great planner and if people don’t plan they’re going to run a higher risk of failure,” he says, adding, “I think it’s very important to find something that you love to do and something that you can make a living at. Honestly that’s how this thing developed. I would call that a success.” His Hobbies Are Many and Varied
While in many ways what you see on the packaging for Bob’s Red Mill is what you get out of its founder and spokesman—a beacon of wholesomeness and nostalgia—he’s still got a few surprises up his sleeve. For one, he loves to play jazz piano and has multiple Steinway grand pianos throughout the company’s production facility and restaurant. He and his long-time executive assistant Nancy Garner often play vintage jazz duets together. Their favorite pieces are from the 1920s and ’30s.
His interest in music doesn’t end with jazz, nor is the piano the only instrument he plays: “I’m very oriented to classical—I play classical violin,” says Moore. “I have a lovely violin that’s a lot better violin than my ability to play it is.”
When he’s not working or playing music, you can probably find him reading. Books are a huge part of Moore’s life, and have taken up their fair share of real estate in his home and office.
“Here’s my reading rule: I read non-fiction, no novels,” he says. “If it happened, I like to read about it. I don’t care whether it’s history, biography, autobiography. It’s so amazing to me how interesting everything can be if you get into it.”
He’s usually reading more than one book at any given time. His current roster of titles, include George & Barbara Bush: A Great American Love Story , The Parthenon Enigma , and Leadership In Turbulent Times .
“These are some of the focused interests in my life that make time go faster and my life more interesting,” says Moore, adding that Bob’s Red Mill has a new book coming out this September. Details are still scarce, but they’re currently working on finalizing a title. He Travels in Style
The model airplanes hanging in Moore’s office are only one of the many indications that Moore has a soft spot for vintage transportation. Whether he’s flying down the road in one of his two 1931 Model As—he’s got a roadster and a coupe—or gliding through the air in a restored Douglas DC-3, you can bet he’s enjoying himself.
“In 2017, I had a chance to take a rather long two-week flight in a beautifully restored, 80-year-old DC-3,” says Moore, adding that the DC-3, which has a design much like today’s commercial aircraft, was first released in the 1930s and revolutionized commercial air travel.
This particular flight was commissioned by the Breitling watch company as publicity for a run of limited-edition watches. It made its way around the globe, and Moore hopped on for the last few legs of the trip, traveling from New Jersey to Goose Bay to Greenland to Iceland and, finally, to Scotland.
“They let me put one of my decals over the door,” says Moore, who keeps a scrapbook of the journey. “When you see a picture of me with the DC-3 it has a Bob’s Red Mill logo across the door. I remember it as one of the top experiences of my lifetime.”"
Trump Nominates Clowns Herman Cain and Stephen Moore to Bring the Fed to Heel,www.thedailybeast.com,Margaret Carlson,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-nominates-clowns-herman-cain-and-stephen-moore-to-bring-the-fed-to-heel,"A FEATURE, NOT A BUG Trump Nominates Clowns Herman Cain and Stephen Moore to Bring the Fed to Heel The president with a gift for undercutting his own institutions is laying the groundwork to strip the most important central bank in the world of its political independence. opinion Bloomberg/Getty
“When you think it can’t get any worse, it does,” servile Senate Republicans keep whimpering.
The sentiment came up when Trump announced his latest choice for an open Federal Reserve Board seat—former presidential candidate and Trump super PAC head Herman Cain.
Until then, Trump’s previous selection for another open seat, Stephen Moore , think tank executive, pundit, and author of Trumponomics , a homage to the president whom he also recommended for the Nobel Prize in Economics, held the record for least credentialed person up for a seat on the Fed board.
Together, these two amateurs are a critical part of Trump’s re-election strategy, which is not just to build a wall, close the border, and deter asylum-seekers by making orphans of their babies. It’s also to keep those lured by tax cuts and an (Obama) economy to stay the course. Should the economy slow, Trump won’t just need someone to blame. He’ll need someone to juice it.
Right now that means laying the groundwork to undercut the independence of the most important central bank in the world. Thus the campaign for Cain and Moore—an heir, and a spare, ready to become chair should anything happen to the current one.
Cain made his name turning around Godfather Pizza with two large pies, extra toppings, for $20. As head of the restaurant trade association, he lobbied against raising the minimum wage, health care, non-smoking regs, and stricter blood-alcohol limits for drivers. His wildcat presidential campaign presaged Trump’s, as the pizza man shot to the top of the polls in the 2012 Republican field by offering catchy but meaningless phrases, like his 9-9-9 tax plan, and singing Uzbeki-beki-beki-stan to cover up not knowing where it was.
It ended when five women charged him with sexual misconduct, one on the record about a 13-year affair, and the other about the job interview from hell during which he pushed her head south. That, and the grifter promoting penny stocks and erectile dysfunction drugs that might repel another president simply endeared him to Trump.
The White House unveiled its weak defense of Cain last Sunday: that not all sexual allegations “pan out” and that he’d served on the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank. In a way, he did—but not in a banking capacity. He was a Class C director chosen from the community in a position specifically reserved for non-bankers. He wasn’t there for his insights into open-market monetary policy.
Should Cain be confirmed, even as Republican whimpers about him get louder, his job along with Moore would be laying the groundwork to undercut the independence of the apolitical Fed. That’s a task Trump himself is well qualified for, as an amoral small-time businessman with an appetite for permanently wounding treasured institutions from NATO to the FBI, one tweet at a time.
Yesterday, with every breath he takes, Trump’s carefully chosen Attorney General William Barr showed how much independence he gave up to win his appointment. By jumping out ahead of the actual Mueller report or even its summary, Barr’s short letter secured public opinion that Trump was exonerated when he wasn’t. On Wednesday, he caved in to another item on Trump’s bucket list and confirmed that he’s initiated an investigation into whether the deep state at Justice spied on the president’s campaign as part of what the president himself has already prejudged as an “attempted coup.”
Now, it’s the Fed’s time in the barrel. Trump’s soured on its too-independent chairman Jay Powell, whom the president elevated after he found former chair Janet Yellen too short (and too female and too independent) for the job. Powell, who served in the first Bush administration, didn’t jump fast enough when Trump began blaming the Fed's interest-rate policy for drops in the stock market, Trump’s applause meter for how the economy is doing. After Powell said rates would remain steady, Trump rewarded him with a Comey-like dinner at the White House. Immediately after, the Fed assured the public that the chairman “did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy.”
That’s all it took for Trump to resume trashing him, and to nominate the two stooges. Trump has asked his lawyers how he could fire Powell, according to Bloomberg . To avoid being yelled at, as former White House counsel Don McGahn was when giving unwelcome legal advice, his lawyers only cited the inevitable court challenge that would follow any dismissal for “cause”—a standard not defined since no prior president has ever tried to remove a Fed chair.
But Trump doesn’t have to worry about being tangled up in a district court he hasn’t yet packed. He has his own insidious way of ridding himself of people without firing them. Aides who are insufficiently servile get public floggings, endure temper tantrums at meetings, and suffer snide, schoolyard insults (former AG Jeff Sessions is an idiot, Secretary Wilbur Ross nods off and drools; the head of Secret Service has Dumbo ears). The resignations flow like wine at Mar a Lago parties attended by a Chinese massage parlor owner.
It worked this week. Kirstjen Nielsen, the recently departed Secretary of Homeland Security head Kirsten did everything to keep her job but snatch babies from mothers at the border herself, yet she couldn’t stop Trump’s public ridicule and early-morning hate calls. She and a raft of other DHS officials “resigned” this week so Trump could install more pliable “acting” replacements. Stacking his cabinet with “actings” is another innovation Trump brags about, since it gives him near absolute control. Watch acting chief of staff Mick Mulaney capitulate to all of Trump’s whims as he auditions to be appointed permanently.
Which is why there will be no need for Trump to fire the Fed chair who the president compared to “a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch, he can’t putt!"" You’d think he’d avoid golf metaphors after a popular new book by former Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly, Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump , shows Trump colluding with caddies to move his balls out of difficult lies onto the green, where he can take a gimme.
As interest rates rose so did the jabs. At some point, Powell will ask himself, as decorated warriors H.R. McMaster, John Kelly, and John Mattis each did before fleeing the madness, “Who needs this?” Trump’s accused the bank of of “going loco” after a half-point rate hike, of being his “biggest threat, and how he “maybe regrets” hiring Powell whom he thought would be a “cheap money” chair. Moore sealed his nomination when he said in an interview that he and Trump were “furious” at Powell over the December rate increase and wanted to fire him for “wrecking our economy.”
It won’t be surprising if Powell is taken by a sudden urge to spend more time with his family and accept one of many high positions that await him in the private sector. The president can then exercise his authority to pick the chairman from the seven members already confirmed and currently serving, two of whom, if he gets his way, will be Cain and Moore.
Trump may well have chosen Cain to make Moore look like Paul Volker, albeit one who shares Cain’s ignorance of monetary policy. Their appointments would be like putting swimmers still in floaties on a 100-meter relay team. That’s not to mention Moore’s checkered personal past, including a tax lien for $75,000 against him for brazenly deducting non-deductible child-support payments, $330,000 of which he hadn’t actually paid to his first wife, who accused Moore of subjecting her to “emotional and psychological abuse,” according to The Guardian , which saw the divorce records. Moore’s P.R. person says the two are “cordial” now. To Trump, character deficits like these are features, not flaws.
Trump knows that close to the election, senators will be more reluctant than ever to deny Trump what he wants. Even if they reach deep inside their weak spines to find the wherewithal to deny one of them a seat, they won’t be able to vote down two.
And so that’s how Trump brings the mighty Fed to heel, as he’s done to so many other hitherto solid institutions. When you think it can’t get any worse, it does. READ THIS LIST"

Trump’s Transgender Ban Brings Chaos and ‘a Lot of Fear’ to Troops’ Families,www.thedailybeast.com,samantha.allen@thedailybeast.com (Samantha Allen),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-transgender-ban-brings-chaos-and-a-lot-of-fear-to-troops-families,"Trump’s Transgender Ban Brings Chaos and ‘a Lot of Fear’ to Troops’ Families Parker Radbourne The hidden impact of President Trump’s transgender troop ban has been on the troops’ loved ones, whose lives, they tell The Daily Beast, have also suddenly been thrown into chaos. 04.11.19 2:55 AM ET
P eg Fram was driving when she learned the president wanted to fire her spouse.
Back in July 2017, Trump tweeted that “transgender individuals” would no longer be allowed “to serve in any capacity in the U.S. military.” Those “individuals” included Bryan Bree Fram , an Air Force lieutenant colonel and non-binary transgender person who serves as the communications director for the advocacy group SPART*A . Bree called Peg as the latter was driving from Minnesota to D.C. to deliver the news.
“I pulled over and I have to say, I hyperventilated a little bit,” Peg Fram told The Daily Beast.
A million questions ran through Peg’s mind as she talked to Bree on the phone: “What does this mean? Does this mean you don’t have a job anymore? Does this mean we’re just done?”
The couple was 14 years deep into military life by that point. They were raising two little girls, who are now aged 10 and six. The family was also single-income: Although Peg has a degree in forensic science, she had stopped working years ago, in part because crime labs were reluctant to hire someone as transient as a military spouse—and because a second job would only go toward child care expenses anyway.
In that panicked roadside moment, Peg realized she might have to go back to school in order to re-enter her career field.
“The comfortable life that I had come to know and we had gotten used to—it felt like it was being ripped out from under me, and I literally had no idea what my first step was going to have to be,” she told The Daily Beast.
Peg Fram is not alone. The Trump administration’s transgender troop ban , set to go into effect on April 12, has affected not just “individuals,” but entire families, too.
Advocates for transgender service members refer to this as the “hidden impact” of the troop ban, because media coverage tends to focus on the service members themselves rather than the policy’s broader impact on spouses, partners, and children.
“It’s this ripple effect that I don’t think people fully comprehend,” said Fram.
Several partners and spouses of transgender service members told The Daily Beast that the last two years of court cases , injunctions , and Supreme Court drama have been an emotional rollercoaster. They have watched the Trump administration transform the ban from a series of tweets into an actual policy that will go into effect in mere days.
“The thing that has been the most stressful about this is just the constant up and down of it,” said Emily Starbuck Gerson, whose partner Jamie Hash came out in the Air Force shortly after the Obama administration lifted the original ban on transgender military service in 2016.
Like Peg Fram, Gerson remembers well the day of the infamous tweets, when she and Hash met at home to console each other: “There was a lot of sadness and a lot of questions about what this means for her future and for our future.” “ Every time there’s been a development, it sort of throws everything into chaos. We scramble to figure out what it means, we get bombarded with messages [from friends]—all on top of the emotional side of, ‘Is this going to actually affect us?’ ”
Since then, the couple—currently based in San Antonio—has been riding the ups and downs of the various developments in the transgender troop ban story, culminating in the Supreme Court’s January 2019 decision to allow the ban to go into effect.
Gerson described a cycle that took place every time there was a new court decision or policy revision: “Every time there’s been a development, it sort of throws everything into chaos. We scramble to figure out what it means, we get bombarded with messages [from friends]—all on top of the emotional side of, ‘Is this going to actually affect us?’”
Gerson, like many partners of transgender service members, has found herself providing a lot of emotional support within her relationship—and then realizing that she needs to heal, too. When the January Supreme Court decision came out, for example, she and Hash had to turn a Washington, D.C. work trip into a challenging occasion.
“I spent a couple of days trying really hard to prop her up emotionally and help her get through it,” said Gerson. “But then after a couple days, I noticed it hit me, and I started feeling really down and sad. That does happen sometimes where I feel like I need to be strong for her, but then it catches up with me and I need a couple of days to mope.”
Gerson, who works as a writer, has been coping in part by blogging about LGBT rights . Her partner—like Peg Fram’s—has been grandfathered into the military under a clause in the forthcoming ban that allows any transgender service member who received a diagnosis before April 12 to avoid discharge .
Even then, the policy puts added stress on the couple: For one, Gerson and Hash wonder whether or not the latter will be able to become an officer. (According to the Palm Center, which studies LGBT issues in the military, the policy does allow transgender service members who have been grandfathered in to seek officer commissions, but there has been confusion on that point.)
Through it all, Gerson said, Hash has been “an angel sent from heaven,” staying calm and re-enlisting last year, determined to serve in the Air Force as long as she can.
“I think sometimes it gets to me more than her,” Gerson admitted.
For other partners of transgender service members, it has been even more harrowing to deal with the potential loss of income and the uncertainty around opportunities for advancement.
Nirvana Lee, whose transgender wife is an staff sergeant in the Air Force, is disabled, which means she relies on the military for both income and medical care through the government’s TriCare insurance program. “ Considering that I can’t get my own insurance if we were to be out of the military, that kind of tricked down and scares me to death. ”
Living in South Dakota, the couple feels like they have “no support,” as Lee told The Daily Beast. ( SPART*A has been a lifeline for families in such situations who feel as though they lack an in-person support system.)
Lee’s wife was in Korea for 15 months while the transgender troop ban was litigated, “so you can imagine how hard that was and how terrifying that was for me,” she said.
“If she was unable to be in the military, we would be in a lot of trouble medically—because that’s mainly what TriCare does for us,” said Lee. “Considering that I can’t get my own insurance if we were to be out of the military, that kind of trickled down and scares me to death.”
Lee’s wife has been grandfathered into the military, having received a gender dysphoria diagnosis in May 2018. But the past two years have, understandably, left Lee feeling scared that even those who have been grandfathered in will not be safe.
“You never know what the future holds with that kind of stuff,” said Lee.
Jordyn Elliot also relies heavily on TriCare, which she receives through her transgender wife, who serves in the Air Force. Elliot suffer from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which means her joints can be easily dislocated from even a sneeze or a tight hug.
The uncertainty around her wife’s career prospects has been terrifying.
“We were relying on her becoming an officer so that when it gets to a point where I’m too ill too work, we can survive financially,” Elliot told The Daily Beast. “It’s not a matter of if , but when for us. It’s a lot of stress on her financially.” “ I feel like it’s a ripple effect of hate outward. It’s not just my spouse being ridiculed for being transgender, which is enough, but it’s also my child and myself. ”
But through it all, the couple—currently based in San Antonio—has actually gotten closer. Relying on each other, said Elliott, has “taught me a lot more communication [and] a lot of resilience.” Still, there’s no denying the stress that the ban has put on the couple—and their eight-year-old son, who she says now gets bullied at school “for having two moms, and [because] one of the moms was once a boy.”
“I feel like it’s a ripple effect of hate outward,” said Elliot. “It’s not just my spouse being ridiculed for being transgender, which is enough, but it’s also my child and myself.”
Many children of transgender service members, like Elliot’s little boy, are too young to understand what’s happening, let alone decipher a byzantine military policy .
But one 15-year-old son of a transgender service member, who spoke to The Daily Beast with his mother on condition of anonymity, was able to vocalize the stress of watching a parent endure the last two years. Even now, the service member’s career is threatened.
“It’s been stressful,” he said. “It’s been a lot of fear, just wondering whether my parent will be able to go to work, wondering whether there will be any changes in the household. A lot of wondering [and] speculation.”
When both son and mother saw the Trump tweets in 2017, the pain was immediate.
“I remember seeing [them] and just crying,” the mother said.
“It was a mix of confusion and sorrow and wishing that things would change,” the son added.
More often, though, children of transgender service members are too young to say how they feel—even if it’s clear they are aware of the stress their parents are going through.
That’s the case for Peg Fram’s little girls. After over a decade of keeping Bree’s identity a secret from everyone—including her own family—to avoid outing Bree, Peg has found comfort inside her nuclear family, where both girls have known for years. “ They’re feeling the stress and anxiety that we’re feeling as their parents, and they don’t understand what to do about it. ”
Peg has continued taking care of her family full-time, even though she still has has occasional “mini-panics” about what life would look like if she had to go back to work.
“They’ve taken everything in stride,” said Fram, of her daughters.
Both girls are too young, Fram added, to “understand prejudice and hate like that,” and yet “they’re feeling the stress and anxiety that we’re feeling as their parents, and they don’t understand what to do about it.”
But that doesn’t stop their youngest, now six, from tying to comfort her hurting parents.
“I swear every five minutes, she comes up and hugs us,” said Fram, noting that the behavior has become more common in the last two months as the ban approaches.

LONDON—The U.S. has charged Julian Assange with illegally helping Chelsea Manning crack a computer password to steal classified documents, the Justice Department said Thursday.
Assange was dramatically dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London by British police early Thursday , where cops arrested him on one relatively minor charge of skipping bail in 2012 over rape charges in Sweden, and then later arrested him for a second time on an extradition warrant on behalf of U.S. authorities. Assange was found guilty of the bail charge.
The Justice Department revealed that Assange the arrest was over a federal charge of “conspiracy to commit computer intrusion” and relates to the Wikileaks founder's alleged role in what it calls “one of the largest compromises of classified information” in U.S. history.
“The indictment alleges that in March 2010, Assange engaged in a conspiracy with Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst in the U.S. Army, to assist Manning in cracking a password stored on U.S. Department of Defense computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network,” the Justice Department said in a statement.
Manning has been in jail since March 3, when a federal judge found her in contempt for refusing to testify in front of the Alexandria, Virginia, grand jury investigating WikiLeaks. The grand jury has been probing the secret-spilling website since 2010 it started publishing hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables Manning leaked to Assange.
The Justice Department alleges that Assange helped Manning try to access computers under a username that didn't belong to her. The statement goes on to say that, once Manning gained access to the system, Assange repeatedly encouraged her to share more and more information.
“During an exchange, Manning told Assange that ‘after this upload, that’s all I really have got left,’” the Justice Department claimed. “To which Assange replied, ‘curious eyes never run dry in my experience.’”
Any extradition may take some time. The British government released its own statement on Assange earlier in the day in which it made clear anyone who's being extradited will be given the opportunity to appeal to the government, then to the country's High Court.
It also said that British judges have the power to decide whether or not extradition would breach an individual’s human rights, or whether their health makes it “unjust or oppressive” to extradite them.
Assange arrived at a court in London Thursday afternoon, three hours after he was hauled out of the place he called home for nearly seven years. He was found guilty on the relatively minor bail charge—for which he could serve twelve months in prison—and was told he would face a hearing on the extradition warrant in just four weeks.

Elizabeth Warren’s Trillion-Dollar Big Business Tax Plan Would Cost Amazon $698M+ Every Year,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/elizabeth-warrens-new-corporate-tax-plan-would-cost-amazon-dollar698-million,"FORK IT OVER Elizabeth Warren’s Trillion-Dollar Big Business Tax Plan Would Cost Amazon $698M+ Every Year The Massachusetts Democrat is introducing a new tax that would apply to the largest companies in the United States. 04.11.19 9:07 AM ET Yuri Gripas
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who has defined her 2020 candidacy with a series of detailed policy proposals, has a plan to impose a new tax on America’s largest companies like Amazon.
“It’s almost Tax Day, and chances are you’ll be paying federal taxes this year. Maybe it’s a lot, maybe it’s a little,” Warren writes in a Medium post unveiling the policy. “Well, guess what? You will be paying more for running the federal government than a bunch of big American corporations that made billions of dollars in profits in the last year.”
The “Real Corporate Profits Tax,” revealed on Thursday morning applies to companies that report more than $100 million in profits. The first $100 million would not be touched, but under the plan, for every dollar of profit above that $100 million, the corporation would pay a 7 percent tax.
Warren estimates that Amazon would pay $698 million as opposed to zero federal corporate income tax and that Occidental Petroleum would pay $280 million.
“It’s a small new tax—but because our richest, biggest corporations are so skilled at minimizing their taxes under our current system, that small new tax will generate big new revenue,” she writes. “According to an estimate from economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman at the University of California-Berkeley, the tax will bring in $1 trillion in revenue over the next ten years—just from the massive profits of the thousand or so richest companies in the country.”
Warren explains that the new tax is a better fix than simply raising the corporate tax rate because the “corporate tax code is so littered with loopholes that simply raising the regular corporate tax rate alone is not enough.”
The tax would apply to worldwide profits of all American corporations that report more than $100 million in net income in a given year, foreign companies with “significant” U.S. operations and profits would also be subject to it and Warren promises “robust enforcement” of anti-inversion rules to prevent large companies from reincorporating abroad to avoid tax.
In a letter to Warren from Saez and Zucman, they estimate that close to 1,200 public corporations would be liable for the tax and that “it would raise $1.05 trillion on public companies alone over the ten- year budget window 2019-2028.”
The introduction of this proposal comes the day after Warren’s campaign revealed that she had raised more than $6 million in the first quarter, a number that has been reached even while she has eschewed high-dollar fundraisers .
It provided some evidence that the policy-centric campaign has found an audience with voters, despite the appearance of an operation in need of cash.
Since launching her candidacy, Warren has introduced plans to break up large tech and agriculture monopolies, get to universal child care coverage, a housing initiative to pay for the construction of more homes to eliminate housing shortages and an ultra-millionaire tax among other plans."
Oprah: Prince Harry Will Be a Real Producer on Our Apple Show,www.thedailybeast.com,tom.sykes@thedailybeast.com (Tom Sykes),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/oprah-prince-harry-will-be-a-real-producer-on-our-apple-show,"For Real Oprah: Prince Harry Will Be a Real Producer on Our Apple Show Oprah hits back at suggestions Prince Harry’s involvement as executive producer for her new TV show is just a stunt. 04.11.19 8:26 AM ET IAN WEST
Prince Harry’s surprise announcement yesterday that he is to partner with Oprah and exec produce a new mental health wellness show with her for Apple has been derided in some quarters, with detractors saying Harry is ill-qualified for such an important role in a major TV show, and is only there because of his name.
But Oprah hit back at those critics yesterday, telling fans waiting outside The Daily Show : “I don’t do anything halfway, so he’s a real partner, we’re real creators, making decisions about what will be aired and how it will be aired.”
Oprah and Harry have been working on the multi-part documentary series for several months and had a number of secret meetings in London as they planned it.
Harry said—in a buzz-word-rich statement—“I truly believe that good mental health—mental fitness—is the key to powerful leadership, productive communities and a purpose-driven self. It is a huge responsibility to get this right as we bring you the facts, the science and the awareness of a subject that is so relevant during these times.”
In an interview with CBS, Oprah said she pitched the idea to Prince Harry after asking him, “What do you think are the most important issues facing the world right now?”
Harry replied that he thought they were climate change and “mental wellness, mental fitness and mental health.”
Oprah, a guest at Harry’s wedding last May, dropped that she was “doing this thing with Apple” and asked him to partner on the project.
In 2017, Harry told an interviewer : “I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well. I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and sort of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle.” READ THIS LIST"

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have told the world to butt out of their birth plans.
There will be no photographs on the steps of any hospitals, no press pens at any locations and definitely no announcements on easels at Buckingham Palace.
In a surprising statement Thursday the royals said, “The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very grateful for the goodwill they have received from people throughout the United Kingdom and around the world as they prepare to welcome their baby.
“Their Royal Highnesses have taken a personal decision to keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private.
“The Duke and Duchess look forward to sharing the exciting news with everyone once they have had an opportunity to celebrate privately as a new family.”
The news that media organizations are to be denied any information about the baby’s birth until after the event will go down badly in the offices of Britain’s national newspapers, although the general public are likely to be more understanding.
Harry and Meghan’s decision to impose a black out ban on all information to the media should also be understood as an important declaration that they believe their child should be entitled to a very high level of privacy as it is not in the direct line of succession like George, Charlotte and Louis.

Why Ecuador Finally Got Sick of Julian Assange and Ended His Refuge at the Embassy in London,www.thedailybeast.com,Kevin.Poulsen@thedailybeast.com (Kevin Poulsen),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/assange-how-ecuador-finally-got-sick-of-wikileaks-founder-and-ended-his-refuge-at-the-embassy-in-london,"BYE Why Ecuador Finally Got Sick of Julian Assange and Ended His Refuge at the Embassy in London The Justice Department is set to announce charges against the Wikileaks founder after he was dragged from Ecuador’s embassy in London. 04.11.19 6:04 AM ET Jack Taylor/Getty
Six years, nine months and 24 days after walking into the Ecuadorian embassy in London and declaring asylum, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was dragged back out onto the streets by British police officers.
A few hours later, federal prosecutors in Virginia unsealed an indictment accusing Assange of conspiring with Chelsea Manning to crack a password to swipe classified documents from government computers nearly a decade ago.
Assange, 47, who was pale and heavily bearded, shouted “The U.K. must resist!” as he was bundled towards a waiting police vehicle by a clutch of officers. He appeared to be carrying a copy of Gore Vidal’s book History of The National Security State .
His dramatic expulsion from the embassy follows a year of ratcheting tension between Assange and his Ecuadorian hosts, culminating in WikiLeaks publicizing a leak of hundreds of thousands of hacked emails mysteriously stolen from the inboxes of Ecuador’s president and first lady.
It was this last move that finally set Ecuador’s government firmly against Assange, who was by then already being treated less like a political refugee than an inmate—albeit one who was free to leave at any time.
“The patience of Ecuador has reached its limit on the behavior of Mr. Assange,” Ecuador’s president, Lenín Moreno, said on Thursday.
Assange, who has an outstanding warrant for jumping bail in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, was taken into custody after officers were invited inside by embassy officials.
Hauled off to court, he was quickly found guilty on the relatively minor bail charge and faces 12 months in prison for that. In court, a judge said he had displayed “the behaviour of a narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest.”
More seriously, British police confirmed a few hours after the initial arrest that Assange was arrested for a second time on behalf of U.S. authorities on an extradition warrant.
The Department of Justice then announced in a press release that Assange had been charged in connection with Manning’s hack, which led to the leak of thousands of diplomatic cables.
“The charge relates to Assange’s alleged role in one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States,” the statement reads.
Federal prosecutors in Alexandria, Virginia, have been working to build a case against the Australian cypherpunk for nearly a decade, and a paperwork error last year revealed they had a sealed criminal complaint ready to pop at the right moment.
Randy Credico, a New York lefty radio host and friend of Assange who saw him in March, told The Daily Beast he was shocked by his appearance as he emerged from the embassy on Thursday.
“I complained to his mom and to some others about the fact that he didn’t look good, he was coughing,” Credico said. “So I know right now seeing him walk out with that beard, he hasn’t had any medical attention, the first thing he needs is medical attention.”
The arrest opens a new chapter in a saga that began when Assange entered the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, 2012.
At the time, Assange was facing imminent extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted for questioning in a rape and sexual-assault investigation that’s since been dropped on a technicality. He showed up at the embassy after losing a final appeal in the British courts.
Assange had good reason for choosing Ecuador as his protector. A few weeks earlier, then-Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa appeared on Assange’s TV interview show on the Russian government’s RT network. The interview revealed Correa as a WikiLeaks fan, and the interplay between the two was filled with the friendly banter of fellow travelers.
Two months after Assange’s walk-in, Correa’s government formally granted the asylum request. In the months and years that followed, Correa built a miniature intelligence agency around his new guest, leaked documents would later show. Called “Operation Hotel,” Ecuador placed outside security contractors into a basement apartment around the corner from the embassy, where for years they surveilled and scrutinized the neverending parade of international visitors calling on Assange.
But as Assange’s tenancy wore on, his welcome wore out.
In October 2016, international pressure fell on Ecuador over Assange’s role in Russian election interference, and Correa temporarily cut off Assange’s internet access, not restoring it until after the U.S. election.
Assange’s standing with his host nation became even more troubled after Correa was term-limited out of office in 2017. He was succeeded by Moreno, his one-time vice president, who won a narrow election victory espousing the same socialist policies as his predecessor. Once in office though, Moreno proved more conservative, and he made no secret that he regarded Assange as an “inherited problem” and a “nuisance.”
Assange wasted little time testing Moreno’s limits. He stirred a diplomatic hornet’s nest in 2017 when he threw his celebrity weight behind the Catalan independence movement in Spain, forcing Ecuador’s foreign minister to clarify in a statement that Assange’s views “do not represent the position of the Ecuadorian State.” Moreno once again suspended Assange’s Internet, this time enforcing the ban with cellphone jamming equipment.
Assange was allowed back online in late 2018, but only after agreeing not to “carry out activities that could be considered political interference in the internal affairs of other states.” At the same time, Ecuador imposed a new and detailed set of rules on its fugitive guest, banning unannounced visitors, and requiring Assange to pay his own medical bills, clean up after himself in the bathroom and tend to the “well-being, food, cleanliness, and proper care” of his cat.
Assange bristled at the restrictions and took Ecuador’s foreign ministry to court. When he lost, he filed a complaint with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which rejected it.
What happened next was perhaps inevitable. It was Lenín Moreno’s time in the barrel. “Ecuador imposed a new and detailed set of rules on its fugitive guest, requiring Assange to pay his own medical bills, clean up after himself in the bathroom and tend to the ‘proper care’ of his cat.”
In late February, one of Moreno’s political rivals revealed he’d received a tranche of leaked documents from an anonymous source. The files, he claimed, showed Moreno had corruptly profited from a deal with a Chinese firm. The dossier was dubbed the “INA Papers,” after one of the shell companies allegedly used to channel the money, INA Investments Corp.
On Feb. 19, the Ecuadorian news outlet Le Fuente published pages from the leak in an investigative story on the alleged corruption. Three days later, someone anonymously registered the website address INApapers.org to publish much more. The site went live in early March with material hacked from the accounts of Moreno and his wife, among others. The stash includes SMS messages, phone logs, WhatsApp and Telegram texts, and private emails and attachments that the site says number in the hundreds of thousands.
The INA Papers leak appears to have earned little notice outside of Ecuador, until a fateful tweet from WikiLeaks on Thursday, March 28 that referenced the resultant corruption investigation by lawmakers in Ecuador’s national assembly. The tweet , since retweeted over 3,700 times, linked directly to the anonymous website hosting the hacked material in bulk.
Like some of WikiLeaks’ own signature releases, including the John Podesta and Democratic National Committee hacks, INA Papers is loaded with material unrelated to corruption, including personal photos of Moreno and his family—“photos of my bedroom, what I eat, and how my wife and daughters and friends dance,” Moreno complained in a radio interview Tuesday.
WikiLeaks has said it has no connection to the site or the hacking. Moreno, though, clearly suspects otherwise. “Mr. Assange has violated the agreement we reached with him and his legal counsel too many times,” Moreno said, according to a Reuters’ translation from the same interview. “It is not that he cannot speak and express himself freely, but he cannot lie, nor much less hack private accounts or phones.”
Ecuador called out WikiLeaks by name for promoting the leak in a complaint to a U.N. privacy council. Moreno’s vice president, Otto Sonnenholzner, went on television to charge “what WikiLeaks and other political actors have done, to publish private photos of the president of the republic, of his family, is a despicable, repugnant, and odious act.” Moreno’s minister of foreign affairs was quoted vowing to take action against Assange.
The escalating clash between Assange and the government protecting him likely sent U.S. officials scurrying in preparation, said attorney Christopher Ott, a former Justice Department prosecutor who worked on Russia’s election-hacking investigation prior to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. “'They’re five hours ahead of us,” Ott said. “You don’t want to wake up in the morning and all of a sudden have two hours to get the whole packet done.”
The unsealing of the indictment confirmed suspicions that the Virginia case against Assange centers on WikiLeaks’ first impactful leaks in 2010, when the secret-spilling website began dumping hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and U.S. Army field reports leaked by Manning, then an Army intelligence analyst.
Manning has been in jail since March 3, when a federal judge found her in contempt for refusing to testify in front of the Alexandria, Virginia, grand jury investigating WikiLeaks . Manning said in a legal filing that the subpoena was preceded by extensive surveillance against her.
At her court-martial in 2013, Manning gave a lengthy statement detailing her motives and accepting personal responsibility for the leaks. The online chats between Manning and Assange used as evidence in the court-martial provide few clues to a potential charge against Assange. With the exception of a brief exchange in which Assange offers to help crack the password for an Army desktop, Assange comes across as little more than a publisher determined to get Manning’s material, some of it of significant news value, out to the public.
Unless prosecutors have more damning evidence waiting in the wings, the extradition request will likely trigger months, or even years, of legal battles in the U.K. courts."

Pentagon Officials Are Preparing for an All-Out Space War,www.thedailybeast.com,David Axe,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/pentagon-officials-are-preparing-for-an-all-out-space-war,"DRUMBEAT Pentagon Officials Are Preparing for an All-Out Space War But when it comes to military provocation in space, the United States isn’t some innocent victim, beefing up strictly in self-defense. 04.11.19 5:43 AM ET Photo Illustration by Lyne Lucien/The Daily Beast/Getty
The United States is under siege in space, and we better get ready for an all-out space war.
At least, that’s the alarming scenario that a host of Trump administration officials posited on Tuesday and Wednesday at a major space conference in Colorado Springs, where Pentagon officials warned of increasingly sophisticated Russian and Chinese weapons threatening America's hundreds of satellites and the GPS, phone calls, and internet-browsing they enable.
But the administration's escalating orbital war-cry has omitted at least one important fact: When it comes to military provocation in space, the United States isn't some innocent victim, beefing up strictly in self-defense.
“ China and Russia have weaponized space,” acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan, a former Boeing executive who is under investigation for favoring his ex-employer in government contracting, said . “We are not going to sit back and watch. We are going to act.”
Gen. David Goldfein, the U.S. Air Force's chief of staff, chimed in with a sports metaphor. “It's not enough to stand in the ring and take punches. You have to have the will and capability to punch back.”
The Pentagon might even start activating new space weapons preemptively as a shock-and-awe-style show of force, Air Force secretary Heather Wilson said. “There may come a point where we demonstrate some of our capabilities so that our adversaries understand they cannot deny us the use of space without consequence.“
But Russian and Chinese officials could say the same things about U.S. behavior in space that American officials say about Russian and Chinese behavior in space. It's not hard to imagine officials in Moscow and Beijing calling for more weapons and dramatic demonstrations of orbital might, all in a bid to match America's own space belligerence.
By far the world's leading space power, the U.S. military possesses all the same orbital weapons that China and Russia have deployed. In some key cases, the Americans actually deployed the space weapons first.
Administration officials repeatedly referred to a Chinese laser installation that could, in theory, blind the sensors on American satellites. That laser site in western China has “undergone significant upgrade” since it first appeared in 2009, said Fred Kennedy, director of the Pentagon's Space Development Agency.
But the United States tested its own satellite-blinding laser as far back as October 1997.
“Results of the test are classified, but the [Department of Defense] did report that the system tracked and illuminated the satellite, and the lower-power laser either temporarily dazzled or damaged the satellite’s sensor,” Laura Grego, a space expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists in Massachusetts, explained in a 2012 paper.
The Pentagon considered the 1997 test to be “defensive,” but that didn't stop Russian officials from lodging a formal protest, Grego pointed out. “The administration’s real emphasis is a space arms race.” — Joan Johnson-Freese, a space expert
U.S. officials in Colorado also decried other countries' tests of anti-satellite rockets. On March 27, India lobbed a rocket 500 miles into space and struck a target satellite, smashing the satellite into hundreds of pieces. It could take up to 18 months for the debris to re-enter the atmosphere and burn up.
In the meantime, some chunks pose a danger to the International Space Station, NASA claimed .
Wilson, the Air Force secretary, cited the Indian test as evidence space is getting more dangerous. China conducted a similar but bigger-scale anti-satellite test in 2007, hitting a target with a rocket and scattering thousands of pieces of debris.
But the United States fired a rocket at a target satellite way back in 1982, and repeated the feat in 2008. The U.S. test in 2008 scattered just as much debris as the Indian test did 11 years later, according to Brian Weeden, a space expert with the Secure World Foundation in Colorado.
In addition to lasers and rockets, there's a third type of anti-satellite weapon: a small, maneuverable “inspection” satellite, whose official mission is to check on a country's own spacecraft, which could easily double as a weapon by tampering with an enemy's spacecraft.
Russian and Chinese inspection satellites pose an “on-orbit” threat to American spacecraft, Air Force general John Hyten, the head of U.S. nuclear forces, said at the Colorado conference. China in 2016 launched its own SJ-17 inspection satellite.
The nimble spacecraft has been tracked maneuvering around other Chinese satellites. “They're practicing here, they're exercising,“ Todd Harrison, a space expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said at the conference. “What could they be preparing for?“
Russia in 2014, 2015 and 2017 deployed no fewer than three separate Kosmos inspection sats. These craft have acted even more aggressively than SJ-17 has done. Russian inspection sats have spent the past few years “nuzzling up to other people's satellites,” Harrison explained.
One Russian sat got so close to a French-Italian military satellite that Paris lodged an official complaint, Harrison said.
Left unmentioned by most attendees at the Colorado conference, and certainly by administration officials, is that the United States operates several inspection satellites. And as part of the Air Force's Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program, two inspection sats since 2014 have performed multiple close passes on other satellites. “This behavior is similar to several international ... missions,” Weeden wrote in an April report.
If there's an arms race in space—and more and more experts agree there is—America started a lot of it and has sustained it by deploying space weaponry at the same time as, or even years before, potential enemies have deployed their own orbital weapons.
But that nuance is missing in the Trump administration's increasingly heated rhetoric about the possibility of orbital conflict.
That might not be an accident. It's possible the President and top officials actually want more weapons, more tension, and more danger in space.
“The administration’s real emphasis,” Joan Johnson-Freese, a space expert, author and educator told The Daily Beast, “is a space arms race.” READ THIS LIST"

Jeff Slate 04.11.19 5:42 AM ET
“ Yeah? What is it? Tell me!” Joan Jett demands, followed by a hearty laugh, when I tell her that when my kids recently saw her as the opening act for The Who, not having previously heard of her, they came away firm fans. “It’s amazing to see and feel that from the stage, but that’s so cool to hear.”
She’s been called the Queen of Rock and Roll, not to mention the Godmother of Punk. But really, Joan Jett is a survivor.
“It’s exciting, it’s gratifying, and it’s something that you can’t really manufacture,” Jett continues, reflecting on her newfound status as a rock and roll legend, playing to ever-larger crowds on a seemingly never-ending tour . “Either people are into it or they’re not. But I do find the makeup of the audiences now—and for probably a good 10 years—has become all ages, and people who clearly like all styles of music, because I see everyone out there from hippies to punks.”
Jett’s story is, of course, the stuff of legend. She survived the fractious rise and fall of her first band, the Runaways—recently chronicled in both a documentary and feature film —as well as her meteoric ascent in the early 1980s to the ranks of rock and roll’s elite, at the hands of the then-fledgling MTV. That was, of course, followed by an equally speedy fall, courtesy of changing times and more than a little sexism—even from her own label —only to become a beacon of authenticity and an icon to the LGBT community (“I stand with everybody,” she says, proudly) in this decade.
“It’s a word that’s probably over-used today—authenticity—but I still think people are looking for it,” Jett says. “They’re looking for something that’s real, because we have so much fakeness today. Everything nowadays is always about putting this best face forward—or phony face forward, as far as I’m concerned—with people creating their ‘brands’ online. I’m talking about little kids, even, and definitely teenagers; everybody’s got a brand. So when people see something they sense is authentic, they gravitate to it.”
One of the most iconic artists of the 1980s MTV era, Jett’s story was retold in last year’s career-spanning documentary Bad Reputation . It’s a remarkable tale: Jett, aided by ever-present manager Kenny Laguna, building her career by fusing punk and glam and the sort of old school rock and roll that used to pepper the AM airwaves in the 1960s, along the way embracing the music videos that MTV was in desperate need of, becoming a household name in the process. But it had been a long, hard road already.
As a kid growing up in suburban Pennsylvania, Jett had absorbed every Black Sabbath, David Bowie, T. Rex, and New York Dolls record she could get her hands on. By her late teens, she was never without a guitar, and had relocated to Los Angeles and co-founded the pioneering all-female band the Runaways.
“I know some of the others in the band have negative feelings about those days,” Jett says, no doubt referring to her former bandmates’ horror stories about their then-manager Kim Fowley. “I don’t. But those were hard times, that’s for sure. So much of the time it just felt like we couldn’t catch a break.”
While the band didn’t last long, Jett soon joined forces with Laguna, who would go on to become a member (and producer) of her group the Blackhearts. On the heels of a 1980 solo album—which took more than a bit of its swagger from early Ramones records—Jett and the Blackhearts had a template for chart domination. “Bad Reputation,” “Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah),” and 1982’s breakthrough album I Love Rock ‘n Roll soon followed, with the then-nascent MTV giving the charismatic Jett and company just the edge they needed in the competitive post-punk era.
A cover of Tommy James and The Shondells’ “Crimson and Clover” soon hit the Top 10, as did the brash power-pop “I Hate Myself For Loving You,” and ensured that Jett would be a household name for years to come.
“Always the coolest person in the room, and an inspiration to anyone who feels like an outsider or misfit,” Jett’s biography reads on her Hall of Fame inductee page . It’s a great line that also sums up Jett perfectly.
But the 1990s and ‘00s were hard years for Jett, who toured and recorded relentlessly during those decades, even when it seemed no one cared.
“I think I’ve always been more of a live performer,” Jett says of her long climb back. “Rock and roll shows were always, for lack of a better way of phrasing it, a young person’s game. So you have to rectify those things as you get older. Is rock and roll still relevant to an older person? I say absolutely yes!” “ It is exciting to see lots of young girls and young women in the audience, and to know that there’s more of us now in the music business than ever before, because that’s really the only way things will change. ” — Joan Jett
“But how do you continue doing it as you get older?” she continues. “I think we’re just staring to figure that out. I like to make records, and I like to write songs; it’s more or less finding subject matter, and finding how to change the approach as I get older. Because if you write about really deep, heavy things, some people might tune out. So that’s the challenge. And it’s one of those things that we are all—all artists—just trying to figure out, because I do really want to write about real things.”
During those lost years, Jett, a rock and roll pioneer as one of the few instantly recognizable women in the genre, became a tireless advocate for young artists, building relationships with a long list of up-and-comers, including Miley Cyrus , who inducted her into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, as well as Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong, and Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl. As she climbed her way back from what at the time seemed like career oblivion, she became a model for younger artists, as the standard-bearer for the old-school belief that uncompromising independence is the only way to survive—and succeed—in rock and roll.
“It’s all ages,” Jett says of her shows these days. “I guess I can’t really use one descriptive word to sum them up, except for ‘music lovers,’ really.”
The rise of women in rock, in particular, is something that she no doubt takes pride in.
“The music business feels like the last place to be affected by #MeToo,” Jett says, more than a hint of frustration in her voice. “My parents told me I could do anything, and I never let anyone get in my way. But it is exciting to see lots of young girls and young women in the audience, and to know that there’s more of us now in the music business than ever before, because that’s really the only way things will change. I mean, nothing is going to change until it’s forced to.”
So how does she feel that the guitar manufacturer Gibson will soon release its third guitar modeled on one of Jett’s iconic instruments, and that the Melody Maker guitar she wielded so fiercely on the cover of her early albums currently sits in the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s new exhibition “Play It Loud,” next to the guitars of Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page and Eric Clapton?
“I chose my guitars, initially, because they were all I could afford,” Jett says wryly of the honor. “But I totally relate to that fan thing—of wanting to see and play the guitars your favorite artists played. But I’ll tell you, I didn’t really key in to my favorite people—Marc Bolan, David Bowie—necessarily using specific guitars. Honestly, it was what I could get my hands on. But for some reason, I knew I wanted a Gibson and not a Fender. I don’t know what that was about, and I don’t really know where that came from.”"
"‘Les Misérables’: A Grand, Romantic Alternative to ‘Game of Thrones’",www.thedailybeast.com,Nick Schager,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/pbs-les-miserables-a-grand-romantic-alternative-to-game-of-thrones,"MUST-SEE TV ‘Les Misérables’: A Grand, Romantic Alternative to ‘Game of Thrones’ The new 6-episode miniseries, premiering April 14 on PBS, soars—and boasts a star-studded cast including Dominic West, David Oyelowo, Lily Collins, and Oscar winner Olivia Colman. 04.11.19 5:41 AM ET PBS
There are no musical numbers in PBS’s Les Misérables , but that doesn’t mean this new six-part “Masterpiece” miniseries—produced by the BBC, and taking Victor Hugo’s acclaimed 1862 novel as its direct source—doesn’t sing a rousing (figurative) song of angry men. An exceptional adaptation of its classic material, it resounds with heart, horror and complexity, eschewing revisionist flourishes to faithfully recount its fateful 19th-century saga about man’s darkest impulses—and, also, his capacity for redemption.
The price of liberty is high in Les Misérables , and so too is the cost of transformative change, both personal and political. That theme is front-and-center throughout this latest take on Hugo’s tale, which avoids massive alterations in favor of a straightforward and stirring approach. Precisely written by Andrew Davies, previously responsible for the BBC’s Middlemarch , Vanity Fair , Pride and Prejudice , Bleak House and War and Peace (as well as the original House of Cards and Bridget Jones’ Diary ), and competently helmed by Tom Shankland, it abridges little of crucial importance. As a result, it allows Hugo’s potent human drama—and sterling performances from Dominic West , David Oyelowo and Lily Collins —to carry it from wretched start to inspiring conclusion.
Premiering April 14 on PBS, after which it will be available (beginning May 20) to binge in its entirety on the Masterpiece Prime Video Channel on Amazon, Davies and Shankland’s series streamlines its story’s chronology, opening on a June 1815 battlefield where, with Napoleon’s forces in ruins, Thénardier (Adeel Akhtar) tries to rob the corpse of Colonel Pontmercy (Henry Lloyd-Hughes). When Pontmercy turns out to be alive, Thénardier pretends to be saving him—thus earning from Pontmercy a life debt. Meanwhile in Paris, royalist Monsieur Gillenormand (David Bradley) curses his Bonapartist son Pontmercy to anyone who will listen, including his grandson Marius. And in the Toulon prison hulks, a convict named Jean Valjean (West) struggles to finish his 19-year sentence (for stealing a loaf of bread) under the tyrannical guard of Javert (Oyelowo)—two men whose paths are destined to repeatedly cross over the course of the ensuing decades.
“Men like us have only two choices: to prey on society or to guard it. You chose the former, I chose the latter,” Javert tells Valjean, thereby establishing his belief that one’s inherent good/evil nature is fixed at birth, as well as Les Misérables ’ central conflict. Anyone who’s read Hugo’s novel or seen the smash Broadway musical will know that considerable suffering awaits both, as Valjean will respond to life’s cruelty by pilfering candlesticks from a Bishop (Derek Jacobi) and, worse, a coin from young Petit-Gervais (Henry Lawfull), and Javert will fume over his inability to catch Valjean. Misery will also befall Fantine (Collins), a young seamstress who’s left with child by a callous aristocratic playboy and, to support herself and her offspring, will leave her daughter Cosette in the care of the dastardly Thénardier and his wife (newly minted Best Actress Oscar winner Olivia Colman ), whose hunger for money—and fondness for cheating suckers out of it—is matched only by their abusiveness.
Les Misérables doesn’t mess with what works, and at six-plus hours, it has the space needed to do justice to its every incident and emotional upheaval. While a few minor elements are condensed or discarded, Davies’ script is true to Hugo’s tome in terms of basic plot particulars and rousing spirit (a cornier writer might say that the beating of its heart echoes the beating of its narrative drum, but I digress…). Fantine’s misfortune and degradation are depicted in harrowing detail, and made all the more moving by Collins’ evocation of the doomed girl’s initial liveliness and innocence. Her agonizing deathbed scene is one of the series’ high points, and thankfully, the show’s urgency doesn’t flag after she’s perished and the focus shifts to the older Cosette (Ellie Bamber) and her romance with Marius (Josh O’Connor), now a law student thinking about taking part in an impending uprising against the Crown.
This Les Misérables flirts with definitiveness, conveying with passion and nuance the arduous struggles of Valjean and Javert, the former trying to prove (to himself, and society) that a man can be what he wants—for better or worse—and the latter convinced that such a notion is fantasy. West’s magnificent performance leads the way, mixing hope and faith with fear and self-doubt to brilliant effect, and he’s nearly matched by Oyelowo, whose Javert is less a titanic monster than a small, dogged, heartless authoritarian consumed by a desire to “win” by capturing Valjean, which in turn would validate his cynical worldview. West and Oyelowo make their iconic characters not mere representations of themes but living, breathing, fallible adversaries, and they do so with such dexterous skill that it’s hard not to be swept up in their respective plights.
As you may have realized by now, this Les Misérables casts a person of color as Javert, and it does likewise with Éponine, played by Erin Kellyman. Those moves follow in the footsteps of a few stage productions (including, notably, 2014’s Broadway rendition), and they are, unsurprisingly, of no appreciable consequence, except to demonstrate that Hugo’s characters are defined not by their appearances but, rather, by their social marginalization and/or tormented internal conditions. If there’s a shortcoming here, it’s Shankland’s direction, which strives for, and occasionally achieves, a sense of grand scale, yet as with the climactic barricade showdown between soldiers and insurgents, sometimes feels a bit visually cramped. That’s exacerbated by his preference for close-ups, yet unlike with Tom Hooper’s in-your-face 2012 musical film, those turn out to be beneficial for his stars, including a suitably nasty Colman and Akhtar as the Thénardiers.
You’ll be forgiven for involuntarily humming some of the musical’s most famous tunes during Les Misérables ’ key moments. Still, Davies and Shankland’s version—scored, mournfully, by John Murphy—stands on its own as a rich, intricate portrait of regret, guilt, rebellion and salvation. It exists in the gritty, grimy muck of the real world, where kindness and mercy are in short supply (especially for women), and brutish nastiness is the order of the day. Moreover, it’s loyal to the dense profundity of Hugo’s work, whose understanding of revolutionary individual and social movements (inspired by God and man alike) proves to be as timely and poignant as ever.

Michael Avenatti Indicted on 36 Counts by Federal Grand Jury,www.thedailybeast.com,Pilar.Melendez@thedailybeast.com (Pilar Melendez) Audrey.McNamara@thedailybeast.com (Audrey McNamara) kate.briquelet@thedailybeast.com (Kate Briquelet),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/michael-avenatti-indicted-for-allegedly-stealing-dollar16-million-from-client-settlement,"Michael Avenatti Indicted on 36 Counts by Federal Grand Jury He’s been accused of stealing millions from clients, dodging taxes, and defrauding a bank. 04.11.19 10:19 AM ET Mike Blake/Reuters
Michael Avenatti has been indicted on 36 counts by a federal grand jury in California, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles confirmed to The Daily Beast.
Avenatti, who made his name as the attorney for adult film star Stormy Daniels and as a vocal critic of President Trump, will reportedly be indicted on new charges, alleging he stole millions from clients, didn’t pay his taxes for his coffee business, and committed bank fraud to cover up the crimes.
Some of the new charges against Avenatti include fraud, perjury, tax dodging and embezzlement from clients, according to Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles.
The celebrity lawyer has been accused by California prosecutors of stealing $1.6 million from a client’s settlement to cover his own expenses, and defrauding a bank in Mississippi. He is also facing charges from federal prosecutors in New York, who have accused him of trying to extort millions of dollars from Nike Inc. Avenatti denies the charges, and was released from jail on a $300,000 bond after his arrest in New York.
“The case paints an ugly picture of lawless conduct and greed,” Nick Hanna, the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, said last month.
Avenatti didn't file tax returns for years and obstructed IRS efforts to collect millions in unpaid taxes from himself personally, and his Newport Beach law firm and Seattle-based coffee company, a California complaint against the lawyer alleges .
The complaint laid out how Avenatti allegedly spent the millions he kept from the IRS on luxe personal expenses, including watches, an “elite private action club,” and Porsches.
Last October, as Avenatti floated a 2020 presidential run, The Daily Beast investigated questions over his finances and $1.2 million in tax liens.
The California indictment requires Avenatti to appear in court to enter a plea. The judge may also set a trial date.
“For 20 years, I have represented Davids vs. Goliaths and relied on due process and our system of justice,” Avenatti tweeted Thursday morning. “Along the way, I have made many powerful enemies. I am entitled to a FULL presumption of innocence and am confident that justice will be done once ALL of the facts are known.”
He continued : “I intend to fully fight all charges and plead NOT GUILTY. I look forward to the entire truth being known as opposed to a one-sided version meant to sideline me.”
According to the Los Angeles Times , a Santa Ana grand jury alleges in the new indictment that the famed lawyer stole millions from five different clients, then used various companies and bank accounts to cover up the act. The exact amount of money Avenatti stole from his clients is unclear.
The indictment also details how Avenatti allegedly hid a $4 million legal settlement in favor of a mentally ill paraplegic client, Geoffrey Johnson, and hid a $2.75 million settlement for another client. Avenatti then allegedly used the money to help pay for the purchase of a private jet, according to the Times .
Last month, The Daily Beast reported that the California complaint also suggested Avenatti stole money from beauty blogger Michelle Phan . Avenatti allegedly failed to pay “M.P.” millions owed to her in connection to the divestment of one of her businesses, according to a search warrant affidavit filed by an IRS investigator. Soon after news of Avenatti’s arrest spread, Phan posted an image to Twitter, “The best revenge is always to just happily move on and let karma do the rest.”
Both the IRS and the U.S. Attorney’s Office announced the 34 new criminal charges against Avenatti. Those charges will be added to the felony bank fraud and wire fraud charges that Los Angeles prosecutors lodged against Avenatti in March.
On the day of Avenatti’s arrest, federal agents executed search warrants for his apartment, law office, and the home of Judy Regnier, his office manager at Eagan Avenatti, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Regnier did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment.
If convicted, Avenatti faces a maximum sentence of 335 years in prison.
Meanwhile, in New York, Avenatti allegedly conspired to extort Nike for $25 million with the help of a co-conspirator (reportedly celebrity lawyer Mark Geragos). Prosecutors say the duo threatened the shoe brand's reputation, saying they had proof Nike employees secretly paid the families of high-school basketball players.
According to a criminal complaint, Avenatti offered to cancel a press conference on Nike's alleged misdeeds in exchange for a $1.5 million payout to his client, an amateur basketball coach whose Nike contract wasn't renewed. Avenatti also allegedly demanded Nike “retain” him and his co-counsel for up to $25 million to conduct an “internal investigation” into the payments, or pay them nearly as much for their silence.
The demands prompted Nike's lawyers to contact the feds, who helped them covertly record conversations with Avenatti.
“You guys know enough now to know you’ve got a serious problem. And it’s worth more in exposure to me to just blow the lid on this thing,” Avenatti allegedly warned Nike's counsel. “A few million dollars doesn’t move the needle for me.”
Since his arrest and subsequent release from jail, Avenatti has issued a salvo of tweets against Nike, including one claiming its executives “participated in and/or helped cover-up the massive illegal bribes paid to rig the college recruitment process.”"

I would love to drink iced coffee all year, but I’m not a glutton for punishment when it comes to the cold. The weather is finally warm enough that your hands don’t hurt while holding a cup of iced coffee while walking down the street. While I splurge every now and then on a Blue Bottle New Orleans Coffee (that chickory, man), I can’t pass up making iced coffee at home. And the best way to get iced coffee at home is the Takeya Cold Brew Coffee Maker .
The Takeya is not only the best way to get non-acidic, super flavorful iced coffee, but it’s probably the easiest. All you’ll need to do is add some coarsely ground beans to the center fine-mesh filter, fill the container with water, and let it sit overnight. In the morning, chuck a couple of ice cubes into your travel bottle and pour your perfectly brewed coffee.
There really is a difference between iced coffee and cold brew (and not just in price). Iced coffee tends to be hot coffee that’s been cooled down. Cold brew coffee is brewed… cold. And that’s what Takeya does. It cuts down on the acidity and doesn’t dilute the strength of your brew. It’s great to keep in your fridge, as it fits neatly in the door or stood up on a shelf.

‘The View’s’ Meghan McCain Explodes at Sunny Hostin for Defending Julian Assange,www.thedailybeast.com,matt.wilstein@thedailybeast.com (Matt Wilstein),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-views-meghan-mccain-explodes-at-sunny-hostin-for-defending-julian-assange,"‘The View’s’ Meghan McCain Explodes at Sunny Hostin for Defending Julian Assange ‘I hope he rots in hell,’ McCain said of the WikiLeaks founder. 04.11.19 12:09 PM ET The View/ABC
The arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange hit The View ’s Meghan McCain hard on Thursday morning.
“The politics of this have always been completely hypocritical on both sides,” McCain said, noting that President Obama’s attorney general Eric Holder declined to prosecute Assange on the basis that WikiLeaks is essentially a “journalistic” organization.
“This is something that a lot of people who have put national security first, and I put myself in that category, have been warning about and warning about and warning about,” she continued, “and the only time the Democrats started caring is when it started affecting them politically and when Hillary Clinton's emails were released.”
Asked what will happen to Assange, McCain replied, “I hope he rots in hell!”
Her co-host Sunny Hostin had a markedly different take on the matter, saying that if people “have a problem” with Assange and the secrets he published, then they must also have a problem with the the release of the Pentagon Papers and the Panama Papers, both of which she believes “protected our democracy.” She disputed the notion that Obama and Holder “punted” on Assange but rather that they decided the Constitution protected Assange ""because our Constitution does protect Julian Assange.”
“I’m sorry, I’ve got to push back hard on this,” McCain interrupted, to which Hostin said, “Excuse me, you can push back after I’m finished speaking.”
Once Hostin had concluded her point about how the First Amendment should protect Assange’s right to disseminate even stolen material, McCain shot back, “I think what you said was just straight propaganda. They’re not First Amendment—he was a cyber terrorist from day one!”
“There's a difference, Sunny, in being a whistleblower and being a straight-up hacker,” Abby Huntsman said, backing up McCain. “What we found out with Assange is he conspired with Russia to meddle in our 2016 elections. If that's not him committing a crime, I don't know what is.”
Ultimately, as she did earlier in the week , moderator Whoopi Goldberg had to break up the fight and throw to commercial. “Whatever it is, we got to go,” she said."
Fox News and Fox Business Correct Lou Dobbs Claim About Trump’s ‘Soaring’ Approval,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-fox-business-correct-lou-dobbs-claim-about-trumps-soaring-approval,"HOW HUMILIATING Fox News and Fox Business Correct Lou Dobbs Claim About Trump’s ‘Soaring’ Approval The Trump-loving Fox host—who has been patched into the president’s Oval Office calls—will also address the issue on his show Thursday night. 04.11.19 12:03 PM ET Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast
President Trump on Thursday morning boasted of “great news” reported the previous night by Fox Business Network host Lou Dobbs , claiming his approval ratings are “soaring.” That claim, however, was wildly inaccurate, and both Fox Business and Fox News have now been forced to issue on-air corrections.
While highlighting a recent Georgetown Politics poll showing Trump’s job approval rating on the economy is 58 percent, Dobbs—a pro-Trump host who has been patched into Oval Office phone calls —claimed the same poll revealed Trump’s overall approval rating to be “soaring” at 55 percent. That figure would represent a huge jump from other polls showing the president in the low 40s.
“The president’s victories are showing up in the polls according to a Georgetown University poll,” Dobbs said Wednesday night, accompanied by a graphic. “The president’s overall approval is now 55 percent—let’s hear that, 55 percent—and approval rating for president’s handling of the economy, a robust 58 percent. Fifty-five percent is pretty robust too, don’t you think?""
On Thursday morning, the president shared Dobbs’ on-air graphic, and wrote: ""Great news! #MAGA.""
Georgetown University Politics director Mo Elleithee, a Fox News contributor, pointed out that the poll actually shows Trump’s approval rating at 43 percent. The 55-percent rating Dobbs touted was actually Trump’s unfavorability rating.
Fox Business Network reporter Blake Burman issued an on-air correction Thursday morning. “It’s been a quiet start to the day for President Trump, though he did send out a tweet this morning from the Lou Dobbs show last night on Fox Business,” Burman said. “That tweet featured a poll that was not entirely accurate, which Fox Business would like to correct.”
“According to a poll from Georgetown University, 58 percent of respondents approved of the president’s handling of the economy. That portion of the graphic was right,” he further explained. “However, the graphic also showed that 55 percent of the respondents approve of the president, that number is not correct. The 55 percent number was those who have an unfavorable impression of President Trump.”
And on Fox News, White House correspondent Kevin Corke issued another—this time, slightly bungled—correction, claiming there was “a typo in the graphic” (ignoring the fact that Dobbs’ spoken monologue was entirely about the false 55-percent figure).
A Fox Business spokesperson, meanwhile, told The Daily Beast that Dobbs will also address the issue on his own Thursday night broadcast.
As of publication, the president’s tweet on the fake job-approval numbers is still active."
Vice President Mike Pence Hits Back At Pete Buttigieg: ‘He Knows Better’,www.thedailybeast.com,Scott.Bixby@thedailybeast.com (Scott Bixby),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/vice-president-mike-pence-hits-back-at-pete-buttigieg-he-knows-better,"HOOSIER BOSS Pence Hits Back at Pete Buttigieg: ‘He Knows Better’ ‘He said some things that are critical of my Christian faith and about me personally. And he knows better—he knows me,’ Pence said. 04.11.19 11:59 AM ET Brendon Thorne/Getty
For months, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has derided Vice President Mike Pence’s partnership with President Donald Trump as a craven move to legitimize the thrice-married serial philanderer in the eyes of evangelical voters. Now, Pence’s first public remarks on the simmering feud accuse Buttigieg of being the cynical one.
“He said some things that are critical of my Christian faith and about me personally. And he knows better—he knows me,” Pence said in an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box that aired on Thursday morning.
“But I get it,” Pence continued. “You know, it’s, look, again, 19 people running for president on that side in a party that’s sliding off to the left. And they’re all competing with one another for how much more liberal they are.”
Pence, who served one term as governor of Indiana while Buttigieg was in his first term as mayor of South Bend, makes numerous appearances in the Democratic presidential candidate’s memoir, where he is depicted as a holy warrior whose obsession with social conservatism embarrassed the state and, in part, inspired Buttigieg to come out as gay .
“It really made my life harder, as we were trying to demonstrate that Indiana was ready for the future,” Buttigieg told The Daily Beast in an interview about his “long and complicated” relationship with Pence. “He seemed to be intent on sending us back into the past.”
During his time in Congress, Pence opposed same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption, and workplace protections for LGBT people. His support for federal funds for organizations that help people “seeking to change their sexual behavior” during his 2000 congressional campaign has frequently been interpreted as an endorsement of conversion therapy, although Pence has denied that he believes in the practice.
As governor, Pence signed into law the “ Religious Freedom Restoration Act ,” which gave individuals and businesses cover to discriminate against LGBT people if they held personal religious beliefs disapproving of homosexuality. The law made Indiana a target of national protest, as dozens of organizations pulled business out of the state. Pence compounded the crisis during a disastrous appearance on This Week with George Stephanopoulos, when the governor refused to say whether it should be legal for businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.
Pence was not asked about that stance in the CNBC interview, but reaffirmed that he and his family “have a view of marriage that’s informed by our faith, and we stand by that.”
“But that doesn’t mean that we’re critical of anyone else who has a different point of view,” Pence, who Trump once joked wants to hang all gay people , said.
Although Buttigieg has actively discouraged fellow Democratic presidential candidates from centering the race on opposition to Trump, he has publicly criticized the vice president in recent weeks. On Sunday, Buttigieg told a largely queer audience at a Washington fundraiser for the LGBT Victory Fund that “the Mike Pences of the world” need to take their problems with gays to a higher authority.
“If you have a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me,” Buttigieg said. “Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.”
The vice president has avoided responding directly until Thursday, but his wife Karen, who works at a Virginia private school that bans gay employees and students , told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade on Tuesday that the pair have “always had a great relationship.”
“It’s funny because I don’t think the vice president does have a problem with him, but I think it’s helping Pete to get some notoriety by saying that about the vice president,” the second lady said at the time.
Buttigieg, apparently in response, tweeted hours later that “People will often be polite to you in person, while advancing policies that harm you and your family. You will be polite to them in turn, but you need not stand for such harms. Instead, you push back, honestly and emphatically. So it goes, in the public square.”
Asked for comment on Pence’s comments, Buttigieg’s campaign referred The Daily Beast back to the mayor’s previous statements—although the mayor’s upcoming Friday appearance on Ellen likely means that the contretemps is far from over."
Daily Beast: This Could Be Manhattan’s First LGBT Elder Housing Project—If Local Residents Don’t Block It,www.thedailybeast.com,Habitat for Humanity,04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-could-be-manhattans-first-lgbt-elder-housing-projectif-local-residents-dont-block-it,"Living Well This Could Be Manhattan’s First LGBT Elder Housing Project—If Local Residents Don’t Block It Haven Green could be Manhattan’s first ever LGBT senior-friendly housing project. But locals fighting to block it say it would destroy the much-loved Elizabeth Street Garden. 03.11.19 4:11 AM ET Stacy Walsh Rosenstock / Alamy Stock Photo
LGBT elders will soon have access to public housing created for them in New York City. As The Daily Beast reported on Friday , the residences—in Brooklyn and the Bronx—will open later this summer and in early 2020 for those over 62 years of age. They are already over-subscribed, and the official application process hasn't even started.
Meanwhile, the battle to build a similar facility for the first time in Manhattan is mired in a planning controversy and two lawsuits.
Haven Green would comprise 123 studio apartments, 15,000 square feet of ground-level retail, and around 8,000 square feet of open space.
The elder LGBT advocacy group SAGE is supporting a project led by Pennrose, RiseBoro Community Partnership, and Habitat for Humanity New York City that would require the razing of the Elizabeth Street Garden in Little Italy, a one-acre green space that has been run and enjoyed by locals since 2013.
Some of those locals have mobilized against the plan, to try to save the green space. Late last week, as reported by Curbed New York , the garden and a separate nonprofit have filed two lawsuits in Manhattan Supreme Court against the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), “charging that the city’s environmental review failed to rigorously evaluate the impacts of the green space’s loss.”
A spokesperson for City Council Member Margaret Chin, who represents the district and who supports the construction of Haven Green, confirmed that the developers would be working with SAGE to market this housing for LGBTQ seniors.
“The necessity is born out of the senior affordable housing crisis we are facing citywide. There are over 200,000 seniors waiting for housing and nearly 5,000 waiting for housing in Council Member Chin’s district,” Chin’s spokesperson told The Daily Beast.
“It’s very hard to build in any New York borough, but particularly Manhattan,” said Michael Adams, SAGE’s chief executive officer.
Adams said that he and the organization were “optimistic” that the Haven Green development would proceed “based on the strong merits of the project and strong support of City Council Member Chin, the Mayor and Manhattan Borough President, and advocates and neighborhood residents who recognize why this kind of affordable housing is critically needed in our city.” “It is notoriously difficult to find sites for affordable housing in NYC. The city spent years analyzing the feasibility of the current site. Low income elders who desperately need housing can’t wait years more, especially given all that has been done to balance the various concerns”
“Building affordable housing is always a balance between a dire need for the housing and the concerns of local residents,” said Adams. “We believe that the Haven Green project does a very good job of balancing those concerns, among other things by including beautiful green space with neighborhood input that will be available to the community.
“It is notoriously difficult to find sites for affordable housing in NYC. The city spent years analyzing the feasibility of the current site. Low income elders who desperately need housing can’t wait years more, especially given all that has been done to balance the various concerns.”
The Friends of Elizabeth Street Garden, an advocacy group, has hired land-use attorney Michael Gruen to represent them. Gruen did not respond to a Daily Beast request for comment. Emily Hellstrom, a board member of Friends of Elizabeth Street Garden, told The Daily Beast, “When you have good urban planning you do not pit two desperate needs against one another as has happened here. This is bad urban planning.”
Hellstrom emphasized that residents’ objections to the new building was “in no way” related to the LGBT -aspect of the proposed building, but rather because the Elizabeth Street Garden is an important green space enjoyed by the local population. Hellstrom said that, without it, the nearest substantial green space is Washington Square Park. The garden has been open for six years, and is run by volunteers.
“We didn’t want to be ‘We want our garden, screw the rest of you,’” said Hellstrom. The Friends have lobbied for two other alternate sites for the project; one on Howard Street and the other on Hudson Street. “Real faith has been broken. The Mayor and the City have turned their backs on us,” Hellstrom said. “For the last six years, this Garden has bought the community together. I know so many of my neighbors as a result of it”
A SAGE spokesperson declined to comment on the question of alternative sites. “We don't feel equipped to offer opinions on different sites, since it's not SAGE's area of expertise,” the spokesperson said.
Hellstrom said that if the plans go ahead, what would be left of the Garden would be a shaded space, mainly paved over, with benches. It would not be publicly owned. “For the last six years, this Garden has bought the community together. I know so many of my neighbors as a result of it.”
Hellstrom is confident that “either a judge or someone from the city will do the right thing,” and “give a win win” to both objecting residents and supporters of the new housing.
Council Member Chin had engaged with the opponents of the affordable housing project, her spokesperson told The Daily Beast. “She understands that the opponents are passionately devoted to their point of view. Cllr. Chin believes that while there is clear disagreement here, everyone involved cares about the community. Cllr. Chin is supportive of Haven Green and is hopeful that the project will move forward so the City can address the affordable housing crisis facing our seniors.”
Mayor Bill De Blasio did not respond to The Daily Beast’s questions about the controversy around Haven Green.
Instead, an HPD spokesperson sent The Daily Beast a statement saying, “This administration is deeply committed to partnering with community-based organizations like SAGE to not just create quality, affordable housing for our city’s seniors, but to provide supportive services and a safe space for LGBT seniors. We look forward to continuing our partnership with SAGE and other allies to serve the needs of the aging LGBT community.”
City Speaker Corey Johnson would not respond to The Daily Beast’s questions on whether he supports Haven Green as a site for Manhattan's first ever LGBT elder-friendly residence.
“Speaker Johnson will continue working with the appropriate agencies and organizations to increase resources for elderly LGBT New Yorkers,” said Breeana Mulligan, a spokesperson for New York City Council.
Haven Green’s path to being built looks likely to be complicated.
In January, Community Board 2 voted to annul the proposal. Then in late February, Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer backed the project though with qualifications, including requesting that the structural plans were reworked to make room for 30 per cent more open space.
Regardless of the lawsuits, the project is deep in the complicated throes of the city planning process, and is currently at the City Planning Commission Review stage.
The CPC has 50 days to hold a public hearing and make a decision. The hearing for Haven Green is scheduled for this week. If the City Planning Commission disproves the plan, it will not move forward.
If it does progress, the City Council would need to review and approve it. The Council has 50 days to hold a public hearing and make a decision. It can approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the decision of the City Planning Commission. It requires a majority vote.
If the CPC wants to approve the plan with modifications, it then sends its ideas over to the City Planning Commission, which has 15 days to decide if the requested modifications require another environmental review. “We have had too many instances where two legitimate needs are put in competition with each other”
After the City Council vote, Mayor de Blasio has the option to veto it, but has not yet indicated his thoughts one way or the other. The City Council could then override the veto if it has the two-thirds needed votes.
Roberta Brandes Gratz, author and urban critic, told The Daily Beast: “We have had too many instances where two legitimate needs are put in competition with each other. I fail to believe that this is the only site available in the entire Lower Manhattan area for a project like this. Both projects are worthy of either being preserved or built, but they should not be in competition with each other. It is outrageous. That garden is an important piece of the neighborhood and the new project is important to be built somewhere, but it does not have to be built here.”
Brandes Gratz said there were few such “positive examples in New York, or many other cities,” where community-created efforts like the Elizabeth Street Garden were so successful. If the development goes ahead, said Gratz, “it would be a terrible message that your efforts may not last. I can’t believe that this is the only place the city can find to site such a project. If the city really cared about both sides of this they would know how to solve this.” “SAGE will continue to advocate vigorously for this housing, while respecting and supporting the balancing of legitimate neighborhood concerns”
A statement sent to The Daily Beast by the Haven Green development team, comprised of partners Pennrose, RiseBoro Community Partnership, and Habitat for Humanity New York City, read: “The development team is aware of the lawsuits against the City and stands firmly behind the vision of Haven Green to bring deeply affordable, LGBTQ-friendly, senior housing to one of New York’s most gentrified and high opportunity neighborhoods.
“The Haven Green project itself is a model energy-efficient building, adhering to Passive House [energy-efficient] standards, employing significant sustainability measures, a green roof and a rainwater collection system. As proven, responsible stewards of public land and community assets, the Haven Green development team partners support HPD in their use of City-owned land to create critical affordable housing for low-income seniors and publicly accessible open space for the community.”
“There is a tremendous need for affordable LGBT-friendly elder housing in every NYC borough, including Manhattan,” said Adams. “SAGE will continue to advocate vigorously for this housing, while respecting and supporting the balancing of legitimate neighborhood concerns.”
Whatever happens at Haven Green, Adams said the issue highlighted the need for such buildings and LGBT elder-focused services throughout the country, not just in New York City.
In a 2018 AARP survey, 34 percent of all LGBT survey respondents reported being at least somewhat worried about having to hide their LGBT identity in order to have access to suitable housing options as they age, as did more than half (54 percent) of transgender and gender expansive participants.
Legislatively, in a majority of states it is legal to discriminate against LGBT people and LGBT elders, said Adams. State and federal laws should be amended to protect both groups, he said, and spending prioritized according to LGBT elders’ greater social needs.
Those working in housing or facilities with LGBT elders should receive special awareness training, Adams said.
“The Trump administration has been completely hostile to the LGBT community from day one,” Adams said. “Having this administration in power makes it tremendously difficult to make progress on a federal level and why we’re focusing on a state level.” READ THIS LIST"

"A Celebrity Beauty Blogger, a Paraplegic, and a Mystery Client: Here Are the People Michael Avenatti Stole From, Feds Say",www.thedailybeast.com,kate.briquelet@thedailybeast.com (Kate Briquelet),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/avenatti-indictment-michelle-phan-geoffrey-johnson-and-a-mystery-client-here-are-the-people-he-stole-from-feds-say,"Travel AVENATTI 2020 A Celebrity Beauty Blogger, a Paraplegic, and a Mystery Client: Here Are the People Michael Avenatti Stole From, Feds Say The new indictment against Avenatti names five clients whom he allegedly scammed—including a disabled man and a YouTube beauty mogul. 04.11.19 2:06 PM ET Spencer Platt/Getty
Celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti has been indicted by a federal grand jury in California on 36 counts, including fraud, tax dodging, and embezzlement.
The latest charges come about two weeks after federal prosecutors in New York and California accused Avenatti of trying to extort millions from Nike, Inc., and of stealing from clients and forging tax returns to defraud a bank.
Avenatti has denied the charges, tweeting on Thursday, “I intend to fully fight all charges and plead NOT GUILTY. I look forward to the entire truth being known as opposed to a one-sided version meant to sideline me.”
The new indictment names five clients whom Avenatti allegedly scammed—and they include cases The Daily Beast has previously reported on, from a disabled man and a YouTube beauty mogul to a client who has accused Avenatti of running his business like a “Ponzi Scheme.” Client 1
In January 2015, Avenatti negotiated a $4 million settlement on behalf of “Client 1,” Geoffrey Johnson, a paraplegic man who sued Los Angeles County over his emotional and physical injuries from a stay in jail.
Johnson’s story is tragic. According to his now-settled lawsuit, Los Angeles police encountered him at 6:30 a.m. on April 24, 2011, when he was “completely naked, praying in the middle of the street outside his apartment building.”
The lawsuit alleges Johnson was suicidal when transported to a local hospital. His intake form, according to the civil suit, said he “believed that the only way to escape the plot of others to kill him was to commit suicide.”
Johnson would be transferred from hospital to jail cell, after he allegedly lunged at a doctor. He was taken to the Twin Towers Correctional Facility and placed in a cell with a violent prisoner, despite his father and sister warning the jail of his mental illness and suicidal thoughts.
After being released and then re-arrested, Johnson was kept in a cell where inmates were known to spit and throw feces. Johnson attempted to hang himself but landed on his head, resulting in a permanent disability from a spinal cord injury.
According to the indictment, Avenatti “falsely represented to Client 1 that the settlement agreement had to remain confidential,” and that Los Angeles County couldn’t pay the $4 million in one lump sum. Avenatti also allegedly said the county needed to approve a Special Needs Trust for Johnson before he could receive the funds.
Yet Avenatti received millions from the county and failed to disclose the payment to Johnson, prosecutors allege.
From Jan. 26, 2015 to March 30, 2015, Avenatti transferred $3.12 million of Johnson’s money to an Eagan Avenatti account, before transferring “substantial portions” to an account for his law firm Avenatti & Associates, then to other bank accounts controlled by Avenatti, including his personal bank account and accounts associated with “GB Auto.”
By July 6, 2015, the indictment states, Avenatti “had drained all of the settlement proceeds” out of Johnson’s client-trust account, using much of it to pay his own personal expenses.
Avenatti then made 69 payments of $1,000 to $1,900—totaling at least $124,000—to Johnson from July 2015 to March 2019, prosecutors say. The lawyer also paid assisted living facilities for Johnson’s rent, and “falsely represented” to Johnson that these payments were “advances” on the settlement owed to him.
In 2017, Johnson told Avenatti he wanted to purchase his own residence, and Avenatti allegedly agreed to find him a real estate broker.
According to prosecutors, Avenatti promised Johnson he’d received the settlement proceeds to buy a house, but after Johnson was in escrow on the purchase, Avenatti falsely informed him there was no money, because the county still hadn’t approved the Special Needs Trust.
Avenatti also caused Johnson to lose his Social Security benefits, prosecutors say.
In November 2018, Avenatti informed Johnson he would help him provide documentation to the Social Security Administration, which was evaluating Johnson’s eligibility for Supplemental Security Income benefits.
“Knowing full well that the requested information could lead to inquiries that could reveal that defendant Avenatti had embezzled [Johnson’s] portion of the settlement proceeds, defendant Avenatti failed to provide the requested information to SSA, which resulted in [Johnson’s] SSI benefits being discontinued” in February 2019, the indictment alleges.
Last month, facing questions over Johnson’s settlement at a judgment-debtor exam, Avenatti falsely told Johnson that the county had finally approved the Special Needs Trust and Johnson would receive his settlement.
Avenatti then had Johnson sign a document claiming he was “satisfied” with Avenatti’s representation of him. Avenatti claimed the signature “was necessary to effectuate the settlement agreement,” the indictment states. Client 2
Avenatti negotiated a settlement for the unidentified “Client 2” on Jan. 7, 2017, with “Individual 1” agreeing to make an initial payment of $2.75 million by Jan. 28. An additional payment of $250,000 was due Nov. 1, 2020 under the agreement.
Prosecutors say Avenatti, who was owed 33 percent of the total $3 million, didn’t provide a copy of the settlement agreement to the client.
Instead, Avenatti falsely represented that “Individual 1” would make an initial lump-sum payment that would go to Eagan Avenatti’s fees. The individual would then make 96 monthly payments over the next eight years, Avenatti allegedly told his client.
Still, Avenatti allegedly concealed the $2.75 million settlement, and transferred $2.5 million of it to the attorney-client trust account for another law firm. The same day, prosecutors allege, Avenatti had this law firm transfer the money to Honda Aircraft Company, LLC, so Avenatti could purchase a private jet through his company, Passport 420. (The remaining $250,000 was transferred from an EA account to an A&A account.)
To appease the client, Avenatti made 11 payments totaling $194,000 to the client from March 2017 to June 2018, the indictment states.
After that, Avenatti stopped paying the client, claiming Individual 1 was not complying with the settlement agreement.
On March 24, 2019, the client met Avenatti at his Los Angeles residence, where Avenatti claimed the client would soon receive a payment to make up for the missed monthly payments—monthly payments to which Individual 1 never agreed. Client 3
In December 2017, Avenatti negotiated a $1.6 million settlement on behalf of a client, which appears to be Gregory Barela, who previously accused Avenatti of stealing his payout and running his firm like a “Ponzi scheme.”
In May 2015, Barela filed a lawsuit against a Colorado-based company over an intellectual property dispute. The civil complaint said Barela was “the inventor of a product which can be summarized as a paving system for paving or flooring.”
Under the settlement agreement, Barela was owed $1.6 million by January 10, 2018, followed by three payments of $100,000 by Jan. 10 of 2019, 2020, and 2021, according to the indictment. Avenatti was owed $760,000 in attorney’s fees, or 40 percent of the total $1.9 million payout.
During a Dec. 28, 2017 meeting at Eagan Avenatti’s offices, Avenatti gave Barela an “altered copy” of the settlement, which forged a new payment deadline of March 10, 2018.
Meanwhile, Avenatti pocketed Barela’s money and used $1.59 million of it to pay his own expenses related to his coffee company, Global Baristas, prosecutors say.
From March 2018 through November 2018, court papers allege, Avenatti lied to Barela, saying the company hadn’t paid the settlement. Avenatti claimed he was working on obtaining the money Barela was owed.
In April 2018, Avenatti began providing Barela multiple payments totaling $130,000—calling them “advances” on the unpaid $1.6 million settlement. Client 4 and 5
In September 2017, Avenatti negotiated a “Common Stock Repurchase Agreement” with a company on behalf of Client 4 and Client 5. Based on the payment deadlines and figures listed in the indictment, these clients appear to be famous beauty vlogger Michelle Phan and a business associate, Long Tran.
As The Daily Beast reported , Phan launched her own makeup brand, EM Cosmetics, in 2013. Four years later, she announced she was leaving Ipsy, a beauty subscription service she co-founded, and that she’d acquire EM from the company.
According to prosecutors, an unnamed company agreed to repurchase Phan’s shares for about $27.47 million, followed by additional shares for about $8.14 million. The total repurchase amount was about $35.62 million, court papers state.
On Sept. 18, 2017, the company wired $27.41 million to Avenatti’s client-trust account. About $2.79 million was designated for Avenatti’s attorney’s fees, which was 7.5 percent of the total payout.
Yet in March 2018, Avenatti withheld Phan’s $8.14 million payment.
Between March 15, 2018 and May 4, 2018, Avenatti used about $4 million of Phan’s money for his own purposes—including using $2.82 million to pay his debts to the Internal Revenue Service. The feds claim Avenatti also transferred the money to bank accounts associated with his other companies: Global Baristas, Avenatti & Associates and Passport 420.
And to prevent Johnson from discovering that Avenatti embezzled his $4 million payment from Los Angeles County, Avenatti used Phan’s money to provide Johnson with about $1,900, prosecutors say. Avenatti also used Phan’s settlement to pay Client 2 about $34,000, the indictment alleges.
From March to May 2018, Avenatti allegedly failed to disclose to Phan and Tran that he’d used about $4 million of Phan’s money for his own purposes. He told them he’d give them their money at a later date and that to do so, he needed to visit the bank to fill out paperwork for wire transfers.
On May 4, 2018, Avenatti paid Phan $4 million and $146,288, authorities say. But Avenatti allegedly failed to transfer the remainder of the $8.14 million to Phan.
From May 4 to June 4, 2018, Avenatti and another unidentified attorney told Phan and Tran that the entire $8.14 million had already been transferred to Phan in three separate wire transfers. According to the indictment, Avenatti falsely presented a wire transfer document document that supposedly showed a second $4 million wire transfer to Phan.
Instead, Avenatti had already used the remaining $4 million for his own purposes, prosecutors say, and the wire transfer document he showed Phan related to the first wire transfer she already received on May 4, 2018.
After Avenatti’s arrest last month, Phan posted on Twitter: “When karma finally comes through. You never disappoint.” She followed up with, “I’m so grateful.”"
How NASA Got Scott Kelly's Blood Back to Earth for Twins Study,www.thedailybeast.com,Victoria.Albert@thedailybeast.com (Victoria Albert) tanya.basu@thedailybeast.com (Tanya Basu),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/nasa-twins-study-how-they-got-scott-kellys-blood-back-to-earth-4,"exclusive MAXIM ZMEYEV
Francine Garrett-Bakelman still remembers the day that she held, quite possibly, the most valuable vial of blood of her career. It was March 3, 2016, the day that astronaut Scott Kelly was set to return back to Earth after nearly a year on the International Space Station.
Garrett-Bakelman, now a physician-scientist at the University of Virginia, was handed Kelly’s blood samples soon after he touched down to Earth at Johnson Space Center in Houston. All she could think about was not dropping them.
“It was just a unique situation of handling space-bound material and having the responsibility to make sure the protocol goes well,” she said.
“You only get one shot. It was really stressful.”
The samples were part of NASA’s landmark Twins Study , to be published Friday in the journal Science . While Scott Kelly floated 254 miles above on the ISS, his identical twin brother Mark was down on Earth—allowing scientists a unique opportunity to compare the twins’ biological data.
“[Scott made a] tremendous commitment to science, and to our country,” Mark said on a conference call announcing the paper’s results, “and a tremendous act of public service.”
“I got all the glory, and you got a lot of work,” Scott jokingly responded.
The report has good news for aspiring space travelers: Long-term space travel—the kind that would be required for missions to Mars or the many planets beyond—may not be harmful for humans.
Although 559 people have visited space, there have only been eight missions longer than 300 days—and the Kellys are the first pair of twins to undergo a space study. “You only get one shot. It was really stressful.” — Francine Garrett-Bakelman, lead author
Ten research teams collected data on the Kellys from samples of their stool, urine, and blood—providing information about everything from the contents of their gut microbiome to the stability of their DNA—for 25 months before, during, and after the ISS mission. While Scott was in space, some of his samples were shot back to Earth on a carrier rocket, while others were preserved for his return.
The study was a first in figuring out how to preserve and send blood back to Earth. For that, the team recruited Garrett-Bakelman, a junior faculty member in 2014 at Cornell Medical School studying a blood cancer, acute myeloid leukemia. That might not seem like anything related to space, but Garrett-Bakelman she had a valuable skill: processing blood and analyzing genetic expression in samples—exactly what the experiment with the Kelly twins would require.
“It was totally surreal, a dream come true,” Garrett-Bakelman said. THE TELOMERE MYSTERY
The report classified 10 biological differences between the twins into low-, medium-, and high-risk categories, depending on the severity of the damage and how long it persisted after Scott came back to Earth.
The majority of Scott’s biomarkers, including his reduced body mass and microbiome composition, quickly returned to normal.
But Garrett-Bakelman and her colleagues noticed something interesting in the telomeres, the caps on our DNA that protect it from damage. On Earth, the longer the telomere, the better a person’s health—because as we age, those telomeres shrink, leaving DNA more susceptible to harm.
Scott Kelly’s telomeres, however, got longer . Even stranger, when Scott Kelly returned to Earth, his telomeres bounced back to their shorter length over time.
Why that happened is a mystery. “It’s one person, and it’s hard to make a conclusion,” Garrett-Bakelman said.
Although average telomere length returned to normal six months after the trip ended, Scott was left fewer telomeres—which could pose a risk for cardiovascular disease and some types of cancer. “Given that the majority of the biological and human health variables remained stable, or returned to baseline, after a 340-day space mission, these data suggest that human health can be mostly sustained over this duration of spaceflight.” — NASA
Other high-risk changes included a series of ocular symptoms known as spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), cognitive decline, and thickening of the carotid intima-media, a section of an artery wall that NASA’s Stuart Lee described on a conference call ahead of the paper’s release as a “predictor of the 10-year cardiovascular disease risk.”
Despite these findings, the report is optimistic about the future of long-term space travel.
“Given that the majority of the biological and human health variables remained stable, or returned to baseline, after a 340-day space mission, these data suggest that human health can be mostly sustained over this duration of spaceflight,” the report said.
Garrett-Bakelman said that Scott Kelly’s overall health stability is crucial information. “This is really important because it could not have been the case [that his health remained the same],” she said. “It could have been something completely different. Our human body is more adaptable, and living on Earth could be just one interpretation of it. Another interpretation is that he [Scott Kelly] was in the International Space Station and in the confines of the magnetic field of the Earth. Maybe beyond that the story is different.
“But it’s reassuring that most of the things we saw were in the range of what we expected.” 'This is a study of one'
The authors acknowledge that this study has an incredibly small sample size—and that even though the Kellys are identical twins, it’s impossible to attribute every change in Scott as a consequence of his time in space. Mark, for example, got to spend his year playing golf and drinking alcohol, while Scott was confined on a space station where drinking is prohibited.
The International Space Station also poses different risks than, say, Mars, where the radiation is much greater.
“This is a study of one,” Garrett-Bakelman emphasized. Also, “this only speaks to the experience of one Caucasian male. But what if the person is a woman? What if the person is Asian or African-American? What if we don’t know the person’s background? How might that influence their bodies?”
Nevertheless, Garrett-Bakelman said this was a perfect study to kick off our understanding of humans in space because the Kellys are twins.
“The reference of having a twin is very advantageous, so we can eliminate any influence genetics can have on the results,” she said. “From that perspective, it was a great study, the best one to start with actually.” “What if the person is a woman? What if the person is Asian or African-American? What if we don’t know the person’s background? How might that influence their bodies?” — Francine Garrett-Bakelman, lead author
Outside experts caution, however, that it’s impossible to definitively know that the observed differences between the brothers can be attributed to space travel alone.
“Attributing the changes to Scott’s time in space is nuanced,” Chirag Patel and Chirag Lakhani , co-authors on the largest twins study to date , via email. While the Kellys are identical twins, they added, many of the measured biomarkers could also have been influenced by environmental conditions they were exposed to individually before the study began.
“Replicating the findings in other twins will be necessary to conclude whether these findings are in fact due to their time in space or other individual differences,” they added.
We haven’t heard the last of the Kellys. “Right now, this is the initial interpretation and analysis of our data,” Garrett-Bakelman said. “I would anticipate that in the next couple of months or years, there will be additional reports coming out.”
“If you guys ever need me for more science, don’t hesitate to ask,” Mark said on the call. READ THIS LIST"

Welcome to Pay Dirt—exclusive reporting and research from The Daily Beast’s Lachlan Markay on corruption, campaign finance, and influence-peddling in the nation’s capital. For Beast Inside members only.
A handful of corporate front groups have sprung up since last year to do political battle over proposals to prop up Pennsylvania’s struggling nuclear energy industry. Leading the fight against those proposals is the state’s natural gas industry, and PAY DIRT has exclusively obtained their playbook for doing so.
The industry's leading advocacy outfit, the American Petroleum Institute, is organizing opposition to pro-nuclear legislation in Harrisburg through an initiative called No Nuclear Bailouts. API has paid for social media ads and mail pieces hammering House Bill 11, which would include nuclear in the portfolio of “alternative energy” sources that count towards utilities’ requirements for carbon-free power sources.

"Jeff Bezos Has No Interest In Reading the National Enquirer, Let Alone Buying It: Source",www.thedailybeast.com,Lachlan.Markay@thedailybeast.com (Lachlan Markay),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/jeff-bezos-and-the-national-enquirer-has-no-interest-in-reading-it-let-alone-buying-it-source-says,"exclusive Alex Wong
Jeff Bezos is not considering a purchase of the gossip tabloid that exposed the sordid details of his high-profile affair.
A friend of Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon and the owner of the Washington Post, says he has no interest in buying the National Enquirer after its parent company, American Media Inc. (AMI), announced it is exploring a sale of the tabloid this week.
“No way he’d be interested in having anything to do with The Enquirer, not as owner, not even as reader,” the friend told The Daily Beast on Thursday.
Bezos has accused AMI and two of its top executives, David Pecker and Dylan Howard, of attempting to extort him through threats to release lude photos of Bezos and his mistress, Los Angeles news personality Lauren Sanchez.
The threats came after Gavin de Becker, Bezos’ personal security consultant, began probing the political motivations behind the Enquirer decision to publish elicit texts between Bezos and Sanchez that had been leaked to the tabloid by Sanchez’s brother Michael.
In a column for The Daily Beast last week, de Becker also suggested that the government of Saudi Arabia—which has attacked Bezos publicly over the Post’s reporting on Saudi complicity in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi—may have been also obtained Bezos’ private communications. AMI maintains that Sanchez was its only source for the Bezos story.
AMI insisted in a statement on Wednesday that the potential sale of the Enquirer is the result of a “strategic operational review” that began last August. But the Post, which first broke the news that the tabloid could be offloaded, reported that the hedge fund manager whose firm owns AMI was “disgusted” with the Enquirer’s reporting tactics involving the Bezos story.
The tabloid’s tactics in general have come under intense scrutiny since Pecker and Howard admitted to using the Enquirer to make hush money payments to one of President Donald Trump’s alleged mistresses, porn star Stormy Daniels. AMI admitted last year that they bought the rights to Daniels’ story weeks before the 2016 presidential election in order to prevent the story from getting out in public, a practice known as “catch and kill.”
Federal prosecutors are set to meet with Bezos to discuss his extortion allegations against AMI. If prosecutors find reason to believe that AMI or its executives committed a crime, it could imperil the non-prosecution agreement they reached in the Daniels case, which spared them from charges of campaign finance law violations.
As scandal engulfed AMI, its business hit dire financial straits, racking up tens of millions of dollars per year in losses. A sale of the Enquirer could help stem those losses.

"Feds Charge Greg Craig, Former Obama Lawyer Tied to Manafort Ukraine Report",www.thedailybeast.com,adam.rawnsley@thedailybeast.com (Adam Rawnsley),04-11-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/feds-charge-greg-craig-former-obama-lawyer-tied-to-manafort-ukraine-report,"Feds Charge Greg Craig, Former Obama Lawyer Tied to Manafort Ukraine Report He’s a former White House counsel and Skadden Arps partner. 04.11.19 2:39 PM ET Mark Wilson/Getty
Federal prosecutors have charged President Obama’s former White House counsel with making false statements in connection with his role in disseminating a report commissioned by Paul Manafort.
Prosecutors allege that as an attorney in private practice, Greg Craig lied to officials at the Foreign Agents Registration Act unit after the Justice Department launched an investigation into Paul Manafort’s illegal lobbying on behalf of his pro-Russian clients in Ukraine. The charges, spurred by a referral from then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office, mark the first time the Russia investigation has led to a criminal complaint against a prominent former Democratic official.
Craig was a partner at Skadden Arps in 2012 when Manafort arranged for the firm to write a report about his client, former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, and the prosecution of Yanukovych’s former political rival, Yulia Tymoshenko.
Skadden reached a settlement with the Justice Department in January 2019 over its work with the Ukrainian government. As part of the agreement, the firm admitted that “a partner then at Skadden made false and misleading statements to the FARA Unit, which led it to conclude in 2013 that the firm was not obligated to register under FARA.” Under the deal, Skadden Arps agreed to register as a foreign agent and pay $4.6 million to the U.S. Treasury—the cost of its work on the report.
Prosecutors say Craig, who led a team of Skadden lawyers in writing the report, ventured into lobbying when he allegedly offered a copy of the report to a New York Times reporter, subsequently identified as David Sanger , and pitched him on a call with a lobbyist for Ukraine in advance of its release. Craig’s conversations with the Times reporter took place shortly after he met with Manafort and a public relations firm to discuss the media strategy for the report’s rollout, and prosecutors viewed his media calls as an outgrowth of the strategy meeting.
The indictment alleges that Craig began lying to officials at the Justice Department's FARA unit when they inquired about his contacts with the media shortly after the Times story ran. In a meeting with the chief of the FARA unit and in a subsequent letter, prosecutors say, Craig falsely claimed that his conversations with reporters “was done in response to requests from the media” and that the Ukrainian government neither knew of it nor directed it.
In particular, they claim that Craig failed to tell FARA officials he had “recommended and facilitated” the Ukrainian government's choice of a PR firm, had been briefed on the firm's strategy, and had recommended Sanger as a recipient for the report after he met with the PR firm and a lobbyist for Ukraine.
The indictment quotes a handful of emails from Craig meant to back up claims that his media outreach was allegedly an extension of a Ukrainian government-directed PR strategy and not a responsive correction of the record.
Craig allegedly emailed Sanger in December 2012 with the explanation that “the Ukrainians have determined that you should be given first look” at the report.
In an email sent shortly after Craig handed an advance copy of the report to the Times , the lawyer reported to a PR firm working for Ukraine that he told Sanger “it was his if he wanted to use it” and that “tomorrow is not too late for [another U.S. reporter] or for [another major U.S. newspaper].”
In discussions with prosecutors, Craig’s attorneys have doubled down on his claims about contacts with the media, according to CNN . They claim Craig only spoke with the Times in order to correct an unspecified mischaracterization of the report and that the prosecution represented an attempt to make the Russia investigation and its spin-off prosecutions, which have primarily targeted Republicans, seem less partisan.
The Skadden report featured prominently in court documents filed in Manafort’s Washington, D.C., lobbying case. The special counsel’s office alleged that Manafort’s choice of “the lead attorney at Skadden was made with the United States lobbying effort in mind"" and that the report Craig spearheaded was “misleading and used to justify the political prosecution and jailing of a political opponent.” Skadden earned $4.6 million for the report, paid through Manafort’s offshore accounts in Cyprus , but the Ukrainian government publicly claimed that the work cost only $12,000.
Craig resigned from Skadden in April 2018, shortly after attorney Alexander Van Der Zwaan pleaded guilty to lying to the special counsel’s office about his work on the report. Van Der Zwaan, whom Skadden fired in 2017, destroyed emails requested by the special counsel and lied about talking points he passed to Manafort aide Rick Gates and an advance copy of the report he slipped to a public relations firm. He served a 30-day prison sentence after pleading guilty and agreeing to cooperate with Mueller’s office.
Prosecutors said that the Skadden report was one part of a sprawling illegal lobbying campaign that enlisted other Washington heavyweights, Mercury Public Affairs and the Podesta Group, to sell Washington on Yanukovych’s government. The special counsel’s office alleged that Manafort used an obscure think tank in Brussels as a cut-out to allow Mercury and the Podesta Group to lobby for the Ukrainian government without registering as foreign agents.Mercury subsequently registered with the Justice Department for its Ukraine work but the Podesta Group fared worse. Its founder, Tony Podesta, left the firm shortly after Mueller indicted Manafort in October 2017, and the firm closed seven months later.
The charges against Craig are another sign that the Russia investigation has led to increased vigilance in enforcing foreign lobbying rules by the Justice Department. The department announced in March that Brandon Van Grack , a special counsel’s office prosecutor who worked on Manafort’s Virginia tax and bank fraud trial, would take over as the head of the Foreign Agents Registration Act unit.

Former NFL player Cierre Wood has been charged with murder in connection with the death of his girlfriend’s 5-year-old daughter, Las Vegas police confirmed to The Daily Beast.
Wood, a 28-year-old former Notre Dame and NFL running back, was initially arrested Tuesday night along with his girlfriend, 25-year-old Amy Taylor, on first-degree child abuse and neglect charges, police said. Authorities arrested the couple at Summerlin Hospital, where the toddler died around 7:30 p.m. She was brought in with bruises on her body, KSNV reported .
Wood and Taylor each posted $5,000 bail at Clark County Detention Center and were released, according to jail records. But the football player was rebooked Thursday on an additional first-degree murder charge. He’s currently being held on bail, police said.
“The investigation is ongoing,” a spokesperson for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said, confirming that the murder charge concerns Taylor’s 5-year-old daughter.
The Clark County Coroner’s Office confirmed to The Daily Beast that the child, La-Rayah Davis, died as a result of child abuse but did not provide the official cause of death.
Wood was drafted to the NFL in 2013 and spent most of his two-year career on practice squads for the Houston Texans, New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks, and Buffalo Bills. Before going pro, Woods played at Notre Dame for three years. He most recently played in the Canadian Football League, according to Yahoo Sports.

How WikiLeaks Assange Could Beat the U.S. and Stay Out of Jail,www.thedailybeast.com,msn.com,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-wikileaks-assange-could-beat-the-us-and-stay-out-of-jail,"TUG OF WAR How Assange Could Beat the U.S. and Stay Out of Jail It’s not enough to charge WikiLeaks’ founder—the feds have to convince the UK to hand him over. Experts say that’s easier said than done. 04.11.19 6:12 PM ET Jack Taylor/Getty
Julian Assange’s arrest in London begins what is likely to be a months or years-long battle in the UK courts as the 47-year-old WikiLeaks founder challenges U.S. extradition on any number of grounds, potentially including political persecution and health issues, according to lawyers who’ve worked both sides of similar cases.
On Thursday morning Ecuadorian officials ushered in UK police to haul Assange out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he’s been holed up for nearly seven years . Prosecutors in the U.S. immediately unsealed a year-old indictment charging Assange for allegedly conspiring with Chelsea Manning to crack a password during Manning’s 2010 leaks of classified documents to WikiLeaks.
The U.S. issued a provisional extradition warrant for Assange and has 65 days to follow up with a more detailed affidavit laying out its case. Prosecutors say Assange faces up to five years in prison on the indictment.
But Assange’s extradition is by no means a forgone conclusion. The UK courts are more skeptical of U.S. extradition requests than you might think, and Assange has several defenses open to him. One expert said that includes an argument that years of voluntary confinement has worked such violence to his mental health that shipment to the U.S. would be inhumane.
“He’s been in one room for the last seven years effectively on his own,” said Karen Todner, a UK human rights lawyer who’s won several high-profile extradition battles against the U.S. “I would think he would try to run some kind of mental health defense. I wouldn’t be surprised.”
Similar arguments, with the facts behind them, have swayed the UK courts in favor of some of Todner’s prior clients. Todner separately represented Gary McKinnon, a Scottish conspiracy buff who cracked Pentagon computers, and Laurie Love, who allegedly siphoned data from NASA and the Defense Department. The courts ultimately rejected extradition of both men, partly on a diagnosis that they suffered Asperger’s Syndrome. “Once he is extradited on specific charges, they are stuck with those.” — Former DOJ official Christopher Ott
With or without a medical condition, Assange could also make a serious argument that he would face inhumane conditions in U.S. custody. Manning, his alleged co-conspirator, would be Exhibit A in that argument. Manning spent nearly a year under solitary confinement during her Army court martial, locked in a cell for 23 hours a day and often forced to give up her prison jumpsuit at night. A military judge later ruled that Manning had been “illegally punished” and awarded her an extra 112 days off her sentence because of the mistreatment.
“You have high-security places Assange might be considered a candidate for,” Todner said, citing the ADX Florence supermax prison in Colorado that’s already been condemned by the European Court of Human Rights. “That was a key factor in the success of the Lauri Love case… Isolation is one of the issues. Access to daylight is an issue.”
Freedom of speech is not a defense in the UK courts, so Assage won’t be directly helped by his argument that WikiLeaks’ wholesale document dumps represents the protected speech of a journalist.
But he could argue that the indictment is politically motivated. “If you can show that the reason for extradition is political rather than just legal, that’s a defense,”Todner said. “I think that’s how you tie in the issue of free speech,” Todner said.
If there’s a downside to contesting the extradition, it’s that the U.S. is free to revise or extend the charges right up to the point Assange is shipped out. After that, the charges are carved in stone under a principal called “specialty protection.”
“Once he is extradited on specific charges, they are stuck with those,” former Justice Department prosecutor Christopher Ott told the Daily Beast. “There is a whole art to that process best typified by the multi-year effort to extradite El Chapo.”
That means that the U.S. can’t grab Assange on a hacking charge and then slam him with an espionage indictment when he lands in the states--any new charges would require the U.S. go through the UK courts all over again, even if he’s already in a U.S. jail.
“He has to face the charge that’s on the affidavit,” said Todner. “The charges that he faces in the U.S. have to be reflected in the affidavit. Anything else he’s charged with when he gets there would be a breach of specialty protection.”
If the U.S. violates that protection, it would damage international relations and harm American prospects in future extradition bids. And Assange would be able to challenge the new charges in U.S. court as an abuse of process, said Todner.
New York defense attorney Arkady Bukh, who specializes in defending extradited Russian hackers in the U.S., said prosecutors were smart to stick with a relatively simple hacking indictment, a charge with a direct equivalent in UK law.
“They’re just limiting it to conspiracy in order to successful pass the extradition process,” said Bukh. “I’ve seen that a lot with these requests. Some places, particularly the British, may refuse extradition if the penalty is too harsh.”
He says that regardless of who prevails in the UK courts, the extradition battle will leave at least one clear winner.
“On cases like that, they have thousands of billable hours, millions of pounds of salary,” Bukh said. “It’s a gold mine for the lawyer.” READ THIS LIST"
Decision to Go After Assange Came During Trump’s War on Leakers,www.thedailybeast.com,betsy.woodruff@thedailybeast.com (Betsy Woodruff) Erin.Banco@thedailybeast.com (Erin Banco),04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/decision-to-go-after-assange-came-during-trumps-war-on-leakers,"BEHIND THE SCENES Trump Justice Department Took New Look at Assange as Part of War on Leaks “There was renewed interest under the new administration to revisit issues of what qualifies as the media and to look back at the Assange case.” 04.11.19 8:04 PM ET Nicholas Kamm/Getty
The decision to prosecute WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange played out against the backdrop of President Donald Trump’s aggressive campaign to ferret out insiders leaking to the media.
First Amendment advocates are enraged by the indictment and say it shows media protections are in jeopardy. A former top national security official told The Daily Beast the charges shouldn’t have triggered those concerns but did say the decision to go after Assange followed an administration push to re-examine “what qualifies as media.”
The indictment covers alleged crimes that occurred nearly a decade ago and that the Obama administration, after much debate, did not prosecute.
But Mary McCord, a career law-enforcement official who helmed the Justice Department’s National Security Division for the first four months of the Trump administration, said “there was renewed interest under the new administration to revisit issues of what qualifies as the media and to look back at the Assange case.”
“That’s not to say there was ever a lack of interest in Assange over the years, even under the previous administration,” McCord said. “There were evidentiary and policy issues that were at play previously, and probably continue to be at play—and reasonable minds can certainly differ about how decisions are made, both legal decisions in terms of statute, and policy decisions.”
McCord added that since the DOJ hasn’t charged Assange with publishing classified material—he was indicted for allegedly helping Chelsea Manning break a password to steal material from government computers—his case isn’t a window into the Trump administration’s view of press freedoms.
“This, to me, is no different than saying you don’t get a pass when you’re the media if you commit a bank robbery, you don’t get a pass when you’re in the media if you hack into computers or conspire to hack into computers,” she said.
Some press freedom advocates, however, said the indictment is troubling; Reporters Without Borders, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, and the ACLU all raised concerns about the move.
Assange is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, based on his alleged efforts in 2010 to help Manning obtain the classified material that he would later publish.
Following the first massive Wikileaks dump, Obama administration officials in various agencies worked to rectify the damage. Several foreign service officers who spoke to The Daily Beast said they were forced to comb through the documents to identify which documents could pose potential threats to informants.
“There was a general sense of worry. We worried that the leak would put lives in danger,” one former Obama administration official said. “We viewed it as a fire that had to be put out. We had to go through all the documents to identify any potential damage they could cause.”
Since that time, the U.S. has continued to gather intelligence on Assange and his relationship to the Russian government. While some agencies have pushed for the U.S. to go after Assange with vigor, others have cautioned that there was not enough evidence or that it was more important to gather counterintelligence information on Assange’s connection to Russia, according to former intelligence officials.
That debate faded under Trump.
In the first few months of his administration, a spate of high-profile classified leaks enraged the president. He tweeted that the FBI needed to find the leakers and criticized then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions for failing to find them.
Sessions tried to play ball. On Aug. 4, 2017, he held a press conference at Justice Department headquarters to tout newly energized efforts to hunt down government officials who share classified material with reporters, including the formation of a new team focused on that issue. A few months later, he told Congress that the number of open leak probes at DOJ had risen by 800 percent .
DOJ has brought charges in a number of cases. Reality Winner, an NSA intelligence specialist who shared information about Russian election interference with The Intercept , is serving a five-year prison sentence. A senior Treasury Department official was charged with leaking confidential material to BuzzFeed. And in February, the DOJ charged an IRS employee with leaking information about ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen (who will soon begin a three-year prison sentence for unrelated crimes) to Michael Avenatti (who faces dozens of criminal counts for other, also unrelated alleged crimes ). A former staffer for the Senate intelligence committee, meanwhile, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with a reporter.
Obama administration officials who worked on the Assange case told The Daily Beast they focused on whether WikiLeaks could be defined as a traditional media organization. The fear, one former intelligence official said, was that the public would see any prosecution as an attack on the press.
Officials said the national security and intelligence communities had extensive, collaborative conversations about building a case against Assange for years. Many of those conversations, they said, touched on strategy and how to build the best case out of the Eastern District of Virginia.
During the first few years after the 2010 leak, U.S. law enforcement agencies probed the connection between Assange, Wikileaks and Russia. But, according to one, they initially struggled to find evidence of any links between him and the Kremlin.
""When I was in government I never saw any proof Assange was actively coordinating with Moscow,” said Michael Carpenter, who served in various national security roles in the Obama administration. “I think the understanding in the course of the Mueller investigation to understand how Russia intervened and partnered with Wikileaks… that understanding has shifted. I think that gets at this notion that this is not some journalistic organization unwittingly manipulated by the Russians. It coordinated to steal U.S. classified information and then to put it out in the public arena.”
Assange hasn’t been charged with acting as a foreign agent of a spy. But American officials have publicly called him one. A few months after Trump’s inauguration, Mike Pompeo—then the CIA director—said Wikileaks engaged in spying.
“It is time to call out WikiLeaks for what it really is: a non-state hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia,” he said.
Within Washington’s tight-knit national security community, former senior officials took different views of the Assange prosecution. Some said it was evidence of President Trump’s eagerness to target reporters and fight leakers. Others, however, cautioned against that, saying the Assange case isn’t political. The Assange case file, sources said, was held within a close circle of investigators and prosecutors, who would have maintained some degree of independence in building the case against him.
The timing of the filing of Assange’s sealed indictment also points to apolitical considerations; it was filed in the Eastern District of Virginia on March 6, 2018—just two days before the statute of limitations for the charge would have expired. READ THIS LIST"

White House officials reportedly suggested releasing migrant detainees in “sanctuary cities” as a means of mitigating the shortage of jail space and retaliating against political foes including Nancy Pelosi, The Washington Post reports. The plan was reportedly first brought up in a Nov. 16 email to immigration officials, in which the White House asked if it was possible to arrest members of the incoming migrant caravan and bus them “to small- and mid-sized sanctuary cities.” The request prompted concern, with Matthew Albence—reportedly slated to lead Immigrations and Customs Enforcement —writing that the plan could result in liability and “PR risks as well.” The White House reportedly asked again about the plan in February, as a way to “punish Democrats standing in the way of funding additional detention beds.” Albence reportedly circulated the plan seeking a “legal review,” which ultimately deemed the idea “inappropriate” and lacking a legal basis.
Officials from the Department of Homeland Security told the Post that senior adviser Stephen Miller was the official who discussed the plan with ICE, and then-acting ICE director Ronald Vitiello was not informed. President Trump recently rescinded Vitiello’s nomination to lead the agency, and Vitiello resigned earlier this week . Miller and Albence reportedly declined to comment. In a statement, the White House said the plan was “just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion.” "

After both Fox Business Network and Fox News were forced to issue on-air corrections Thursday morning after President Trump tweeted out a wildly inaccurate on-air graphic from Lou Dobbs Tonight showing his job approval rating is 55 percent, Fox Business host Lou Dobbs briefly addressed the matter Thursday evening.
During his program Wednesday night, Dobbs boasted about the president’s “soaring” and “robust” approval rating while airing a graphic from a Georgetown University poll . While Dobbs and the graphic were correct that the survey showed 58 percent of voters approved of the president’s handling of the economy, the poll actually found Trump’s job approval rating was 43 percent.
Georgetown University Politics director Mo Elleithee, a Fox News contributor, noted after Trump’s tweet that the 55-percent number Dobbs bragged about was actually the president’s unfavorability rating.
In an on-air segment Thursday morning, Fox Business Network reporter Blake Burman explained that the president’s tweet “featured a poll that was not entirely accurate” and the job approval number Dobbs touted on air “was those who have an unfavorable impression of President Trump.”
Fox News White House correspondent Kevin Corke also delivered an on-air correction, claiming there was a “typo in that graphic” while ignoring Dobbs’ remarks about the poll.
The pro-Trump host, who the president regularly patches into Oval Office meetings , appeared a bit chastened when he made his correction. Coming from break, Dobbs informed his audience he had some new poll numbers about the “radical Dimms” that he wanted to share with them, but first he “would like to repair something’ he got wrong the night before.
The Fox Business host quickly explained he had incorrectly reported “a Georgetown poll showed president had an overall approval rating of 55 percent—the number, in fact, is 43 percent.”
Dobbs, meanwhile, made sure to note that he did accurately reflect Trump’s approval rating on the economy in the poll.
As of this publication, the president’s tweet is still live , having racked up over 25,000 retweets and 100,000 likes. READ THIS LIST"

Bernie Sanders Hits One Million Donations in Less Than Two Months,www.thedailybeast.com,gideon.resnick@thedailybeast.com (Gideon Resnick),04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-hits-one-million-donations-in-less-than-two-months,"Bernie Sanders Hits 1 Million Donations in Less Than Two Months The Vermont senator took five months to hit the same milestone during his 2016 campaign. 04.12.19 11:35 AM ET Lucy Nicholson
Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-VT) 2020 campaign announced Friday that it has received one million donations since he launched his second presidential bid on Feb. 19.
“We did it! The grassroots movement has made 1 millions donations and counting to the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign,” wrote the senator’s official Twitter account, accompanied by a video touting the figures. “This is how we’re going to defeat Donald Trump and transform this country.”
While the campaign initially set a goal to reach the mark by the end of the first quarter, the one-million donation mile marker reflects the fundraising prowess of his operation and is another indicator that the Vermont senator is off to a faster start than his initial long-shot bid in the 2016 campaign.
His campaign also hit one million donations during that previous White House bid, but it took a full five months and was announced in Sept. 2015. The Sanders team has slashed that time in half for the 2020 race.
The one-million donation milestone had also been reached by both of President Barack Obama’s campaigns in 2008 and 2012.
Many of the 2020 Democratic contenders have revealed their fundraising totals for the first quarter prior to the filing deadline on Monday. So far, Sanders has led with a total of $18.2 raised. Trailing him in fundraising haul are Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) with $12 million, former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) with $9.4 million, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg with $7 million, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) with $6 million.
Prior to Friday’s announcement, Sanders’ team also said his total came from 525,000 contributors."
"ThinkProgress, a Powerful Democratic Media Arm, Calls Out Bernie Sanders for His Wealth",www.thedailybeast.com,sam.stein@thedailybeast.com (Sam Stein),04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/thinkprogress-a-powerful-media-arm-of-the-democratic-party-calls-out-bernie-sanders-for-his-wealth,"EAT THE RICH ThinkProgress, a Powerful Democratic Media Arm, Calls Out Bernie Sanders for His Wealth ‘The video illustrated how Sen. Sanders’ rhetoric has evolved,’ the site’s editor said, stressing that the video was simply observational, not adversarial. 04.12.19 11:26 AM ET The Asahi Shimbun/Getty
Inside Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign there has always been a sense of vulnerability about the attacks that would come against the senator over the wealth he has accumulated in office. After all, it becomes a bit tricky for a politician to rail against the perniciousness of income inequality when he himself becomes a member of the well-off, even if that fortune is simply due to a best-selling book.
But few expected that one of the first jabs would come from one of the most firmly Democratic-allied media outlets in the country.
This week, ThinkProgress, the news organ that is a project of, though editorially independent from, the progressive think tank Center for American Progress, put out a video noting that Sanders had stopped maligning millionaires—choosing, instead, to direct his ire at billionaires—when he became a millionaire himself.
The video accompanied a more nuanced article reflecting on the irony of Sanders dragging his feet in releasing his tax returns out of a desire to hide his wealth while President Trump refused to release tax returns in order to keep secret that he wasn’t as rich as he boasted. And in an email to The Daily Beast, Jodi Enda, the editor of ThinkProgress, defended the work as observational more than adversarial.
“ThinkProgress did not try to ‘go after’ Sen. Sanders—to use your words—and we will not ‘go after’ any other candidate,” Enda said. “We strive to be fair and to allow our readers and viewers to interpret the news for themselves. We are no different from other media in that regard.”
“The video illustrated how Sen. Sanders’ rhetoric has evolved,” Enda added.
A source at the Center for American Progress stressed that no one at the think tank had insight about, or input into, the video that ThinkProgress produced. But within the broader Democratic ecosystem, those editorial lines of demarcation were not exactly satisfying.
The video was viewed as an implicit warning that a portion of the party’s infrastructure would not simply be content to let Sanders coast through the primary (as if that was in doubt). And a number of progressives expressed dismay to The Daily Beast that one of the party’s more notable media arms had chosen to attack Sanders for his wealth well before any of his fellow primary candidates had. It did not go unnoticed that the video was being gleefully passed around by GOP operatives on Twitter.
What made the video all the more remarkable, however, was that Sanders’ campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, was not too long ago the editor of ThinkProgress. Shakir said he had no comment on the matter. But his relationship with the officials at CAP is complicated, after he began providing assistance to Sanders’ 2016 campaign—all of which was revealed during the dumping of stolen emails by Wikieaks during the late stages of that campaign.
But there was an obvious explanation for why that grated on CAP officials. They were largely supportive of Hillary Clinton, from the organizations founder (John Podesta) to its current president (Neera Tanden).
There is no Clinton in the race this go round. But, it appears, the skepticism towards Sanders persists."

“I’m not interested in feuding with the vice president,” Mayor Pete Buttigieg told Ellen DeGeneres on Friday’s episode of her daytime talk show.
And yet that’s more or less what he’s been doing now for months. Back in February, the openly gay 2020 presidential hopeful was on The Late Show when Stephen Colbert asked him how he was able to work with Mike Pence , who, as governor of Indiana, signed into law an anti-gay bill that allowed businesses to discriminate against LGBTQ people on the basis of “religious freedom.”
“If he were here, you would think he is a nice guy to your face, but he’s also just fanatical,” Buttigieg told Colbert at the time. And that includes the vice president’s belief that being gay is a choice. “And the thing about it is, if that was a choice, it was a choice that was made way above my pay grade,” the mayor added. “So what he doesn’t realize is that his quarrel is with my creator. My marriage has moved me closer to God and I wish he respected that.”
More recently, Buttigieg reiterated that point during a speech for the LGBTQ Victory Fund, prompting Pence to fire back by saying , “He said some things that are critical of my Christian faith and about me personally. And he knows better—he knows me.” The vice president went on to accuse Buttigieg of attacking him just to prove how “liberal” he is next to the rest of the 2020 field.
“I’m not critical of his faith,” Buttigieg told DeGeneres during this week’s interview. “I’m critical of bad policies. I don’t have a problem with religion, I’m religious too. I have a problem with religion being used as a justification to harm people.”
If Pence wanted to “clear this up,” Buttigieg said, “he could come out today and say that he’s changed his mind, that it shouldn’t be legal to discriminate against anybody in this country for who they are. That’s all.”"

This week: This week’s best new show. (Plus, sex!) How is Elisabeth Moss so good? Bracing for Beyoncé. The verdict on Lawyer Kim Kardashian. Stop with the prequels. God bless His Holiness, Jude Law. Special Is an Absolute Pleasure
I’ve never seen anything quite like Special . Of course, nothing’s ever existed that’s quite like Special , which blends sunny earnestness and heart with biting sarcasm and satire in a breezy way that might make it the most pleasant Netflix bingeing experience I’ve ever had.
The show is created by and stars Ryan O’Connell, a gay comedy writer in Los Angeles who has cerebral palsy. Loosely inspired by his own life, O’Connell plays Ryan as someone eager to rewrite his identity. He’s hit by a car, and when his new coworkers assume that’s the reason he walks with a limp, he doesn’t correct them and tell them he has CP. He just goes with it, seizing his newfound confidence to explore his sexuality in ways he had always been too self-conscious to before.
There are so many reasons to love this show. It’s important, of course, but it undercuts any pretentiousness that might burden it with a lacerating wit and self-effacing attitude towards disability. There are more laugh lines in the first three minutes than most comedies have in an entire episode. The skewering of millennial culture and media is painfully accurate. (Ryan is an intern at a website called Eggwoke, which recently pivoted to publishing confessional essays that appeal to “basics,” like “50 Ways to Hate Myself.”)
There’s a fascinating storyline exploring Ryan and his mother’s codependence, in which Jessica Hecht delivers a monologue about the virtues of The Macaroni Grill that I nearly applauded after. All of that, and no episode runs more than 15 minutes. Glory be!
But the thing about the show I can’t stop thinking about is how it handles its big sex scene. Because it bears repeating: I’ve never seen anything quite like it.
Ryan hires a sex worker to lose his virginity to, and the way it’s filmed, frankly, shocked me. It was so realistic in a way no TV show has ever been about gay sex. My Google Doc of notes from that part of the series just reads “holy shit!” over and over again for about half a page.
It’s not graphic or gratuitous, but frank and sensitive. There’s nothing salacious or editorially sexy about it in the way that so many TV shows filter sex. It shows the mechanics, the discomfort, and mutual respect involved in two men having sex—something that is never shown on screen and certainly not in a TV show that’s meant to be heartwarming and, like we said before, important. Special proves you can do all of that. Plus, it’s really damn funny. Elisabeth Moss Gives the Performance of the Year (So Far) in 'Her Smell'
It is April 12, which means that, by my count, there are 317 days between now and the 2020 Oscars for me to not shut the hell up about how good Elisabeth Moss is in Her Smell , how she should be nominated for Best Actress, and then bitching insufferably about how she was robbed when she inevitably isn’t because the Academy is dumb.
The movie, with a title as idiotic as Moss is good in it, centers on Becky Something, the lead singer of an all-girl rock band with petulance and behavioral issues that would make Courtney Love seem like a saint. (The name, according to writer-director Alex Ross-Perry, is inspired by the titles of riot grrl zines from the ’90s.) The sun is setting on Becky’s incendiary career, and she’s hell-bent on incinerating everything in its path on the way down.
Moss turns Becky into the human equivalent of streaked mascara, delivering a carnal, guttural, snotty, sweat- and blood-soaked performance. She’s unhinged, so palpably out of control you’re uneasy in your seat just watching, like you’re witnessing a person mid-exorcism. It’s a towering performance, completely unrecognizable from Moss’ other work in The Handmaid’s Tale, Mad Men , or even Us , in which we first see glimpses of the terrifying wild eyes that are on display here.
She channels her entire body, soul, and all the power of Xenu into this performance. Girl is on a roll, cementing her status as one of the best actresses working today. All other thetans bow down. (On that subject, make sure to read my colleague Marlow Stern’s interview with Moss about the film... and Scientology.) Beyoncé Homecoming Is Already Iconic (And It Hasn’t Premiered Yet)
Beychella—Beyoncé’s iconic performance at the Coachella Music Festival —was the pop culture event of 2018. Now our Lord and Beyvior is ensuring that it’s the pop culture event of 2019, too.
By this time next week, a documentary about the making of the superstar’s jaw-dropping Coachella set, which was an homage to historically black colleges and universities, will have premiered on Netflix. Called Homecoming —this rude Julia Roberts erasure —the film will include behind-the-scenes footage in addition to performance clips. It will be directed by Beyoncé herself.
This is obviously all very exciting, but it remains to be seen how Homecoming will stack up against my single favorite piece of filmmaking, Beyoncé: Life Is But a Dream : a documentary about the artistic genius and unrivaled cultural significance of Beyoncé, directed by Beyoncé, the theme of which was that God sent Beyoncé here as a gift to us, as told by Beyoncé. Where is the lie? Want this in your inbox? Subscribe here. Kim Kardashian West, Esq.
Kim Kardashian is on the cover of Vogue , and the accompanying profile delivers what may be the single greatest plot twist in celebrity puff piece history: “Kim Kardashian West is studying to become a lawyer.”
According to the magazine , she is studying to take the California bar exam in 2022, through a state loophole that allows aspiring lawyers to take the bar without going to law school if they apprentice with a practicing lawyer or judge. [Insert “wonder if she reached out to Lori Loughlin for some study tips!” joke.]
It’s a move that many are dismissing and scoffing at, which is perhaps the stalest and most unoriginal reaction to the Kardashians someone can have today. (Ridiculing their success was lame five years ago.) But it’s also a move that isn’t as far-fetched as you might think... and dare I say, inspiring?
She was apparently inspired by her time at the White House, pleading for the release of Alice May Johnson, a 63-year-old woman who had been incarcerated for two decades on a nonviolent drug charge. Sitting in a room surrounded by legal experts, activists, and the president of the United States, she was inspired to learn and know more, so that her activism could be more effective.
The Elle Woods/ Legally Blonde comparisons are inevitable, except that the inspiration for Kardashian’s pursuit of a law degree is certainly more noble. Elle wanted to win back her boyfriend. Kim Kardashian West wants to reform the prison system and save human lives. Who gives a shit how the girl became famous? She’s doing important things with her fame. The 'Grease' Prequel No One Wants
Grease is an absolutely ridiculous film that I’m not sure is any good, and yet I love it dearly, think it’s perfect, and for the love of 33-year-old Stockard Channing playing a high school senior, wish that Hollywood would stop taking T-bird-sized dumps on its legacy.
It was announced this week that a prequel to the film is in the works, inspired by the vacation fling Sandy and Danny had that’s alluded to in “Summer Loving,” the song in which Sandy tells the Pink Ladies that she had a chaste time with a stand-up guy at the beach and Danny suggests she couldn’t resist fucking him the second she saw him. (This movie is problematic in so many ways.)
Anyway, the movie will be called Summer Loving , and no thank you, I don’t want it. Tell me less, tell me less. The Only Photos You Need to See This Week
I’ve been in an uncharacteristically good mood this week. The temperature in New York finally climbed to about 50 degrees. I’m about to go on vacation. The calendar suggests it is finally an acceptable time of year to alternate between chugging iced coffee and rosé sans judgment. Oh, and these photos of Jude Law on the set of The New Pope have come into my life. Suddenly, I’ve found religion.
What to watch this week:
Little : It’s Marsai Martin’s world and we’re all just living in it.
Game of Thrones : So there’s this little show coming back this weekend…
Les Miserables : Did we need another version of this? No. But this one has Olivia Colman!
What to skip this week:
No Good Nick : I refuse to endorse another Netflix family sitcom until they release One Day at a Time from hostage status .
Hellboy : Heavens no.
Mary Magdalene: The movie was never going to top the paparazzi photo of Rooney Mara smoking a cigarette on a break while Joaquin Phoenix hangs from the cross."

What do you like to drink after a shift? “As boring an answer as it is, water. I crush ice water after work. We get so focused on the job and getting the night into a good rhythm I forget to stop and drink water most of the shift, so I’m always dehydrated after work. A cold beer isn’t a bad chaser.”
What is the all-time best dive bar jukebox song? ““Islands in the Stream” by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers.”
After all these years bartending and creating drinks, do you still enjoy going out to bars? “I absolutely love it. I still love the energy a good bar has, and I’m always excited to see what’s happening creatively.”
Name the first good drink you ever drank and where you had it. “A proper stirred Manhattan at a Del Frisco’s Steak House. I was young, maybe 22 or 23-years-old, the bartender asked me if I’d like it stirred or shaken, that question was a first for me. I went stirred and never looked back.”
What book on cocktails or spirits is your go-to resource? “ The PDT Cocktail Book by Jim Meehan . It’s a modern-day cocktail bar how-to from start to finish.”
What’s your favorite cocktail and food pairing? “A Negroni and a hard cheese, like Parmesan.”
What drink are you most proud of creating? “The Ligurian Sea. It’s basically a Cynar Negroni with an absinthe float. The float leads to it evolving in the glass and changing as you drink it. Starts out great and it just gets better as you go.”
Is there one person (dead or alive) you’d like to make a cocktail for? “Ina Garten.”
What’s your favorite shot-and-a-beer combination? “High Life and a Jameson.”
What is the one tool that you always make sure to pack when you’re traveling for business? “A pocket knife. It comes in handy more that you’d think behind a bar.”

Music’s Forgotten Genius: Alex Chilton of Big Star Was a Restless Human Jukebox,www.thedailybeast.com,malcolm.jones@thedailybeast.com (Malcolm Jones),04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/musics-forgotten-genius-alex-chilton-of-big-star-was-a-restless-human-jukebox,"CHANGELING Music’s Forgotten Genius: Alex Chilton of Big Star Was a Restless Human Jukebox The late Memphis native soaked up every kind of Southern music, but he didn’t quit there. A lover of punk and a master of jazz standards, he shows his range on two new albums. 04.12.19 4:43 AM ET Ebet Roberts/Getty
As a musician, Alex Chilton could do damn near everything. And that was his problem (one of them anyway). He never stood still, so it was hard even for his fans to keep him in focus. Oldies acts thrive because they keep doing the same things they did when they first got popular. Chilton wanted none of that. So, while he died tragically early, of a heart attack at 59, he had in his all-too-brief life packed the careers of several different musicians. If you’d asked the real Chilton to stand up, you’d have had an army on your hands.
Defined by the reductive taxonomy of the music business, he was a one-hit wonder. As the 16-year-old lead singer for the Box Tops, he charted #1 for the first and last time with “The Letter.”
According to music critics, a lot of other bands, and a small but passionate bunch of fans, he was one of the most talented and influential composers and performers in pop rock, a genre he’s often claimed to have invented as one of the leaders of Big Star. “He made records that in their various ways all showed you some side of him you hadn’t seen before.”
A band far more widely beloved today than when it was active in the early ’70s, Big Star was over and out in under five years. Now it’s a legacy band: its three albums continue to beguile musicians from Elliott Smith to Teenage Fanclub to the dB’s to…you get it. It’s like the old line about the first Velvet Underground album: it only sold like 7,500 copies when it came out, but everybody who bought a copy started a band. Anyway, by the time people began catching up with Big Star, Chilton was long gone. By the end of the same decade, he would be producing The Cramps’ first album. He never stayed still.
He made a living as a musician almost his whole life—it didn’t hurt when That ‘70s Show picked his song (but not the Big Star version ) “In the Street” for its theme song—but on the back half, he steered clear of the music business. “To sign with a record company where if I only sold a hundred thousand records, I’d be a failure, isn’t for me,” he said. Instead, he played gigs, sometimes with the reconstituted lineups of Big Star and the Box Tops, sometimes alone, and he made records that in their various ways all showed you some side of him you hadn’t seen before.
Bar None Records has graciously reissued a couple of albums (culled from existing albums and some EPs) of late-life Chilton that give some hint of his range. And there’s really not a bad patch in that range. You may prefer one of his phases over the others, but you can never say he didn’t know what he was doing. Even the punk-meets-Ernest Tubb chaos on Like Flies on Sherbert (yeah, I know it’s misspelled but apparently he didn’t), while it’s a tough sled here and there, is a knowing tough sled, as in “he knows what he’s doing even when ‘live in the studio, keeping it simple but not stupid, not knowing what comes next’ is the point.” As his friend and producer Jim Dickinson said, “Alex didn’t have any bad ideas.”
One of the new albums features Chilton mostly fusing R&B and pop and making it sound old and fresh all at once. And he had great taste and the talent to pull it off. I can’t think of another singer who could so credibly cover anyone from Lou Reed to Bobby Charles. The originals include “Guantanamerika” and the always hilarious “Dalai Lama.” But as much as I like From Memphis to New Orleans , which namechecks both of his principle addresses and his most dominant musical influences and which now reigns as my favorite party record, it’s Songs from Robin Hood Lane that has my heart.
This title, like the other one, refers to both a geographical place and a musical influence—the Chilton family’s Memphis address, where Alex up grew up listening to his father play jazz and where he learned the standards that appear here (he also borrowed heavily from trumpeter Chet Baker’s singing repertoire). Some of the songs come from an album cut with backing musicians, and others from an album where Chilton goes solo. I much prefer the solo songs, just Chilton and an acoustic guitar, because there’s more intimacy and because you get a great chance to hear what a terrific guitarist he was. I must have already played “My Baby Just Cares for Me” a hundred times. And as a bonus, you get his recording of “What Was.” Not an old standard exactly, it’s a sad but beguiling ballad written for The Late Show , the (if you’ve never seen it, stop right now and go find it) Art Carney and Lily Tomlin noir movie. I do wish the producers had used the acoustic version of “There Will Never Be Another You,” but you can’t have everything."
Was the ‘Game of Thrones’ Pilot Actually Any Good?,www.thedailybeast.com,kevin.fallon@thedailybeast.com (Kevin Fallon),04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/game-of-thrones-was-the-hbo-shows-pilot-actually-any-good,"A WINTER’S TALE Was the ‘Game of Thrones’ Pilot Actually Any Good? It seems like eons have passed since Game of Thrones’ unassuming debut on HBO in 2011. On the eve of the final season premiere, we revisit that first episode. Does it hold up? 04.12.19 4:41 AM ET The Hollywood Archive/Alamy
It’s been almost eight years to the day since we were first warned that “winter is coming.” I’ll be honest: I didn’t take the warning very seriously.
That’s because it’s been roughly seven years and six months, you see, since, exasperated by hearing about this Game of Thrones show that couldn’t sound less like anything I’d ever be interested in, I sought out one of those shoddy Megavideo pirated links from the days of yore—the internet in 2011—and finally watched the pilot. (Don’t tell the feds.)
Was it worth the myriad viruses I gave my laptop that night? I think so! The truth is, I don’t remember much about my reaction to it, or frankly much about it at all.
Over the next seven years, I’d pop in and out of the show—binge some episodes here, some more there—and eventually started to watch them live when my then-roommate and I decided we were adults and therefore were going to get HBO.

I’ve loved the show. I’ve been angry at it. I’ve marveled at its popularity, been annoyed by its fans, and angered by some of its problematic motifs. Mostly, I’ve been confused by it; turns out this is not a series to pop in and out of sporadically. But that hasn’t taken away my appreciation for it.
This is all a long-winded way of saying that, on the eve of the final season premiere , I thought an interesting experiment would be to revisit that pilot and see how it holds up. As objectively as possible, is this a show that would be well-reviewed today? Would it inspire the phenomenon it eventually grew to? We’re so enamored by the series now. But was that first hour really that good?
What shocked me is how emblematic that very first episode is of what the show would become, in all ways good and bad. I remember reviews at the time were largely positive, entranced by the scope of production, if slightly dismissive of the series as too niche and directed at a certain fantasy-fan demographic. (A survey of Metacritic corroborates that critical assessment, while a survey of my soul forces the admission that, yes, I too had that anti-fantasy bias.)
Perhaps the most impressive thing about that first 68 minutes—simpler times, when we thought that was a long running time—was the amount of confidence co-creators D.B. Weiss and David Benioff, who co-wrote the pilot, and Timothy Van Patten, who directed it, had in their ambitious vision and how a production of this magnitude and complexity would unfold. It blasts off as if out of a cannon.
It opens on a group of Night's Watchmen traversing a tunnel through the Wall. Not even 15 seconds in and the show’s swagger is on display: The shot is breathtaking. The scale is unreal, contrasting their bodies against the bare, white monolith in the blizzard.
They come upon the bodies of Wildlings that have been dismembered and impaled, body parts frozen in the snow. The show was gorgeous and gruesome from the start.
As they try to piece together what happened to the Wildlings, the White Walkers emerge, a jump-scare as if out of a classed-up creature feature. It’s a proper horror show start to the series, and as captivating an opener as any modern drama series has crafted.
The blunt violence arrives early, when Ned Stark (Sean Bean) beheads the Watchman who deserted his post to warn of the White Walkers. So too, comes the cumbersome exposition. We’re quick to meet dozens of characters and their relationships. Some are easy to decipher—the Stark children—others not so much. What is Jon Snow’s ( Kit Harrington ) place? And what of Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen)?
For all the virtues of Game of Thrones on display from the start, so too are its biggest pitfalls.
When we say there’s cumbersome exposition, we mean there’s a lot of it. Trying to imagine a time when these characters are all still new, it’s a lot to wrap your head around.
The king’s Hand died, and so the king is coming with his wife, Cersei ( Lena Headey ), and her two siblings ( Nikolaj Coster-Waldau ’s Jaime and Peter Dinklage ’s Tyrion) to ask Ned to be the new Hand. But it turns out the king’s Hand, Jon Arryn, may have been poisoned...and maybe it was the Lannisters...and maybe the king is at risk?
Then there are the Targaryens, Daenerys ( Emilia Clarke ) and Viserys (Harry Lloyd), who halfway around the world are making a play to return Viserys to the Iron Throne by marrying Daenerys off to Dothraki leader Khal Drogo ( Jason Momoa ) in exchange for his army. And just when your head stops spinning, you learn that Cersei and Jamie, who are twin siblings, are having sex with each other.
This doesn’t even get into the business of setting up Tyrion as a boozy, tortured cad, the introduction of Jorah (Iain Glen), the motives of Joffrey ( Jack Gleeson ), the complicated relationship between the Stark girls, or the fact that—and I can’t believe I forgot this—there is a scene in which Jon, Theon, and Richard Madden ’s Robert Stark stand around shirtless waiting to be shaven clean for a party. “For all the virtues of Game of Thrones on display from the start, so too are its biggest pitfalls.”
It’s a miracle that any of us were seduced by the show’s many attributes into following its storytelling.
What struck me about the pilot, however, is that things just happen. The moralizing and more existential discussions would come later. The recklessness with which the show rewarded or punished goodness and evil, which made it one of the most consistently shocking series on TV, hadn’t quite developed.
We’re just meeting characters, piecing together things about them based on tropes we’re already familiar with, and finishing all 68 minutes on an ellipsis, not yet entirely sure of the point.
Based on the timing of when it premiered, a few years after The Sopranos left HBO, and at a time when the network was still struggling to find its next big drama, you might have transposed the power struggle for the Iron Throne onto the machinations of a certain New Jersey mafia. (Benioff even once joked that the show’s tagline should be “The Sopranos in Middle-Earth.”)
While the style and the creative cojones to tell this tangled web of a story may still be praised if this was a new series today, there are certain elements that have not aged well. The show’s tendency to exploit naked women as set-dressing and, on the other hand, fetishize sexual violence for the sake of plot is on irritating display here.
The brothel scene that introduces Tyrion is one thing. That Daenerys is naked and fondled by her brother within five minutes of her entrance is another. By the end of the episode, she will have been raped on her wedding night, pushed down on all fours while crying.
It’s also uncomfortable to rewatch the scenes featuring Khal Drogo and the Dothraki, who are reduced to racist, problematic tropes about “savages.” The worst tendency of fantasy and genre storytelling is to assume that retrograde stereotypes and storytelling devices shouldn’t be elevated or evolved because of when or where a narrative takes place, for fear that doing so would no longer signal a certain thing to a viewer, or rob the story of verisimilitude. (It’s fantasy, people. That couldn’t be further from the truth.)
It’s also maybe aggravating to see all these scenes again because it’s so hard to remain objective about the show. As a TV critic, I’ve seen all the ways the popularity of Game of Thrones gave rise to a concerning increase in sexual exploitation, nudity-as-set-dressing, and the unnecessary usage of sexual violence against women as a narrative tool. This is not to say that there’s not a place for any of it, but it snowballed into a worrisome, damaging trend.
To that end, the episode ends in a truly wild way, a reminder of how cheeky the show was when it started and the sinister sense of humor it had. There’s a lot of lightheartedness to this pilot that I think dimmed down as the series went on.
Yes, the final sequence of the Game of Thrones pilot is a twin incest sex scene and then a 10-year-old boy pushed out a window for being a witness to it.
Of maybe everything that happens in the 68 minutes of that first episode, that may be the scene that changed television fundamentally afterwards: A dogged pursuit of the WTF moment. (The series would of course up the ante in that regard several episodes later when Ned Stark meets his fate.)
But to the question at hand. Was the Game of Thrones pilot actually any good? It’s one of the breeziest episodes of the series—even with all that scene setting—and, in my estimation should rank among the show’s best ever. But it wasn’t an easy sell. Only 2 million people watched that first episode when it aired. More than 16.5 million watched the season seven finale the night it aired.
What a humble—a word not often used with Game of Thrones —beginning.

Keith Olbermann: MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and Steve Kornacki ‘Washed Me Out’ of Their Past,www.thedailybeast.com,lloyd.grove@thedailybeast.com (Lloyd Grove),04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/keith-olbermann-msnbcs-rachel-maddow-and-steve-kornacki-washed-me-out-of-their-past,"FEUD Keith Olbermann: MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and Steve Kornacki ‘Washed Me Out’ of Their Past In a BBC podcast, former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann criticizes Rachel Maddow and Steve Kornacki for lack of gratitude, and boasts he once demanded $12 million from the network. exclusive Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily Beast/Getty
It has been more than eight years since quirky television personality Keith Olbermann , who played a key role in turning MSNBC into a liberal-leaning powerhouse with his righteously indignant on-camera delivery, angrily quit the cable network in the middle of his four-year, $30 million contract.
Nearly a decade of distance and perspective might be time enough for mellowing. Not for Olbermann, however. Judging by his comments trashing MSNBC anchors Rachel Maddow and Steve Kornacki to BBC presenter Ros Atkins , he’s still nursing grudges.
“The bottom line for me is I contributed to their success and I was correct in my assessment. If I have any animosity toward it, it is that many of them have washed me out of their past in order to make it look like I did not have any influence in getting them to where they are,” Olbermann complained to Atkins during almost 10 hours of conversation that Atkins recorded from early 2018 through October, and the BBC whittled down to a six-part podcast series titled Texting Keith Olbermann .
“Why do you think they did that?” Atkins asked Olbermann about the alleged ingrates.
“Well, that’s another aspect of what makes people successful in this business,” he replied. “If you acknowledge the degree to which you are beholden to others, you are somehow seen as weak. The Rachel Maddow story was that after I left, she was mad at me for leaving because it meant that she could not pass me in the ratings at MSNBC and prove better than her mentor.”
Maddow—whose current viewership at 9 p.m. (often over 3 million) far exceeds Olbermann’s from nine years ago—declined to comment.
However, she has publicly credited Olbermann for her career more than once. “I wouldn’t have this show without Keith directly nudging the network to give me a try,” she said on the air after Olbermann suddenly separated from MSNBC, where his primetime program Countdown had been Maddow’s lead-in.
It was a typically messy Olbermannic departure—much like a dozen other abrupt leave-takings from various broadcast and cable outlets in his colorful career—rife with backbiting and recrimination between the star anchor and his nominal bosses.
Olbermann’s comments about Kornacki, meanwhile, came while Atkins visited his Manhattan apartment one afternoon last July and the two of them were watching cable news programming on multiple screens.
“ The Lead with Jake Tapper is Mike Pompeo,” Olbermann narrated. “I haven’t checked but I believe he’s still secretary of state, but I haven’t looked in a few days. Over here is Closing Bell on CNBC. That’s business news people complimenting each other about how much money they’ve made.”
In due course Olbermann fixed on his target: “Here’s Steve Kornacki’s show. He’s one of the least grateful people. I started him in television. He was my backup guy at Current TV. He’d never done any TV and I was sort of bringing him along. And while he was doing that, he was negotiating with MSNBC. And now he has a show there.” “Let me find out that maybe you’re thinking of not working for me anymore rather than letting me read a press release from MSNBC that explains that you’ve been hired, rather than you’re not coming in to be on the show that night. That’s how he did that.”
“What kind of gratitude were you expecting?” Atkins wondered.
“Well, let me find out that maybe you’re thinking of not working for me anymore rather than letting me read a press release from MSNBC that explains that you’ve been hired, rather than you’re not coming in to be on the show that night. That’s how he did that.”
Kornacki likewise declined to comment. However, prior to appearing as an unpaid political analyst around a dozen times on Olbermann’s shortlived Current TV version of Countdown in the fall of 2011 and early 2012, Kornacki had cohosted a weekly political show on News 12 New Jersey for three years, and had been an on-air guest hundreds of times dating back at least nine years on local television and cable news, including practically every MSNBC show except—notably—Olbermann’s.
“If there’s one MSNBC person who cannot claim to have discovered Kornacki, it’s him,” said a knowledgeable media person. “If Kornacki ever worked for Olbermann, he owes him back pay, because he never got a cent.”
Olbermann—who, full disclosure, had complained to my bosses about my coverage of him in the New York Daily News more than a decade ago and named me as his “Worst Person in the World” on MSNBC—didn’t respond to a detailed email requesting comment.
These days, however, the 60-year-old Olbermann appears to be doing fine, having recently returned to an on-air berth at ESPN , the sports network he also helped make successful (and left five times before, bookending bridge-burning exits from former vice president Al Gore’s Current TV in 2012 and more recently GQ magazine, for which he made a series of 187 anti-Donald Trump videos titled “The Resistance with Keith Olbermann”).
As Texting Keith Olbermann suggests, he’s incredibly wealthy, owns a fabulous penthouse with breathtaking views of Central Park, and seems ecstatically happy living with several small dogs which he calls “the love of my life.”
The London-based Atkins, the host of the BBC’s 9 p.m. news program Outside Source , said in an interview that he got the idea for the podcast after a year of obsessive phone-texting with Olbermann—multiple times a day, every day, and late into the night—starting when the TV star declared himself a fan on Twitter in January.
“Thank god you’re back,” Olbermann tweeted when Atkins and his family—wife Sara, a lawyer, and their two daughters, Alice, 12, and Esther, 7—returned to London from a Christmas vacation and Atkins resumed doing his show.
“It was a very nice surprise,” the 44-year-old Atkins said upon learning that Olbermann—who is hardly known in the U.K. but was famous to Atkins as an “iconic American broadcaster”—had been subscribing to the BBC World Service as part of his cable package and was a regular Outside Source viewer.
The two exchanged friendly tweets and in short order shared their private cell phone numbers; immediately they began an intense texting relationship that evolved, Atkins believed, into a genuine friendship.
The podcast series also features Sara, Alice and Esther Atkins, who frequently show up to express varying degrees of mild alarm and bemusement at Atkins’ and Olbermann’s compulsive textual encounters, in which Olbermann sends his ESPN ratings numbers, photos of his pooches, photos of the view outside his penthouse window, and even photos of the oysters he’s about to swallow at the seafood restaurant down the block.
Lying in bed with Sara as midnight approaches, and his cell phone keeps flashing with new texts from Keith, Atkins asks if there’s anything she’d like him to ask.
“Is he aware of the time difference between New York and London, and is he aware you’re married to somebody?” she suggests. “Why is he your friend if you’ve never met him?...You don’t actually know whether they’re nice, do you?”
The series also has Olbermann musing on subjects ranging from his ability to make piles of money (he boasts that he once demanded $12 million from MSNBC and received $8 million), to his weekly death threats from non-fans, to his apparent incuriosity about others (“It goes without saying, I like talking about myself—my favorite subject”), to his preference for dogs over human beings (“I retreated to a dog-based world because it’s a better one”), to his deep dislike of U.S. cable news and especially CNN (“Between the topics on it and the presentation of it, I stand two chances each minute that I watch of having a coronary, just dying on the spot in a fury”).
Just before his New York trip, when Ros explains to daughter Esther that her father is friends with Olbermann even though they haven’t met, she demands, “Why is he your friend if you’ve never met him?...You don’t actually know whether they’re nice, do you?”
Indeed, in the first episode, Atkins notes during the podcast that Olbermann has a penchant for feuding, and tells him pointedly: “You have a reputation for falling out with people… Maybe I’ll say something that goes down badly and rubs you up the wrong way”—and prompts Olbermann to drop him like a rock.
In the end, predictably, that’s exactly what happened. When the producers and editors had molded Texting Keith Olbermann into a finished podcast series—but well before it was scheduled to be published—the BBC sent it to him as a courtesy.
Olbermann listened to it and, according to people familiar with his reaction, responded with what one described as “cyclone-force rage” and demanded that the BBC never post it. They finally did, a few weeks ago.
Why Olbermann was unhappy with it is unclear: He comes across in the series as extremely smart, entertaining, insightful, and yes, egomaniacal and deeply idiosyncratic.
But suddenly his texts to Atkins stopped.
“I’m sad about it,” Atkins said about the end of a beautiful friendship."
Seth Meyers Destroys GOP Rep. Thomas Massie Over John Kerry Disaster,www.thedailybeast.com,marlow.stern@thedailybeast.com (Marlow Stern),04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/seth-meyers-destroys-republican-congressman-thomas-massie-over-john-kerry-disaster,"YIKES Seth Meyers Destroys GOP Rep. Thomas Massie Over John Kerry Disaster It was “one of the dumbest lines of questioning in the history of American politics,” the late-night host said. 04.12.19 1:15 AM ET NBC
On Wednesday, Republican Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky participated in the most idiotic line of questioning during a congressional hearing maybe ever.
During a House committee hearing on climate change, the dangers of which Rep. Massie and many of his GOP colleagues (including President Trump) have foolishly dismissed, the congressman tried to trap former Secretary of State John Kerry, whom the House Democrats had called in as a witness—only to have it backfire in epic fashion.
“[Massie] tried to question Kerry’s credentials—specifically his college degree,” explained Seth Meyers on Thursday’s Late Night . “Kerry has a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science, a common degree that lots of people have, and yet Massie thought it was some kind of brilliant gotcha to point that out, resulting in one of the dumbest lines of questioning in the history of American politics.”
“It sounds like you’re questioning the credentials of the president’s advisers currently, but I don’t think we should question your credentials today. Isn’t it true you have a science degree from Yale?” Rep. Massie asked Kerry.
“Bachelor of Arts degree,” Kerry replied.
“Is it a political science degree?” said Rep. Massie.
“Yes, political science,” offered Kerry.
“So, how do you get a Bachelor of Arts in a science ?” pressed Rep. Massie.
“Well, it’s a liberal arts education and degree… it’s a Bachelor [degree],” Kerry explained.
“OK, so it’s not really science. So, I think it’s somewhat appropriate that someone with a pseudoscience degree is here pushing pseudoscience in front of our committee today,” said Rep. Massie.
“Are you serious? I mean, this is really a serious happening here?” Kerry fired back.
“It is. Unfortunately, I’m sorry to say, it is a serious happening—and that is the perfect phrasing, because this whole Trump era feels like a horror movie called A Serious Happening ,” joked Meyers, adding, “This is an actual member of Congress who can’t wrap his head around the fact that you can get a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science! Despite the fact that he himself has a degree from MIT!”
Meyers laughed. “I mean, why stop there, Massie? ‘Senator Kerry, you’re a married man, correct? Then please explain to us how you could possibly have a ‘bachelor’s’ degree?’”
If Rep. Massie really wanted to criticize Kerry’s education (in non-moronic fashion), perhaps he could have mentioned his poor college grades—Kerry had a 76 average at Yale. Then again, Rep. Massie is an outspoken defender of President Trump’s, whose grades apparently weren’t so hot in college either, according to his classmates (not to mention that unlike Kerry, Trump dodged Vietnam thanks to his magically disappearing bone spurs)."
Jimmy Kimmel Brutally Mocks Pamela Anderson Over Julian Assange Arrest,www.thedailybeast.com,marlow.stern@thedailybeast.com (Marlow Stern),04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/jimmy-kimmel-mocks-pamela-anderson-over-wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-arrest,"LOW BLOW Kimmel Brutally Mocks Pamela Anderson Over Julian Assange Arrest The late-night host teed off on the model/actress/activist and the WikiLeaks founder following his embassy expulsion and arrest. 04.12.19 12:12 AM ET Randy Holmes/ABC
On Thursday, all anyone could talk about—other than, of course, the powerful, star-studded memorial for fallen hip-hop artist and activist Nipsey Hussle—was the ejection of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and his subsequent arrest.
Assange, whose WikiLeaks organization is alleged to have conspired with the Russians to publish hacked information during the 2016 presidential election, spent six years, nine months, and 24 days in the embassy. Following his expulsion, he was immediately brought to court and found guilty on an outstanding bail-jumping warrant in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced rape charges.
“It was a tough day for Julian Assange. The founder of WikiLeaks was arrested in London and could soon be extradited to the United States,” said Jimmy Kimmel, before airing footage of Assange being hauled out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by his hands and feet.
“There he is—that’s Julian being gently escorted from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he’s been holed up since 2012,” narrated Kimmel. “Why he looks like Tom Hanks in Cast Away we don’t know. He was living in an embassy; he was not stuck on a deserted island. He had access to grooming tools!”
The U.S. Justice Department is hoping to extradite Assange stateside so he can face espionage charges. The whole ordeal has been tough on Pamela Anderson, who’s been one of Assange’s most outspoken defenders , having visited him in the embassy on numerous occasions amid rumors of a romantic affair—which she’s denied.
Following the expulsion and arrest news, Anderson went off on Twitter:
“Signed Pamela Anderson. The ‘Tool Time’ girl.’ I love this,” joked Kimmel. “It seems there’s some kind of secret organization that assigns a C-list celebrity to every cause. Pamela Anderson, you get WikiLeaks! Dennis Rodman, you’re on North Korea! Steven Seagal, you take Russia! Chuck Norris, guns! Jenny McCarthy, vaccines! Tom Arnold, pee tape is yours! Meat Loaf, GMOs! Gary Busey, you can take everything else!”
Kimmel then mocked Assange’s giant, unkempt beard and greasy hair tied in a ponytail.
“Maybe a change of scenery will be good for Julian Assange. He doesn’t look great. He looks like the kind of guy who cackles at the sky while operating the Tilt-A-Whirl,” cracked Kimmel.
“Why Ecuador gave him up is unknown, but it’s possible they just got sick of him,” he continued. “According to their interior minister, he did a number of antisocial things—including smearing feces on the embassy wall. And that, speaking as someone who frequently welcomes houseguests, is definitely the type of thing you frown upon.”"
Hannity Rallies to Assange’s Defense: WikiLeaks Has Better Track Record Than ‘Fake News Media’,www.thedailybeast.com,Justin Baragona,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/hannity-rallies-to-assanges-defense-wikileaks-has-better-track-record-than-fake-news-media,"COMRADES Hannity Rallies to Assange’s Defense: WikiLeaks Has Better Track Record Than ‘Fake News Media’ The Fox News host defended the WikiLeaks founder, cited the Pentagon Papers, and railed against Robert Mueller. Justin Baragona 04.11.19 10:48 PM ET
Reacting to Thursday’s arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange by British police officers and to the Department of Justice charging Assange with conspiracy to hack government computers, Fox News host Sean Hannity rallied to the defense of the man he once offered a guest-hosting gig.
Claiming during his Thursday night opening monologue that the media “has spread a baseless lie that he was the key to Russian collusion,” Hannity noted that Assange was arrested on a U.S. extradition warrant over a 2010 plot to steal government secrets with former intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.
After framing President Trump’s ridiculous “I know nothing about WikiLeaks” Thursday remarks as the president merely saying he leaves Assange’s fate with the Department of Justice, the pro-Trump host proceeded to make the case that Assange was acting purely as a journalist regarding the leaked DNCand John Podesta emails, only publishing information provided to him by sources.
“As a matter of fact, if you look at Wikileaks' record, they never printed a single thing proven untrue in like 12 years,” Hannity declared. ”Whether you like their work or don't, that's a much better track record than the fake news media mob here in America that has been doing nothing but lying and peddling you conspiracy theories for two-and-a-half years.”
Bringing up the Pentagon Papers Supreme Court case that found media outlets could publish stolen materials as long as they didn’t conspire to steal the information, Hannity referenced his 2017 interview with Assange in which the WikiLeaks founder denied Russia was involved in providing him with the hacked DNCand Podesta emails.
Hannity then wondered why Special Counsel Robert Mueller never questioned Assange if it “wasn’t Russia,” adding that Assange “could have been the guy that offered computer forensics that would prove exactly where that information came from.”
“Mueller didn't take the time to ask?” Hannity exclaimed.
Mueller’s indictments and reporting over the past two-plus years, however, have shown that Russian hackers were responsible for hacking the emails and began releasing the information in June 2016 through the persona “Guccifer 2.0”—traced to an officer of Russia’s military intelligence directorate (GRU). Mueller has also revealed in indictments that WikiLeaks contacted Guccifer 2.0 in June and that stolen emails were sent to WikiLeaks the following month.
Hannity, meanwhile, has expressed doubt that Russia was responsible for hacking the DNC’s emails, going so far as to promote an unfounded conspiracy theory that DNC staffer Seth Rich was murdered in July 2016 because he was in contact with WikiLeaks. Fox News would later retract an article on the Seth Rich investigation and the Rich family has sued the network. READ THIS LIST"

Tarpley Hitt 04.11.19 10:28 PM ET
L OS ANGELES, California—Early Thursday morning, thousands processioned through the streets of downtown Los Angeles to celebrate the life of Ermias Joseph Asghedom, better known as the rapper and community activist Nipsey Hussle , who was gunned down at the age of 33.
Over the sounds of “Victory Lap,” the title track of Hussle’s Grammy-nominated debut album, the parade made their way to the Staples Center, where the rapper’s family had organized a four-hour service, with performances and remarks from relatives—including Hussle’s two-year-old son, Kross—as well as several high-profile figures, like Marsha Ambrosius, Jhené Aiko, YG, Snoop Dogg, former President Barack Obama (via a letter read in absentia ), the controversial minister Louis Farrakhan , and music icon Stevie Wonder .
Earlier this week, Hussle’s family had offered up 21,000 free tickets for the “Celebration of Life” event, which sold out in minutes. But as the crowd filed into the massive stadium Thursday, many attendees passed out extras to those desperate to get in—an homage to the local legend who had spent his life giving back. Audience members also received free copies of a special tribute edition of The Final Call , a newspaper published by Nation of Islam minister Farrakhan, and a thick yearbook with photos of the young rapper and letters from his loved ones and famous industry peers. “Nipsey should’ve died an old man,” Lena Waithe wrote on her page. “Instead he’ll be forever etched into our brains as a young man on the verge of something bigger than himself.”
The service started with prayers from Minister Reid Rich and Pastor Shep Crawford, who talked about the story of Joseph, a biblical figure who died at the hand of his jealous brothers. The story was an overt hat tip to Hussle’s accused killer, 29-year-old Eric Holder .
Holder, a much less successful musician, reportedly had a personal dispute with Hussle on March 31, the day he allegedly shot the rapper outside his Los Angeles clothing store (Holder has pleaded not guilty to one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder). After an interlude of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way,” and Marsha Ambrosius’s performance of “Fly Like A Bird,” Hussle’s friend and business partner Karen Civil took the stage to read a letter from Barack Obama.
“I’ve never met Nipsey, but I’ve heard his music from my daughters,” the former president wrote. “And after his passing I had a chance to learn about his transformation and his community work. While most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood and only saw gangs, bullets and despair, Nipsey saw potential. He saw hope. He saw a community that even through its loss taught him to always keep going. His choice to invest in that community rather than ignore it, to build a train center, to build a co-working space in Crenshaw, to lift up the Eritrean-American community, he set an example for young people to follow. I hope his memory inspires more good work in Crenshaw and communities like it.”
The primary remarks came from Farrakhan, the polarizing Nation of Islam minister, whose legacy of community activism has been tainted by allegations of anti-Semitism, sexism and homophobia (in the past, Farrakhan has called Hitler “a great man”; in a speech directed at women he encouraged the audience “to put husbands and children ahead of their careers, shun tight, short skirts, stay off welfare and reject abortion,” according to The New York Times ).
Wearing his signature square glasses and a gold bowtie, the minister hailed Hussle as a “prophetic voice”; as a figure who was for hip-hop and rap what “Bob Marley was to Reggae”; and as a man who “rose above the pull of gravity,” fulfilling the prediction of his first name, which translates to “God is Rising.” During his speech, Farrakhan also repeatedly referred to Nipsey Hussle as “Nipsey Russell,” the rapper’s comedian namesake.
“I said it right,” Farrakhan insisted, before pivoting to talk, without total clarity, about Russell Westbrook, who dedicated his historic double triple-double to Hussle last week. “Now let’s look at 20-20-20—it’s 60. In the Book of Revelations, it says, here’s wisdom. Count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: 600, three score—which is 60—and six. But the beast is a marker of a man, that a man came up of the light of the beast. I’m saying this to my hip-hop community, you live like the mark of the beast is in your forehead and in your hands.” Farrakhan later referred to Hussle as Russell again in his concluding remarks.
Later in the service, Hussle’s two children, Emani and Kross, took the stage in matching blue-and-white outfits, alongside his nephew, Khalil Kimble, and Kameron Carter, the 9-year-old son of Hussle’s long-time partner Lauren London and her ex Lil Wayne. Two-year-old Kross won the crowd over with a short monologue of burbles and babytalk. Kameron also took the mic and recounted, in his pre-teen falsetto, how Hussle, whom his family calls Ermias, had recently appeared in one of his dreams.
“On the night of April 2, I had a dream that I was in paradise, and I was playing in the ocean water when Ermias appeared,” he recounted. “He said, ‘What up, Killa?’ because that was my nickname... I turned around and I held his hand and I gave him a hug... It was still cool, I guess... Ermias told me what it was like in paradise.”
In the second half of the service, friends and family came up and told stories from Hussle’s life. London, through tears, offered: “To Ermias, the love of my life. You know what it is. Grief is the final act of love. My heart hears you, I feel you everywhere. I’m so grateful that I had you. I love you beyond this Earth. Until we meet again, the Marathon continues.” His older brother, Samuel, recalled how a 12-year-old Nipsey had fixed their grandfather’s computer from spare parts he’d scavenged from thrift stores (“For two weeks, our room was covered in computer parts...Years later, he downloaded software and started making music.”)
His mother, Angelique Smith, remembered when their car had caught on fire and a pre-teen Nipsey ran down the block to hail a firetruck, which put out the flames. The car, she said, was burnt but turned out fine. (“Now, our engine is on fire. We’re burning. But we’re not destroyed.”) Snoop Dogg, wearing a metallic blue jumpsuit, joked about one of Hussle’s big, crazy ideas: a theme park called Doggyland.
“One of the first times me and Nips were hanging out, he came up to me and said, hey cuz, you need to do an amusement park, call it Doggyland,” Snoop Dogg said. “The sixth time he said it to me, I said Nip, why don’t you just do it for me, dog? Because I don’t understand the dynamics of what you’re saying. I’m old school. I’m A-B-C-D. You’ve done and gone into the Matrix. But Nip ended up buying a whole square. He ended up doing things for the community. He built his own Doggyland.”
In the final moments of the service, Stevie Wonder took the stage to perform “Rocket Love,” which had been Hussle’s favorite of his songs. Wonder reflected on meeting Hussle, and then used his time to talk about gun control, calling on leaders and activists to make it harder for people like Holder to act out their anger with a weapon. “The world has gone crazy,” he said. “It’s almost like the world is becoming blind.”"
"Evidence of New Human Species, Homo Luzonensis, Found in Philippines",www.thedailybeast.com,,04-12-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/evidence-of-new-human-species-homo-luzonensis-found-in-philippines,"3 days ago Evidence of New Human Species, Homo Luzonensis, Found in Philippines
Scientists have recently discovered evidence of a previously unknown 50,000-year-old human species in the Philippines, The Wall Street Journal reports. Researchers reportedly found foot and hand bones, part of a thigh bone, and teeth that they believe belong to the new species—named Homo luzonensis—in the Philippines’ Callao Cave after three years of work. In the journal Nature , the scientists reportedly wrote that the remains belonged to two adults and one child and appear to be a mix of other known human species—including “Homo sapiens, Denisovans, Neanderthals, Homo naledi and Homo floresiensis[.]” They also reportedly determined the species could walk upright with feet “shaped to climb”and had “dainty teeth” in their small jaws. “The molars were so tiny, so small. The pre-molars had two or three roots.
