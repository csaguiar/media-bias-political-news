"Trump World ramps up campaign to turn tables in Russia case, target Dems who 'colluded'",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is An Editor', 'Attorney Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-turn-tables-in-russia-probe,"As Democratic leaders tentatively took impeachment proceedings off the docket this week, the White House put payback on the front burner -- calling for closer looks into everyone from the FBI officials who investigated the Russia case to allies of Hillary Clinton's campaign who solicited foreign help during the 2016 presidential campaign.

“All those things have to be explored and more,” Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told ""Fox & Friends"" on Wednesday.

On social media and in televised interviews, President Trump, his attorneys, his campaign and senior members of his administration have in the wake of the Robert Mueller report seemingly adopted a strategy of highlighting lesser-known episodes of alleged misconduct by Democrats and investigators, as Democrats pursue obstruction of justice inquiries.

White House adviser Kellyanne Conway led the charge on Monday, openly wondering on Twitter why former FBI Director James Comey focused so heavily on the lurid and salacious claims in a largely discredited anti-Trump dossier.

""Comey, then-FBI Director, waited 2 months after @realDonaldTrump was elected to pay a visit & brief the President-elect,"" Conway wrote. ""While there, he wasted his time on this golden-shower-nonsense-concocted-dossier. Could have been honest about Obama ignoring Russian interference instead.""

COMEY'S PAPER TRAIL: WHY DID FBI DIRECTOR KEEP HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN HIS PERSONAL MEMOS?

""Tables are finally turning on the Witch Hunt!"" Trump also tweeted.

The FBI is currently being sued by conservative group Judicial Watch, after the bureau failed to respond to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request concerning contacts in late 2016 between the then-FBI general counsel and a top Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer, as well as contacts between the FBI and the author of the dossier.

Comey briefed Trump on the salacious contents of the dossier in January 2017, ostensibly to make him aware of potential blackmail threats, Comey later testified. That confidential meeting later leaked, and CNN cited the fact that intelligence officials had briefed Trump on the dossier as a justification for airing the story, even though the dossier's claims were unverified.

Comey told lawmakers that then-National Intelligence Director James Clapper, an Obama appointee, came up with the idea to brief Trump on the dossier's contents.

Separately this week, Giuliani revived Republican-led calls to look into whether, and to what extent, a Democratic Party consultant worked with Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on the Trump campaign.

""Keep your eye on Ukraine,"" he said Wednesday.

A 2017 investigation by Politico found that Ukrainian officials not only publicly sought to undermine Trump by questioning his fitness for office, but also worked behind the scenes to secure a Clinton victory.

ANTI-TRUMP AGENT STRZOK'S PHONE FROM DAYS ON MUELLER TEAM TOTALLY WIPED; FBI BLAMES SOFTWARE GLITCH FOR OTHER MISSING TEXTS

Among other initiatives, Politico found, the Ukrainian government worked with a DNC consultant to conduct opposition research against Trump, including going after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort for Russian ties, helping lead to his resignation.

Last month, Ukraine Prosecutor General Yurii Lutsenko opened a probe into the so-called black ledger files that led to Manafort's departure, after a leaked tape recording apparently showed a senior Ukrainian anticorruption official admitting to disclosing Manafort's information to help the Clinton campaign. A Ukrainian court later ruled that the move amounted to illegal interference in the U.S. election.

""Now Ukraine is investigating Hillary campaign and DNC conspiracy with foreign operatives including Ukrainian and others to affect 2016 election,"" Giuliani tweeted Tuesday. ""And there’s no Comey to fix the result.""

On Sunday, Giuliani hammered the same theme. ""Is it a crime for an American campaign to consider information from a foreign source or to obtain it?"" he asked, responding to claims that the Trump team acted improperly by meeting with Russian-affiliated individuals who promised damaging information on Clinton.

""If so the allegation that the DNC [Democratic National Committee] colluded with Ukrainian officials to generate information to hurt the Trump campaign and help the Clinton campaign must be investigated,"" Giuliani added.

Buoyed by Special Counsel Mueller's findings that no member of the Trump team illegally conspired with Russia, Republicans have additionally turned to a separate known episode of apparent collaboration between a 2016 presidential campaign and a foreign national -- specifically, the decision by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC to hire Fusion GPS. The firm, in turn, funded the infamous dossier, drafted by British ex-spy Christopher Steele, which contained numerous assertions that fueled an anti-Trump media frenzy -- but that Mueller's investigators were unable to substantiate.

Nonetheless, the FBI relied heavily on the dossier to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to monitor former Trump aide Carter Page, and the bureau did not clearly disclose to the FISA court that Steele was working for a firm funded by Clinton and the DNC. Rather, the FBI told the court the materials were prepared in connection with a campaign for president. (Only partial versions of the FBI's FISA application has been released; Trump has told Fox News he will eventually declassify and release all relevant information from the FISA application.)

Democrats, too, heavily pushed the Steele dossier. At a 2017 hearing, now-House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., confidently described Steele as ""a former British intelligence officer who is reportedly held in high regard by U.S. intelligence"" and repeatedly cited ""Steele's Russian sources"" as he described a purported Trump-Russia conspiracy.

But in an article last week, The New York Times joined a chorus of publications that have long cast doubt on the dossier's veracity, writing that the document ""financed by Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee"" was ""likely to face new, possibly harsh scrutiny from multiple inquiries.""

The article noted that Steele relied in part on Russian sources and that, ironically, the document could have been part of a ""Russian disinformation"" effort to smear Trump even as Moscow was going after Clinton.

The article suggested that dossier skepticism, once panned as denialism, has entered the mainstream, as Mueller's report found ""some of the most sensational claims in the dossier appeared to be false, and others were impossible to prove.""

Internal FBI text messages obtained by Fox News last month showed that a senior Justice Department official warned of ""bias"" in a source key to a FISA application. The DOJ Inspector General is investigating whether the FBI violated its procedures or Page's constitutional rights by withholding exculpatory information from the FISA court.

""The Office of the Inspector General has a pending investigation of the FISA process in the Russian investigation, and I expect that that will be complete probably in May or June, I am told,"" Attorney General William Barr testified earlier this month.

House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has already sent several criminal referrals to the Justice Department related to alleged crimes committed during the Russia probe, and Fox News is told as many as ""two dozen"" individuals could be implicated. It was unclear exactly whom had been referred.

""The American people have only seen the pieces that have been declassified so far,"" Nunes told Fox News earlier this month. ""There's still more information.""

The Trump team's pushback comes as top Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have clamped down on calls to impeach the president. In a private Democratic conference call on Monday, two sources told Fox News, Pelosi said impeachment would be premature, and even anti-Trump firebrand Maxine Waters declined to call on her colleagues to begin impeachment proceedings.

FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: INSIDE MONDAY'S DEM CONFERENCE CALL ON IMPEACHMENT PLANS

However, Fox News is told Democrats emphasized on the conference call that more investigations and fact-finding are necessary before any final decision can be made.

Schiff, for his part, has already referred to a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting as ""direct evidence"" of collusion in plain sight. Schiff has only doubled down since Mueller's report was published, calling for closer looks into Trump's finances and contacts with Russians.

Donald Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner, and Manafort were known to have attended the meeting with Kremlin-linked attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya, and the Trump team gave shifting explanations for the role of the president in drafting media responses to inquiries about the episode.

But Mueller found that the meeting was not a criminal campaign finance violation, in part because there was insufficient evidence that the involved parties knew they were breaking the law -- a high standard that applies only to certain crimes. Additionally, prosecutors said, it was unclear whether an exchange of information not available on the public marketplace could constitute a ""campaign contribution"" by a foreign national in the first place.

Still, Schiff told Fox News that episodes like that meeting raised grave concerns, and indicated impeachment would be a ""difficult"" issue that would be addressed in a matter of weeks.

In the dueling messaging wars, though, the Trump team has been nothing if not confident in recent days.

Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday,"" for example, that ""so far we don’t think we need to"" release a planned counter-report to Mueller's findings, because ""we think the public debate is playing out about as well as it can -- why confuse it?""

"In Push for 2020 Election Security, Top Official Was Warned: Don’t Tell Trump",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Eric Schmitt', 'David E. Sanger', 'Maggie Haberman']",04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/us/politics/russia-2020-election-trump.html,"WASHINGTON — In the months before Kirstjen Nielsen was forced to resign, she tried to focus the White House on one of her highest priorities as homeland security secretary: preparing for new and different Russian forms of interference in the 2020 election.

President Trump’s chief of staff told her not to bring it up in front of the president.

Ms. Nielsen left the Department of Homeland Security early this month after a tumultuous 16-month tenure and tensions with the White House. Officials said she had become increasingly concerned about Russia’s continued activity in the United States during and after the 2018 midterm elections — ranging from its search for new techniques to divide Americans using social media, to experiments by hackers, to rerouting internet traffic and infiltrating power grids.

But in a meeting this year, Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, made it clear that Mr. Trump still equated any public discussion of malign Russian election activity with questions about the legitimacy of his victory. According to one senior administration official, Mr. Mulvaney said it “wasn’t a great subject and should be kept below his level.”

Even though the Department of Homeland Security has primary responsibility for civilian cyberdefense, Ms. Nielsen eventually gave up on her effort to organize a White House meeting of cabinet secretaries to coordinate a strategy to protect next year’s elections."
Meet the Other Resistance: The Republican One,https://www.nytimes.com,['Mark Leibovich'],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/magazine/republican-primary-trump-resistance.html,"Hogan, who is 62, resembles a driver’s ed instructor: built like a fireplug, thick glasses, barking cadence. He became the instant Never Trump front-runner in November after he was overwhelmingly re-elected to a second term in the solidly blue state, in part on account of his vocal criticism of Trump. He then made an obliging visit to the Niskanen Center in December. He is term-limited, has little use for Trump and has ruled out nothing for 2020. The Washington Post columnist and Never Trump eminence George F. Will, noting the intense chemotherapy Hogan underwent while in office, surmised “he has endured something almost as unpleasant as Donald Trump.”

When I met him, Hogan had just finished his weekly news conference, in which he became animated about the battered state of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. “It’s outrageous and unacceptable,” he told reporters. “I mean, you have potholes practically swallowing cars.” There was something refreshing, in 2019, about watching a chief executive hold forth on something as workaday as pavement after a weekend in which the actual chief executive of the federal government had railed on Twitter against everything from his portrayal on “Saturday Night Live” (a rerun) to John McCain’s “last in his class” rank at the Naval Academy (60-plus years ago) to the travesty of Jeanine Pirro’s suspension by Fox News.

Hogan seemed to be enjoying the role of hypothetical Republican alternative. To a question about the trip he made to Iowa at the beginning of March, he pointed out that he was the vice chairman of the National Governors Association, and Iowa happened to be where one of its regional workshops was held, so nothing to see there. “I thought it would just be great to spend 48 hours in subzero temperatures in Des Moines,” he deadpanned. “But that doesn’t mean I’m actually running for anything.” He took another question about whether he might run or not.

Hogan likes to remind people that he was the first Republican governor in 2016 to say he could not vote for Donald Trump, whom he opposed on general character and temperament grounds — just the opposite of the kind of panting allegiance to the president that you often hear from elected Republicans. Instead, Hogan wrote in his late father, Lawrence Hogan, a three-term Maryland representative in the 1970s. The elder Hogan, who died in 2017, was the only Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee to vote for all three articles of impeachment against President Nixon. Hogan’s father counseled him to do something else for a while before getting into politics, and he spent much of his adult life as a real estate developer. He had run unsuccessfully for Congress but never held any elected office until, at 57, he won an upset victory in 2014.

“I’m boring,” Hogan said in his office, excitedly. He pointed to something that the Johns Hopkins political scientist Yascha Mounk told The Times last year: “For the last two years it’s been impossible to go to a bar on a Monday night and not have to talk about politics. Most Americans are sick of that. I think you can win in 2020 by promising that if you become president, people can go back to talking about football.” Americans, Hogan told me, wanted a president who would “just fix stuff.”

“Just Fix Stuff” is about as close as Hogan comes to putting forth a governing philosophy. He talks about his ability to “reach across the aisle” and be “less divisive” and restore a more inclusive tradition in the party. (That may be a relative proposition: Amid a heated legislative fight with the Maryland General Assembly last month, Hogan accused Democrats of being “pro-criminal.”) “I think the party has been sort of hijacked by this guy that really is not a traditional Republican,” he said of Trump.

As we spoke, it was hard to ascertain what Hogan’s animating reason for doing something like this would be, whether he has any particular passion for ideas or theory of the future — or whether he is entertaining the notion simply because he has a high approval rating (69 percent, per a Goucher Poll in February). He told me he’s not willing to launch a “suicide mission” against Trump if he has no chance. And he is not really thinking about a campaign, except when people ask him about it (which they do all the time, he mentions — all the time). Anyway, a lot can change. Filing deadlines are a ways off, he pointed out."

He won Pennsylvania by less than 1 percentage point in 2016. | Alex Wong/Getty Images 2020 elections Trump camp descends on Pennsylvania as alarms grow over 2020 The president’s team is set to meet with a state Republican Party riven by dissension.

Senior Trump 2020 advisers are headed to Harrisburg on Wednesday to meet with Pennsylvania GOP officials amid mounting concerns about the president’s prospects in the critical battleground state.

Trump's campaign is moving to shore up the state after 2018 midterm elections that saw Republicans get blown out in races up and down the ballot. Compounding the situation is a state party organization riven by turmoil and infighting.

Story Continued Below

The private meeting, confirmed by a half-dozen party officials, underscores the high stakes for the president in the state. Trump won Pennsylvania by less than 1 percentage point in 2016, and reelection aides view the state’s 20 electoral votes as crucial to his 2020 hopes. Pennsylvania also has symbolic significance: In 2016, Trump geared his campaign toward the state’s large proportion of blue-collar voters, many of whom had traditionally voted Democratic.

The Trump contingent is expected to include political director Chris Carr, who is orchestrating the campaign’s national field deployment, as well as Bill Stepien and Justin Clark, who are overseeing outreach to delegates and state party organizations. Republican National Committee officials are also expected to attend.

The meeting is the first of what Trump aides say will be a series of visits to battleground states. The fact that Pennsylvania is the first stop underscores the state’s importance, they say — and the level of concern about it.

“The party is not in great shape,” said Rob Gleason, a former Pennsylvania GOP chairman. “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see that.”

The meeting is expected to focus on field deployment, voter data and coordination between state and national officials.

Among those expected to be on hand are Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Val Digiorgio and RNC member Bob Asher. Ted Christian and David Urban, who helped spearhead Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state, are expected to join, as is former GOP Rep. Lou Barletta, an ally of the president who waged an unsuccessful 2018 Senate bid.

Tim Murtaugh, a Trump 2020 spokesman, declined to comment on the meeting other than to express confidence in the president’s prospects in the state.

“The voters of the commonwealth were there for President Trump in 2016 and will be with him again in 2020,” he said.

The Trump campaign has been focused on Pennsylvania for months. In January, DiGiorgio traveled to Washington to privately huddle with reelection aides. The chairman presented a sweeping 2020 blueprint, detailing how he planned to recruit volunteers, target swing voters who bolted the party in 2018 and boost the state party’s lackluster fundraising.

DiGiorgio said in a text that the state party is working closely with Trump's campaign and that he's confident the collaboration will produce ""another victory"" in Pennsylvania next year.

Wednesday’s meeting comes after months of bad news for the Pennsylvania GOP. In March 2018, Republicans lost a special election in a conservative southwestern Pennsylvania congressional district. In November, Republicans lost Senate and gubernatorial races by double digits as well as three House seats, partly because of a redrawn congressional map that favored Democrats.

Democrats also flipped 16 state legislative seats in the midterms.

The bleeding hasn’t stopped since then. In a special election this month, Democrats won a state Senate seat in a district that Trump carried in 2016. Nationally, it was the first such legislative seat that Democrats flipped this year, prompting grumbling among some Republicans that the state party did not invest enough in turning out voters.

A power struggle, meanwhile, has consumed state GOP leadership, with some Republicans complaining that DiGiorgio lacks fundraising skills and has failed to unite the party after a bruising election for state party chief in 2017.

There have been other black eyes. Last week, Fox News held a town hall with Democratic contender Bernie Sanders in Northampton, a traditionally Democratic county that Trump won in 2016. Prime-time viewers were treated to visuals of Sanders getting cheered in Trump country, leading some to wonder whether Republican organizers failed to lure fans of the president to the event.

Still, there are some indications the party has begun to stabilize. After rumors swirled for months that DiGiorgio critics might stage a vote of no confidence at the state party’s winter meeting, it never materialized.

Bruce Hottle, a state party committee member from western Pennsylvania, had called for state party leadership “to be looked at” before the event. Since then, he’s changed his tune.

“Leadership has taken a hard look at what worked and what didn’t work in the fall campaign and has made efforts to correct it so we don’t fall in that same trap again,” he said.

Others contend that the challenges the party faces in the state aren’t simply operational. A Franklin & Marshall College Poll released last month said just 34 percent of the state’s registered voters approved of Trump’s job performance — a precarious standing for an incumbent.

To win Pennsylvania again in 2020, party officials say Trump will need to pull off a repeat of his 2016 performance by again carrying traditionally blue areas that had gone for Obama four years earlier.

Asher, a longtime GOP official and fundraiser, lavished praised on Trump's reelection campaign for “getting everybody together from all corners of the state and all parts of the party” for Wednesday’s meeting.

“I’m not going in with any preconceived notions,” he said."

Closer look: Scholars say the Constitution deems that offenses involving the lawless use of official power could justify removal from office. Does Mr. Trump’s conduct, as described in the special counsel’s report, clear that bar? Impeachment proceedings against Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton indicate that it could.

Twitter CEO Gently Tells Trump: Your ‘Lost’ Followers Are Bots and Spam Accounts,https://www.thedailybeast.com,"['Will-Sommer Asawin-Suebsaeng', 'Will Sommer', 'Asawin Suebsaeng']",04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-gets-gentle-reassurance-from-twitter-chief-jack-dorsey-over-follower-count-in-white-house-meeting,"On Tuesday, President Trump hosted Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in the Oval Office for a closed-door meeting, during which the leader of the free world spent an inordinate amount of time complaining about lost Twitter followers, according to a source familiar with the conversation.

The Twitter chief, for his part, tried to reassure the president that the company’s staff merely wants his follower count to be as bot-free as possible.

This is what the most powerful person in the world was preoccupied with Tuesday.

A large percentage of the meeting, which included senior White House officials such as Trump’s social media director Dan Scavino, was spent addressing the subject of @realDonaldTrump’s follower count. The president stated his belief that he had lost some of his roughly 59 million followers in anti-Trump, anti-conservative Twitter purges, according to a source familiar with the meeting.

Dorsey, according to this knowledgeable source, had to explain to the president that like other Twitter users, @realDonaldTrump periodically loses followers when the site deletes fake or bot accounts. Dorsey even said he himself had lost followers as a result of Twitter’s efforts to delete fake accounts.

During this private gathering in the West Wing, Dorsey assured Trump that the company wants him, and everyone else on Twitter, to have only real followers, according to the source.

Trump also said he’s heard from other prominent conservatives about problems with Twitter, though he declined to name names.

“ Trump has repeatedly griped to associates about how Obama has had more Twitter followers than he has, even though—by Trump’s own assessment—he is so much better at Twitter than Obama is. ”

The summit with Twitter’s CEO is unlikely to assuage the president’s concerns about tech giants and social media, of which he has many. Two people close to Trump previously told The Daily Beast that Trump has repeatedly griped to associates about how his predecessor, President Obama, has had more Twitter followers than he has, even though—by Trump’s own assessment—he is so much better at Twitter than Obama is.

The Washington Post first reported that the president devoted much of the White House meeting to grumbling about his Twitter followers. Earlier in the day, Motherboard broke the news that Trump and Dorsey were meeting on Tuesday.

Dorsey also used the meeting to promote Twitter’s efforts to fight opioid addiction, which include using a special emoji to promote National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. It is unclear how interested Trump was in discussing those efforts, at least compared to his time spent inquiring about the alleged purging of his followers.

Beyond confirming that the meeting had indeed occurred, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not respond to The Daily Beast’s follow-up questions as of press time.

The discussion came a few hours after early morning tweets from the president accusing Twitter of playing “political games” with his follower count and calling for congressional intervention against the company.

“Constantly taking people off list,” Trump tweeted. “Big complaints from many people.”"
"Did Trump Obstruct Justice? Mueller Didn’t Say, but Left a Trail to the Answer",https://www.nytimes.com,['Charlie Savage'],04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/us/politics/trump-mueller-obstruction.html,"WASHINGTON — The report by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, explored about a dozen episodes in which President Trump’s actions raised concerns about obstruction of justice.

Mr. Mueller stopped short of concluding whether Mr. Trump committed that crime, but the report made clear that others can use the evidence to make that call. Mr. Mueller’s investigators made an oblique reference to possible impeachment proceedings and noted that after Mr. Trump leaves office, he will lose the temporary immunity the Justice Department says sitting presidents enjoy. Mr. Mueller cited that factor as barring him from making accusations now.

The report evaluated the evidence based on three criteria: The act must be obstructive, linked to an investigation and undertaken with a corrupt motive. Investigators also explored countervailing evidence that Mr. Trump’s lawyers could use to argue that the acts fell short of a crime.

Mr. Mueller also devoted over a dozen pages to rebutting a sweeping argument offered by Mr. Trump’s lawyers — and Attorney General William P. Barr, who has said he believes Mr. Trump did not violate obstruction laws: that Congress cannot make it a crime for a president to abuse his official powers to impede an investigation."
Six Trump Interior appointees are being investigated for possible ethical misconduct,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Juliet Eilperin', 'Reporter Covering Domestic Policy', 'National Affairs', 'Dino Grandoni', 'Reporter Covering Energy', 'Environmental Policy', 'April At Pm', ""Juliet Eilperin Is The Washington Post'S Senior National Affairs Correspondent"", ""Covering The Transformation Of Federal Environmental Policy.

The Interior Department’s Office of Inspector General has opened an investigation into whether six of President Trump’s appointees have violated federal ethics rules by engaging with their former employers or clients on department-related business.

The new inquiry, which the office confirmed in an April 18 letter to the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, is looking into senior Interior officials, including Assistant Secretary for Insular and International Affairs Doug Domenech, White House liaison Lori Mashburn, three top staffers at the Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs, and the department’s former energy policy adviser. The Campaign Legal Center detailed the officials’ actions in a Feb. 20 letter to the inspector general’s office, suggesting a probe is warranted.

To avoid conflicts of interest, Trump signed an executive order days after taking office that requires appointees to recuse themselves from specific matters involving their former employers and clients for two years. The complaint, which cites reports in HuffPost and the Guardian as well as extensive public records, outlines how a half-dozen political appointees at Interior continued to discuss policy matters with organizations that had employed them in the past.

Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said in a phone interview Tuesday that the inquiry shows that the president and his top deputies have failed allegedly to deliver on Trump’s 2016 campaign promise to “drain the swamp” in Washington.

“This is demonstrative of the failures at the very top of this administration to set an ethical tone,” Marsco said. “When people come to work for government, they’re supposed to work on behalf of the public. It’s a betrayal of the public trust when senior political appointees seem to give privileged access to their former employers or former clients.

“We hope this investigation will answer whether these officials are working on behalf of the American people or on behalf of the interests that used to pay their salary,” she added.

The Guardian reported in May 2018 that Domenech, the highest-ranking official named in the complaint, continued to interact with the conservative think tank that used to employ him before he joined Interior.

Domenech’s calendars indicated that he twice met with representatives from the Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation on an endangered species listing and a property dispute. The group had lawsuits pending with Interior over both issues and resolved the fight over private property near Texas’s Red River six months after the meeting with Domenech.

In a news release, the foundation described the November 2017 settlement with Interior as “a major win.""

Benjamin Cassidy, a former lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, also has attracted significant attention for his past work on gun-related issues since joining the department as senior deputy director at its Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs.

Calendars released by Interior show Cassidy participating in a December 2017 meeting regarding Trump’s decision to scale back two national monuments in Utah, even though Cassidy had lobbied Congress on a bill addressing the president’s ability to establish national monuments just months earlier. This activity, first reported by HuffPost, could violate the federal ethics pledge because Cassidy was prohibited from engaging in particular matters on which he had lobbied during the two years before joining the department.

Cassidy had also been in contact with a current NRA lobbyist, Susan Recce, about opening up Bureau of Land Management lands in Arizona and Utah to recreational shooting. Interior ultimately decided to allow recreational shooting in the Sonoran Desert National Monument, the option endorsed by the NRA.

After the decision was announced, the NRA published a post on its website quoting Recce as saying that “the BLM backed down from the closure alternative” as “a result of” the work her group and other gun rights advocates had done.

The center also alleges that Mashburn, a former associate director at the conservative Heritage Foundation, violated her ethics pledge by attending multiple private events held by her former employer.

Nancy DiPaolo, a spokeswoman for the inspector general, said in an email, “We have opened an investigation and are considering all the material presented by CLC, but because it is an active investigation, have no further comments.”

The move comes a week after the office launched a probe into whether Interior Secretary David Bernhardt violated federal conflict of interest rules by weighing in on policies that could affect the former clients he represented while working at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

Bernhardt, who was confirmed earlier this month, has denied any wrongdoing and said he has cleared any action affecting his former employer or clients with the department’s ethics office.

[Bernhardt has so many conflicts of interest he needs to carry a card listing them all]

Interior spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort said in an email that while the department does not typically comment on personnel matters, the secretary’s office “immediately consulted” with department ethics officials after receiving the center’s complaint in February.

“Ethics reviewed each matter and provided materials to the chief of staff, who has taken appropriate actions. All of these materials have been provided to the inspector general,” said Vander Voort, who declined to specify what actions the department had taken. “The department takes ethics issues seriously.”

The other two senior officials with the Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs now under investigation are Todd Wynn and Timothy Williams. All of the officials named in the complaint continue to work at Interior, except for Vincent DeVito, who left his job as the department energy policy counselor in August to join an offshore oil drilling firm."
Treasury Delays Decision on Whether to Release Trump’s Tax Returns to May 6,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/us/politics/trump-taxes.html,"Mr. Neal issued a terse statement on Tuesday but did not indicate his next move, which could include a subpoena or a lawsuit. The matter could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.

“This afternoon, Secretary Mnuchin notified me that once again, the I.R.S. will miss the deadline,” he said. “I plan to consult with counsel about my next steps.”

But other Democratic lawmakers said they were prepared to escalate things quickly.

“They don’t get to pick and choose the laws with which they will comply,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas. “After so much of their double talk, prompt action must be taken to secure what they have wrongfully refused.”

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said that Treasury’s lack of cooperation was an example of the Trump administration’s “lawlessness.”

“Secretary Mnuchin and the White House have blatantly interfered with the I.R.S.’s obligation to provide the president’s tax returns, and action is needed to force this administration to follow the law,” Mr. Wyden said.

Mr. Neal has largely dismissed Mr. Mnuchin’s arguments that the request could violate taxpayer privacy and that it was being done for political purposes, saying that they lacked merit. He gave the Treasury Department until Tuesday to comply and said that failing to do so would be “interpreted as a denial of my request.”

In his letter, Mr. Mnuchin said that the delay was not a failure to comply with the request and that portraying it as such would be “a misinterpretation.”

“The committee’s request has not been denied or granted at this time,” he said.

Last week, in a sign of how much attention Mr. Trump is paying to the proceedings, his personal lawyer urged the Treasury Department not to release the president’s tax returns and accused Democratic lawmakers of having a “radical view of unchecked congressional power.”"
"Trump Justice Department Goes After Seattle, Philadelphia Overdose Prevention Sites as ‘Crack Houses’",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Zachary Siegel'],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-justice-department-goes-after-seattle-philadelphia-overdose-prevention-sites-as-crack-houses,"Two major U.S. cities are trying to open facilities to save drug users’ lives, but the Trump administration is trying to stop them, arguing the facilities are no different than crack houses.

Seattle and Philadelphia plan to curb overdose deaths by opening facilities where drug users can ingest illicit substances like heroin under medical supervision. So-called overdose prevention sites are part of a strategy that seeks to reduce harm from drug use. The facilities were first popularized in Western Europe and have made their way to Canada and now potentially the U.S. While controversial and seemingly counterintuitive, over 100 such facilities currently operate in several countries, and public health experts consider them a staple of a robust strategy to prevent overdoses. Even Vice President Mike Pence, when he was Indiana’s governor during an HIV outbreak, implemented a similar program to distribute fresh syringes to prevent new infections.

President Trump campaigned on ending the overdose crisis, but federal prosecutors appointed by his administration are thwarting cities from pursuing effective strategies. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein promises “swift and aggressive action” if any cities follow through on their plan to implement the sites in the face of a staggering overdose death toll that has led Denver, New York, Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia to consider implementing them. In 2017, more than 72,000 people died from drug overdoses in the U.S. Among overdose deaths involving opioids, more than 28,000 were due to illicit fentanyl, an uber-potent synthetic opioid manufactured in clandestine laboratories.

While overdose prevention sites are no panacea, decades of research from Canada, Australia, and Western Europe demonstrate their effectiveness, especially in times of crisis. A review of the scientific literature finds that these facilities reduce overdose deaths, public injection, neighborhood disorder, and the transmission of blood-borne diseases like Hepatitis C and HIV in the communities they operate. People who use overdose prevention sites also see improvements in their overall health, and overtime seek out treatment and find a path toward recovery.

“ The only thing these sites encourage is safer drug use for people who are already using drugs and unable to or do not wish to stop. ” — social worker Brooke Feldman

Last February, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against Safehouse, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit that plans on operating the country’s first ever overdose prevention site. The civil suit, also a first of its kind, is a preemptive strike that aims for the facility to be deemed illegal by a judge before it ever opens.

“What’s driving the lawsuit is our responsibility to uphold and enforce the rule of law,” the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia, William McSwain, said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “ Possessing, consuming or otherwise sanctioning the use of these dangerous narcotics is clearly against the law in the United States.”

McSwain is referring to what’s known as the “crack-house statute,” a provision that penalizes anyone who manages or owns a building where drugs are being used. Violating the statute can result in hefty fines or jail time. Public health and legal experts suggest the “crack-house statute” was never intended to apply to medical settings where people are receiving services that Safehouse would provide, such as wound care, new syringes, and treatment referrals.

Seattle may soon find itself in the same legal bind as Philadelphia. When asked about a site in Seattle, U.S. Attorney there Brian Moran told city officials: “Don’t go there.”

“As the Deputy Attorney General has made clear, the U.S. Department of Justice will not stand idly by and allow consumption sites to open in cities across the U.S.,” Moran told The Daily Beast . Though Moran has not filed a lawsuit like his Pennsylvania counterpart, he calls the plan to do so a “logical path” were Seattle to move forward on the proposed facility to be called Community Health Engagement Locations (CHELs).

The threat of a lawsuit looms large in the minds of Seattle officials like Mayor Jenny Durkan, whose office said she “thinks it is unfortunate that the Department of Justice would move to block a harm-reduction strategy to the opioid epidemic. However, we are not surprised and take these threats seriously. We continue to monitor the Philadelphia lawsuit while evaluating our legal options.”

Ronda Goldfein, an attorney in Philadelphia who sits on Safehouse’s board, told The Daily Beast that a court date has not been set, but that they are prepared to argue their case. “We have consistently maintained that an overdose prevention site, which includes a supervised consumption room and is operated for the purpose of saving lives, does not violate federal law,” Goldfein says. “We’re looking forward to the opportunity to present our arguments.”

Goldfein, also the executive director of the AIDS Law Project in Pennsylvania, sees many parallels between the modern day overdose emergency and the AIDS epidemic. AIDS activists put relentless pressure on the federal and local governments to fund research for treatment and invest in services like syringe-exchange programs that distribute sterile injection equipment to prevent the transmission of blood-borne diseases. The same way activists distributed syringes before it was legal, there are currently underground overdose prevention sites operating in U.S. cities.

“Among our challenges will be to address the stigma of drug use,” Goldfein says. “In HIV work, it’s clear that stigma continues to fuel that epidemic, despite medical and scientific advances in treatment and prevention.” Despite awareness around drug use as a matter of public health, drug users continue to be arrested and criminalized, she says.

The Department of Justice frequently argues that overdose prevention sites condone and therefore “normalize” injection drug use.

“Not only does the existing research on overdose prevention sites suggest that they do not encourage or increase drug use, but that argument just simply doesn't make sense,” said Brooke Feldman, a social worker in Philadelphia who has found recovery from her own substance use disorder. “The only thing these sites encourage is safer drug use for people who are already using drugs and unable to or do not wish to stop.”

A two-and-a-half-hour drive up the coast from Seattle is an overdose prevention site in Vancouver called Insite, which has been operating since 2003 on the Downtown Eastside.

“We know definitively there is a reduction in things like discarded syringes and public injecting upon the opening of these sites,” Ryan McNeil, a research scientist at the University of British Columbia who has studied the effects of overdose prevention sites. “You would think law enforcement groups would get behind that?”

“All these sites do is ensure that people who are using don’t die,” he added."
DHS plan for face scanning at airports sparks alarm,https://thehill.com,[],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/440323-dhs-plan-for-face-scanning-at-airports-sparks-alarm,"Lawmakers and civil liberties advocates are calling on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to halt plans to begin using facial recognition technology on nearly all departing air passengers within the next four years.

The agency’s plan has reignited the fight over the sensitive technology. Critics say facial recognition technology is not ready for large-scale deployment and that DHS has failed to establish specific rules to prevent abuses and policies for handling the collected data.

“The Department of Homeland Security is plowing ahead with its program to scan travelers’ faces, and it’s doing so in absence of adequate safeguards against privacy invasions, data breaches, and racial bias,” Sen. Ed Markey Edward (Ed) John MarkeyAmazon hiring alcohol lobbyist Tlaib rallies in support of Green New Deal at Detroit town hall Ben & Jerry's backs Green New Deal: 'We have to act now' MORE (D-Mass.) said in a statement to The Hill. “Homeland Security should change course and stop its deployment of facial recognition technology until it meets that standard.”

Markey and Sen. Mike Lee Michael (Mike) Shumway LeeGOP senator compares Mueller report's obstruction findings to 'Pinocchio' in 'Shrek 3' Dems sound alarm over top DOJ nominee Restore Pell Grant eligibility to people in prison MORE (R-Utah) have raised these concerns with DHS over the past year, releasing statements and sending letters to the agency urging it to halt the program until it puts specific safeguards in place. So far, according to Markey’s office, the department has ignored their warnings.

DHS has been implementing its “biometric exit” program, which photographs some visitors when they are departing the U.S., for years, expanding to 15 major airports with plans to reach five more. President Trump Donald John TrumpRussia's election interference is a problem for the GOP Pence to pitch trade deal during trip to Michigan: report Iran oil minister: US made 'bad mistake' in ending sanctions waivers MORE in 2017 signed an executive order speeding up the rollout of the face-scanning technology, and Congress in 2016 authorized up to $1 billion over the next 10 years to implement the program.

The stated purpose of the program is to identify non-U.S. citizens who have overstayed their visas, but it captures the faces of U.S. citizens as well. The agency says it has successfully identified 7,000 people at major U.S. airports who have overstayed their visas.

The DHS report published last week, which was provided to the House and Senate judiciary committees, is the latest sign that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) — DHS’s largest federal law enforcement agency — is fast-tracking the implementation of the program at the country’s largest airports.

That has privacy advocates in an uproar. They say DHS is ignoring concerns that facial recognition technology wrongly recognizes certain populations at higher rates and allegations that the agency ignored formal procedures required to implement such a wide-ranging program.

“DHS wants to scan your face before it has issued formal rules to protect your privacy,” Harrison Rudolph, an associate at Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology, told The Hill. “Without rules, there could be little that stands in the way of DHS breaking its privacy promises. That’s deeply alarming.”

According to a tranche of documents released by the Electronic Privacy Information Center last month, CBP skipped parts of the formal rulemaking process that requires federal agencies to solicit public comments before they adopt technology that will be used on U.S. citizens.

Privacy advocates have continued to call for CBP to undertake a rulemaking process, which would allow them to push for safeguards and limits on its data collection.

As it stands, CBP says it keeps the photos of those identified as U.S. citizens for 14 days before disposing of them. The agency keeps photographs of non-U.S. citizens for up to 75 years.

Neema Singh Guliani, a senior legislative council at the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Hill that she is concerned by CBP’s refusal to establish rules around how passengers can opt out of face scanning.

“The agency has not undertaken any rulemaking to clarify how it’s going to use this information, what privacy protections will apply, what recourse individuals may have in the event that their privacy is violated,” Guliani said. “They haven’t provided clarity or information as to how U.S. citizens or others can opt out of face recognition.”

The agency says it is working to propose a rule that would require all travelers, including U.S. citizens, to be photographed. But it is unclear what safeguards that would include.

Currently, CBP says passengers are welcome to decline to participate in the program. But according to the airlines partnering with the agency, very few passengers do so.

And CBP also says it cannot prevent the private companies that provide the facial recognition technology from keeping the biometric data they capture. Airports and airlines solicit third-party vendors to provide the cameras used by CBP.

“If any airline wanted to suddenly start their own photograph database, that’s their business to do with their customer, but it cannot in any way connect to us for any matching,” a CBP official told The Hill. The official noted that “nobody wants to be in the biometric game” or “keep this data” because they recognize it is a “responsibility.”

Those vendors include SITA, a multinational information technology company that focuses on airport transportation; NEC Corporation, a Japanese information technology company; and Vision-Box, a Portugal-based multinational technology company.

SITA, which has worked with JetBlue and CBP on biometric exit at three U.S. airports, in an emailed statement told The Hill that it does not distribute “biometric information to any party other than the customer ... and to CBP.” It said it only uses personal information to share with CBP and “expedite passengers’ departure.”

The other two companies did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment.

Besides the concerns around data collection, critics say facial recognition is not ready for large-scale deployment.

DHS face scans have been shown to misrecognize U.S. citizens, as well as young and old people, at higher rates, according to a September audit of biometric exit by the DHS Office of the Inspector General.

U.S. citizens, according to the watchdog report, were up to six times more likely to be rejected by DHS than non-U.S. citizens last year. And individuals under the age of 29, who accounted for 18 percent of all passengers, accounted for 36 percent of all passengers rejected by DHS’s system.

A CBP official told The Hill that its facial recognition system will be undergoing an external assessment over the next six months.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology, a non-regulatory federal agency, will be assessing DHS’s face scanning system for bias testing. The two agencies have signed all the appropriate paperwork and started holding exploratory meetings in the past few weeks, according to the official.

Officials are trying to calm worries about the new technologies.

“Nobody wants to have an anomaly in the way the system matches and operates,” the CBP official said. “The federal government has policies against that, and we don’t want to do that.”

Lawmakers, though, note that there are no laws in the U.S. specifically governing the use of facial recognition technology even as it is being rapidly deployed at airports. And they want DHS to address their concerns.

“DHS has a statutory requirement to submit a report to Congress detailing the viability of biometric technologies, including privacy implications and accuracy,” Markey and Lee wrote in a statement last month.

“DHS should pause their efforts until American travelers fully understand exactly who has access to their facial recognition data, how long their data will be held, how their information will be safeguarded, and how they can opt out of the program altogether.”"
Is Obstruction an Impeachable Offense? History Says Yes,https://www.nytimes.com,['Adam Liptak'],04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/us/politics/obstruction-impeachable-offense.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump has been consulting the Constitution. In a Twitter post on Monday, he recited part of Article II, Section 4, the provision that allows Congress to remove federal officials who commit “treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.”

Mr. Trump wrote that he had done none of those things: “There were no crimes by me (No Collusion, No Obstruction), so you can’t impeach.”

The president’s analysis had two shortcomings. It misstated the conclusion of the report issued by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, which made no definitive judgment about whether Mr. Trump had violated criminal laws concerning obstruction of justice. And it failed to take account of what the framers meant by “other high crimes and misdemeanors.”

The phrase is vague, of course, but it plainly does not encompass every ordinary crime. Rather, it follows two offenses that give a good sense of the kinds of crimes the framers had in mind: treason and bribery. Those are crimes against the state and the justice system that undermine the ability of the government to function."
A Trump Transition Staffer Calls for Impeachment,https://www.theatlantic.com,"['J. W. Verret', 'Professor Of Law At George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School']",04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/gop-staffer-advocates-trumps-impeachment/587785/,"Yoni Appelbaum: The Mueller report is an impeachment referral

The question I feared inevitably opened the interview: “How do you feel about Donald Trump?” I could not honestly say I admired him. While working on Senator Marco Rubio’s primary campaign, I had watched Trump throw schoolyard nicknames at him. I gave the only honest answer I could: “I admire the advisers he’s chosen, like Larry Kudlow and David Malpass, and I admire his choice of VP.” That did the trick. I got the impression they’d heard that one before. I was one of the first 16 members of Trump’s transition team, as deputy director of economic policy.

In time, my work for the transition became awkward. I disagreed with Trump’s rhetoric on immigration and trade. I also had strong concerns about his policies in my area of financial regulation. The hostility to Russian sanctions from the policy team, particularly from those members picked by Paul Manafort, was even more unsettling.

I wasn’t very good at hiding my distaste. We parted ways in October amicably; I wasn’t the right fit. I wished many of my friends who worked on the transition well, and I respected their decision to stay on after Trump won. A few of them even arranged offers for policy jobs in the White House, which I nearly accepted but ultimately turned down, as I knew I’d be no better fit there than I had been on the transition.

I never considered joining the Never Trump Republican efforts. Their criticisms of President Trump’s lack of character and unfitness for office were spot-on, of course, but they didn’t seem very pragmatic. There was no avoiding the fact that he’d won, and like many others, I felt the focus should be on guiding his policy decisions in a constructive direction. The man whom I most admire in that regard is McGahn, Trump’s first White House counsel, who guided the president toward some amazing nominees for regulatory agencies and the judiciary.

Yoni Appelbaum: Impeach Donald Trump

I wanted to share my experience transitioning from Trump team member to pragmatist about Trump to advocate for his impeachment, because I think many other Republicans are starting a similar transition. Politics is a team sport, and if you actively work within a political party, there is some expectation that you will follow orders and rally behind the leader, even when you disagree. There is a point, though, at which that expectation turns from a mix of loyalty and pragmatism into something more sinister, a blind devotion that serves to enable criminal conduct.

The Mueller report was that tipping point for me, and it should be for Republican and independent voters, and for Republicans in Congress. In the face of a Department of Justice policy that prohibited him from indicting a sitting president, Mueller drafted what any reasonable reader would see as a referral to Congress to commence impeachment hearings."
EPA head Andrew Wheeler never disclosed chemical lobbying job: congressman,https://nypost.com,['April'],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://nypost.com/2019/04/24/epa-head-andrew-wheeler-never-disclosed-chemical-lobbying-job-congressman/,"The head of the Environmental Protection Agency failed to disclose lobbying work he did for a company that is regulated by the agency, according to a federal lawmaker.

When EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler joined the agency in 2017, he neglected to mention on required financial disclosure forms that he had just left a two-year gig at Darling Ingredients, which has a hand in making fuel and fertilizers regulated by the EPA.

“These documents indicate that you may have improperly omitted Darling from your financial disclosure, and they raise concerns that you may have failed to identify other clients who paid for your services as a lobbyist during the period covered by your disclosure report,” House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings wrote in a Tuesday letter to Wheeler.

The omission came to light when his former lobbying firm, Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting, filed disclosure reports that showed the income.

Wheeler’s former work on behalf of EPA-regulated companies — including coal outfits — has come under scrutiny by Democrats.

At a town hall meeting Monday, presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren criticized the EPA chief for his previous work.

“No coal lobbyists for head of EPA,” Warren said at the event.

The scrutiny comes less than a year after former EPA head Scott Pruitt resigned in disgrace from the agency in July amid a cloud of ethics controversies.

He was probed by the House and the Senate for his profligate spending at the EPA, which included lavish first-class air travel, a $43,000 soundproof booth for making private phone calls from his office, and $1,560 on a dozen custom fountain pens."
Acting DHS chief predicts a lot of progress building southern border wall despite Congressional inaction,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/acting-dhs-chief-predicts-a-lot-of-progress-building-southern-border-wall-despite-congressional-inaction,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Tuesday that his department needed more troops on the southern border, where he expected to leverage a ""robust partnership"" with the Department of Defense and continue making rapid progress on a barrier blocking unauthorized entry.

He was responding to Fox News host Dana Perino on ""The Daily Briefing"" when she asked how he planned, without additional funding from Congress, to give voters the sense that the administration was making progress building the border wall that the president had made a central part of his 2016 campaign.

""We're going to show a lot of progress this year,"" he told Perino, noting that wall construction had already outpaced the progress seen in federal projects of similar size. ""We've already built the FY17 funding in less than two years. That shows how aggressively we're moving out on this.""

He also pointed to support from the Department of Defense, which he said has been ""critically engaged"" in border security and freed up the border patrol to focus on primary law enforcement duties.

FORMER ICE ACTING DIRECTOR ON BORDER: 'THIS IS A CRISIS I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE AT THIS LEVEL'

Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted that the wall was ""being rapidly built."" ""The Wall is being rapidly built! The Economy is GREAT! Our Country is Respected again!"" he said.

For much of the president's first term, he and congressional Democrats repeatedly clashed over the border wall. When the two sides couldn't agree on the issue at the end of 2018, the government shut down and only re-opened alongside Trump's decision to declare a national emergency in order to expedite wall funding.

Trump has taken a multi-faceted approach to immigration policy and faced legal challenges to many of his decisions. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on his administration's decision to ask about citizenship on the 2020 Census — a move Democrats blasted as illegal.

HOUSE DEMS FAIL TO OVERRIDE TRUMP VETO IN FIGHT OVER BORDER EMERGENCY DECLARATION

During his interview with Perino, McAleenan reiterated the president's concern about the law surrounding unaccompanied minors and migrant families at the border. He highlighted two particular changes he'd like to see from Congress.

""The two targeted changes we need the most are the ability to detain families together through a fair and expeditious immigration proceeding,"" he said.

""And secondly, the ability to have unaccompanied children, who are being enticed into the smuggling cycle from Central America — being able to repatriate them safely in concert with the Central American government,"" he said."
President Trump accepts Queen Elizabeth's invitation to visit U.K.,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'Michael Holden']",04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/04/23/president-trump-accepts-queen-elizabeths-invitation-to-visit-uk/23715917/,"LONDON, April 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will make a state visit to the United Kingdom in June, Buckingham Palace announced on Tuesday, a trip Britain hopes will cement transatlantic relations but one that immediately prompted criticism and promises of protests.

Trump will be only the third U.S. president to have been accorded the honor of a state visit by Queen Elizabeth during her 67-year reign. But the trip, from June 3-5, is likely to be controversial given many Britons deeply dislike the man and reject his policies on issues such as immigration.

Almost 1.9 Britons signed a petition in 2017 saying he should not be given a state visit - a pomp-laden affair involving a carriage trip through London and a banquet at Buckingham Palace. Protests involving tens of thousands of demonstrators overshadowed his non-state trip to Britain last July.

The opposition Labour Party strongly criticized Prime Minister Theresa May for pressing ahead with the ceremonial stay, which she offered Trump when she became the first foreign leader to visit him after his inauguration in January 2017.

May, who is facing calls for her resignation from some lawmakers in her own Conservative Party over her handling of the country's exit from the European Union, which is still stalled, will be hoping for strong backing for a post-Brexit U.S.-UK trade deal.

""The UK and United States have a deep and enduring partnership that is rooted in our common history and shared interests,"" May said in a statement.

The state visit would be an opportunity to strengthen already close ties in areas such as trade, investment, security and defense, she said.

The White House said the trip would reaffirm ""the steadfast and special relationship"" between the allies.

During his trip last year, Trump shocked Britain's political establishment by giving a withering assessment of May's Brexit strategy. He said she had failed to follow his advice such as suing the EU but later said May was doing a fantastic job.

""This is a President who has systematically assaulted all the shared values that unite our two countries,"" Emily Thornberry, Labour's foreign affairs spokeswoman, said in a statement after the visit was announced.

""Unless Theresa May is finally going to stand up to him and object to that behavior, she has no business wasting taxpayers’ money on all the pomp, ceremony and policing costs that will come with this visit.”

Few details of the trip were given, but it will include a meeting with May in Downing Street and also a ceremony in Portsmouth on the south English coast to mark the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy, France during World War Two. Trump will be accompanied by his wife, Melania.

TEA AND PROTESTS

Last year, Trump was feted with a lavish dinner at Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of the British World War Two leader Winston Churchill, and he and Melania also had tea with the queen at Windsor Castle.

The president then breached royal protocol by publicly disclosing details of a conversation he had with the 93-year-old monarch about the complexities of Brexit.

Trump's state visit has been a divisive issue for Britons since May issued the invitation, with 1.86 million people signing a petition calling for him to be prevented from making such a trip, leading to a debate in parliament in 2017.

More than 100 protests were planned across the country during his visit last year and police had to deploy 10,000 officers, an operation that cost nearly 18 million pounds.

The largest protest in London attracted some 250,000 people, according to organizers, bringing much of the capital to a standstill.

They promised a ""Together Against Trump"" protest in June.

""He is a symbol of the new far right, a politics of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism, of war and conflict, and walls and fences that are growing around the world,"" said Shaista Aziz, from the Stop Trump coalition.

The queen, the world's longest-reigning monarch, has met every U.S leader since Harry S. Truman except for Lyndon Johnson. Only two U.S. presidents - Barack Obama in 2011 and George W. Bush in 2003 - have previously been invited for full state visits.

After leaving Britain, Trump will travel to France to meet French President Emmanuel Macron, the White House said. (Additional reporting by Makini Brice in Washington Editing by William Schomberg and Frances Kerry)

Matt Gaetz says evidence of FBI officials improperly receiving incentives from the media in exchange for leaks will soon come out.

During an interview on Fox News late Saturday, the Florida Republican said the Justice Department inspector general is examining the FBI's relationship with some members of the press. But, he said some of this information will be made public before the watchdog report's release.

""One of the other nuggets that the inspector general is working on is the corruption that existed between the media and members of of the FBI,"" Gaetz said. ""Where members of the mainstream media were giving concert passes and athletic tickets and other incentives to people in the FBI to leak to them so we'll be seeing that even before we see the inspector general's report on how this fraudulent investigation began.""

Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced the initiation of a FISA abuse investigation in March 2018 after requests from both then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Republican members in Congress. He is expected to wrap up by May or June.

It's unclear where Gaetz may have gotten his information. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

However, his fellow GOP colleagues Reps. Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan recently said they discussed the FISA investigation with Horowitz. The lawmakers claimed the Justice Department and FBI had abused the FISA process and misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in their investigation and surveillance of President Trump and his associates during the campaign, as well as during the Trump administration.

Gaetz questioned the veracity of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, noting how he cited media reports ""as if they're gospel when they clearly are not.""

Mueller's report, which was released in redacted form on Thursday, found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller declined to make a conclusion about possible obstruction of justice by the president.

The DOJ inspector general released a report last summer that found many FBI officials talking to the press and attending ""social events"" with the media during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private emails, breaking with FBI policy limiting employees who are authorized to speak to the media.

In October, the inspector general released more information in a summary that said a senior FBI official, who had since retired, accepted tickets to a sports event from a television reporter who regularly covered the bureau."

""The goal of the policy is to drive up the costs of Iran's malign behavior and more strongly address the broad range of threats to peace and security their regime presents,"" a State Department official told the Post.

The announcement will come nearly one year after President Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal

During an hours-long tweetstorm, President Donald Trump complained that he wasn’t getting enough credit for presiding over a strong economy.

In an early morning tweet on April 23, Trump wrote, ""In the ‘old days’ if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism. Remember, ‘It’s the economy stupid.’ Today I have, as President, perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the Mainstream Media, it means NOTHING. But it will!""

In the “old days” if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism. Remember, “It’s the economy stupid.” Today I have, as President, perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the Mainstream Media, it means NOTHING. But it will! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019

We wondered whether Trump was right that historically, ""if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism."" (His mention of ""It's the economy, stupid,"" was something Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign team would say to remind themselves to stay on message.)

Short answer: Trump is wrong.

Looking at approval ratings

For starters, we’ll note that ""criticism"" of government leaders is virtually inevitable given the First Amendment, which protects ""freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""

""Presidents have never been ‘immune’ to criticism, regardless of the economy,"" said Jeremi Suri, a historian at the University of Texas and its Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. ""From Washington to Trump, every president has faced serious criticism from domestic adversaries and various groups. That is as American as apple pie.""

But even if you define the issue more broadly, Trump’s statement lacks evidence.

For a quick-and-dirty analysis, we looked at two statistics that measure the strength of the economy and public support for every post-World War II president: the unemployment rate, and the president’s approval rating from the polling firm Gallup.

We found four presidents -- Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and George W. Bush -- who experienced roughly similar low unemployment rates as Trump but whose approval percentages ranged from the low 20s to the high 30s.

Here’s a summary:

Truman’s strong-economy doldrums lasted for the better part of two years, Johnson’s for a year and a half, Nixon’s for a couple of months, and Bush’s for about six months.

What they all shared is a major issue other than the economy that sapped public support.

""If a president has a good economy, it gives them the chance to get a good approval rating -- but it’s not a guarantee,"" said Jeffrey A. Engel, director of the Southern Methodist University Center for Presidential History.

For Truman, Johnson and Bush, a war proved unpopular. For Nixon, it was Watergate.

""War, when it is protracted, tends to be a downer for presidential approval,"" said Bert A. Rockman, an emeritus political science professor at Purdue University. ""All things being equal, a booming economy is a help to a president, unless they are caught up in conflicts that produce high numbers of casualties over a protracted period of time and that seem to be at an impasse.""

Johnson faced problems beyond the Vietnam War. ""I think he could have survived the war if not for race riots and assassinations,"" Engel said. ""It wasn’t just one thing. It was the multiplicity of them.""

Even presidents who maintain their approval ratings aren’t immune from ""criticism"" during good economic times, Suri said.

Johnson and Bill Clinton ""were presidents during two of the best economic periods in post-war U.S. history, but both faced intensive criticism from Republicans and some Democrats,"" Suri said. ""The Republicans impeached Clinton at a moment of very low unemployment, strong economic growth, and even a budget surplus."" (Clinton’s approval rating on the eve of his impeachment vote in the House was 63 percent.)

Low unemployment rates don’t guarantee that everyone will be happy with the economy, either, Suri added.

""There is also the question of who benefits from good economic numbers,"" he said. ""Growing inequality, despite low unemployment, has been a source of criticism for all presidents since at least Nixon.""

The White House did not respond to an inquiry.

Our ruling

Trump said, ""In the ‘old days’ if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism.""

Even setting aside the constitutionally protected right of Americans to petition the government with their grievances, Trump lacks basic evidence for his assertion. At least four prior presidents served during good economic times yet had approval ratings lower than Trump’s are currently, usually because of wars or scandal.

WV MetroNews DOJ unit focused on political hot potatoes leads probe of Governor Justice's properties,http://wvmetronews.com,['Brad Mcelhinny'],04-23-2019,2019,4,http://wvmetronews.com/2019/04/23/doj-unit-focused-on-political-hot-potatoes-leads-probe-of-governor-justices-properties/,"By Brad McElhinny in News | April 23, 2019 at 6:56PM

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A subpoena requesting information about Gov. Jim Justice’s private properties did not come from federal prosecutors in West Virginia.

Instead, the subpoena is addressed from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Public Integrity Section, a designation that may reflect the investigation is high-profile and sensitive.

The Public Integrity Section’s own description of its role says it “oversees the federal effort to combat corruption through the prosecution of elected and appointed public officials at all levels of government.”

Mike Stuart, the U.S. Attorney for Southern West Virginia, has talked proudly of his office’s efforts to challenge public corruption. ““Public corruption is a cancer on our system of government,” Stuart has said.

Stuart’s office spearheaded fraud prosecutions of state Supreme Court Justices Allen Loughry and Menis Ketchum last year.

But the investigation involving the governor appears to have gone beyond Stuart and his staff.

“One of the reasons it could be taken to Public Integrity Section would be appearance of conflict,” said former assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Callaghan, who is now in private practice in Charleston.

“In my experience the Public Integrity Section would oversee any public official investigation. They may or may not take over the case. It just depends on circumstance.”

As West Virginia’s governor, Jim Justice is already a prominent political figure. Add to that his family’s sprawling, complicated and, by all appearances, financially-strained business operation.

A subpoena demanding records from the state Department of Commerce to The Greenbrier Resort, The Greenbrier Classic golf event and Old White Charities — all run by the governor’s family — was revealed earlier this month.

The subpoena is not evidence of wrongdoing, but does indicate an investigation is underway.

Last week, when reporters asked Justice what he believes the investigation is about, the governor said he doesn’t know.

“I don’t have one earthly clue,” Justice said. “I honestly don’t. And I want to re-emphasize that I want to be respectful of these people and the job they’re doing.

“Let’s just be fair here. They’re here to protect us. And that’s just the job they do. I guess I make a mistake now and then, and then I try to correct it.”

He went on to describe the economic difficulties of coal, where his family has many of its holdings, along with the catastrophic flood of 2016 that hurt The Greenbrier’s properties and forced the annual PGA Tour golf tournament to be canceled.

“It’s tough. It’s really tough,” Justice said. “And so, I guess, in an organization as big as our organization you surely are going to be able to find something that doesn’t look right or whatever. But I promise you to God above, you’ll never find anything that Jim Justice has purposefully done to benefit Jim Justice.”

The Public Integrity Section was created in 1976 following the Watergate scandal.

Following the dismissal of corruption charges against Alaska Sen. Ted Stephens in 2009, the unit’s reputation was perceived as tarnished.

That was further complicated in 2010 with a string of congressional investigations that ended without resolution. One of those was an investigation of Congressman Alan Mollohan, a West Virginia Democrat, over whether he had benefited from federal earmarks for his district.

By 2014, as the section rallied, a headline in The New York Times declared, “At Justice Department, a Watchdog on Graft Finds Its Teeth Again.”

The Public Integrity Section provides an annual report to Congress. The most recent one from 2017 depicts an active prosecutorial unit that remains involved with corruption investigations.

The report notes that cases handled by the Public Integrity Section generally fall into one of the following categories: recusals by United States Attorneys’ Offices, sensitive cases, multidistrict cases, referrals from federal agencies and shared cases.

“I can’t tell you for sure they’ve taken over this case,” Callaghan observed. “By appearances they have.”

In some instances, local prosecutors might recuse themselves.

“Public corruption cases tend to raise unique problems of public perception that are generally absent in more routine criminal cases,” the Public Integrity section wrote in its most recent report to Congress.

“An investigation of alleged corruption by a government official, whether at the federal, state, or local level, or someone associated with such an official, always has the potential of becoming a high-profile case simply because its focus is on the conduct of a public official. In addition, these cases are often politically sensitive because their ultimate targets tend to be politicians or government officials appointed by politicians.”

Similarly, a case may be so sensitive that it is best handled away from where it would have the most political impact.

“Sensitive cases may also include those that are so politically controversial on a local level that they are most appropriately handled in Washington,” the Public Integrity Section wrote."
Treasury's Mnuchin misses congressional deadline to hand over Trump tax returns,https://www.reuters.com,"['David Morgan', 'Min Read']",04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-tax/treasurys-mnuchin-misses-congressional-deadline-to-hand-over-trump-tax-returns-idUSKCN1RZ0W8,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin failed to meet a final congressional deadline on Tuesday for turning over President Donald Trump’s tax returns to lawmakers, setting the stage for a possible court battle between Congress and the administration.

The outcome, which was widely expected, could prompt House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to subpoena Trump’s tax records as the opening salvo to a legal fight that may ultimately have to be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Neal set a final 5 p.m. (2100 GMT) deadline for the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury to provide six years of Trump’s individual and business tax records. But the deadline passed without the panel receiving the documents.

After the deadline lapsed, Mnuchin released a letter to Neal in which he pledged to make “a final decision” on whether to provide Trump’s tax records by May 6. It was the second time the administration had missed a House deadline for the tax returns since Neal requested them on April 3.

“Secretary Mnuchin notified me that once again, the IRS will miss the deadline for my ... request. I plan to consult with counsel about my next steps,” Neal said in a statement.

In his letter, Mnuchin said he was still consulting with the Justice Department about Neal’s request, which he termed “unprecedented.”

“The department cannot act upon your request unless and until it is determined to be consistent with the law,” the Treasury secretary told Neal.

Democrats want Trump’s returns as part of their investigations of possible conflicts of interest posed by his continued ownership of extensive business interests, even as he serves the public as president.

Republicans have condemned the request as a political “fishing expedition” by Democrats.

Trump broke with a decades-old precedent by refusing to release his tax returns as a presidential candidate in 2016 or since being elected, saying he could not do so while his taxes were being audited.

But his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, told a House panel in February that he did not believe Trump’s taxes were under audit. Cohen said the president feared that releasing his returns could lead to an audit and IRS tax penalties.

‘NOT UP TO THE PRESIDENT’

Earlier on Tuesday, the White House said Trump was unlikely to hand over his tax returns. “As I understand it, the president’s pretty clear: Once he’s out of audit, he’ll think about doing it, but he’s not inclined to do so at this time,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told Fox News in an interview.

“This is not up to the president. We did not ask him,” said a Democratic committee aide, who cited a law saying the Treasury secretary “shall furnish” taxpayer data upon request from an authorized lawmaker.

Neal informed IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig earlier this month that failure to comply with the deadline would be viewed as a denial.

Legal experts said House Democrats could vote to hold Mnuchin or Rettig in contempt of Congress if they ignored a subpoena, as a pretext to suing in federal court to obtain Trump’s returns. Experts say administration officials could ultimately risk financial penalties and even jail time by defying the committee.

As Ways and Means chairman, Neal is the only lawmaker in the House of Representatives authorized to request taxpayer information under federal law. Democrats say they are confident of succeeding in any legal fight over Trump’s tax returns.

“Secretary Mnuchin is again choosing to violate the law to keep Trump’s records hidden away. This administration’s contempt for rule of law is without peer,” Representative Bill Pascrell, who has been leading the Democratic push for Trump’s tax records, said in a statement on Twitter.

“I stand beside @RepRichardNeal as he continues the crusade to impose plain oversight on this corrupt administration.”

Despite the law’s clarity, Democrats have long acknowledged that the effort would likely result in a legal battle that could end up with the Supreme Court.

“If the IRS does not comply with the request, it is likely that Chairman Neal will subpoena the returns,” Representative Judy Chu, a Democratic member of the Ways and Means Committee, told Reuters.

“If they do not comply with that (subpoena), a legal battle will begin to defend the right of oversight in Congress,” she said."
Opinion | Air Pollution Standards,https://www.nytimes.com,[],04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/opinion/letters/air-pollution-environmental-protection-agency.html,"To the Editor:

Re “Don’t Let a Killer Pollutant Loose,” by John Balmes (Op-Ed, April 15):

I agree with Dr. Balmes about recent troubling efforts to undermine established evidence showing the grave dangers of air pollution.

I am an epidemiologist and a former scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency who helped sift through thousands of peer-reviewed research studies that collectively support and strengthen the conclusion that exposures to even low levels of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) cause heart disease, cancer and early death — a finding that is confirmed by the World Health Organization.

Accepting the scientific conclusions in the E.P.A.’s assessment should lead to a reduction in the amount of harmful PM 2.5 that’s allowed from smokestacks and tailpipes.

Tightening our air pollution standards for PM 2.5 may be a problem for the polluters with cozy ties to the Trump administration and the former lobbyists now in charge of the E.P.A., but stronger air pollution limits will benefit the health and welfare of millions of Americans and also help mitigate the global climate crisis."

Tim Cook wanted Apple to fight US DOJ in court over encryption,https://appleinsider.com,[],,,,https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/04/23/tim-cook-wanted-apple-to-fight-us-doj-in-court-over-encryption,"Speaking at Time Magazine's first-ever Time 100 Summit on Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed a variety of topics, most notably saying he wished the company's encryption battle with the U.S. Department of Justice had gone to court.







In his Time talk, Cook claimed that privacy, and encryption have become ""much more meaningful"" to the U.S. public because of numerous ""events,"" such as those affecting politics. That may have been a reference to the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal , since harvested data was used to build voter profiles. There's also the fact that the Russian government used social media to influence 2016's elections.Privacy is important, Cook remarked, because if people self-censor to avoid surveillance, it stifles freedom of expression.Regarding that privacy, Cook sees device encryption as vital to privacy and security. Without a legal framework solidified by the courts, he believes it will remain under fire by the Department of Justice.In 2016, Apple famously fought the FBI and DOJ over demands for a backdoor into the iPhone of San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook. The company argued that it couldn't be compelled to write new code, and that doing so would fundamentally weaken the security of iOS.In the San Bernardino case, Apple complied with warrants for data that it held within days. However, the DOJ decided that compliance in that regard wasn't enough, and got a judge to order an unlock without consulting Apple beforehand. The DOJ's case ultimately fizzled when it turned to a third-party service —likely Cellebrite —that successfully cracked Farook's iPhone 5c.No useful information was gleaned from the iPhone crack by the third party.The DOJ's campaign against Apple was ""rigged,"" Cook said during Tuesday's interview, without elaborating on details except to point to recent revelations. Cook may have been referring to the fact that DOJ officials including present FBI Director Christopher Wray have long been angling for alternatives to end-to-end encryption, which Apple uses for services like iMessage and FaceTime. By definition, end-to-end systems can't be intercepted, even by platform creators, which some U.S. officials have said is making communications ""go dark"" to police and spy agencies.The CEO also addressed the company's general political stance, for instance saying that ""people have values, corporations are made of people, and therefore corporations should have values."" Today's problems ""cannot solely be addressed by government"" and require the help of business and academia, he went on, elaborating that Apple focuses on issues in which it has ""standing"" — such as immigration, the environment, and privacy — without backing specific parties or politicians.Apple doesn't have a PAC (political action committee) because ""it shouldn't exist,"" Cook stated. PACs have widely been criticized for wielding stronger influence than actual public opinion.The executive even addressed concerns that democracy is failing globally, given billions of people in poverty and the rise of authoritarians and outright fascists, even in America.""We have to admit that what we're doing isn't working,"" Cook suggested, for example referencing the ""no rails"" technology industry. The real-world costs of some businesses aren't being accounted for, Cook charged, nevertheless admitting that he's ""deeply a free-market person.""The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) ""isn't ideal"" but does represent a ""step in the right direction"" for keeping privacy in check, the CEO said. Such rules may ""eventually come to the U.S."" he added, though observing that American businesses tend to treat any regulation as bad regulation."

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt began working on policies that would aid one of his former lobbying clients within weeks of joining the Trump administration, according to a POLITICO analysis of agency documents — a revelation that adds to the ethics questions dogging his leadership of the agency.

Bernhardt’s efforts, beginning in at least October 2017, included shaping the department's response to a key portion of a water infrastructure law he had helped pass as a lobbyist for California farmers, recently released calendars show. The department offered scant details at the time about meetings that Bernhardt, then the deputy secretary, held with Interior officials overseeing water deliveries to the farmers, leading many observers to believe he was steering clear of the issues he had previously lobbied on.

Story Continued Below

But newly disclosed schedule ""cards"" prepared by Interior officials for Bernhardt show more than three dozen meetings with key players on California water issues, including multiple lengthy meetings on specific endangered species protections at the heart of his previous work. Those appointments were only vaguely identified on his official calendars.

Interior's inspector general is probing whether Bernhardt violated ethics rules by working on policies he had pushed as a lobbyist for the Westlands Water District, a job that earned his former firm more than $1.3 million in the five years before he returned to government service.

Bernhardt's ethics agreement barred him from participating in any ""particular matters"" involving Westlands until August 2018, one year after he arrived at the agency, and it was only after that recusal period ended that then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke publicly tasked him with working on California water issues. But the newly released information shows that Bernhardt had weighed in on discussions around Westlands' policy priorities for nearly a year by that point.

""They were creating the perception that he was not involved in these issues that his former client had a major stake in, when we now know he was deeply involved in them,” said Doug Obegi, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council who works on California water issues.

One previously undisclosed meeting likely to draw new scrutiny is a fall 2017 briefing on the implementation of the very provision of water law he won for the agricultural district after years of lobbying. The meeting adds to issues around Bernhardt's relationship with Westlands that have been flagged to the inspector general by outside groups like the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog, and congressional Democrats.

""I think with this calendar entry saying that he sat in on a meeting that is actually implementing the precise regulation that he lobbied on, I mean, that is really, really problematic,"" said Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel for the Campaign Legal Center. ""You cannot participate in the development, the implementation, the interpretation, the application of the regulation in individual cases if you lobbied on it prior to joining government.""

Interior argues Bernhardt handled ethical matters diligently, and that information about Bernhardt’s meetings, including numerous ones with industry officials, was kept off his official calendars due to security concerns, scheduling and convenience.

“Secretary Bernhardt is in complete compliance with his ethics agreement and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations,” spokesperson Faith Vander Voort said in a statement.

Transparency issues have dogged Bernhardt, who won Senate confirmation as secretary on April 11. Environmental groups and Democrats charge that the former lobbyist for energy and agricultural interests has failed to disclose who he has met with while shaping policy.

The National Archives and Records Administration has an ongoing investigation into whether the department violated the Federal Records Act by failing to keep detailed records of his meetings and actions.

From 2011 to 2016, David Bernhardt lobbied Congress to relax endangered species protections that restrict pumping from California’s main water hub, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. | Rich Pedroncelli, File/AP

From 2011 to 2016, Bernhardt lobbied Congress on various iterations of drought legislation aimed at relaxing endangered species protections that restrict pumping from California’s main water hub, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, to farms and cities in central and southern California. Westlands, which delivers water to about 700 farmers in California's Central Valley, holds junior water rights on the federal water project and is among the first to see its deliveries curtailed when supplies are low. For that reason, the changes stood to benefit its farmers disproportionately.

Bernhardt deregistered as the group’s lobbyist in November 2016, although records show he continued to advise Westlands on legislation and other legal matters through at least April 2017 — the month President Donald Trump nominated him to be deputy secretary.

The final version of the drought legislation Bernhardt had lobbied on passed in December of 2016 as part of a broader water infrastructure bill, with the key California provisions directing Interior to take a looser interpretation of existing endangered species protections for a five year period.

Shortly after being confirmed as deputy interior secretary in July 2017, Bernhardt launched work on a process on the same endangered species and pumping issues that could bring an even bigger and longer-lasting win for Westlands.

In October 2017, Bernhardt's calendars show he had begun directing a series of specific steps to rewrite the underlying protections for the Delta smelt, a 3-inch-long fish that lives only in the Bay-Delta and which scientists say is teetering on the brink of extinction in large part because of water pumping. He also directed a rewrite of protections for winter-run Chinook salmon, which also restrict water exports. Those changes are aimed at cementing far looser species protections than the drought bill secured, and for years going forward.

Although Bernhardt was recused from working on “particular matters” affecting Westlands until August 2018, agency ethics officials gave him verbal approval to work on some issues that affect the agricultural district before then, including endangered species protections. But written guidance from the ethics officials did not come until this past February, more than a year after his calendars indicate he began work on those issues, and several days after a New York Times report on his involvement in Westlands-related policies.

The Interior Department ethics officials concluded that Bernhardt did not have to recuse himself from the process for rewriting endangered species protections. It said the steps he directed Interior to take were not “particular matters” because they affect parties beyond just Westlands.

But independent ethics officials disagree.

Virginia Canter, a long-time federal ethics attorney who now serves as chief ethics counsel at the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said it does not appear that ethics officials got all the necessary details about Bernhardt’s work for Westlands before drafting what she described as a “very generic” memo.

She argued that the lack of detailed analysis in the ethics memo means it will offer Bernhardt less of a shield in the inspector general's investigation.

“This is a complicated issue,” she said. “If he was relying in good faith on advice of an ethics official, there should be evidence of what advice he was given. It should have been documented either in a memo to him or a memo in the ethics department’s files. They have produced none of that evidence.”

The Interior ethics officials determined that the overall infrastructure bill does not qualify as a ""particular matter."" But Canter said that the fact that the drought provisions had previously been in stand-alone bills means they may have qualified as “particular matters” from which Bernhardt should be recused.

That Bernhardt could go, in less than a year, from lobbying on a specific provision for a client to directing its implementation “seems to undercut the very purpose of the ethics pledge,” Canter said.

Indeed, Bernhardt's calendars indicate he was directly involved in the provision's implementation, with a Nov. 22, 2017 briefing on “WIIN Act Winter Operations.” The highly controversial California drought provision governs pumping operations in the Delta during heavy rains, which occur primarily in the winter in California.

And while much of Westlands’ federal lobbying has focused on endangered species protections and Delta pumping operations, the district also has an interest in a number of other, interrelated California water issues in which Bernhardt has played a role. Those include former Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposal to build a pair of massive tunnels under the Delta, the coordination of federal and state water project operations and a state plan to improve Delta water quality by requiring farms and cities to leave more water in the rivers.

Interior and state officials announced a grand bargain on some of these issues in late December, including a deal allowing the federal water project — which delivers water to Westlands and other largely agricultural users — to pump as much as 65 billion gallons more from the Delta, while requiring the state project — which serves largely municipal users — to pump an equal amount less.

The calendars also show that Bernhardt met with at least one Westlands farmer, Mark Turmon of Sierra Valley Almonds. That meeting, on Feb. 12, 2018, was about fires, Vander Voort said.

Another meeting, with former Westlands Board President Jean Sagouspe, appears on the calendars two weeks later, although both Interior and Sagouspe say it was canceled. Instead, Sagouspe said he met with Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Brenda Burman and Jason Larrabee, the political official overseeing the Fish and Wildlife Service — two key officials in the smelt protection rollbacks.

In February 2017, Sagouspe, a co-owner of Sierra Valley Almonds, published a column in the Wall Street Journal criticizing the “scorched-earth campaign by environmentalists” that restricts water deliveries to his farm. That column was published one day before Bernhardt, described as a member of the Trump transition team, spoke at a meeting of The Steamboat Institute, a Koch-backed group on whose board Sagouspe sits.

EPA head asked to back up claim that climate change is '50 to 75 years out',https://thehill.com,[],04-23-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/440228-epa-head-asked-to-back-up-claim-that-climate-change-is-50-to-75,"Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler is being asked to back up recent claims that climate change consequences are still “50 to 75 years out.”

In a freedom of information request filed by the Sierra Club late Monday, the conservation group requested the EPA turn over any documents that support Wheeler’s assertion.

Wheeler’s comments

came in an interview with CBS, when he told the network's Major Garrett that he would be focused on pressing issues like access to clean water since “most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out.”

Climate scientists armed with government research, however, are finding that climate change is having a much more immediate impact. The Sierra Club argues the dangers from climate change are fast-approaching and that Wheeler's remark to Garrett has no basis.

“We are confident that EPA’s response to this request will reveal that Wheeler’s assertion was unsupported by science and is inconsistent with the research and conclusions of the U.S. government’s career scientists,” Matthew Miller, a Sierra Club attorney, said in a release.

The group points to a number of ways the planet is currently impacted by global warming, ranging from wildfires to ailing coral reefs to record-breaking weather events.

EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said government experts often measure climate change over decades, rather than year-by-year, adding: ""Administrator Wheeler has continued to emphasize the Trump EPA’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""

Similar information requests proved successful during former Administrator Scott Pruitt Edward (Scott) Scott PruittOvernight Energy: Flint residents can sue EPA over water crisis | Environmentalists see victory with Green New Deal blitz | March global temperatures were second hottest on record | EPA told to make final decision on controversial pesticide Court orders EPA to make final decision on banning controversial pesticide Former EPA chief Scott Pruitt registers as lobbyist in Indiana MORE’s tenure.

Pruitt, in a television appearance in March of 2017, disagreed that humans were a ""primary contributor to the global warming that we see.""

He did not back his reasoning with science, according to internal documents provided following a lawsuit won by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) in June of last year.

Instead, the agency provided 12 pages of supporting internal EPA emails to PEER that showed how Pruitt prepared for questions on the Waters of the United States rule, the withdrawal of the Obama-era methane rule and EPA's proposed changes to vehicle emissions standards.

"Pentagon, DHS considering designating fentanyl a WMD, memo says",https://www.cnn.com,['David Shortell'],04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/21/politics/dhs-fentanyl-wmd/index.html,"(CNN) Top military and Homeland Security officials are considering classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, according to an internal DHS memo.

The synthetic opioid, blamed in health surveys for surging drug overdose deaths in the United States, has for decades concerned national security officials because of its potential widespread lethality in terror attacks, and in recent months, officials from DHS and the Pentagon have met to discuss an official WMD designation as a tool to disrupt the drug's widespread availability on the black market, the memo says.

""Fentanyl's high toxicity and increasing availability are attractive to threat actors seeking nonconventional materials for a chemical weapons attack,"" the DHS assistant secretary for countering weapons of mass destruction, James F. McDonnell, wrote in the memo, which was obtained by the military news publication Task & Purpose

A DHS official confirmed the authenticity of the memo, which was sent to then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in February.

The national security threat posed by fentanyl has remained largely out of the public eye, but the Trump administration has made thwarting its illegal distribution a centerpiece of the campaign against the opioid crisis.

Fentanyl and its derivatives were behind 30,000 of the 72,000 overdose deaths in the US in 2017, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Versions of the drug, which has legitimate medical use as a painkiller, are widely produced in China and can be purchased on the dark web in the US. Mexican cartels and elements of the heroin trade have been known to use fentanyl as an additive to increase the potency of other illegal drugs.

Late last year, after pressure from the Trump administration, the Chinese government said it would add fentanyl to its list of controlled substances in a significant shift that aims to curb the drug's manufacturing in the country.

Congress has also set new standards on the US Postal Service that will help customs inspectors screen and interdict packages with fentanyl and other opioids at ports of entry.

""Disturbingly easy"" to weaponize

Despite these efforts, it would be ""disturbingly easy"" to use the drug in a chemical attack, said Andy Weber, the former assistant secretary of defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Programs.

""Now that there's actually a market where one can buy large quantities of fentanyl analogues, it eliminates the capability gap and it makes it accessible to terrorist groups,"" Weber said. ""It's a game changer. In my lifetime I've never seen a weapon of mass destruction that is part of an existing black market.""

There are other officially-designated WMDs that are made from easily obtainable items, like ricin, which is extracted from the castor bean, though weapons experts said the threat posed by fentanyl and its derivatives are more significant.

""It's as bad as it seems,"" said a government consultant who requested anonymity to discuss countering-WMD projects he has worked on. ""Because of its strength, it's like nothing else that we've seen, beyond radiation, nuclear, chemical and high explosive. It's something that is potentially very, very dangerous.""

Fentanyl could be weaponized to devastating effect through its distribution in air and water systems.

US defense officials first noted the danger of a fentanyl attack when the Russian military in 2002 pumped it into the ventilation system of a theater in Moscow that had been taken over by Chechen rebels, according to Weber.

Dozens of hostages were killed by the fentanyl gas, along with the insurgents.

""That's when we at the Pentagon started to realize that militaries were developing fentanyl analogues as a form of chemical weapon and that we needed to start working on countermeasures,"" Weber said.

Formal designation proposed

According to the memo, there has been ""reinvigorated interest"" in addressing fentanyl as a WMD ""due to the ongoing opioid crisis ,"" and in recent months, senior DOD leaders, including the commander of the US Southern Command, have proposed the formal designation.

Another former Defense Department official, who requested anonymity to speak to CNN about sensitive topics, said the current consideration of fentanyl as a WMD is part of a broader discussion between national security officials around the classification of pharmaceutical-based agents.

DHS also had ""informal discussions on the topic"" in the first two months of this year between its sub-agencies and a number of DOD divisions, McDonnell wrote in the memo.

In statements, DHS and US Southern Command both said that they are ""constantly assessing"" a range of threats in partnership with other agencies, but declined to comment on the specifics of those conversations.

Countering illegal shipments

Designating fentanyl as a WMD would allow national security officials to more effectively divert resources to building technology that could detect shipments of fentanyl.

The Defense Department has been developing capabilities against non-traditional chemical weapons, like fentanyl, according to the memo, but ""certain operational [countering weapons of mass destruction] entities at DOD and elsewhere have been slow to act due to concern of getting pulled into the counter-narcotics mission,"" the memo says.

An official WMD designation would also open up new tools for prosecuting the illicit distribution of the drug.

""It's going to enable them to get moving on the ability to stop big shipments of it quicker and easier,"" the government consultant said."
"Obama DOJ has to fess up on FISA 'spying' after Mueller finds no collusion, GOP investigator says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/obama-doj-has-to-fess-up-on-fisa-spying-after-mueller-finds-no-collusion-gop-investigator-says,"A key Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee says the Obama Justice Department has some explaining to do.

Special counsel Robert Mueller's inability to find collusion between President Trump's campaign and Russia begs the question of why officials sought FISA warrants to wiretap one-time campaign adviser Carter Page, Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, said Sunday on Fox News.

He said Attorney General William Barr, who recently testified ""spying did occur"" on Trump's campaign, needs to seek answers.

""I'm glad that he has focused on getting the Mueller report out in a redacted form that people can see, but now his focus needs to be answering his own question, as he said, there was spying, the Obama Justice Department and intelligence community did spy on the Trump campaign,"" Ratcliffe said on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

""The question now that needs to be answered is was there a predicate for that?"" he added. ""Particularly when the predicate was supposedly that there was collusion. Now we know there's no evidence of collusion. Again Bob Mueller didn't say if there was insufficient evidence of collusion. He said, 'No evidence.' He said, 'There isn't any evidence.' So if there wasn't any evidence of collusion what was the probable cause, what was the predicate for the Obama Justice Department to go to the FISA court and represent that there was probable cause of a crime of a conspiracy with Russia and the folks that made those verifications, they got some explaining to do.""

Barr is expected to testify about the Mueller report in the next couple weeks. Barr, who sparked an uproar among Democrats earlier this month when he said ""spying did occur"" on the Trump campaign, is putting a team together to look into surveillance abuse,

Ratcliffe, a former federal prosecutor, said he hopes both Barr and Mueller can illuminate Congress on why the infamous Trump dossier was left out of the report and explain the ""troubling origin"" of the FISA warrants taken out on Page.

""Remember that the Obama Justice Department didn't just go to the FISA court and represent there was probable cause of collusion that we now know didn't exist on a single occasion,"" Ratcliffe said. ""They did so four times over a year, and so how is that allowed to happen and what steps is he taking, what investigations are underway, and what assurances can he give the American people that there will be accountability for folks who made false verifications about a dossier that was unverifiable because it was untrue.""

The dossier, compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, contained salacious and unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia. It was used by the FBI obtain a series of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants to wiretap Page. The first warrant application was submitted in October 2016, after which there were three renewals at three-month intervals, including in January, April, and June 2017.

Page was investigated over his interactions with Russians but was never charged by Mueller.

Ratcliffe has been an integral GOP investigator questioning top brass in the Justice Department and FBI in an investigation examining possible political bias. Last week, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., sent a notification letter to Barr saying his team ""identified several potential violations of the law"" as part of an investigation into origins of the Trump-Russia investigation and hopes to set up a meeting with Ratcliffe and himself to discuss eight criminal referrals."

Op Ed: EPA Hires Third Ex-Walker DNR Staffer,https://urbanmilwaukee.com,['James Rowen'],04-23-2019,2019,4,https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2019/04/23/op-ed-epa-hires-third-ex-walker-dnr-staffer/,"Sign-up for the Urban Milwaukee daily email

Team Walker and its reach pops up again.

It became clear after Democrats ousted Wisconsin’s GOP Governor Scott Walker and Attorney General Brad Schimel in November that secretly-crafted 11th-hour bills were to be sent quickly for Walker’s OK to maintain Republican/business-sector control despite the outcome of the election.

While those actions are being litigated, I’ve noticed another effective but less-visible method of maintaining and even expanding Walkerism: the growing cluster of key Walker-era DNR officials ensconced in senior positions at the US EPA’s regional office in Chicago which covers Wisconsin and several other Great Lakes state.

Trump’s selection of Walker’s long-time DNR Secretary and key corporate cudgel Cathy Stepp as Administrator of the EPA’s six-state Great Lakes-area regional office has been reported, and her selection of her former DNR deputy Kurt Thiede as Chief of Staff was also noted by media.

But here’s an update: the Chicago EPA office has confirmed that another former DNR official – – Russ Rasmussen – – is now on Stepp’s EPA team as “Special Adviser on Water.”

That’s especially interesting, as the DNR under Stepp was so disinterested in water policy that formal action had to be filed to force the agency to comply with 75 efficiencies in water management that the EPA prior to Stepp’s arrival had ordered, as I wrote:

The public interest law firm Midwest Environmental Advocates filed a Petition for Corrective action, PCA), in 2015 with the EPA to force the DNR into compliance with the Clean Water Act on 75 matters which the Walker administration knew about but failed to repair under Cathy Stepp’s tenure as Walker’s DNR Secretary for almost seven years.

And during the Walker-Stepp-Thiede-Rassmussen years, the number of polluted streams had doubled while state groundwater was alternately gifted to special interests or allowed to contaminate rural wells, kitchen taps and even baby formula, From the Minnesota Star Tribune comes this heartbreaking, infuriating story about the all-too-familiar water quality issues in rural Wisconsin’s Central Sands:

Celina Stewart, a young mother in the tiny town of Nekoosa, lost an infant daughter to a fatal brain malformation that has been associated with high levels of nitrate, a fertilizer byproduct found in the community’s drinking water. Her tragedy led to a community well testing program this year, which found that 40 percent of the homes had nitrate concentrations that, like hers, were far above the legal limit.

‘We should be able to go to our faucet and turn it on and safely drink water from our well and not worry about getting sick or dying,’ Stewart wrote to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.

Rasmussen admitted in a Journal Sentinel story that the DNR wasn’t adequately protecting drinking water:

A Department of Natural Resources official acknowledged Wednesday that the system of spreading manure in certain regions of Wisconsin isn’t adequately protecting drinking water supplies and said the state will recommend new application methods in coming months…

The agency for now isn’t suggesting new regulations, which would mandate limits on how much manure could be applied on land where animal waste and other pollutants are polluting groundwater supplies, [Russ] Rasmussen said.

Instead, he said, his agency, the state agriculture department and other groups are developing voluntary recommendations… especially in northeast Wisconsin, where water and manure are known to flow quickly through fractured bedrock and potentially taint the groundwater.

Rasmussen also warned his water staffers after the 2015-2017 Walker budget proposed major reductions in their division that, on office time, they should keep their objections to themselves:

Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources water division administrator Russell “Russ” Rasmussen sent his staff a “Hello Water Colleagues” memo on February 8th about “the Governor’s budget proposal [that] is now our DNR budget proposal” that ended with a warning:

An additional note – you may have your own personal feelings about provisions in the budget; however, the Governor’s budget proposal is now our DNR budget proposal. You are entitled to your own opinions and you may want to express them. That is your right. It is important, however, to keep your work and any political activities strictly separated. Any media contacts about the budget should be referred to Bill Cosh who is the department’s spokesperson on the budget.

Work rules prohibit use of any state equipment – phone, copy machines, e-mail or computers – for political activities, of which lobbying is part. In addition, you cannot engage in lobbying activities on work time or in the work place, and you cannot use your work title and affiliation with DNR when talking to legislators about your personal feelings about a legislative decision. Here is a link to the DNR Manual Code on political activity…

Bottom line: bad water IS the Walker legacy.

I cannot think of a worse group of people to advise on, manage or implement water or any environmental policy in Wisconsin or the Great Lakes region, but there they are in US EPA District 5 having helped Walker embed his ‘chamber of commerce mentality‘ across the Wisconsin public’s land, air and water.

A Darker Portrait Emerges of Trump’s Attacks on the Justice Department,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Katie Benner', 'Adam Goldman']",04-19-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/us/politics/justice-department-trump-attack-mueller.html,"“Attorney General Sessions carrying a resignation letter with him each time he had a meeting at the White House is a vivid reflection of the dysfunctional and unprecedented approach this president has taken towards the Department of Justice and federal law enforcement,” said Matthew S. Axelrod, a partner at Linklaters and a former Justice Department official and prosecutor under Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama.

Mr. Sessions resisted multiple entreaties to reverse his recusal so he could oversee and curtail the Mueller inquiry; by the time the criminal investigation of him ended in March 2018, he could do little to get back in the president’s graces.

Mr. Rosenstein, whose office received briefings every other week on the progress of the investigation, would have glimpsed the gravity of the situation as the special counsel interviewed witnesses.

He was also in the unusual position of being a witness himself in the investigation that he oversaw. Critics have said that role should have prompted Mr. Rosenstein to recuse himself from the inquiry, but top ethics lawyers at the Justice Department cleared him to oversee the special counsel, a department spokeswoman said. She added that the special counsel’s office never asked about or questioned that decision.

After Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey as the director of the F.B.I., setting off a storm of criticism, he asked Mr. Rosenstein to give a news conference and say that the firing had been his idea.

Mr. Rosenstein warned the president that the news conference was a bad idea “because if the press asked him, he would tell the truth,” Mr. Mueller’s investigators wrote. Mr. Sessions told White House lawyers that Mr. Rosenstein was upset about being used as a pretext for the ouster, and both officials told Donald F. McGahn II, then the White House counsel, that Mr. Trump was spinning a false narrative about Mr. Rosenstein’s role in the termination.

Mr. Rosenstein proved to be deeply rattled during the chaotic days after Mr. Comey’s firing. He discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump as president and suggested that he secretly record Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, according to people briefed on the events. Mr. Rosenstein has denied their accounts."

Posted to: Business, Labor

HARTFORD, CT (UPDATED 2:30 p.m.)— On their own time, Department of Labor employees delivered a petition to Gov. Ned Lamont’s office Monday asking him not to privatize any part of any Paid Family and Medical Leave program that’s approved by the General Assembly.

The petition was signed by about 300 of their colleagues.

“We as an agency believe we could do a better job administering the program,” AFSCME Local 269 President Xavier Gordon said.

He said privatization, one of the options being discussed in negotiations over three different versions of the legislation before the General Assembly, could also compromise the integrity of the program.

Democratic lawmakers are currently looking to negotiate exactly what Connecticut’s paid Family and Medical Leave Program will look like. House Speaker Joe Aresimowicz, D-Berlin, has said he expects the legislation to be passed in the next two weeks.

“Personally, I really don’t care who is administering it,” Aresimowicz said recently. “I don’t care. Public, private, let’s find out what works. Let’s get the product out to the people who need it.”

The two bills proposed by the legislature differ from the bill proposed by Lamont.

Under all three bills, all employees in Connecticut would contribute 0.5% of their weekly paycheck to a state-run trust fund, which would be used to pay workers during approved periods of leave.

How much employees would receive while they are out on leave differs depending upon which bill you consider.

The governor’s bill, SB 881, says an employee could earn 90% of their typical earnings up to $600 per week for anyone making around $15 an hour, and 67 percent up to $900 for workers earning more than that.

The other two bills offer a wage replacement level of 100 percent, up to a maximum of $1,000, which is much higher than programs in other states.

Asked about how firm he was last week on privatizing parts of the program, Lamont said the “hard line” for him is to “keep those options open so we can deliver service in the most efficient and effective way possible.”

Lamont said the Department of Labor would adjudicate any claims related to the program even if it’s overseen largely by a private insurance company.

Gordon said he doesn’t want to be sharing anyone’s “medical information” with a private company.

He said even if the Department of Labor maintained the claims adjudication, it would need to share information it collects for other functions with a private company.

“It shouldn’t be in two different areas,” Gordon said.

He said the state already has the infrastructure to manage this type of program.

AFSCME Local 269 Vice President Marsha Tulloch said she came from the division that crafted the current regulations for unpaid Family and Medical Leave.

“We are subject-matter experts who have the training and the commitment to do the job right — and do it impartially, with full accountability to the public,” Tulloch said.

She said they already have wage information and a list of all employers.

“I think it would be an easier fit and a quicker fit to have us administer the program,” Tulloch said.

It’s unclear exactly how many employees will eventually be hired to administer the program if it becomes law. Gordon estimated that it would be between 100 and 120.

The fiscal note for the legislation says the state will have to hire between four and eight additional staff — two principal attorneys, five staff attorneys, and one administrative assistant — at a cost of between $414,690 and $863,938 in fiscal year 2021.

Senate Republican Leader Len Fasano, R-North Haven, released a statement in response to the DOL petition Monday afternoon:



“This petition speaks to that fact that for some, paid family medical leave is not about creating a sustainable, effective and efficient benefits system. It’s about pumping more taxpayer dollars into state government to hire more state employees, even if that means less money for actual paid family medical leave benefits,” Fasano said. “If a private company can manage a paid family medical leave program at a lower cost with better results, why should the governor reject that direction? Why should the only path forward be one that involves hiring more state employees and putting more on the state’s credit card?

“These demands by union leaders show that many in state government are not focused on creating the most effective and efficient paid family medical leave system,” Fasano continued. “They are focused on adding more state employees at all costs. In addition, at a time when the Department of Labor lacks the ability to manage even its current responsibilities according to the state auditors, we should all have serious concerns about this department potentially managing any new program, especially one as massive as paid family medical leave.”"

USDA Scientists Must Say Published Research Is “Preliminary”,https://www.the-scientist.com,[],,,,https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/usda-scientists-must-say-published-research-is-preliminary-65771,"ABOVE: © ISTOCK.COM, QINGWA

Last summer, scientists at the US Department of Agriculture received a memo ordering them to label their peer-reviewed research as preliminary, The Washington Post reported last Friday (April 19).

Published manuscripts, according to the memo obtained by The Post, must include the following disclaimer: “The findings and conclusions in this preliminary publication have not been formally disseminated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy.” The disclaimer has been used on several studies dating back to at least November.

When The Post asked for more information on the requirement, USDA scientific integrity officer William Trenkle released a statement saying that “outside scientific publications can be factual presentations of data that do not present any policy or position of the federal government.”

The “potentially misleading” language of the disclaimer may prevent USDA scientists’ research from being published, Christine McEntee, director of the American Geophysical Union, tells The Post. If a research paper is labeled preliminary, a journal editor may think the paper isn’t ready for publication and reject it. “We hope that it’s not interfering with the dissemination of scientific findings that are important for the public,” McEntee says.

Even after publication, the boilerplate disclaimer might lead to misunderstandings of the research. “Any scientist reading a journal, seeing that, would be very confused by this statement,” Ed Gregorich, editor of the Journal of Environmental Quality, which frequently publishes research by USDA scientists, tells The Post.

The USDA plans to update the phrasing of the disclaimer soon, according to Trenkle’s statement."
The Cybersecurity 202: DHS is pushing cybersecurity support to presidential campaigns,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Joseph Marks', 'Reporter For The Cybersecurity Newsletter', 'April At Am']",04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-cybersecurity-202/2019/04/24/the-cybersecurity-202-dhs-is-pushing-cybersecurity-support-to-presidential-campaigns/5cbfb5981ad2e52459e24664/,"THE KEY

The Department of Homeland Security is offering to help test and improve the cybersecurity of Democratic presidential campaigns — and this time, these services are getting a lot of interest.

“We haven’t had anyone decline to have a call with us or not be excited about the resources we’re offering or the support or services,” DHS senior adviser on election security Matt Masterson said of offers to the crowded field of 2020 candidates, during a panel discussion at the Atlantic Council’s International Conference on Cyber Engagement.

That’s a far better reception than ahead of the 2018 midterms, when state election officials broadly rejected DHS’s offer to help with their cybersecurity early in the Trump administration. Despite the Russian hacking and influence operation that upended the presidential election, state officials were concerned DHS aid could lead to a federal takeover of election administration and were angered by the department's slow pace sharing information about Russia's 2016 hacking attempts.

It was well into 2017 before some states changed their tune and began working with DHS on girding their election systems against hacking from Russia and elsewhere in the midterm elections.

Now, the acceptance of free help from DHS is a sign the campaigns and states are getting on the same page as the federal government about the need for security to protect both voter information and the integrity of the vote.

“They, I think, realize the risk and vulnerability that are out there and the need to secure their systems,” Masterson said. “We haven’t had any conversations that suggest people aren’t taking this seriously and don’t see the real risks out there.”

DHS is offering campaigns all the services it offered to state election officials in advance of the 2018 midterm elections, including scanning their computer networks for bugs and doing more complex penetration testing, according to Chris Krebs, director of DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

Campaigns are especially vulnerable to hacking because they form quickly with a mix of professional and volunteer staff — many of whom many not be especially digitally savvy. They’re also typically hyper-focused on winning votes, donations and news cycles to stay in the race, rather than on tedious administrative tasks such as ensuring everyone is following proper protocols before accessing sensitive databases or guarding against phishing emails.

Krebs, on the sidelines of the Atlantic Council conference, declined to say which campaigns his division spoke with and which accepted CISA services. But said he hopes to work with all the presidential campaigns — Democratic and Republican — once the field of candidates is settled.

“If there are two high priorities on election security, it’s state and local [election offices] and its campaigns,” Krebs said. “We will provide whatever services they request.”

There could be trouble, however, if campaigns are wary of letting the federal government nose around computer systems that hold sensitive data such as donor information, opposition research on other candidates or campaign strategies.

That’s the sort of information Russia or another adversary might be most interested in stealing — either for blackmail or embarrassing leaks -- and in the greatest need of protection. But Democratic campaigns might also be wary of giving access to databases containing sensitive strategy documents to a federal agency that's part of the government of the opposition party -- and ultimately reports to a president who's running for reelection.

As the 2020 campaign progresses, Krebs said he’d consider creating an external organization that provides the same cybersecurity services CISA offers but doesn’t report directly to DHS.

A model for that organization could be the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, he said — a nonprofit organization that receives federal government funding and shares cybersecurity threat information among federal, state and local governments.

Liisa Past, a former Estonian cybersecurity official, described during the Atlantic Council conference the model that government uses to secure campaigns: Estonian government cybersecurity pros test every campaign website that touches the public Internet for vulnerabilities but don’t touch any internal databases.

“We knock on the doors and windows, and that’s worked very well,” she said.

Or, DHS could offer some cybersecurity aid with the assistance of organizations that have their own cybersecurity operations and strong relationships with campaigns, including Harvard’s Defending Digital Democracy project or the Democratic and Republican National Committees, Krebs said.

“We’ll be working through any option our stakeholders want,” Krebs said. “I’m based on demand signals, so if campaigns come and say, ‘This is the capability we need,’ we’ll look at the feasibility of pulling it together.”

PINGED, PATCHED, PWNED

PINGED: Former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was barred from discussing possible Russian interference in the 2018 and 2020 elections in front of President Trump, the New York Times’ Eric Schmitt, David E. Sanger and Maggie Haberman reported Thursday.

Nielsen, who the Times reported “had become increasingly concerned about Russia’s continued activity in the United States during and after the 2018 midterm elections — ranging from its search for new techniques to divide Americans using social media, to experiments by hackers, to rerouting internet traffic and infiltrating power grids” resigned under pressure earlier this month.

Here are more details from the Times: “In a meeting this year, Mick Mulvaney, the White House chief of staff, made it clear that Mr. Trump still equated any public discussion of malign Russian election activity with questions about the legitimacy of his victory. According to one senior administration official, Mr. Mulvaney said it ‘wasn’t a great subject and should be kept below his level.’”

“Even though the Department of Homeland Security has primary responsibility for civilian cyberdefense, Ms. Nielsen eventually gave up on her effort to organize a White House meeting of cabinet secretaries to coordinate a strategy to protect next year’s elections.”

“As a result, the issue did not gain the urgency or widespread attention that a president can command. And it meant that many Americans remain unaware of the latest versions of Russian interference.”

PATCHED: The United Kingdom will allow Huawei to build part of its next-generation 5G telecommunications network despite U.S. pressure, the Wall Street Journal’s Max Colchester and Dan Strumpf reported.

But the controversial Chinese telecom will only be allowed to build peripheral sections that perform less vital functions, the Journal reported.

More from the Journal: “The decision is a victory for Huawei in its fight against a U.S. campaign to block the use of its 5G equipment in the networks of U.S. allies. The U.S. has long held that Huawei equipment is a security threat, which the telecoms company forcefully denies....The decision came at a meeting of Britain’s National Security Council on Tuesday attended by Prime Minister Theresa May and several British government ministers.”

“They agreed that Huawei should be allowed to participate in the construction of the network, but would be barred from involvement in its critical core, the official said. The decision wouldn’t be final until announced before lawmakers in the House of Commons.”

Meanwhile, Ciaran Martin, the head of GCHQ’s National Cyber Security Center, downplayed the rift between the U.S. and its five main intelligence sharing partners over Huawei in a BBC Radio interview. “It’s objectively the case that in the past decade there have been different approaches across the Five Eyes and across the allied wider Western alliance towards Huawei and towards other issues as well,” Reuters reported from the interview.

PWNED: Krebs also revealed during the Atlantic Council conference that as soon as next week CISA will publish its list of “critical functions” that government and industry should prioritize protecting against cyberattacks.

The general idea of the list is that the “critical infrastructure” that DHS helps protect against physical and cyberattacks encompasses too much for the department to protect everything equally — so it has to identify the most critical of the critical infrastructure.

The list, which Krebs said will include about 57 critical functions, is the first major output from CISA’s National Risk Management Center, which the department launched last year to focus on long-range cybersecurity problems.

Krebs didn’t provide specific examples of critical functions, but said the benchmark is services “that if interrupted … would literally crater the economy.” An example that Krebs and other officials have cited in the past is Global Positioning System data, which is vital to everything from trucking to financial transactions.

PUBLIC KEY

-- Democrat and Republican leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee are demanding answers from Google amid privacy concerns about a database the company maintains of users’ precise location information, according to a letter to CEO Sundar Pichai.

The New York Times’s Jennifer Valentino-DeVries profiled the database, which Google calls “Sensorvault” and which law enforcement frequently seeks information from during criminal investigations, earlier this month.

Here are details from that report: “For years, police detectives have given Google warrants seeking location data tied to specific users’ accounts.”

“But the new warrants, often called 'geofence' requests, instead specify an area near a crime. Google looks in Sensorvault for any devices that were there at the right time and provides that information to the police.... Google first labels the devices with anonymous ID numbers, and detectives look at locations and movement patterns to see if any appear relevant to the crime. Once they narrow the field to a few devices, Google reveals information such as names and email addresses.”

The House committee’s Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) and ranking Republican Greg Walden (Ore.) want to know how Google uses the database, what privacy protections it applies and whether it’s storing other databases of location information.

An inspector generals’ investigation later revealed the FBI didn’t explore all possible avenues before asking a federal judge to force Apple’s cooperation, and several people inside the bureau believed the goal was to force a court precedent rather than to solve the specific case. The bureau eventually withdrew its case when a third party offered it a way to hack into the phone without Apple’s assistance.

“I have personally never seen the government apparatus move against a company like it did here in a very dishonest manner,” Cook said.

"Federal report contradicts EPA chief's claims that climate change impacts are decades away, environmental group says",https://www.cnn.com,['Ellie Kaufman'],04-22-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/22/politics/sierra-club-climate-change-scn/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump reminded the public on Monday, in honor of Earth Day, that while his administration values the environment, ""environmental protection and economic prosperity go hand in hand."" Trump and EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler have publicly stated that climate change is not the White House's main environmental priority.

In March, in his first televised interview after being confirmed as the EPA chief, Wheeler told CBS that ""most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out,"" contradicting the conclusions of top scientists in the US government and international organizations like the UN.

Instead, Wheeler stressed that access to clean drinking water was the greatest concern facing the environment, a sentiment echoed in the White House's Earth Day statement, which said the administration is working to strengthen the ""security and reliability of our drinking water and accelerating spending on water infrastructure.""

An analysis by the environmental advocacy group the Sierra Club, released Monday, found nine instances in which Wheeler's statements about the delayed impact of climate change were directly contradicted in the National Climate Assessment , a government-sponsored climate analysis authored by scientists from 13 federal agencies that was released in November. (there is no link to this analysis because they gave it to us exclusively)

Other major scientific studies, including one produced by the United Nations' International Panel on Climate Change, also contradict Wheeler's claims. ""Human-induced global warming"" has caused ""multiple observed changes in the climate system,"" according to the International Panel on Climate Change Special Report

Here are nine examples from the National Climate Assessment directly contradicting Wheeler's statement that climate change impacts are still 50 to 75 years away, according to the Sierra Club's analysis.

1. Sea level rise

Sea level rise ""has already increased the frequency of high tide flooding by a factor of 5 to 10 for several U.S. coastal communities,"" according to the National Climate Assessment. The report says that the rise has contributed to coastal flooding since the 1960s.

2. Higher temperatures

Between 1901 and 2016, the global average temperatures ""have increased by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit,"" and there is no evidence that the rise in temperature has been caused by any ""natural explanation,"" according to the report.

""The evidence consistently points to human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse or heat-trapping gases, as the dominant cause,"" the report states.

3. Hotter years

Each decade has been the hottest on record in succession over the past 30 years. Seventeen of the 18 hottest years on record have occurred since 2001, according to the report.

4. More wildfires

Areas burned by wildfires covered ""twice what would have burned if climate change had not occurred"" from 1984 to 2015. The area that was burned by wildfires between 1916 and 2003 ""was more closely related to climate factors than to fire suppression, local fire management, or other non-climate factors,"" the report states.

Trump was highly critical of the Interior Department and California's government during the California wildfires in fall 2018. He publicly blamed ""gross mismanagement"" for the devastating wildfires, saying it was largely caused by poor ""forest management"" in tweets

5. Harm to coral reefs

The report found that global warming has led to ""coral diseases"" and ""mass bleaching"" off Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Florida, Hawaii and the US-affiliated Pacific Islands. These diseases ""threaten reef ecosystems.""

6. Damage to military assets

Climate change is ""already affecting"" the Department of Defense's infrastructure, according to the report, by ""damaging roads, runways, and waterfront infrastructure.""

7. Clean water

Wheeler said that access to clean drinking water worldwide was ""the biggest environmental threat."" Climate change is affecting the water infrastructure that keeps water in our country clean. ""Changes in the frequency and intensity of climate extremes,"" compared with the 20th century, are ""deteriorating water infrastructure,"" the report states.

8. Relocation of indigenous communities

The report found that ""climate-related impacts"" are causing some US indigenous communities to ""consider or actively pursue community re-location as an adaptation strategy."" Because they are struggling with severe effects of climate change, the residents are considering uprooting their communities, which could make it harder to maintain ""cultural and community continuity,"" the report notes.

9. Injury, illness and death

Climate change is affecting the health and well-being of the American people, according to the report. ""Climate-related changes in weather patterns and associated changes in air, water, food and the environment"" are ""causing injuries, illnesses and death,"" the report states."

DOJ spokesperson Kerri Kupec said in a statement that Attorney General Bill Barr provided Mueller’s report on Thursday with only “minimal redactions” and, “in the interest of transparency,” the department had provided certain members of Congress, including Nadler, with a report that had “even fewer redactions.”

NADLER REQUESTS MUELLER TESTIFY BEFORE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ‘AS SOON AS POSSIBLE’

“In light of this, Congressman Nadler’s subpoena is premature and unnecessary. The Department will continue to work with Congress to accommodate its legitimate requests consistent with the law and long-recognized executive branch interests,” Kupec continued.

Nadler said in a statement early Friday that he subpoenaed the DOJ for the “full version” of the Mueller report and “underlying evidence,” requiring the department to comply by May 1.

“My committee needs and is entitled to the full version of the report and the underlying evidence consistent with past practice,” Nadler’s statement read. “The redactions appear to be significant. We have so far seen none of the actual evidence that the special counsel developed to make this case.”

Prior to the release of the long-awaited report, Nadler also made a request that Mueller himself provide testimony “as soon as possible” before his committee to explain his findings in the nearly 400-page report.

“It is clear Congress and the American people must hear from Special Counsel Robert Mueller in person to better understand his findings.”

While there was no immediate response from Mueller, Barr said at a press conference prior to Nadler’s request that he would be open to providing testimony on the report."
"New York, Vermont colleges get financial boost from USDA",https://www.timesunion.com,[],,,,https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/U-S-Department-of-Agriculture-is-a-college-13785945.php,"Green Mountain College had a USDA loan. Green Mountain College had a USDA loan. Photo: GMC Photo: GMC Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close New York, Vermont colleges get financial boost from USDA 1 / 1 Back to Gallery

Poultney, Vt. — When the president of Green Mountain College in January said the school was closing this spring due to declining enrollment and insufficient funds, one of their creditors was a name that would be more familiar to nearby dairy farmers than to those in academia. The school in 2017 had taken out a $19,500,000 35-year, 3.25-percent interest loan from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

College officials stressed that they had the money put aside for this year’s loan payment, but news that the USDA made the loan may have been surprising to some. In actuality, the federal agency has long made loans to small rural colleges through its Rural Development office.

“You’d be surprised, there are quite a number of New York state colleges that are in rural settings,” said David Morrow, vice president for administration and finance at Fulton Montgomery Community College in Johnstown.

FMCC between 2010 and 2012 received three USDA loans totaling $12.1 million for the purchase and renovation of 288 student housing units as well as furnishings. That also funded renovations like new heating systems and windows.

The advantage, Morrow said, was the interest rate and accessibility of the loan.

Commercial banks, which were still coming off the 2008 financial crash in 2010, wanted 10 percent down as well as a 6 percent interest rate – compared to the 4 percent that USDA was offering.

Other New York schools that have used USDA loans include Keuka College in the Finger Lakes region, Genesee Community College and Corning Community College.

“It was very beneficial for this area,” Morrow said.

The loans came as FMCC was looking to boost enrollment from foreign students, which has been a problem during the past few years. The Trump Administration’s hard line on immigration has kept some foreign students away. And like other schools in upstate New York, FMCC is countering a local population drain by tapping the New York City market. The problem with that is that’s a competitive market. As a result, the school’s dorms are about 80 percent full. “Those are headwinds hampering our recruitment,” Morrow said.

Some critics say the USDA should stick to agricultural endeavors.

“The USDA, in general, has certainly veered off its mission,” said Daren Bakst, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.

Bakst questioned the Green Mountain College loan in particular, noting that the deal was made when the school was already known to be struggling financially. “This was a particularly dumb loan,” he said.

“Do we need the USDA to become the lender of last resort for colleges that are struggling?” Bakst asked.

“It’s kind of hard to argue the taxpayers should be involved in these bailouts.”

It wasn’t immediately clear how much money the USDA is owed on the Green Mountain loan and whether the agency could take control of any property there. Local leaders have been meeting to try and figure out what to do with the campus. Ideas have ranged from use as a trade school to a satellite campus for other Vermont colleges.

Not all USDA loan requests are approved. The Annandale Campus Foundation, on behalf of Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, in 2018 sought a USDA loan for improvements and infrastructure, according to the USDA.

Bard College had received a bond rating downgrade to B1 in 2016 from Moody’s Investor Service. The school's foundation and USDA were recently in mediation over the denial, according to the agency.

Dept. of Education says 14 subject areas suffer teacher shortages across Indiana,https://www.wndu.com,['Karina Flores'],,,,https://www.wndu.com/content/news/IN-Dept-of-Education-says-14-subject-areas-suffer-teacher-shortages-across-state-508967871.html,"The Indiana Department of Education announced Tuesday that it will submit its list of teacher shortage areas to the U.S. Department of Education this week.

Every year, each state submits a list of areas with teacher shortages to the U.S. Department of Education to give graduates an incentive to enter the field of education and fill those gaps.

This year, Indiana is struggling with shortages in almost 15 subject areas.

“Anything STEM related,” said Dr. Todd Cummings, the South Bend Community School Corporation deputy superintendent. “Science, technology, engineering, math and special education.”

The 14 subjects suffering teacher shortages are:

- Business

- Computer Education

- Computer Science

- CTE Licensure Areas

- Early Childhood Education

- Exceptional Needs

- Fine Arts: Instrumental and General Music

- Fine Arts: Vocal and General Music

- Mathematics

- Science

- Secondary Language Arts

- Technology Education

- Teachers of English Learners

- World Languages

“It shows up in larger class sizes, it shows up in teachers having to do online courses, and it shows up in us not being able to offer all the dual credit courses that we want,” Cummings said.

“Computer science and technology are our future, and yet we’re at a point where we’re struggling to find teachers to fill those spots to educate our students so they can drive the future of our state,” said Adam Baker, the press secretary for the Indiana Department of Education.

The Indiana Department of Education says it’s working to ensure educators have good environments, higher pay and feel safe.

They and area school districts want college students to know that if they want to teach, the door is wide open to them.

“Here’s an opportunity, here is where the state is finding shortages,” Baker said. “If you’re interested in teaching in any of these areas, we are ready for you and we will take you in a heartbeat.”

The Indiana Department of Education commends school districts for stepping up in times of shortages.

The press secretary said when there’s a need, the state of Indiana offers emergency permits where secondary teachers can receive that permit and fill those voids.

"Lawsuits challenge Interior Department on fossil fuels, sage grouse",https://www.deseretnews.com,"[""Amy Joi O'Donoghue"", 'Amy Joi Is The Environmental Reporter For The Deseret News.']",04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900067269/lawsuits-challenge-interior-department-on-fossil-fuels-sage-grouse.html,"SALT LAKE CITY — Separate lawsuits are challenging the U.S. Department of Interior over oil and gas leases issued near a trio of monuments in the Four Corners region and revamped greater sage grouse plans.

The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance wants 35 oil and gas leases totaling 54,508 acres of public lands near the former Bears Ears, Hovenweep and Canyons of the Ancients rescinded.

It argues the lands are among the most culturally rich in the United States and home to cliff dwellings, pueblos, kivas, petroglyphs and more.

Landon Newell, a staff attorney with the organization, said the Bureau of Land Management failed to consider the ""big picture"" impacts to nearby monuments, including impacts to night skies and cultural heritage.

The lawsuit filed April 19 is challenging leasing decisions made in 2018 — decisions opposed by the BLM's sister agency, the National Park Service, which termed the proposal as ill-advised.

In a separate action, four conservation groups are asking a federal judge to block new plans they say allow drilling, mining and other activities across 51 million acres of greater sage-grouse habitat in seven Western states, including Utah.

""Sage grouse are an American icon that will be irreparably harmed by the wanton destruction of sagebrush habitats that the recent amendments allow,” said Erik Molvar of Western Watersheds Project.

Greater sage grouse once occupied hundreds of millions of acres across the West, but their populations have dwindled due to a variety of threats, including industry activity, transmission lines, wildfires and invasive species.

Molver said the rollback of protections need to be stopped, prompting the request for a preliminary injunction filed Friday in Boise.

The groups — Western Watersheds Project, the Center for Biological Diversity, WildEarth Guardians and Prairie Hills Audubon Society — are represented by Advocates for the West, a nonprofit, public-interest law firm based in Boise."
USDA guidance clears hemp cultivation seeds for import to USA,https://hemptoday.net,[],04-22-2019,2019,4,https://hemptoday.net/hemp-seed-imports/,"American hemp stakeholders on Friday received clarification from the the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that they can legally import hemp sowing seeds.

The guidance comes on the heels of the recently enacted U.S. Farm Bill that specifically removed any Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) authority regarding seed imports. U.S. stakeholders previously required hemp seed import permits from the DEA.

U.S. producers and seed exporters requested assistance from USDA as demand for hemp cultivation seed is soaring in the USA, with supplies from abroad pent up awaiting clear rules.

Whither the 2019 planting season?

While USDA continues to develop regulations for hemp cultivation under the 2018 Farm Bill, the Department said its directive lets farmers move ahead with import seed purchases, presumably for the 2019 planting season.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said earlier this month that farmers can import and cultivate hemp under previous regulations as USDA continues to develop new ones. That came after Montana Sen. John Tester informed Perdue that farmers in his state – the USA’s leader in hemp fields – were having trouble importing seeds due to DEA interference.

Wheeler did not list Darling Ingredients, a company that supplies ingredients for products ranging from fertilizers to fuel to pet and livestock food, when he first came to the EPA in 2018.

However, lobbying group Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting, Wheeler’s former employer, showed that Wheeler lobbied on behalf of Darling in 2015 and 2016.

“These documents indicate that you may have improperly omitted Darling from your financial disclosure, and they raise concerns that you may have failed to identify other clients who paid for your services as a lobbyist during the period covered by your disclosure report,” Cummings wrote in the letter, which was also signed by Rep.

“We will again respond to the committee through the proper channels,” said EPA spokesman Michael Abboud.

Federal law requires officials to disclose any client over the past two years that paid them more than $5,000, and Wheeler’s compensation topped that amount by about $300 in 2015. Those figures were supplied by Darling Industries in response to a request by the committee.

Wheeler has also met with representatives from Darling Industries during his time at the EPA, something an agency lawyer said did not violate ethics laws.

Wheeler, who lobbied for a number of industries regulated by the EPA prior to joining the agency first as its deputy administrator, has long been criticized by Democrats for those ties.

In February, the committee asked Wheeler to turn over more documents related to his lobbying work, but two months after the due date, the EPA has yet to comply.

“To date, you have failed to comply with the committee’s request for documents, including documents relating to your compensation from Darling,” the letter said, asking Wheeler to please let the committee know if he intends “to comply with this request voluntarily or whether compulsory means will be necessary.”

"Mueller report shows probe did not find collusion evidence, reveals Trump efforts to sideline key players",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/justice-department-releases-redacted-version-of-special-counsels-russia-probe-report,"After two years of suspense, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report was released into Washington’s partisan scrum Thursday showing investigators did not find evidence of collusion between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia – as Attorney General Bill Barr declared last month – but revealing an array of controversial actions by the president that were examined as part of the investigation’s obstruction inquiry.

READ THE REPORT

This included President Trump allegedly telling his White House counsel in June 2017 to inform the acting attorney general that Mueller had conflicts of interest and ""must be removed."" The report said Trump also fumed over the original appointment -- lamenting it would mean the ""end of my presidency"" -- first telling then-DOJ leader Jeff Sessions he should resign, and later trying to get Sessions to take back control of the probe.

Mueller ultimately did not reach a conclusion on whether the president's conduct amounted to obstruction, stating: ""[W]hile this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.""

But even though Barr's DOJ determined they did not have evidence to pursue such a case, the details in the report only fueled Democrats' mounting calls to not only see the unredacted report but have Mueller testify.

""This is exactly why we need to hear directly from Special Counsel Mueller and receive the full, unredacted report with the underlying evidence,"" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler tweeted, highlighting that section.

Trump and his legal team, though, declared victory upon the release of the report.

""No collusion, no obstruction,"" Trump said.

The swift reactions indicated the release of the report is only likely to fuel, not quiet, the long-raging debate in Washington over the Russia probe and serve as fodder going into the 2020 election year.

TRUMP DECLARES VICTORY AS MUELLER REPORT DROPS: 'NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION'

As stated in Barr’s summary last month and reiterated again at a press conference earlier Thursday morning, though, the special counsel did not find clear evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russia.

“[T]he investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,” the report said, while also saying there were ""links"" between the two.

“While the investigation identified numerous links between individuals with ties to the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump Campaign, the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges. Among other things, the evidence was not sufficient to charge any Campaign official as an unregistered agent of the Russian government or other Russian principal,” the special counsel report stated.

The version of the more than 400-page report that the Justice Department made public Thursday includes redactions, consistent with Barr’s plan to black out portions of the document—including grand jury material, information the intelligence community believes would reveal intelligence sources and methods, any material that could interfere with ongoing prosecutions and information that could implicate the privacy or reputational interests of “peripheral players.”

The redactions in the report were color-coded, labeled with the reasoning behind each redaction, with categories including ""grand jury material,"" ""personal privacy,"" ""investigative technique;"" and ""harm to ongoing matter.""

The report, meanwhile, went in depth on the obstruction of justice question, despite the lack of a decision on that front. In Barr's summary to Congress last month, he said he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein found the evidence was “not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.”

The report itself noted that they obtained evidence about the president’s “actions and intent,” and that presented “difficult issues that would need to be resolved” if they were making a traditional judgment.

The report looked at 10 episodes related to the allegations of obstruction of justice, including:

“The campaign's response to reports about Russian support for Trump; Conduct involving FBI Director Comey and Michael Flynn; The President's reaction to the continuing Russia investigation; The President's termination of Comey; The appointment of a Special Counsel and efforts to remove him; Efforts to Curtail the Special Counsel's investigation; Efforts to prevent public disclosure of evidence; Further efforts to have the Attorney General take control of the investigation; and Conduct toward Flynn, Manafort, [REDACTED]; conduct involving Michael Cohen.”

The report revealed that the president reacted to the news a special counsel had been appointed by telling his advisers that it was “the end of my presidency. I'm f---ed,” and demanding that Sessions resign. Once Sessions submitted his resignation, the president did not accept it.

The report also detailed Trump's alleged effort to have Mueller sidelined, amid reports at the time that the special counsel’s office was investigating the president for obstruction of justice. The report detailed a dramatic moment where the president's White House counsel apparently rejected the push.

“On June 17, 2017, the president called [White House Counsel Don] McGahn at home and directed him to call the Acting Attorney General and say that the Special Counsel had conflicts of interest and must be removed. McGahn did not carry out the direction, however, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre,” the report stated, referencing the Watergate scandal.

The report also revealed that when the media reported of the president’s request for McGahn to have Mueller removed, the president directed White House officials “to tell McGahn to dispute the story and create a record stating he had not been ordered to have the special counsel removed.”

“McGahn refused to back away from what he remembered happening,” the report said.

The report went on to explain that two days after the initial request to McGahn, the president made another attempt to “affect the course of the Russia investigation.”

BARR AFFIRMS MUELLER PROBE FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF RUSSIA-TRUMP COLLUSION

“On June 19, 2017, the president met one-on-one in the Oval Office with his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a trusted advisor outside the government, and dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to Sessions,” the report said.

“The message said that Sessions should publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation was ‘very unfair’ to the president, the president had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with the Special Counsel and ‘let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections.’”

Lewandowski, according to the report, said he understood what the president wanted Sessions to do.

“Lewandowski did not want to deliver the president’s message personally,” the report said, “so he asked senior White House official Rick Dearborn to deliver it to Sessions.”

Dearborn ultimately did not follow through with the task.

The report also said “substantial evidence indicates that the catalyst” for the decision to fire FBI Director James Comey was his “unwillingness to publicly state that the president was not personally under investigation.” But the report said the evidence “does not establish that the termination of Comey was designed to cover up a conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia.”

The report stated that while the areas the special counsel investigated “involved discrete acts, the overall pattern of the President’s conduct towards the investigations” shed light on the “nature” of his acts. The special counsel determined that the actions investigated are divided into “two phases,” which they said reflected “a possible shift in the President’s motives.”

TRUMP THOUGHT PRESIDENCY WAS OVER WHEN TOLD OF MUELLER'S APPOINTMENT: 'THIS IS THE END...I'M F---ED'

The first phase was related to the firing of Comey. “During that time, the President had been repeatedly told he was not personally under investigation. Soon after the firing of Comey and the appointment of the Special Counsel, however, the President became aware that his own conduct was being investigated in an obstruction-of-justice inquiry,” the report said, adding that “at that point, the president engaged in a second phase of conduct, involving public attacks on the investigation, non-public efforts to control it, and efforts in both public and private to encourage witnesses not to cooperate with the investigation.”

The evidence detailed in the report related to allegations of obstruction of justice, though, is likely to come under intense scrutiny from congressional Democrats and could be used in their sweeping Trump-related investigations.

The president’s legal team, in anticipation of obstruction of justice details in the report, has prepared their own report to counter the allegations.

“They assumed all along that there was going to be a finding of no collusion, so the rebuttal is about obstruction,” a source close to Trump’s legal team told Fox News. “They are preparing a rebuttal to presumed allegations which will be refuted.”

The special counsel wrote that they sought a voluntary interview with the president, but after more than a year of discussing the prospect of one, the president declined. The president did, though, agree to answer written questions on certain Russia-related topics. But according to the report, he “did not similarly agree to provide written answers to questions on obstruction topics or questions on events during the transition.”

Mueller’s team also said that, while they believed they had the “authority and legal justification” to do so, they decided not to issue a grand jury subpoena to obtain the president’s testimony.

Embassies targeted in hacking campaign mounted with bogus State Department spreadsheet: Report,https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Andrew Blake']",04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/apr/23/embassies-targeted-in-hacking-campaign-mounted-wit/,"Embassies in Europe have wound up on the receiving end of an ongoing hacking campaign with roots in Russia, a multinational cybersecurity firm warned Monday.

Researchers at Check Point reported becoming aware of a weaponized spreadsheet being emailed to targets described as “government finance authorities and representatives in several embassies in Europe.”

Attached to emails bearing the subject “Military Financing Program,” the booby-trapped document bears the seal of the U.S. State Department and claims to contain top secret information that can only be accessed if the recipient follows instructions that actually executes malicious code on their computer, according to the report.

Individuals who opened the purported State Department spreadsheet and followed the included steps would have allowed attackers to gain “full control” of the infected computer, Check Point reported.

Among the intended targets were officials representative of Nepal, Guyana, Kenya, Italy, Liberia, Bermuda and Lebanon, the report found.

“It is hard to tell if there are geopolitical motives behind this campaign by looking solely at the list of countries it was targeting, since it was not after a specific region and the victims came from different places in the world,” Check Point reported. “Nevertheless, the observed victims list reveals a particular interest of the attacker in the public financial sector, as they all appear to be handpicked government officials from several revenue authorities.”

Despite having some hallmarks a well-thought out attack, Check Point reported that its researchers were able to trace the malicious code to a Russian speaker who has previously shared excerpts on internet hacking forums using the handle “EvaPiks.”

While far from definitive attribution, Check Point is hardly the only cybersecurity firm to spot Russian hackers using the State Department to stage attacks. FireEye and CrowdStrike both reported late last year that “Cozy Bear,” the name given by cybersecurity professionals to hackers associated with Russian intelligence, were suspected of impersonating State Department employees as part of a phishing scheme targeting potential victims across several critical sectors.

The State Department did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Founded in 1993 in in Tel Aviv, Israel, Check Point boasted deferred revenues of $1.3 billion in its first quarter report earlier this week, a 13 percent increase year over year.

Check Point was able to stop the hacking campaign using proprietary cybersecurity services, according to its report

Homeland Security considers designating fentanyl a weapon of mass destruction,https://fox8.com,[],04-22-2019,2019,4,https://fox8.com/2019/04/22/homeland-security-considers-designating-fentanyl-a-weapon-of-mass-destruction/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Top military and Homeland Security officials are considering classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, according to an internal DHS memo.

The synthetic opioid, blamed in health surveys for surging drug overdose deaths in the United States, has for decades concerned national security officials because of its potential widespread lethality in terror attacks, and in recent months, officials from DHS and the Pentagon have met to discuss an official WMD designation as a tool to disrupt the drug’s widespread availability on the black market, the memo says.

“Fentanyl’s high toxicity and increasing availability are attractive to threat actors seeking nonconventional materials for a chemical weapons attack,” the DHS assistant secretary for countering weapons of mass destruction, James F. McDonnell, wrote in the memo, which was obtained by the military news publication Task & Purpose.

A DHS official confirmed the authenticity of the memo, which was sent to then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in February.

The national security threat posed by fentanyl has remained largely out of the public eye, but the Trump administration has made thwarting its illegal distribution a centerpiece of the campaign against the opioid crisis.

Fentanyl and its derivatives were behind 30,000 of the 72,000 overdose deaths in the US in 2017, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.

Versions of the drug, which has legitimate medical use as a painkiller, are widely produced in China and can be purchased on the dark web in the US. Mexican cartels and elements of the heroin trade have been known to use fentanyl as an additive to increase the potency of other illegal drugs.

Late last year, after pressure from the Trump administration, the Chinese government said it would add fentanyl to its list of controlled substances in a significant shift that aims to curb the drug’s manufacturing in the country.

Congress has also set new standards on the US Postal Service that will help customs inspectors screen and interdict packages with fentanyl and other opioids at ports of entry.

“Disturbingly easy” to weaponize

Despite these efforts, it would be “disturbingly easy” to use the drug in a chemical attack, said Andy Weber, the former assistant secretary of defense for Nuclear, Chemical and Biological Defense Programs.

“Now that there’s actually a market where one can buy large quantities of fentanyl analogues, it eliminates the capability gap and it makes it accessible to terrorist groups,” Weber said. “It’s a game changer. In my lifetime I’ve never seen a weapon of mass destruction that is part of an existing black market.”

There are other officially-designated WMDs that are made from easily obtainable items, like ricin, which is extracted from the castor bean, though weapons experts said the threat posed by fentanyl and its derivatives are more significant.

“It’s as bad as it seems,” said a government consultant who requested anonymity to discuss countering-WMD projects he has worked on. “Because of its strength, it’s like nothing else that we’ve seen, beyond radiation, nuclear, chemical and high explosive. It’s something that is potentially very, very dangerous.”

Fentanyl could be weaponized to devastating effect through its distribution in air and water systems.

US defense officials first noted the danger of a fentanyl attack when the Russian military in 2002 pumped it into the ventilation system of a theater in Moscow that had been taken over by Chechen rebels, according to Weber.

Dozens of hostages were killed by the fentanyl gas, along with the insurgents.

“That’s when we at the Pentagon started to realize that militaries were developing fentanyl analogues as a form of chemical weapon and that we needed to start working on countermeasures,” Weber said.

Formal designation proposed

According to the memo, there has been “reinvigorated interest” in addressing fentanyl as a WMD “due to the ongoing opioid crisis,” and in recent months, senior DOD leaders, including the commander of the US Southern Command, have proposed the formal designation.

Another former Defense Department official, who requested anonymity to speak to CNN about sensitive topics, said the current consideration of fentanyl as a WMD is part of a broader discussion between national security officials around the classification of pharmaceutical-based agents.

DHS also had “informal discussions on the topic” in the first two months of this year between its sub-agencies and a number of DOD divisions, McDonnell wrote in the memo.

In statements, DHS and US Southern Command both said that they are “constantly assessing” a range of threats in partnership with other agencies, but declined to comment on the specifics of those conversations.

Countering illegal shipments

Designating fentanyl as a WMD would allow national security officials to more effectively divert resources to building technology that could detect shipments of fentanyl.

The Defense Department has been developing capabilities against non-traditional chemical weapons, like fentanyl, according to the memo, but “certain operational [countering weapons of mass destruction] entities at DOD and elsewhere have been slow to act due to concern of getting pulled into the counter-narcotics mission,” the memo says.

An official WMD designation would also open up new tools for prosecuting the illicit distribution of the drug.

“It’s going to enable them to get moving on the ability to stop big shipments of it quicker and easier,” the government consultant said"
