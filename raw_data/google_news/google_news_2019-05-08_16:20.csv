Trump Asserts Executive Privilege Over Full Mueller Report,https://www.nytimes.com,['Nicholas Fandos'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/congress-contempt-barr.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump asserted executive privilege on Wednesday in an effort to shield hidden portions of Robert S. Mueller III’s unredacted report and the evidence he collected from Congress.

The assertion, Mr. Trump’s first use of the secrecy powers as president, came as the House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote Wednesday morning to recommend the House of Representatives hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena for the same material.

“This is to advise you that the president has asserted executive privilege over the entirety of the subpoenaed materials,” a Justice Department official, Stephen E. Boyd, wrote Wednesday morning, referencing not only the Mueller report but the underlying evidence that House Democrats are seeking."
Trump blasts 'hit job' New York Times report on losses in tax returns,https://www.foxnews.com,['Ronn Blitzer'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blasts-hit-job-nytimes-story,"President Trump fired back Wednesday at a New York Times report detailing huge losses in his real estate empire during the turbulent '80s and '90s, calling the story ""highly inaccurate"" and downplaying the red ink in the documents.

The report, citing tax records, stated that Trump claimed more than $1 billion in losses from his real estate business between 1985 and 1994, but the president claimed Wednesday this was a common practice for developers during that time and largely represented depreciation.

CNN ANCHORS CELEBRATE TRUMP'S LEAKED TAX DOCS

""You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes,"" Trump said in a morning tweet, saying that ""almost all real estate developers"" used this as a ""tax shelter."" He went on to say that the Times report ""is a highly inaccurate Fake News hit job!""

The report indicated that Trump was able to use these losses to avoid paying taxes in eight of the 10 years covered by the tax documents, which the Times said were acquired from a source ""who had legal access to it.""

TREASURY SECRETARY MNUCHIN DENIES HOUSE DEM'S REQUEST FOR TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS

Democrats have been seeking Trump's more recent tax returns ever since gaining control of the House after the 2018 midterm elections. The House Ways and Means Committee requested the president's federal tax returns, but Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin rejected them, citing a lack of ""legitimate legislative purpose.""

Democrats could respond to this refusal by issuing a subpoena, or they could file a lawsuit seeking a court order for Trump's tax returns.

"""All I'm Thinking Is, 'I'm Going to Die'"": Howard Stern Reveals Cancer Scare, Trump Regrets and Details of a Dishy New Book",https://www.hollywoodreporter.com,['Lacey Rose'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/howard-stern-reveals-cancer-scare-trump-regrets-details-a-dishy-new-book-1208773,"After a health crisis that had him ""scared s—less,"" the $90 million-a-year radio legend opens up about retirement, the one time he lied to his listeners and his metamorphosis from shock jock to insightful interviewer: ""I'd feel really f—ing s—ty if I hadn't evolved.""

On Wednesday, May 10, 2017, for the first time in memory, Howard Stern abruptly canceled that day's show. His listeners, a famously loyal subset of SiriusXM's 36 million subscribers who've made Stern a part of their lives since he rose to prominence in the '80s as radio's boundary-pushing ""shock jock,"" were understandably alarmed. Reddit lit up with crackpot theories, and a handful of dogged reporters tracked down the host's elderly parents to check up on him.

By Monday, the self-described king of all media was back on the air, poking fun at the hullaballoo, as many hoped he would. It was just the flu, he told his audience: ""Why is it such a big deal that I took a fucking day off?""

Turns out, he was lying through his teeth.

On the morning in question, Stern wasn't home with a fever or runny nose; he was being carted into surgery. For the better part of the previous year, he'd been shuttling between appointments as doctors monitored a low white blood cell count revealed during a routine checkup and, later, discovered a growth on his kidney. The chance that it was cancerous: 90 percent.

For a man who lives his life on-air, divulging such personal details as his first wife's miscarriage and his reputedly undersized penis, he'd been uncharacteristically discreet about his latest struggle. In fact, he told only his very inner circle, a group that included his second wife, Beth, his three daughters, his therapist and his on-air foil of nearly four decades, Robin Quivers, herself a cancer survivor. Until all this, Stern had considered himself invincible — at 65, his 6-foot-5 frame was still enviably trim, his head endowed with a thick mop of curls. He ate well and exercised often. Cancer was a ridiculous notion.

""And now all I'm thinking is, 'I'm going to die,' "" he recalls in an interview, his first time discussing the health issue publicly. ""And I'm scared shitless.""

A couple of hours and seven incisions to his abdomen later, he came out of surgery to learn it had all been a scare. A tiny, harmless cyst. The news should have been comforting. But for the first time in Stern's adult life, he'd come face-to-face with his own mortality, and now there was no turning back.

In the 24 months since, he's found himself wondering often if he's done it all wrong. Despite fame and fortune unrivaled in his medium, Stern says he's a mountain of regret. He beats himself up over the father he couldn't be to those three girls, now grown and living elsewhere; and the husband he never was to their mother, Alison, who finally left him in 1999. He can't read his first two best-selling books, Private Parts (1993) and Miss America ('95), without cringing at his own narcissism, and he insists nearly every one of the interviews he conducted during his pre-satellite radio days makes him sick.

""I was so completely fucked up back then,"" he says, his head shaking with disgust on this morning in early April. ""I didn't know what was up and what was down, and there was no room for anybody else on the planet."" His more recent metamorphosis, the result of age, a healthy marriage and intensive therapy, has revealed sensitivities he didn't know he had. It's also sharpened his skills as an interviewer.

Dressed now like an aging rocker with a pair of dark jeans, boots and his signature shades perched just above his brows, Stern is sprawled out on the charcoal-gray couch usually reserved for guests in his midtown Manhattan studio. He's explaining how his brush with cancer is a key reason he agreed to write his first book in two decades, Howard Stern Comes Again, a curated collection of edited transcripts from his favorite interviews — with everyone from Billy Joel to Donald Trump (more on him later) — wrapped in his own memories and candid self-reflection. There's considerably more in the book on his health scare, too, along with his musings on fame, sex and spirituality. ""It's as much his autobiography in conversation as it is a tour through American pop culture over the last 20 years,"" says Jonathan Karp, publisher of Simon & Schuster, which will release the book May 14. That brush is also the reason Stern's been having real discussions about what's next once his contract with SiriusXM, which reportedly pays him $90 million a year, expires at the end of 2020.

""I'm at a place now where I am trying to figure out how to spend the rest of my life, however long that might be,"" he says. He's been flirting with the idea of retirement in conversation with close friends and, occasionally, on the air. ""It seems weird to me not to have this,"" he nods at the desk where he spends four to five hours three mornings a week — but maybe it would be great. Maybe his painting could improve. Maybe he could take that sketch class he's been thinking about. Maybe he and Beth, 46, and their coterie of rescue cats, could travel more, visiting those kids he doesn't get to see enough of.

He wouldn't be bored, he's sure of that; but is Howard Stern really ready to shut up?

***

America's most famous radio personality has been screaming for attention his entire life. Early on, it was through performance: dirty puppet shows for his pals, impressions for his parents. His radio engineer father would offer feedback, if not exactly encouragement — and a valuable lesson in how to keep an audience engaged. ""Stop!"" his dad would bark. ""You're going on too long! Make it interesting!""

By the time he hit puberty, Howard's Long Island community had transformed from predominantly white to predominantly black. As he recalls, the arrival of black families prompted his so-called liberal neighbors to flee in the middle of the night. It was an early education in hypocrisy, and it left him outraged: ""All these preachy phonies who would go to services and say, 'All people are the same in God's eyes' were full of shit,"" he seethes. His parents, along with Stern and his older sister, Ellen, would stay put. By his freshman year of high school, he was one of only a handful of white kids left in class, a de facto outsider who'd frequently find himself on the receiving end of somebody's fist.

The Sterns eventually relocated to a nearby white neighborhood, but by then Howard was woefully behind academically and a complete disaster socially. ""I was traumatized,"" he says. Still, he got admitted to Boston University, where he found an outlet on the campus radio station and later a series of gigs that took him from Hartford to Detroit. In the early days, he'd shake every time he got on-air; but with time, he began to relax and find his voice, a mix of hijinks and puerile humor.

By the early '80s, Stern landed in D.C., where he was first paired with Quivers and, through a series of outrageous antics, sealed his shock jock reputation. No prank seemed to get quite as much attention as the one he pulled the morning after an Air Florida flight crashed in the Potomac River, killing 78 people. The host famously pretended to ring the airline, inquiring about the price of a one-way ticket to the 14th Street Bridge. Those who weren't horrified were highly amused. From there, Stern moved to New York, the most coveted of markets, where he shared with format predecessor Don Imus a station and a slogan: ""If we weren't so bad, we wouldn't be so good."" By 1986, his eponymous show was nationally syndicated.

With each stunt, Stern's audience seemed to grow larger and more passionate. At its peak, The Howard Stern Show reached an estimated 20 million weekly listeners. Money followed, though the number of zeroes seemed important to him largely as a measure of success. Save a few pricey homes — in Manhattan, the Hamptons and Florida — the borderline recluse has never been known as a big spender or a man of lavish taste. (Money is the rare subject that Stern has long been unwilling to touch, unless of course he's the one asking the questions.) Winning, on the other hand, ""became an almost debilitating obsession,"" he says. He was committed to doing and saying pretty much anything to stay on top: be it dialing for dates with lesbians or banging bare bottoms like bongos. At one point, one in every four cars on Long Island was listening to The Howard Stern Show during the morning commute; he was fixated on the other three: What the hell were they listening to if not him?

For years, guests served merely as props, there to service Stern's audience. ""My interviewing technique was like bashing someone in the face with a sledgehammer,"" he writes in the new book. ""I was like the Joker, and all I wanted to do was cause chaos."" He asked Gilda Radner if Gene Wilder was well endowed, driving her right out of the studio. He spent the bulk of his time with Carly Simon telling the singer how hot she was; and, despite multiple warnings not to ask George Michael about his sexuality, he did so immediately. There were plenty more, from Eminem to Will Ferrell, who appeared once then never again.

What Stern lacked was the humility to be a fan of anybody but himself. At least not publicly. ""I lashed out at anyone and everyone whose career was prospering,"" he offers. ""I thought I should be at the center of the universe, and whenever it seemed like someone else was, I couldn't accept it."" David Letterman? Blasted him. Jerry Seinfeld? Him, too. Rosie O'Donnell? Forget it. His denunciations of her inspired Stern fans to rummage through her trash and threaten the life of her young son. ""It got to the point where it was terrifying,"" says O'Donnell, who, in a stunning twist, became a Stern confidante years later.

An early '90s interview he did with Robin Williams still ranks among Stern's biggest regrets, however, in part because it's too late to apologize, as he has to others. ""I loved Robin Williams, but there I am beating him over the head with, like, 'Hey, I hear you're fucking your nanny?' I could have had a great conversation, but I'm playing to the audience,"" he says. ""They want to hear outrageousness, and that's my arrogance thinking that Robin Williams can't entertain my audience. How stupid am I?""

In the end, Stern found himself stuck in an arms race with himself, constantly reaching for new levels of outrage. It caused endless headaches: Religious groups came after him, as did the FCC, levying millions in fines. Advertisers regularly pulled their support and cranks called in death threats. ""I was a nervous fucking wreck, ready to jump out a window,"" he admits. But he wouldn't be stopped. ""Every issue — race, religion, sexuality — was dealt with as honestly and openly as possible to the detriment of everything around me. I was like scorched earth, … trying to be heard like the mountain that roared.""

Everything else in Stern's life, including his college sweetheart, Alison, and their three daughters, took a back seat. He just couldn't see it at the time. ""I lived in a delusional world. I thought I was the best parent. I thought I was like Ward Cleaver, living the Leave It to Beaver life. I didn't realize everything was crumbling around me,"" he says now. ""I mean, I didn't even know what it meant to be a grown man with a family. I didn't know anything. I was a child.""

Then, in late 2004, came a lifeline from Sirius, a fledgling satellite service that was willing to bet $500 million (and, arguably, its future) on Stern. He'd start in 2006, getting two entire channels to himself and the freedom to do and say whatever he damn well pleased. No federal decency rules to contend with, nor skittish bosses breathing down his neck. On his way out, he caused one last firestorm, promoting his switch to Sirius on the air at CBS Radio, prompting then-boss Leslie Moonves to slap him with a nine-figure lawsuit. Scorched earth it was.

***

Sirius was, by all accounts, the Wild West. He could get away with anything, and for a good stretch he did. ""We said 'fuck,' we said 'shit,' we weighed a guy's doody,"" he recalls. Then something happened. He began to lose interest in outrage. With no rules left to break, it wasn't that much fun anymore.

It was time to evolve.

By that point, Stern was spending as many as four days a week in therapy — he's now down to two, though his longtime therapist would prefer three — and he was interested in having more genuine conver­sations. He felt he was finally being heard and was eager to hear from others. ""You can only interview so many strippers,"" he offers without a whiff of irony. Don't get him wrong, however: he ""loved the idea that we'd go on the air and measure our penises or discuss vaginal secretions —whatever it was, if it freaked you out, I loved it because, to me, it was not a big deal. But now I find it gross. And I'd feel really fucking shitty if I hadn't evolved. I'd be completely out of step with the times.""

With little warning, Stern's off on a tear about the industry's more recent cultural reckoning, enraged once again by the hypocrisy it's revealed. After all, several of the professional moralists who'd attacked him for his on-air antics were now being exposed for ""doing really weird shit"" in private. ""It just shows you that people are full of shit,"" he says, before directing his fury at his former nemesis: ""I'll admit there was a certain joy that I took when the #MeToo movement broke and [we found out] Les Moonves is doing all these things in his private life.""

To Stern's delight, most of his listeners have been willing to evolve with him. Not all, of course. There are some who miss the old Howard — including former Howard Stern Show personality Artie Lange — who accuses him of having gone soft. Stern, for his part, counters that he has little left to offer those who say, ""We want you squeezing a perfect stranger's titties in the studio."" Which is not to suggest he or his show have somehow become G-rated. There are still plenty of pranks, profanity and egregious sex talk that can occasionally feel jarring in the year 2019. He shrugs and says, ""I still have a really juvenile sense of humor.""

At his therapist's urging, Stern has been making room in his life for interests beyond radio. He took up chess for a few years, then photography, though in both cases, he says, ""My compulsion to be the greatest crept in and strangled the fun out of it."" Now, he's all in on painting. He's opened himself up to genuine friendships, too, with folks like Jimmy Kimmel and O'Donnell. (It was Mia Farrow who brokered peace between the two, telling Stern that he and Rosie had been the only ones who publicly admonished her ex, Woody Allen, well before it was culturally in vogue to do so. ""She told him, 'Stop being such an asshole. You and Rosie have more in common than you think,' "" says O'Donnell. ""And really, we do."")

Selling Hollywood's gatekeepers on the new Stern would take time. For years, he'd been enemy No. 1 in most publicity circles, and often the feeling was mutual. ""Their job was to avoid controversy,"" he says, ""and my job was to create it."" But, gradually, he became so eager to showcase his softer side, he signed on to judge America's Got Talent in 2012, to the shock of his longtime agent, Don Buchwald. Perhaps more shocking: It worked. ""I had a reputation as a stark-raving lunatic before that,"" says Stern. After his four seasons on the NBC talent competition, ""I went from America's nightmare to Santa Claus. Literally, people were putting their kids on my lap.""

Slowly, stars and their handlers began to accept the shift, too. Stern describes his interviewing technique now as the ""dinner party approach,"" explaining how he coaxes his guests to be spontaneous without having to get in their faces. He points to an early 2015 interview with Gwyneth Paltrow that weaved its way from a discussion of relationships to one of oral sex as a major turning point. ""Had I said to her, 'Gwyneth Paltrow, do you blow your husband?' I'm an asshole,"" he says. ""But, sure enough, we start talking, and she's fascinating, and I'm getting to know her, and then she goes: 'One of the things you can do to make your man happy, ladies, is, like, sometimes in the middle of a fight, I just blow him. It ends everything.' So, she took me there.""

Stern's longtime producer, Gary ""Baba Booey"" Dell'Abate, has called the Paltrow interview ""one of the most important milestones"" for his job as a booker. In the years since, Stern's couch has become a sought-after stop on the publicity tour for a wide swath of Hollywood's A-list — though flacks still cop to sweating through clients' hour-plus interviews, which quickly evolve past prepackaged sound bites to become intimate character excavations. ""When you talk to Howard, you just kind of explode with candor,"" says Lena Dunham, whose relationship with Stern got off to a rocky start in early 2013 when he described her as ""a little fat girl who looks like Jonah Hill."" He later apologized, declared himself a major Girls fan and invited her on to dig deep on subjects ranging from obsessive-compulsive disorder, from which they both suffer, to sexual assault. Adds Dunham, ""I wish the side effect [of going on his show] wasn't tons of aggressive headlines, because while it's happening it feels really good.""

Kimmel, a loyal listener long before he became a close friend, considers Stern the best the format has to offer, and he's hardly unique in his assessment. ""Unlike the late-night talk shows, nothing is off-limits on his show, and you know that going in,"" says Kimmel, having been a guest himself more than 30 times. ""If you put limits on the interview, Howard won't do it. No matter how tempting or how much he wants the guest, he just won't. So, if you're Paul McCartney and you want to publicize something, you know you're going to sit with Howard for an hour and a half and talk about whatever Howard wants to talk about, and no one is above that.""

***

Curating a book of Stern's best interviews was supposed to be simple. Jonathan Karp had assured him that Simon & Schuster would do nearly all of the work. In fact, when Karp arrived at Stern's Manhattan apartment in April 2017, the publisher had 30 of his most popular transcripts already bound with a book jacket. All Stern would have to do was write a few words of introduction. He was flattered enough to say yes.

Like every other major publisher, Karp had been courting Stern for years for the express reason that his base had proved eager book buyers, as evidenced by the performance of his first two tomes. When Private Parts came out in 1993, it was the fastest seller in Simon & Schuster's history. Beatles-esque hysteria at book signings and, later, a film adaptation with Stern as its star, followed. His second, Miss America, managed to outdo it, becoming what was, at the time, the fastest seller in publishing history.

But Stern didn't love the idea of doing a third. Books were simply too much work, he'd often say, which is why Karp tried to make it easy. Stern, however, was constitutionally incapable of doing it that way. He couldn't let someone else pick the interviews; he'd have to do that himself. So a one-year project took two, as he pored over hundreds of transcripts and decided to write an intimate introduction for every one he chose. Ultimately, he settled on close to 40 in-depth conversations, from the early and uncomfortable (Bill O'Reilly) to the more recent and evolved (Bill Murray); along with several dozen snippets that he'd weave together by theme, like sex and relationships or money and fame.

Then came another idea: He'd lace throughout the book a sampling of his 40-plus conversations with Trump, beginning with a 1995 exchange in which they joke about a presidential run; he'd also devote at least a few pages to the interview he tried desperately to land with Hillary Clinton, who, he'd reveal, had rebuffed him at every turn. Despite the host's history with the current president, who'd regularly call in and discuss such subjects as his sex life with Melania or his daughter Ivanka's ""very voluptuous"" breasts, Stern was an ardent supporter of Clinton, both in 2008 and again in 2016. Still, he says he saw before others how tough it would be for her to beat Trump.

His listeners span the country, he explains, and in that final stretch he could see that Hillary wasn't connecting with them. Stern isn't arrogant enough to say for sure that an interview on his show could have tipped the election in her favor, but he doesn't rule it out, either. ""There's a segment of my audience that really gets turned on to people they thought they hated because we tap into their humanity,"" he says, rattling off examples like Lady Gaga. ""They were like, 'Fuck Lady Gaga, why are you having her on?' And then it's over, and they go, 'Shit man, I'm going to go see her in concert.' ""

For a while there, Stern says his wife would get annoyed every time a conversation turned to the election since it always seemed to play out the same way. He'd ask those better versed in politics than he who they thought would win and then he'd refuse to bite his tongue when inevitably he'd be told Hillary. ""I'd sit there at these dinner parties and go, 'Not that you asked, but I don't think you're seeing this the right way,' "" he says. "" 'Donald is communicating. He's talking like a dude. That's very powerful — take it from someone who knows.' "" Stern had famously soared in the polls when he ran for governor of New York on the libertarian ticket in 1994, and all he had to say was, ""We're going to kill all the criminals, take their crispy remains and stick them in the potholes."" He removed himself from the race before it was too late.

On-air and off, he had tried to get Trump to do the same. Early on, Stern was still fielding his calls from the campaign trail and spending time at Mar-a-Lago. Sure, he considered Trump among his greatest all-time radio guests — raw and unfiltered — but leader of the free world? He insists in those days, he never imagined Trump would get anywhere near that far, and he's convinced Trump didn't either. Save a brief congratulatory exchange when Trump won, the two haven't had any interaction since Stern declined his request to speak at the Republican National Convention. ""It was a difficult thing because there's a part of me that really likes Donald, but I just don't agree politically,"" he says. Still, he jokes: ""A more self-serving person would have gone all in on Donald because I'd probably be the FCC commissioner or a Supreme Court justice by now.""

The rest of Stern's book can occasionally read like a series of love letters to his subjects. Before a Kimmel interview, he writes about how his friend is often there to provide him with a boost of confidence when he needs it most — and for that, he shares, ""I love him""; before one with O'Donnell, he offers: ""I remember thinking, 'How could I have missed out in my life on someone so special because of some dumb posturing on the radio?' "" He hopes that the collection, as a whole, adequately captures his evolution and ultimately becomes his legacy; at the very least, he says, it's how he wants to present himself to his daughters. Just don't, under any circumstance, accuse Stern of having lost his edge.

It's a lesson that talk show host Wendy Williams learned the hard way. After praising him as her role model and his book as an inevitable best-seller — per Karp, it's Simon & Schuster's fastest seller of the year, in terms of pre-orders — she became the latest to suggest the host had gone soft. ""He's a Hollywood insider now,"" Williams said on a March episode of her show, ""which sucks because you started like me, being of the people, but at some point, you sat behind that microphone for too long, and now you are the people.""

Within hours, Stern had fired back, eviscerating Williams on his air. ""Jealous bitch. … You'll never be me,"" he fumed. ""You don't have my wit and you don't have my talent."" Weeks later, he regrets the tirade, acknowledging: ""That was me at my worst. I thought she was saying that I was a piece of shit and I sucked. But as [I hear it] now, I don't see it as an offense at all. If 'Hollywood' means that I've evolved in some way and the show has changed, then yeah, she hit the nail on the head."" He's pulled the rant from rerun airings.

Soon, the conversation comes back around to his health scare and with it his musings about a future off the radio. Of course, Stern has contemplated walking away before, notably in the run-up to his last contract negotiation, only to re-up with a rich new deal in 2015. Similar talks will reignite in the next year, if not sooner, along with an almost inevitable crush of headlines that will ask whether Howard Stern is still worth $90 million a year. Sure, some will argue, when he signed his first pact in 2004, he was key to the future of what was then just Sirius, with its 1.1 million subscribers and $67 million in revenue. On his back, the company, which later merged with XM Satellite Radio, built both its brand and its base.

By 2014, however, the last time Macquarie Securities analyst Amy Yong surveyed SiriusXM subscribers, only 12 percent (or about 3.2 million listeners) were tuning in to Stern, and only 5 percent said they'd bail if he left. And now? Yong cites SiriusXM's subscriber growth, currently at 36 million, and its recent $3.5 billion acquisition of Pandora: ""They're in such a different life stage, and they've done a really good job of diversifying,"" she says of a company that now boasts $5.8 billion in revenue. ""They have like 150 channels, so no one is going to have that much leverage.""

And maybe it's just as well. Stern's been spending a lot more of his time ""thinking about the hourglass,"" he says, ""and the sand emptying."" He daydreams about the next chapter, when he'll wake up, read the paper and paint for hours at a time. Still, it's hard to imagine the guy who regularly sneaks onto Twitter to gauge listener reactions is really ready to hang it all up. His eyes, which have been darting around the studio for the past hour and a half, suddenly settle on the microphone hanging high above his desk: ""To walk away from what I'm good at?"" he says, questioning himself already. ""I don't even know that I have it 100 percent right yet. And maybe there's more to explore …""

Brian Rabbitt has seen the Russia investigations through from start to finish — from several sides.

At the beginning, Rabbitt was in the White House, helping the new administration navigate congressional probes into Moscow interference in the 2016 presidential election. At the end, Rabbitt was at the Justice Department as chief of staff to Robert Mueller’s boss, Attorney General William Barr, as Barr determined how to describe the special counsel’s investigation to the public. In between, Rabbitt prepped Barr for Mueller questions during his Senate confirmation.

Story Continued Below

Rabbitt’s behind-the-scenes role reveals the carousel nature of the Russia probe, which has featured a number of players switching positions over the last two years. And it highlights the ethical challenge numerous DOJ and White House officials have had to grapple with as a result — whether to recuse themselves from working on the investigation at all.

Barr rejected calls to step back because of a 19-page memo he wrote before joining the administration contesting the legal grounds for Mueller’s obstruction-of-justice investigation. His predecessor, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, also fended off recusal calls over his full-throated cable news denunciations of Mueller’s probe. And Trump’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, actually did recuse himself and the rest of his personal office because of the prominent surrogate role he played during the Trump campaign.

At the White House, counsel Don McGahn in mid-2017 chose to have his entire office stop working on Russia-related matters because staffers had been privy to some of the incidents under investigation.

So when Rabbitt became Barr’s chief of staff in February, he sought out the agency’s ethics officials to determine whether he could advise on Russia matters, given his prior work in the White House counsel’s office. The officials cleared Rabbitt, and within weeks he was assisting on what would become some of the most consequential decisions to date of Donald Trump’s presidency.

“Yes, in an abundance of caution, I requested guidance from career ethics officials and was cleared to advise and work with the attorney general on these issues,” Rabbitt told POLITICO in an email exchange.

Now, three months into his DOJ job, Rabbitt has played several key roles during the culmination of the Mueller investigation.

The 36-year-old conservative attorney called the White House on a March Friday afternoon to inform Emmet Flood, a former colleague and friend then serving as the president’s lead Mueller-response lawyer, that the special counsel’s work was officially over.

Two days later, Rabbitt made another call to Flood, this time to read aloud Barr’s four-page letter summarizing the special counsel’s top-line conclusions on collusion and obstruction of justice. (That Sunday morning, Rabbitt also delivered three boxes of donuts to reporters staked out for weekend duty at DOJ headquarters awaiting the release of Mueller’s findings.)

Rabbitt declined to comment about what specific role he played in helping Barr handle the nuances of the Mueller report, decisions that have since become a lightning rod of controversy and even drew a rare complaint from the special counsel that the attorney general “did not fully capture the context, nature and substance” of his work on the Russia probe over that mid-March weekend.

During Barr’s Senate hearing last week into the Mueller investigation, Rabbitt also whispered repeatedly into the attorney general’s ear as he looked to his staff for help on some questions.

“People should jump me if I’m wrong,” Barr said on more than one occasion, a reference that seemed aimed at his chief of staff and the other aides sitting nearby.

Rabbitt joined the Trump administration in March 2017 from the Washington, D.C., offices of Williams & Connolly, a law firm well known for its partners’ representation of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Rabbitt said in an email he wanted to start out in the Trump Justice Department, but his resume made its way to McGahn, who offered him a job.

While working for McGahn, Rabbitt had a first-floor desk in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. His main portfolio involved legal issues surrounding the deregulation of the financial services industry, as well as helping the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau make its first transition into a GOP administration. He also worked on the confirmations for Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch and SEC Chairman Jay Clayton.

As one of the few White House lawyers with experience in trial litigation, Rabbitt was also tapped to help in the early stages of the Russia probe, as several House and Senate investigations were just getting started and FBI Director James Comey would publicly confirm a federal probe into possible links between the Trump campaign and Moscow’s election meddling efforts.

“He did a few simple things,” said one former White House colleague who declined to elaborate.

“Let’s just leave it with what you have,” added a second former colleague, who also declined further comment.

In an email exchange with POLITICO, Rabbitt said he was “involved as a lower-level junior lawyer in some of the early congressional inquiries on Russia-related matters.”

Former Trump White House attorney Ty Cobb was more fulsome with his praise.

“We worked closely on complex matters and I admired the judgment he displayed — judgment mature beyond his years!” he said in an email.

From the start, Rabbitt’s work has been almost entirely out of the public eye. And in the end, the Northern Virginia native managed to stay out of the legal fire himself. While several of his former White House colleagues’ names, notes and testimony are cited in the Mueller report, Rabbitt is nowhere to be found.

By the summer of 2017, Rabbitt and the rest of the White House counsel’s office were recused from working on the Russia probe, which by that point had morphed from the FBI investigation Comey had confirmed into the special counsel’s probe. McGahn made the recusal decision, Cobb explained last year, because many of his own attorneys “had been significant participants” surrounding key episodes at the center of the Russia probe, including the firings of Comey and national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Rabbitt left the White House that November to work for the SEC, starting out as a senior lawyer on enforcement and then moving into Clayton’s office as a senior policy adviser. Former colleagues say Rabbitt’s tenure at the White House during the Russia probe was wearing.

“A year in the White House counsel’s office is like 10 years in a normal job,” one of them said.

Rabbitt said he made the change for a “great opportunity to work for a great team and fantastic chairman at the SEC on issues related [to] what I had done in private practice.”

Rabbitt then leapt at the chance to work for Barr. He has known the attorney general since the mid-2000s, when he became close friends with Barr’s middle daughter, Patricia, while the two worked together at the U.S. attorney’s office in Alexandria, Va.

“Bill Barr eventually became a mentor to me,” Rabbitt said in an email about his current boss, who previously served as attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration.

His Justice Department job actually started before Barr had been sworn in as attorney general. Rabbitt served as the sherpa for Barr’s Senate confirmation, helping the nominee prepare for a hearing loaded with questions about his allegiance to Trump and how he’d handle the release of a final Mueller report.

“He was always super prepared and thoughtful in his comments and was kind of issues-fodder extraordinaire,” said Reginald Brown, a former senior George W. Bush White House aide who also helped Barr in his Senate confirmation. “You can see why Bill liked him on the substance and it was just clear the relationship between them was one of complete trust.”

“That confirmation could have been a controversial one,” Brown added. “It wasn’t. That was in significant part to the quality of [Rabbitt’s] thinking and approach.”

People who know both men say it was a natural fit, offering the attorney general who had been out of government for more than 25 years a window onto Capitol Hill and inside the Trump White House.

“He has a set of relationships across the Trump administration that Bill might not have. He has the ability to be his eyes and ears across town,” said Brown.

Serving as Barr’s right-hand-man has meant a lot of Mueller — it’s the issue that has dominated the attorney general’s first three months on the job.

“There’s obviously been a lot of Mueller. He’s involved in everything the attorney general is involved in,” said one of his former White House colleagues.

Rabbitt, however, never became part of the probe itself. While other former White House colleagues had sat for questioning in the Mueller investigation — McGahn himself spent more than 30 hours with investigators — Rabbitt said the special counsel team didn’t interview him as a witness and he didn’t need to get his own personal lawyer.

Still, Rabbitt nonetheless considered whether another recusal was necessary when Barr became Mueller’s main supervisor, taking over from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

Rabbitt is actually one of several original McGahn hires now serving in the Barr Justice Department. The attorney general’s senior staff also includes deputy chief of staff John Moran and senior adviser Claire McCusker Murray — both worked in the White House counsel’s office with Rabbitt. And former Trump White House associate counsel James Burnham also now has a lead role on DOJ’s civil side representing the administration in trial courts around the country.

The Barr-Rabbitt relationship marks a big change from the first team at DOJ, which started out with Sessions and chief of staff Jody Hunt. Sessions recused all of his staff in the attorney general’s office from working on the Russia probe, which opened the door for Rosenstein to take the lead appointing and then supervising Mueller. Whitaker, a former federal prosecutor from Iowa and frequent conservative TV commentator, replaced Hunt in September 2017 and later became the acting attorney general after Trump ousted Sessions the day after the November 2018 midterms.

“Could I have seen him be Jeff Sessions’ chief of staff? No. Because that’d be weird,” said one of Rabbitt’s former White House colleagues. “Given the fact Bill Barr is the attorney general, it makes all the sense in the world.”"
"As Hurricane Relief Stalls In D.C., Trump To Rally Base In Florida Panhandle",https://www.npr.org,['Domenico Montanaro'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/08/720803270/as-hurricane-relief-stalls-in-d-c-trump-to-rally-base-in-florida-panhandle,"As Hurricane Relief Stalls In D.C., Trump To Rally Base In Florida Panhandle

Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images

President Trump will hold his first 2020 Florida political rally since the 2018 elections on Wednesday, and he's doing it in the Panhandle, the heart of his base in the state.

But the region is facing setbacks because of a federal funding shortfall after Hurricane Michael last fall that threatens to dampen enthusiasm.

""As much as Bay County votes Republican, we don't need a political rally right now,"" said Bay County Commissioner Philip Griffitts, a Republican. Trump's rally will be in Panama City, which is in Bay County. ""We need some good news from the federal government,"" he said.

Florida is crucial to Trump's reelection chances in 2020. Without Florida, there is virtually no path for his victory. Trump's campaign and Republicans in the state are feeling good about their chances. After all, in a wave year for Democrats in 2018, Republicans were able to win the governorship with a candidate who ran as unapologetically pro-Trump.

In that campaign, Republican Ron DeSantis defeated Andrew Gillum, a Democrat endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist. That campaign is expected to serve as an example for the president's messaging strategy to win the state, trying to paint any Democrat who runs against him as a ""socialist.""

That anti-socialist message, the campaign believes, will appeal in South Florida to those with roots in Venezuela and Cuba. Trump has backed that up as president with hard-line policy stances toward the governments of those countries.

Still, this is Florida. On average, it has been the closest state in the last five presidential elections on average, and Trump only won the state by a little over a percentage point in 2016.

While many of his supporters don't blame him for the lack of funding for Michael recovery, he can't afford to lose any support in a state this close, especially in the Panhandle, where he got about 10% of his total statewide vote out of the 18 counties in that area.

And rallies like Wednesday's are key to organizing and drumming up support.

Lack of funding

Several Florida lawmakers are saying they feel as if Michael has become the ""forgotten"" storm.

That's despite Trump declaring after Michael hit, ""We're doing a lot, more than anybody would have ever done.""

The Federal Emergency Management Agency last month touted that it had provided $1.1 billion in funding to the Panhandle with almost $1 billion going directly to survivors. Officials on the ground, however, are frustrated with the agency's denial of claims and the slowness of aid. Bay County has seen 33,000 denials, for example.

""The bureaucracy of FEMA is very impressive, and that's not meant to be a compliment,"" Griffitts said. ""The processes and bureaucracy of the federal government has been painful at times.""

Bay County has not been reimbursed for some $250 million in debris clearance. That total may be small by Washington standards, but it accounts for about three-quarters of the county's annual budget.

Many of the businesses in the tourism-heavy area haven't come back, with just weeks before Memorial Day, the unofficial kickoff of the summer season.

Tyndall Air Force Base, a major economic force in Bay County, was also hit hard by the storm. Housing on the base was damaged as were more than a dozen F-22 fighter jets. Construction at the base halted last week because of a lack of funding. Trump is expected to get a briefing at the base.

Congress has yet to pass supplemental disaster-relief funding that would get the president's blessing.

A relief package for areas affected by Michael, the California wildfires and other disasters passed the House, but the bill stalled in the Senate. The Senate had a deal on funding, but Trump balked at increased funding for Puerto Rico, whose leaders have been hotly critical of the president after Hurricane Maria. The president sees the government there as inept and untrustworthy stewards of the funds.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has tabled any measure until he's certain the White House will sign off.

""I don't know who to blame,"" Griffitts said, adding that he doesn't necessarily blame Trump, but there's ""no excuse. Quit playing politics.""

Griffitts also noted that one in seven kids did not return to school, a number he said he uses as a proxy for a population drop of about 15 percent. That translates to about 27,000 people no longer living in Bay County — and not enough people for jobs available.

That could certainly have an electoral effect if those voters moved out of state, or if they choose not to vote.

The importance of Florida and the Panhandle to Trump

The president's path to reelection remains a narrow one, and he needs Florida's 29 electoral votes. Trump won the state by just 1.2 percentage points, or about 113,000 votes.

Florida has been decided by an average of less than 2 percentage points on average since 2000, and Democrat Barack Obama won it twice. But Republicans see it trending their direction after the 2018 midterm wins. Not only did they win the governorship, but they also flipped a U.S. Senate seat.

The Panhandle is very important to Trump's chances. Remember that Trump went there to rally the base during a tough political time – four days after the release of the Access Hollywood tape, in which he was heard bragging about assaulting women.

In 2016, Trump wound up running up the score in the 18 counties in the region, getting 22,604 more votes, or about a 5% increase, out of them than GOP nominee Mitt Romney had in 2012.

Looked at another way: Those votes were about one-fifth of Trump's total statewide margin over Hillary Clinton.

Bay County went for Trump with 71% of the vote. That was one of the highest percentages of any large county in the state. Bay also saw the second-largest increase in Republican votes in the Panhandle from 2012 to 2016. Trump got about 5,300 more votes than Romney four years earlier in Bay, a 9% increase. Across Florida, only Santa Rosa County saw a bigger GOP vote increase.

Facing a reelection bid with Democrats fired up to run against him, Trump is going to need to persuade virtually every one of those voters to come out to support him again.

""The president knows the importance of northwest Florida,"" Griffitts said. ""We are a red voting district, and I would hope that he could deliver some good news."""
Exclusive: Trump fixer Cohen says he helped Falwell handle racy photos,https://www.reuters.com,"['Aram Roston', 'Min Read']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-falwell-exclusive/exclusive-trump-fixer-cohen-says-he-helped-falwell-handle-racy-photos-idUSKCN1SD2JG,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Months before evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr.’s game-changing presidential endorsement of Donald Trump in 2016, Falwell asked Trump fixer Michael Cohen for a personal favor, Cohen said in a recorded conversation reviewed by Reuters.

Falwell, president of Liberty University, one of the world’s largest Christian universities, said someone had come into possession of what Cohen described as racy “personal” photographs — the sort that would typically be kept “between husband and wife,” Cohen said in the taped conversation.

According to a source familiar with Cohen’s thinking, the person who possessed the photos destroyed them after Cohen intervened on the Falwells’ behalf.

The Falwells, through a lawyer, declined to comment for this article.

Cohen, who began a three-year prison sentence this week for federal campaign violations and lying to Congress, recounted his involvement in the matter in a recording made surreptitiously by comedian Tom Arnold on March 25. Portions of the recording — in which Cohen appeared to disavow parts of his guilty plea — were first reported April 24 by The Wall Street Journal.

The Falwells enlisted Cohen’s help in 2015, according to the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking, the year Trump announced his presidential candidacy. At the time, Cohen was Trump’s confidant and personal lawyer, and he worked for the Trump Organization.

The Falwells wanted to keep “a bunch of photographs, personal photographs” from becoming public, Cohen told Arnold. “I actually have one of the photos,” he said, without going into specifics. “It’s terrible.”

Cohen would later prove successful in another matter involving Falwell, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Cohen helped persuade Falwell to issue his endorsement of Trump’s presidential candidacy at a critical moment, they said: just before the Iowa caucuses. Falwell subsequently barnstormed with Trump and vouched for the candidate’s Christian virtues.

Reuters has no evidence that Falwell’s endorsement of Trump was related to Cohen’s involvement in the photo matter. The source familiar with Cohen’s thinking insisted the endorsement and the help with the photographs were separate issues.

Cohen’s connection to the Falwells sheds light on the formidable alliance between Trump and a man who, through his university, is one of the most influential evangelical figures in America. Falwell’s backing helped galvanize evangelicals and persuaded many Christians concerned about Trump’s past behavior to embrace him as a repentant sinner.

Falwell’s support for Trump has not wavered throughout the New York celebrity-politician’s own tribulations, including the Access Hollywood recording of Trump talking about grabbing women’s genitals and payoffs made by Cohen to hide Trump’s extramarital affairs. This past weekend, Falwell tweeted that “Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term” to make up for the two years of the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

BLOCKBUSTER ENDORSEMENT

Falwell’s endorsement of Trump, however, did surprise some students and staff at Liberty University, the school in Lynchburg, Virginia, founded by Falwell’s father, Jerry. It was at Liberty where fellow Republican presidential candidate and major Trump rival Ted Cruz had chosen to launch his campaign the previous year. Cruz’s father was an evangelical preacher, much like Falwell’s father; Trump has been married three times and divorced twice. For years, prior to running for president, Trump boasted of his sexual exploits and supported a host of social positions, such as abortion rights, that run counter to beliefs espoused by Falwell.

Although Falwell declined interview requests for this story, he has said repeatedly that he endorsed Trump because Trump was the strongest candidate, had significant experience running a business, and had the right vision for the country.

The connection between Trump and Falwell goes back years. In 2012, Trump gave the convocation at Liberty University. One link between Trump and the couple appears to have been Cohen, a now-disbarred New York lawyer who formed a close bond with the Falwells.

During the campaign, Cohen worked closely with Liberty University to help promote Trump’s candidacy. It was around that time that Cohen heard from the Falwells about the photographs, said the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking.

The Falwells told Cohen that someone had obtained photographs that were embarrassing to them, and was demanding money, the source said. Reuters was unable to determine who made the demand. The source said Cohen flew to Florida and soon met with an attorney for the person with the photographs. Cohen spoke with the attorney, telling the lawyer that his client was committing a crime, and that law enforcement authorities would be called if the demands didn’t stop, the source said.

The matter was soon resolved, the source said, and the lawyer told Cohen that all of the photographs were destroyed.

Months later, in early 2016, Trump faced what seemed like an enormous challenge. The Iowa caucus was coming up, and Cohen — then deeply loyal to Trump — was concerned about how Trump would fare, the source said. Cohen felt Trump “was being slaughtered in that community,” and “didn’t want to see him embarrassed or, you know, without support,” said the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking. Cohen repeatedly reached out to Jerry Falwell, and pleaded with him to back Trump, the source said.

Soon after, according to this account, Falwell made his historic announcement. “I am proud to offer my endorsement of Donald J. Trump for President of the United States,” Falwell was quoted saying in a statement issued by the Trump campaign. “He is a successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.”"
State Department Continues Fight to Strip Gay Couple’s Two-Year-Old Son of Birthright Citizenship,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-continues-fight-to-strip-gay-couples-two-year-old-son-of-birthright-citizenship,"Ever since twins Aiden and Ethan Dvash-Banks were born in Toronto in September 2016, they have shared everything—the same button nose, the same swoopy haircut, the same pug/terrier mix London. But for years, the U.S. State Department has fought an escalating legal battle to ensure that they don’t share one important thing: American citizenship.

Although Aiden and Ethan’s fathers, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks, have been married since 2010, only Andrew is an American citizen. While that would be enough for children in a heterosexual marriage to qualify for U.S. citizenship while born abroad, the State Department has held the Dvash-Bankses to a different standard, requiring the family to undergo DNA testing to establish that Aiden—but not Ethan—was the biological son of a U.S. citizen.

The boys’ parents sued, arguing in federal court that proving a biological connection between a child and a U.S. citizen parent isn’t required to extend birthright citizenship from a married parent to a child, and in February, the judge ruled in their favor.

“The basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, U.S. District Judge John F. Walter wrote in a decision issued in February, dismissing the department’s attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples “unilateral.”

But on Monday, the State Department appealed that decision, continuing a years-long bid to strip Ethan of his citizenship.

“Once again, the State Department is refusing to recognize Andrew and Elad’s rights as a married couple. The government’s decision to try to strip Ethan of his citizenship is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and morally reprehensible,” said Aaron C. Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBT people in the immigration system. Morris successfully argued in federal court that a policy requiring genetic testing for the children of same-sex binational couples created a new double standard for citizenship: one for the children of gay couples and one for the children of straight couples.

After the Supreme Court struck down a ban on federal recognition of same-sex marriage in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security issued a guidance declaring that “just as [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] applies all relevant laws to determine the validity of an opposite-sex marriage, we will apply all relevant laws to determine the validity of a same-sex marriage.”

In response to a request for comment on the appeal, and on whether it plans to require DNA testing of all binational married couples in order to establish a biological relationship and thereby to establish birthright citizenship, a State Department spokesperson said that the department “does not comment on pending litigation.”

Morris also noted that in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the State Department has filed its appeal, the standard of using DNA testing to ensure a biological relationship between a child and a married U.S. citizen parent in order to confer citizenship has already been soundly rejected.

“This is settled law in the Ninth Circuit, which has already established that citizenship may pass from a married parent to a child regardless of whether or not they have a biological relationship,” Morris said.

Despite that precedent, Aiden and Ethan’s fathers are still deeply concerned with the State Department’s decision to appeal the case.

“We’re outraged that the State Department is so intent on harming our family and the LGBTQ community,” Andrew and Elad said in a statement. “The fight is not over, and we will not rest until our family is treated fairly and equally. Nothing can tear us apart. The four of us are unbreakable.”"
VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas,https://www.politico.com,['Lorraine Woellert'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/va-mortgage-lenders-federal-subpoenas-1414318,"Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. | Charles Dharapak, File/AP Photo defense VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas

Federal investigators have issued subpoenas to several mortgage lenders that make loans to military veterans, seeking information on delinquencies and payments.

The investigation is being led by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General in cooperation with the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, according to four people with knowledge of the subpoenas.

Story Continued Below

At least eight lenders, and likely more, have been asked to turn over hundreds of files on VA home loans made between 2013 and 2017, according to two people with knowledge of the request.

The requests include questions about quality control and loan audits.

Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. One VA program in particular — the Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan, or IRRRL — allows lenders to put existing VA borrowers into new loans without an appraisal or underwriting and was ripe for abuse.

Michael Nacincik, a spokesperson for the Department of Veterans Affairs OIG, and John Marzulli, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, declined to comment. Both said they could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation.

Jeffrey London, executive director of the VA’s Loan Guaranty Service, did not respond to requests for comment.

On Friday, Ginnie Mae said it was weighing whether to exclude some of those VA loans from its pooled securities in an effort to tackle a wave of rapid-fire mortgage refinancings that have left some military service members deeper in debt.

In a 14-page request for input, the government mortgage agency called the practice, known as churning, “unhealthy” for the agency.

The loan documents requested by investigators weren’t limited to IRRRLs, according to one person with knowledge of the subpoenas.

The VA subpoenas are landing as HUD is taking steps to rein in the prosecution of lenders who sell mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration.

Many of the nation’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, stopped offering FHA loans after the government, under former President Barack Obama, used the False Claims Act to extract billions of dollars in settlements from dozens of big lenders.

FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery, an appointee of President Donald Trump, has said those cases went too far and that the Trump administration is working with the DOJ to change how the False Claims Act is used against lenders."
Nancy Pelosi on impeaching Attorney General William Barr: 'Nothing is off the table',https://www.cnbc.com,['Kevin Breuninger'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/nancy-pelosi-on-impeaching-attorney-general-william-barr-nothing-is-off-the-table.html,"Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the United States House of Representatives during her weekly press conference on Thursday morning. Pelosi is asserting that Attorney General Robert Barr has committed a crime by lying to Congress.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that Attorney General William Barr should be held in contempt of Congress and ""nothing is off table"" regarding whether to impeach him.

Pelosi's comments at a Washington Post event came hours before the Democrat-led House Judiciary Committee was scheduled to vote whether to hold Barr in contempt for the Justice Department's refusal to give Congress special counsel Robert Mueller's unredacted Russia report and its underlying evidence.

""Yes, I think that the attorney general should be held in contempt,"" said Pelosi, the nation's top-ranking Democrat.

When the Post asked Pelosi, ""Is impeachment of Mr. Barr on the table?"" she responded: ""Well, nothing is off the table.""

""I wish everyone would take a deep breath and be almost prayerful about this,"" Pelosi added.

The committee is scheduled to hold the vote, which pertains to a contempt resolution and report, during a markup hearing at 10 a.m. ET, according to a press release from the panel. If the vote passes, the resolution and report will move to the full House, where Democrats hold a majority of seats.

Democrats have criticized Barr heavily for his handling of Mueller's report on Russia's election meddling, possible Trump-campaign coordination with the Kremlin and possible obstruction of justice by Trump. Their attacks only grew following Barr's appearances testifying before congressional committees, where some top Democratic lawmakers — including Pelosi — say the attorney general was untruthful.

""He lied to Congress,"" Pelosi said last week. ""If anybody else did that, it would be considered a crime.""

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Pelosi's remarks."
Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Doug Palmer']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/agriculture-economists-leave-trump-1307146,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's moves to limit his agency's research arm have led to a string of departures from the Economic Research Service, whose reports detail how farmers have been hurt by President Donald Trump's trade feuds. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Agriculture Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump Reports showing farmers hurt by the president’s policies have drawn the ire of top officials.

Economists in the Agriculture Department's research branch say the Trump administration is retaliating against them for publishing reports that shed negative light on White House policies, spurring an exodus that included six of them quitting the department on a single day in late April.

The Economic Research Service — a source of closely read reports on farm income and other topics that can shape federal policy, planting decisions and commodity markets — has run afoul of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue with its findings on how farmers have been financially harmed by President Donald Trump's trade feuds, the Republican tax code rewrite and other sensitive issues, according to current and former agency employees.

Story Continued Below

The reports highlight the continued decline under Trump’s watch in farm income, which has dropped about 50 percent since 2013. Rural voters were a crucial source of support for Trump in 2016, and analysts say even a small retreat in 2020 could jeopardize the president’s standing in several battleground states.

“The administration didn’t appreciate some of our findings, so this is retaliation to harm the agency and send a message,” said one current ERS employee, who asked not to be named to avoid retribution.

For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper at an economic conference in early 2018 that indicated the GOP tax overhaul would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers — generating negative press coverage that staff members said irked senior officials at USDA.

Then, in August, Perdue stunned members of the roughly 300-member research service by announcing plans to bring ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, who reports more directly to the secretary. Equally significant, he said the USDA would move the agency out of Washington to a location closer to the U.S. heartland.

Members of the agency were also caught off-guard last summer when Perdue’s office issued an internal memo directing ERS and other research branches to include disclaimers in their peer-reviewed publications stating that the findings were “preliminary” and “should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy” — seen as a way of watering down any unflattering data from the department’s own experts.

The move to uproot the agency has led to a brain-drain of experienced researchers. So far in fiscal 2019, non-retirement departures from the agency have more than doubled on an annualized basis compared to the previous three-year average, according to data collected by employees.

Six of the economists — made up of specialists in the agricultural economy, farm taxation and food programs with more than 50 years of combined experience at ERS — left the agency at the end of April, out of frustration with the relocation process or in some cases suspicion about Perdue’s efforts to reshape USDA’s research wing, according to coworkers. More are planning to leave in the coming months.

For his part, Perdue has said the relocation was motivated by his desire to save taxpayer dollars, bring the research service closer to major farming regions, and help attract economists who could be deterred by Washington’s high cost of living.

“I really have been a little surprised with the naysayers on this,” he said last month at a Senate Appropriations hearing, touting the move as a common-sense, cost-cutting measure.

Perdue’s office declined to provide information on the numbers of employees who’ve quit or respond to allegations of political interference in the research service.

But the secretary alluded to frustrations with the quality of USDA research in comments to POLITICO on April 30, saying that all decision-making in the department must be “fact-based.”

“In USDA, we want good scientific discovery,” Perdue said, when asked about the mandated research-disclosure language. “We want peer-based evidence there. We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers. That relies on sound, replicatable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

Perdue and Trump made clear in their budget request in March that they wanted to reduce the scope of the ERS, eliminating “low priority research” into such politically sensitive areas as food stamps and environmental issues.

The White House blueprint called for slashing ERS staff levels by more than 50 percent, cutting the total number of positions from about 329 to 160.

The budget is unlikely to be approved by Congress, but members of the service say they’ve already seen the effects of Trump’s and Perdue’s preferences.

“Things like conservation, rural development, food assistance, have just been de-emphasized” in favor of the administration’s preferred topics, said one economist who left ERS because of the relocation plan.

Former ERS Administrator Susan Offutt, who oversaw the service under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the agency’s studies showing how USDA’s farm-subsidy programs disproportionately benefit wealthier farmers have been a “perennial irritant” to influential lobbying groups, but an “over-the-top reaction” to clamp down on such reports would be unprecedented.

“Of course, this is not the story the farm lobby wants to tell about struggling farmers,” said Offutt. “Controlling ERS would stop unflattering news about federal farm subsidies favoring high-income, high-wealth farm households from reaching the public.”

Lawmakers have complained that USDA has yet to provide a full cost-benefit analysis of its plan to move the office closer to the heartland. Republicans have increasingly supported the relocation plan, while House Democrats have filed legislation to block the move.

On Friday, the USDA announced three finalists for the new headquarters of the service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which is also being moved out of Washington. The finalists are Kansas City, the North Carolina research triangle region and multiple locations in Indiana.

Perdue’s office has promised to release further data justifying the move when he announces a final site recommendation this month.

Within the service, skeptical employees view the secretary’s rationale for the move and the months-long site selection process carried out by accounting firm Ernst & Young as a smokescreen.

“The message we’ve been getting is, ‘The cost-benefit analysis doesn’t matter. Being close to stakeholders doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters for you is the fact that the secretary wants you to move, thinks it’s in your best interest, and that’s what we’re doing,’” said another senior ERS economist who declined to use his name for fear of retaliation.

Brian Stacy, a former ERS economist who left in February, said he thinks the move is a way for the administration to force out staff members and reduce the size of the ERS without congressional approval.

“Part of me wonders whether this relocation is just a way to get at that staff reduction,” Stacy said, referring to the president’s budget request. “I don’t know how else to read some of the moves being made.”

ERS employees are planning to vote on unionization on Thursday.

USDA intends to keep 76 ERS employees in Washington and relocate 253 positions to the new location, USDA senior adviser Kristi Boswell told a House Appropriations panel in March.

“This is the spiraling down of the fantastic work that the ERS has done for years,” said Sonny Ramaswamy, who headed the National Institute of Food and Agriculture under the Obama and early Trump administrations. “It’s one way to drain the swamp, as it were.”

"E.P.A. Leaders Disregarded Agency’s Experts in Issuing Asbestos Rule, Memos Show",https://www.nytimes.com,['Lisa Friedman'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/climate/epa-asbestos-rule-scientists.html,"Want climate news in your inbox?

WASHINGTON — Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also is a known carcinogen. Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote."

Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., initially requested ""all materials ... obtained or produced by the Special Counsel's Office in the course of the investigation"" in a March 27 letter to Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and FBI Director Christopher Wray. After receiving no response, Schiff and Nunes repeated their request in a second letter dated April 25, one week after Barr released a redacted version of the Mueller report to Congress and the public.

""[A]s the report makes clear, the Department of Justice and the FBI failed to keep the Committee 'fully and currently informed' of this important foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information, as required by law,"" Schiff and Nunes wrote in the April letter. ""The Department and the Bureau did not keep the Committee apprised of this information ... contrary to long-standing practice regarding significant counterintelligence matters.""

DEMS WHO FUMED AT NUNES FOR JEOPARDIZING 'SOURCES AND METHODS' NOW DEMAND MUELLER REPORT IN FULL

The second letter from Nunes and Schiff gave the Justice Department until May 2 to cooperate with their requests or ""the Committee will have no choice but to resort to compulsory process on Friday, May 3 to compel production of documents responsive to the Committee's request.""

A committee aide told Fox News on Tuesday that ""the [Justice] Department has not produced any documents responsive to our requests and has not agreed to schedule any testimony,"" even after Schiff and Nunes sent their second letter.

""An accommodations process must go both ways, and the Committee will soon start the compulsory process since the Department has not even begun to comply,"" the aide said.

The letters mark a rare showing of bipartisan agreement between Schiff and Nunes, who have repeatedly been at loggerheads over the Russia investigation. On March 28, the committee's nine Republican members -- including Nunes -- requested that Schiff step down as chairman over his repeated claims in the media that there was ""more than circumstantial evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Last week, Schiff called for Barr to resign as attorney general over his handling of the Mueller report, writing in a USA Today op-ed that Barr ""misled the country about an investigation implicating the president.

""Then he lied to Congress,"" Schiff wrote in the piece published last Friday. ""Then he did something worse: He effectively said that the president of the United States is above the law.""

Steven Mnuchin Refuses to Release Trump’s Tax Documents to Congress,https://www.nytimes.com,['Alan Rappeport'],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/06/us/politics/trump-tax-returns-mnuchin.html,"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department said on Monday that it would not release President Trump’s tax returns to Congress, defying a request from House Democrats and setting up a legal battle likely to be resolved by the Supreme Court.

Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, wrote in a letter to Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, that Mr. Neal’s request for the tax returns “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose” and that he was not authorized to disclose them. The decision came after weeks of delays as Mr. Mnuchin said that his department and the Justice Department needed to study the provision of the tax code that Democrats were using to seek six years’ worth of the president’s personal and business tax returns.

The request for Mr. Trump’s taxes is the latest instance of the Trump administration rebuffing congressional oversight efforts.

“As you have recognized, the committee’s request is unprecedented, and it presents serious constitutional questions, the resolution of which may have lasting consequences for all taxpayers,” Mr. Mnuchin wrote in the one-page letter."

Devin Nunes, have both made requests to the FBI and Justice Department to be briefed on the counterintelligence information gathered in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.

And now they are warning a subpoena is coming soon if they don't get compliance.

The subpoena threat from Schiff and Nunes -- two California lawmakers who have often been at each other's throats on the committee over the past two years -- is a rare case where the diverging interests of the pair align when it comes to the special counsel's investigation.

Schiff and Nunes have jointly requested a briefing on the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Trump and Russia from Mueller and his team, as well as the special counsel's evidence collected during the probe.

The request could lead to Mueller testifying before the panel behind closed doors, in addition to the House Judiciary Committee's efforts to seek Mueller's public testimony later this month.

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday threatened to withhold the salaries of Interior Department officials who have blocked lawmakers from interviewing agency employees about whether Secretary David Bernhardt was complying with recordkeeping laws.

The committee’s threat ratchets up the pressure on Interior in the latest skirmish between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the lawmakers' complaints that agencies are withholding documents and ignoring requests to send senior officials to testify before Congress.

Story Continued Below

“Please be advised that any official at the Department who ‘prohibits or prevents’ or ‘attempts or threatens to prohibit or prevent’ any officer or employee of the Federal Government from speaking with the Committee could have his or her salary withheld pursuant to section 713 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act,” Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a prepared statement.

Cummings also complained in the letter to Cole Rojewski, Interior's director of congressional and legislative affairs, that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations.

Oversight has sought interviews with Interior’s administrative assistant to the deputy secretary, scheduling and advance director, executive assistant to the office of the deputy secretary and acting chief of staff and associate deputy secretary. The committee asked Interior to respond to the interview requests by Friday.

Cummings is also using the the threat of withholding salaries to force Commerce Department officials to appear before it for interviews relating plans to add citizenship questions to the 2020 Census.

In his statement, Cummings pointed to a 2016 GAO report that said a department’s budget “appropriation was not available to pay the salary of a federal officer or employee who prevents another federal officer or employee from communicating directly with any member, committee, or subcommittee of Congress.”

Oversight and the National Archives and Records Administration are investigating allegations that Bernhardt was keeping meetings off his official calendars and not supplying information about meetings to the public.

Interior refused the committee’s previous requests to interview several staffers, telling Oversight that the interviews “are unnecessary at this time,” according to a letter the committee sent to Interior today.

At a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the Interior Department budget on Tuesday, Bernhardt defended preventing the employees from talking to the committee, saying ""it’s not the appropriate time"" for those interviews, and that his decision was designed to protect career employees.

“You’re talking about individual employees who have long standing in the department,” he said in response to questioning from Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). “We have wonderful career employees here ... they’ve never had this happen to them in their careers.”

Lawrence shot back that Congress was responsible for oversight of the agency.

""You have been requested to comply. With all due to respect, you are required to comply,“ she said.

Besides refusing interviews, Interior has declined to provide documents the Oversight and House Natural Resources committees requested on March 13, according Cummings‘ letter. The department instead offered tens of thousands of pages of documents unrelated to the committee's request, the letter states.

The Bible was carried by a prisoner of war in World War II and then made part of a memorial in the Manchester VA, near the entrance. >> Download the FREE WMUR appA patient, James Chamberlain, filed a lawsuit Tuesday to have the Bible removed from the Missing Man Table, where it is displayed inside a secure case.The Bible had been removed in February after a plea from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, whose leaders said 14 patients complained to them about the Bible's placement. The organization asked the VA to remove the Bible, calling its presence intolerable and unconstitutional.""Right now, the VA is a train wreck of unconstitutionality as they elevate Christianity to the supreme position of dominance in direct violation of our U.S. Constitution,"" said Michael Weinstein of MRFF. ""It's shameful. It's disgraceful.""VA officials moved the Bible to a nearby display case, sparking opposing efforts to get the Bible moved back to its original spot.After a few weeks, VA officials moved the Bible back, leading to the lawsuit from Chamberlain, the 15th patient to file a complaint with the foundation, according to the lawsuit.Veteran Paul Martin's group, the Northeast POW-MIA Network, obtained the WWII-era bible for the display in September last year.""Everybody's entitled to their opinion, but I think it's a shame,"" Martin said. ""It would be a shame that that Bible be taken from that table.""In the lawsuit, Chamberlain said he is a devout Christian, but he ""believes that our Constitution prohibits the establishment by the government of any specific religious belief and prohibits discrimination against any person because of their religious beliefs or lack thereof.

Following that removal, Manchester VAMC received an outpouring of complaints from Veterans and other stakeholders – many of whom dropped off Bibles at the facility – in protest of this action. After consulting with legal counsel, Manchester VAMC has again placed the Bible on display, where it will remain indefinitely as part of the POW/MIA table, a secular tribute to America’s POW/MIA community.

"Kellyanne Conway on investigating FBI, DOJ leaks: 'What is everyone afraid of?'",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/kellyanne-conway-on-investigating-fbi-doj-leaks-what-is-everyone-afraid-of,"White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday taunted top-level officials in former President Barack Obama’s FBI and CIA Monday, asking why they'd be nervous about President Trump’s Justice Department investigating leaks they made to media in an attempt to hurt Trump.

“What is everyone afraid of?” Conway quipped during an appearance on ""Fox and Friends."" “What do you have to hide? How did this all start? Bill Barr, the attorney general, made clear that perhaps there is an investigation into at least eight of these leaks.”

The “leaks” Conway are referring to are alleged communications between top Obama-era intelligence officials and members of the press during the 2016 presidential election and first year of Trump’s presidency.

In 2017, Trump famously fired former FBI Director James Comey — today a prominent anti-Trump figure who the president has dismissed as a “liar” and a “leaker.”

The same year, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was forced to resign from the department after it was discovered he leaked information to the press about former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

When it comes to possible investigations into spying on Trump in 2016, @KellyannePolls asks: ""What is everyone afraid of?"" pic.twitter.com/fUG0oOfNg2 — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) May 7, 2019



During a congressional testimony last week, Attorney General William Barr sent Republicans into a frenzy by citing spying on Trump’s 2016 campaign.

Barr’s statement gave fuel to an already red-hot narrative spun by the White House and leading Republicans who have railed against an anti-Trump bias at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and criminal intelligence agencies.

After Mueller found no collusion between the president and Russia, Trump encouraged his allies on Capitol Hill and Barr to “investigate the investigators.”

“Mueller, and the A.G. based on Mueller findings (and great intelligence), have already ruled No Collusion, No Obstruction,” Trump tweeted last month. “These were crimes committed by Crooked Hillary, the DNC, Dirty Cops and others! INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS!”

Now that scrutiny has shifted in part to how the Mueller probe began, Conway smirked at the thought of anti-Trump figures shaking in their boots.

“I, for one, as a citizen of this country, want to know if intelligence officers were leaking information to the press,” Conway said. “I think a few of them look a little nervous these days.”"
"New York Attorney General Sues Trump Treasury Department, IRS",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Victoria Albert'],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/new-york-attorney-general-letitia-james-sues-trump-treasury-department-irs,"New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Monday that her office has filed a lawsuit against the Trump Treasury Department and its subsidiary, the Internal Revenue Service, for failing to respond to legally mandated records requests. The suit targets a reporting standard released in July 2018, which eliminates donor disclosure requirements for non-501(c)(3) tax-exempt groups for donors who give more than $5,000. The statement alleges that after James’ office sent a FOIA seeking more information about the decision to implement the standard, the IRS did not adequately respond within the mandated time limit. It also claims that the revised standards impede the AG’s ability to regulate those organizations.

“My office depends on these critical donor disclosure forms to be able to adequately oversee non-profit organizations in New York,” James said in the statement. “Not only was this policy change made without notice, the Treasury and the IRS are now refusing to comply with the law to release information about the rationale for these changes. No one is above the law—not even the federal government—and we will use every tool to ensure they comply with these regulations to provide transparency and accountability.”"
400 former DOJ prosecutors: Mueller had enough evidence to charge Trump,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/6/18531511/400-prosecutors-mueller-letter-trump-charge-obstruction,"More than 400 former federal prosecutors have signed a new letter claiming that President Donald Trump’s interference in the Russia investigation, as described by special counsel Robert Mueller’s report, should have led to “multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice.”

The letter, circulated by the anti-Trump group Protect Democracy and first reported on by the Washington Post’s Matt Zapotosky, is pretty brutal. According to the former Justice Department officials, Trump’s actions as detailed by the Mueller report, which ranged from interference with Mueller’s attempts to acquire cooperating witnesses to an attempt to fire Mueller, constitute severe inference with the federal inquiry. In fact, they say, the question of whether there’s enough evidence to charge Trump isn’t even a particularly tough call.

“All of this conduct — trying to control and impede the investigation against the President by leveraging his authority over others — is similar to conduct we have seen charged against other public officials and people in powerful positions,” the letter’s text says.

“To look at these facts and say that a prosecutor could not probably sustain a conviction for obstruction of justice — the standard set out in Principles of Federal Prosecution — runs counter to logic and our experience.”

The only reason Mueller didn’t indict, they believe, is that Trump is “covered by the Office of Legal Counsel policy against indicting a sitting President” — something Mueller believed it would be above his pay grade to contradict. Instead, he reserved judgment on whether Trump should be indicted and asked Attorney General William Barr to make the final call on the matter.

The problem, though, is that Barr is hardly a trustworthy party.

Before his appointment as attorney general, he wrote a secret memo to the White House bashing the legal theory behind Mueller’s obstruction case against Trump. Before Mueller’s report was released, Barr released a memo describing its contents that was so misleadingly pro-Trump that Mueller sent him a private note complaining about it. And hours before the press release, Barr held a press conference in which he spun its findings in Trump’s favor, saying (for example) that the report found “no collusion,” when it expressly did not make any judgments about whether the president “colluded” with Russia in any fashion.

All of this has made it seem like Barr is acting as Trump’s personal lawyer, and not in the attorney general’s role as defender of the justice system. Now we know that more than 400 federal prosecutors, who served in administrations of both major parties, are willing to put their names on a letter saying that Barr is wrong.

It’s another blow to the credibility of an attorney general already reeling from a rough day of testimony at the Senate last week, a performance so dismal that it led several Senate Democrats to call for his impeachment."

No specific reason was given for the cancellation. The press pool traveling with Pompeo has not been told where they are going next, and have been warned they may not be able to report from the country they are going to until after their departure.

""Unfortunately, we must reschedule the Berlin meetings due to pressing issues. We look forward to rescheduling this important set of meetings. The Secretary looks forward to being in Berlin soon,"" State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said, according to the press pool traveling with Pompeo.

The sudden schedule change comes two days after the Pentagon deployed a carrier and a bomber task force to the Middle East, in response to ""specific and credible"" intelligence that suggested Iranian forces and proxies were planning to target US forces in Syria, Iraq and at sea.

The carrier group has been ordered to Strait of Hormuz in order to send a deterrent message to Iran, US officials said Sunday. The move is likely to heighten tensions as Tehran explicitly warned the US in April against any moves to block or interfere with the Strait. The 21-mile-wide waterway separates Iran from other Gulf countries and is a crucial conduit for the global economy, with 30% of the world's crude oil passing through it.

Judge rules EPA must enforce Obama-era landfill pollution regs,https://thehill.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/442444-judge-rules-epa-must-enforce-obama-era-landfill-pollution-regs,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must begin enforcing pollution regulations that were set for landfills under the Obama administration.

Haywood Gilliam Jr., a U.S. district judge in Northern California, sided with California and seven other states late Monday, ordering the EPA to begin reviewing state plans for reducing pollution from landfills.

Landfills are the third largest source of methane pollution in the U.S., releasing the highly heat-trapping gas into the air as landfill contents decompose.

Gilliam said the EPA was long overdue in meeting its obligations and ordered the agency to review state proposals and begin promulgating regulations by fall.

Here are some of the gifts received by wealthy Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross,https://www.cbsnews.com,"['Steve Dorsey', 'Jake Rosen']",,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/here-are-some-of-the-gifts-received-by-wealthy-commerce-secretary-wilbur-ross/,"From a Thai tea cup set (that arrived broken) and chocolate made from camels' milk, to a gold box, coin and trinkets, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has received an eclectic range of gifts, according to a list obtained by CBS News through a public records request.

The list includes the exotic -- Romania gold coin, a dozen small gold-covered Zodiac figurines -- as well as the more quotidian -- an assortment of books, 24 avocados, a box of dates, some pens and bath soaps.

Ross, who has been caught napping during the president's speeches and during meetings, also received three bottles of instant coffee. And he's been presented with a ""giant-print"" reference Bible. Another gift giver settled on the classic choice of champagne - a 2006 bottle of Dom Perignon (which can be found online for about $130 to $150).

The gift list reveals hints of who, at home and abroad, may be trying to curry favor with Ross, who took office in February 2017.

The Commerce Department provided few details about who sent the gifts and their value, but some descriptions point to foreign governments in China, Thailand, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Ghana, Uzbekistan, Japan, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates.

Other gifts include an AmCham (American Chamber of Commerce) crystal business card holder, and a ""thumb drive with Secretary Ross speech and some other ceremony highlights from Tenaris Day."" Tenaris is a pipe supplier for oil and gas companies.

As Commerce Secretary, Ross plays a key role in crafting U.S. trade policy and amplifying American products and industries.

""Any of the gifts that indicate that they are made of gold or silver--that would suggest that they have some significant and intrinsic value,"" said Virginia Cantor, chief ethics counsel for the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""You definitely need transparency in order to be able to determine whether it would present a potential conflict of interest.""

A Commerce Department spokesperson tells CBS News high-value gifts are appraised and sold, according to federal regulations on gifting limits.

Ross has previously faced criticism for financial disclosure inaccuracies and concerns about his compliance with conflict of interest laws.

The 81-year-old investor, known as the ""king of bankruptcy"" for his predilection for buying bankrupt companies, has also been lampooned as financially out-of-touch with most Americans, after suggesting in January furloughed federal workers should take out bank loans to pay their bills.

Though Ross has claimed he's a billionaire, Forbes removed him in 2017 from its list of billionaires after it said financial disclosure forms showed he had less than $700 million in assets."

Joe Biden is surfing a presidential polling wave that has, at least momentarily, stalled the momentum of the rest of his 2020 Democratic rivals.

The former vice president is capturing 40 percent of the national Democratic primary vote, stretching his lead over second-place Bernie Sanders to 21 points, according to Morning Consult's weekly tracking survey.

That's a 4-point improvement over a week and marks his highest percentage in the poll this year. The Vermont senator, meanwhile, has slipped to just 19 percent of the national primary vote, down 8 points since he announced his campaign in February.

Every other candidate is stuck in single digits.

At this point in 2015, Hillary Clinton's national lead over Sanders was 50 points , though her lead dwindled as the primary season went on – a cautionary tale for how a front-runner can lose trajectory over time. Clinton still ultimately became the 2016 nominee.

But the numbers in the earliest nominating states are even better news for Biden, who officially announced his campaign less than two weeks ago.

Firehouse Strategies, a Republican strategy firm, found Biden holding double-digit leads over his most high-profile rivals in the caucus state of Iowa and the primary states of New Hampshire and South Carolina.

In Iowa, Biden tops the field at 35 percent, giving him a 21-point lead over Sanders. In New Hampshire, he's at 34 percent, for an advantage of 18.5 points over Sanders. South Carolina is clearly Biden's strongest state. He pulls 48 percent of the vote, producing a commanding 36-point spread. Placing third place in each state was Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana who has become the surprise contender in the early phase of the campaign.

Still, for Biden, the numbers represent a double-digit boost in all three states over the past three months.

Firehouse/0ptimis also asked the 1,695 likely Democratic primary voters across the three states if Biden's treatment of Anita Hill during the 1991 confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas would make them less likely to support him.

Apparently, time can heal old wounds, or at least place them in the rear view mirror. Seventy percent of voters across the three states said it did not affect their views of Biden.

Biden got even more good news from a pollster in Arizona on Tuesday that bolsters his most persuasive argument of electability. According to the Phoenix-based OH Predictive Insights, Biden is ahead of President Donald Trump in a hypothetical general election match-up in the Grand Canyon State.

Biden leads Trump 49 percent to 44 percent and was the only one of the six Democrats tested who came out on top of the president in traditionally red Arizona. The last Republican presidential nominee to lose Arizona in a general election was Bob Dole in 1996, when President Bill Clinton carried the state during his re-election.

""The Biden bump we have seen in other states carried over to Arizona,"" said Mike Noble, the managing partner of OH Predictive Insights. ""Fifteen months before the Arizona primary, Biden is the Democratic candidate best positioned to take on the president. If Democrats put electibility above all else, Biden could run away with the nomination and the White House.""

The RealClearPolitics average shows Biden polling marginally better against Trump than his other rivals. He's averaging a 7-point lead over the president nationally; whereas Sanders' lead is just 3 points.

Biden skeptics will dismiss these numbers as the fortunate bounty of a candidate with universal name identification. Some pundits will toss them aside as meaningless at such an early point in the campaign when the candidates haven't even met for their first debate.

Polling is certainly just a snapshot in time. Biden's lead could evaporate gradually over time, in a two-week swoop before the Iowa caucuses or not at all. These numbers should not be seen as predictive.

But to deem this early polling data irrelevant is naive.

They still shape media coverage, inform other candidates' decisions on who and whether to launch attacks and influence the mindsets of contributors on whether to give a campaign money."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department threatened on Tuesday to completely withhold Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report from Congress if House Democrats decide to move ahead with plans to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt.

The department said in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler any move by Democrats to hold Barr in contempt would compel Barr to “request that the President invoke executive privilege” over the unredacted materials in Mueller’s report that the Democrats previously subpoenaed."
Labor Dispute Opens New Front in Fight to Privatize the VA,http://nymag.com,['Sarah Jones'],05-08-2019,2019,5,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/labor-dispute-veterans-affairs-privatization.html,"Robert Wilkie. Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images

During his Senate confirmation hearing, Robert Wilkie, the secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, said he wouldn’t privatize the VA’s health-care services. He’s since repeated that promise to veterans themselves. “The private sector cannot replicate VA’s expertise in things like spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, rehabilitative services, prosthetics, audiology, services for the blind, suicide prevention,” he told members of the American Legion in 2018.

But Wilkie was nominated by President Trump, who has surrounded himself with advocates for the privatization of the VA since taking office. His decision to fire Wilkie’s predecessor, David Shulkin, an Obama appointee who opposed privatization, may not have had as much to do with Shulkin’s alleged spending improprieties as it did with months of sustained lobbying against the secretary from allies of Concerned Veterans for America. The Koch-backed advocacy group supports an expansion of private-sector care for veterans — and Wilkie, since his confirmation, has deviated little from that goal.

On Wilkie’s watch, the VA has begun to shrink. The department, which provides free or low-cost health care to around 9 million enrolled veterans as part of its mission to support former service members, has nearly 50,000 unfilled vacancies. Meanwhile, the Mission Act, which will expand the VA’s privatized community-care network for eligible veterans, is scheduled to take effect in June.

Now, a nascent contract dispute between the VA and the American Federation of Government Employees may bolster fears that Wilkie’s reforms are privatization in all but name. On Thursday, the VA submitted a proposal to renegotiate its collective-bargaining agreement with the AFGE, which represents around 250,000 department employees. The department’s proposals would drastically reduce the amount of time employees are allowed to spend on union business during the workday, among other changes. In a press release, the VA said it hoped to reduce staffers’ union time from 1 million hours per year to around 10,000, a change that would, it claimed, direct “more than $48 million per year” back to aiding veterans. The press release was otherwise light on detail, though in it, Secretary Wilkie described this as “a reset” of the VA’s relationship with the AFGE. “With VA facing thousands of vacancies, these proposals could add more than 1 million man-hours per year back into our work force — a vital influx of resources that would make an almost immediate difference for veterans and the employees who care for them,” Wilkie said.

These restrictions on union time would make it difficult, if not quite impossible, for staff to conduct legally permissible union business during work hours. And the VA’s plan goes even further. According to a copy of the proposal package provided by the union, the VA wants to eliminate 28 provisions of the department’s current collective-bargaining agreement. Union representatives would lose their offices inside VA facilities, and could no longer use VA equipment to carry out their duties. The department’s new contract with AFGE would last for ten years, but only the VA could make changes to it during that time; the union would be prohibited from doing the same. The VA seeks to weaken the grievance procedures set out in its previous agreement with AFGE. Communication between the union and the department would have to take place entirely at the national level. Employees who need to file grievances, for example, would no longer be able to do so at the local level. The union believes this could create a bottleneck that would slow the processing of employee grievances. The union also alleges that at least two of the VA’s proposals — to require the union to pay for the time management spends on union business, and to pay attorneys’ fees to the VA — would violate existing labor law.

Contacted for comment, VA press secretary Curt Cashour directed New York to a May 2 editorial published by Wilkie on InsideSources.com. In it, the secretary said that the department’s reforms would “make sure that the contract does not interfere with the department’s ability to take action against poor performers” and eliminate language in the previous agreement that “has effectively allowed the union to co-manage the VA.”

Asked specifically about the union’s claim that some of the proposals are illegal, Cashour said, “When department employees and attorneys — at the demand of the union — are required to cease providing medical care and support for veteran services, to prepare for and engage in union-demanded activities such as grievances, disciplinary appeals, or arbitration, it’s only fair for the union to reimburse taxpayers for this time spent not taking care of veterans.”

David Cann, AFGE’s director of field services and education, told New York on Monday that the VA’s proposals “are unique.” He added, “What I’m seeing out of the VA is the most both-barrels anti-union effort that I’ve seen in my time with AFGE.” The VA’s proposals resemble executive orders that Trump signed last May. One would have significantly reduced the amount of time that federal workers are allowed to spend on union business. AFGE sued the administration and won an injunction in August that blocked certain provisions of the orders from going forward. The Trump administration appealed the injunction, and the case is ongoing. “For whatever reason, the VA is acting in contravention of that injunction, and proposing limitations on the rights of members that are exactly the same as what the court has said they’re not allowed to do,” Cann said.

The VA’s proposal package seems to be “a clear case of failing to bargain in good faith, which is an unfair labor practice under the relevant statute,” Joseph Slater, the Eugene M. Balk professor of law and values at the University of Toledo, told New York in an email. Slater, who has reviewed a summary of the VA’s proposals, added that provisions “strike me as illegal bargaining proposals on their own,” including the provision that would allow only the VA to make changes to the contract once it’s in place. “The ten-year duration is clearly trying to lock in extreme terms for an unusually long time, which is commonly held to be bargaining in bad faith. Eliminating procedures and appropriate arrangements generally seems legally dicey to me too, as those are statutory rights,” he continued.

“I could go on,” he concluded, “but this is a set of radical, unworkable proposals that no union would agree to.”

The VA isn’t the first federal agency to call for a draconian renegotiation of its collective-bargaining agreement with AFGE. The Social Security Administration has proposed similar changes to its union contract, down to the removal of union representatives from their offices inside SSA buildings. Contract negotiations with AFGE may become not just a backdoor for the Trump administration to get around the injunction, but the locus at which its antipathy to the federal workforce meets its hostility toward unions.

The first two years of Trump’s presidency have already been difficult for the federal workforce. One of Trump’s first actions as president was to implement a temporary federal hiring freeze. He’s overseen two significant government shutdowns, the most recent of which lasted for five weeks and cost federal employees two pay periods. (Though federal workers received back pay after the government reopened, many federal contractors did not.) The VA isn’t the only federal agency facing a staffing crisis, either. Though the status of the VA’s workforce has a clear, disproportionate effect on veterans, so too does the state of the federal workforce at large. A third of federal employees are veterans. Cann told New York that AFGE believes that figure is even higher for employees of the VA.

But the fact that Wilkie is pursuing certain conflict with AFGE, instead of filling his department’s vacancies, kindles a fear specific to the VA: that the secretary intends to let the VA atrophy and funnel more and more veterans into private medical care. “If we really want to fix the VA so badly, let’s start hiring, and fill up some of those 49,000 [staff] vacancies,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said at a recent town hall co-sponsored by National Nurses United and CommonDefense, a progressive veterans’ advocacy group.

There’s no question that the VA suffers from systemic problems. Twenty-four veterans have died by suicide on VA campuses during the last 18 months, the Military Times reported in April. The department’s tech problems are so pronounced that implementation of the Mission Act may prove disastrous. According to ProPublica, a planned tool to help determine which veterans are eligible for private community care is so unreliable that “it threatens to disrupt the health care of about 75,000 veterans every day.” Nevertheless, a joint study from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and the White River Junction VA Medical Center found that VA medical facilities achieve health-care outcomes that are consistently as good as, or even better than, private alternatives in 121 regional markets. In polling, veterans themselves reliably oppose privatization, though they’re less hostile to the notion of some community-based choices as a supplement to the VA’s public services. The American Legion, like every other major veterans’ service organization, opposes privatization of the VA.

Alexander McCoy, the political director of Common Defense and a former Marine, told New York that his organization is watching the labor dispute closely. “The secretary of Veterans Affairs and Trump are trying to use veterans as props for union-busting,” he said. “This isn’t about improving our health care or fixing problems with the VA. They’re punishing workers for their own campaign to starve the VA.”

Kate Hoit, an Army veteran affiliated with VoteVets, a progressive organization that has repeatedly sued the Trump administration for its handling of the VA, agreed. “First and foremost, our concerns rest in the fact that the changes in the collective bargaining agreement will make the VA a worse place to work and therefore result in worse care for veterans,” Hoit said in a statement to New York.

Private-sector unions, too, worry that the VA’s contract proposals belie its commitment to privatization. Sara Nelson, who heads the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and called for a general strike in response to the latest government shutdown, said that it’s “no surprise” that the Trump administration would target AFGE’s VA members, who have traditionally enjoyed a robust contract. “It’s all a direct attack on VA workers and their union,” Nelson said in a statement to New York. “Why? Because they are the ones demanding accountability at the VA, they are the ones blowing the whistle on waste and fraud, they are the ones standing in the way of privatization. That’s the ultimate goal: privatize the VA so the giant health care corporations can reap the billions spent on caring for our veterans, ignoring the fact that veterans overwhelmingly prefer the VA to private healthcare.”

AFGE will likely need all the support it can get. Slater, the law professor, cautioned that if the union wanted to file an unfair labor practices charge against the VA, it may have difficulty finding relief. Trump took until March of this year to nominate a general counsel to the U.S. Federal Labor Relations Authority, the body responsible for addressing labor grievances against federal agencies. Unions have already criticized Trump’s FLRA pick, Catherine Bird. National Treasury Employees Union president Tony Reardon told Bloomberg Law that Bird, who formerly worked in the office of general counsel for the Department of Health and Human Services, was “directly involved in the agency’s bad faith bargaining last year.” Reardon added that his union has filed four grievances against HHS for unfair labor practices. Even if Bird is confirmed, Bloomberg Law said she’ll have to process an extensive backlog of cases because the office has been vacant for two years.

Federal law also prohibits VA employees from going on strike, which further restricts AFGE’s options as it navigates contract negotiations. But Cann said that the union is considering other forms of direct action. “Getting people involved, doing petitions, doing informational rallies, applying pressure on the agency by pointing out their hypocrisy and their anti-union animus, reaching out to the handful of friends we have on the Hill, we plan on doing all of that,” he said, adding, “We’re counting on employees who care so much about the work they do as caregivers to veterans to be willing to stand up, and get involved in this campaign, and object to having their voices silenced.”

"As EPA stalls, 43 states have water sites contaminated with toxic chemicals",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/water-toxic-chemicals-pfas-states-2f68b1c6b7f3/,"Toxic chemicals found in nonstick cooking pans and other household items have contaminated more than 600 water sources across at least 43 states, according to a new report, with Michigan by far the most impacted.

The findings underscore the wider water crisis facing the United States and are likely to increase pressure on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enact stricter limits on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), toxic chemicals that can increase the risk of cancer and other severe health problems.

New analysis published Monday by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) and Northeastern University finds that 610 water sources across the country contain PFAS. The water systems include drinking water sources that serve upwards of 19 million people, along with military and industrial sites, dumps, and airports. PFAS itself is found in everything from firefighting foam to rain jackets.

Using data from sources including the federal Safe Drinking Water Information System and the Pentagon, the authors mapped the nationwide prevalence of PFAS. The version released Monday reflects an updated map — the last version was released in July 2018 and found 172 contaminated sites in 40 states. And it is likely that the new report still doesn’t account for many contaminated sites around the country.

“We believe the locations shown on our map may be only the tip of a toxic iceberg,” said Bill Walker, EWG vice president and editor in chief, in an email to ThinkProgress.

CREDIT: EWG

Michigan, a state grappling with ongoing water crises, stands out as the most severely impacted state. The updated map identifies 192 contaminated sites in Michigan alone, the vast majority of which are drinking water sources.

An ongoing lead contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan, is the state’s most well-known water problem. The city’s residents say that five years after their water first became contaminated, they are still experiencing health impacts associated with Flint’s water, like rashes and headaches. But PFAS has also become a problem in the state — last July, two communities in Kalamazoo County were given bottled water after their drinking source was found to contain dangerously high levels of the chemicals.

Under scrutiny over water issues in the aftermath of Flint, state officials have been hard at work testing the water for chemicals in an effort to identify the scope of the PFAS problem. That work has been critical; EWG credited a multi-agency effort overseen by the state as helping to identify impacted areas. Michigan environmental officials have said there may be as many as 11,000 PFAS-contaminated sites in the state.

According to the new report, California comes in second after Michigan with 47 known sites, while New Jersey is third with 43 sites. But Walker of EWG told ThinkProgress that without efforts like those underway in Michigan, gauging the full scale of the problem is a challenge.

“Most other states have not conducted the kind of comprehensive multi-agency detection effort that Michigan has,” he said.

For years, communities in states like West Virginia and Pennsylvania have struggled with staggering cancer rates and other health problems, trends residents now link to PFAS exposure. They have repeatedly lobbied for the EPA to act and several told ThinkProgress in March that they feel the agency is not doing enough — even as EPA officials argue the agency is taking the crisis seriously.

In February, then-Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler unveiled an “action plan” to tackle PFAS following more than two decades of alarm from impacted communities. But Wheeler’s announcement failed to establish a Maximum Containment Level (MCL) for PFAS in drinking water, something advocates say is critical to addressing the crisis. Currently, the agency has a non-enforceable health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion that applies to only two types of PFAS: PFOA and PFOS. Health experts have said that PFAS chemicals could pose a risk to humans at much lower levels.

Moreover, a draft of interim recommendations for PFAS cleanup released in April was panned by EWG and other groups as “woefully inadequate,” in no small part because it relies on the 70 parts per trillion guidance. The recommendations also do not legally require the Pentagon or the chemical industry to clean up contaminated sites. According to the Defense Department, at least 126 military bases have reported possibly harmful PFAS levels, and EWG identifies 117 military sites on its map. Chemical companies like DuPont are meanwhile associated with mass-PFAS contamination in areas like Parkersburg, West Virginia.

EPA testing has also historically set a level for detection that EWG says is too high. According to Walker, “more than 100 million Americans could have PFAS in their water supplies” if the detection level reflected the lower points at which studies have show averse health effects to occur.

It is unclear when or if the EPA will address such discrepancies. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-PA) last week introduced a bill that would require the agency to create a drinking water standard for all PFAS chemicals. But the bill would give the EPA two years to do so — a timeline unlikely to appease communities currently struggling with contamination."
"WV MetroNews Manchin, Collins urge DOJ to drop support of Obamacare lawsuit",http://wvmetronews.com,['Alex Thomas'],05-07-2019,2019,5,http://wvmetronews.com/2019/05/07/manchin-collins-urge-doj-to-drop-support-of-obamacare-lawsuit/,"By Alex Thomas in News | May 07, 2019 at 9:52PM

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Two U.S. senators on Tuesday asked Attorney General William Barr for the Justice Department to drop its support of a ruling on the constitutionality of the federal health care law.

West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin and Maine Republican Susan Collins sent a letter to Barr as former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law faces a challenge from a coalition of states and the Trump administration that could mean the end of the Affordable Care Act.

“Overturning the ACA will put millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of West Virginians and Mainers at risk of losing their health insurance, including thousands of our constituents who gained health insurance through the Medicaid expansion, and thousands more who gained insurance through the ACA exchanges,” the senators said.

“With so much at stake, we urge you and the administration to reconsider this position and to defend the consumer protections for seniors, young adults, women, children, and working families.”

Judge Reed O’Connor of the District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled in December against “Obamacare” because of its individual mandate, which required people to purchase health insurance. O’Connor said the provision, which Congress eliminated in the 2017 tax law, was essential to the healthcare law.

A coalition of states including West Virginia is arguing against the law’s legal standing. Then-Maine Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, signed onto the lawsuit last year, yet then-state Attorney General Janet Mills declined further involvement. Mills, a Democrat, became governor in January.

The Justice Department in March came out in support of affirming O’Connor’s ruling.

Manchin and Collins told Barr millions of Americans would be at risk of losing their insurance coverage if the law is struck down, including people with pre-existing conditions and individuals who gained insurance coverage through state Medicaid expansion programs.

“It is also alarming that in the midst of the devastating opioid epidemic, millions of Americans suffering from substance use disorders would lose access to the treatment that they need to recover. It is no exaggeration to say that this is a matter of life and death to many of these Americans,” the senators wrote.

According to Manchin, around 800,000 West Virginians have a pre-existing condition. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources tweeted Monday less than 156,000 West Virginians are enrolled in the state’s Medicaid expansion program.

Other individuals who would be at risk of losing their insurance coverage includes young people still on their parents’ insurance plans.

“Congress can work together to fix legislatively the parts of the law that aren’t working, but we must not let this flawed court decision stand and devastate millions of seniors, young adults, women, children, and working families,” Manchin and Collins added. “We urge the administration and the Department of Justice to reconsider the decision not to defend the critical consumer protections that have provided healthcare to millions of Americans around the country.”

Over the last year, Manchin has led multiple Democratic attempts to get the Senate Legal Counsel to intervene in the lawsuit. Manchin and Collins in 2017 opposed attempts to repeal and replace the health care law, but Collins backed a proposal giving states the option to operate under the statute.

Collins voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, while Manchin opposed the legislation.

Both senators voted in February to confirm Barr as attorney general.

Manchin told MetroNews last month he plans to introduce with Collins a bill funding a reinsurance program for high-cost individuals. Collins previously backed a similar proposal with Florida Democrat Bill Nelson, who lost his reelection bid in the 2018 election cycle.

The state coalition and the Trump administration last week submitted briefs to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans supporting O’Connor’s ruling."
"Administration announces additional 30,000 seasonal worker visas",https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/06/politics/seasonal-worker-visas/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration is making an additional 30,000 seasonal worker visas available for 2019, according to a joint rule published Monday by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Labor.

The additional visas come on top of the visas already made available for the year.

The work visas, which allow employers to hire foreign workers for temporary, non-agricultural jobs, will only be available to workers who already received H-2B status in the past three fiscal years. Availability is also restricted to businesses who would ""suffer irreparable harm"" without the additional workers, US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced on Monday.

The increase was expected, as USCIS alerted Capitol Hill in April that it intended to make this decision and the rule would be forthcoming.

In March, a group of senators asked Homeland Security to raise the number of available visas above the 66,000 statutory annual cap. The demand for seasonal workers was ""so extreme"" this year that the Labor Department's website almost crashed, according to a letter sent to then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Trump Interior chief says climate change response falls on Congress,https://thehill.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/442605-interior-secretary-says-climate-change-response-falls-on-congress,"Interior Secretary David Bernhardt defended his position on climate change and record on ethics while speaking before lawmakers Tuesday to discuss his agency's proposed budget.

In his first hearing since being sworn in as secretary, the Trump administration official frequently put the onus on lawmakers for responding to global warming. He said that while he believes in climate change, Congress has not directed him to respond to it.

Bernhardt told the committee that there are more than 600 instances in current laws where the secretary is directed that he or she “shall” do something.

“You know what there’s not – is a ‘shall’ for ‘I shall manage the land to stop climate change’ or something similar to that,” he said.

Bernhardt also discussed development of fossil fuels on public lands, saying he would not stop oil and gas development – including offshore drilling – without direction from Congress.

The Trump Cabinet official also clarified that his department will finish its five-year drilling plan, despite reports that it was indefinitely sidelined.

Bernhardt repeatedly emphasized that concerns from states would be paramount in making a determination at the federal level.

“I’m not aware of a single lease that was ever developed over the opposition of a state,” he said.

“We shouldn’t be afraid of information. If we can do it properly and it can be done responsibly, the data itself is not something we should be afraid of,” he said.

Some of the hearings most heated exchanges came in response to questions over Bernhardt’s ethics records.

Quigley repeatedly accused Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who was confirmed to the administration last month, of acting in the interests of his former lobbying clients. Bernhardt responded that he was working for American interests.

Legislators have long questioned Bernhardt's industry ties given his background as a lobbyist, and Democrats have pushed for more details about how top staff keeps track of Bernhardt's calendar and meetings with industry representatives.

The EPA is meant to protect us. The Monsanto trials proves it isn't | Nathan Donley and Carey Gillam,https://www.theguardian.com,"['Nathan Donley', 'Carey Gillam']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/07/epa-monsanto-round-up-trial,"Ever since Monsanto introduced its line of Roundup weedkillers to the world in 1974, the products have been touted by the company and regulators as extremely safe. The EPA reiterated that stance last week.

But the emergence of long-held corporate secrets in three public trials has revealed a covert campaign to cover-up the pesticide’s risks and raised troubling questions about lax oversight of all pesticides by the Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory agencies that are supposed to be protecting public health.

Two recently concluded Roundup product liability trials in California have resulted in large damage awards against Monsanto, after juries found the company’s herbicides contributed to cancer and that it failed to warn of the risks. Closing arguments in a third trial under way now in Oakland, California, are expected this week. Revelations that have emerged from the trial testimony include:

* Monsanto never conducted epidemiology studies for Roundup and its other formulations made with the active ingredient glyphosate, to see if the products could lead to cancer in people who used them.

* At the same time as Monsanto was refusing to conduct long-term product safety studies, the company was spending millions of dollars on secretive PR campaigns – including $17m budgeted in a single year – to finance ghostwritten studies and op-eds aimed at discrediting independent scientists whose work found dangers with Monsanto’s herbicides.

* Several Monsanto scientists spent years putting together a sweeping paper that was published in a scientific journal in 2000, concluding Roundup posed no health risk to people. Internal emails show the team was applauded by corporate leaders for their hard work on the paper. But when the work was published in a scientific journal, no Monsanto employees were listed as authors. A company scientist referred to the paper internally as one the company had “ghost” written. Monsanto has denied that characterization. Regulators, including the EPA, have cited that paper as a reference in assuring consumers that Roundup is safe.

* Numerous other examples of Monsanto employee ghostwriting have surfaced. In one from 2013, a company scientist emailed co-workers about a manuscript he wrote that he hoped he could make appear to be authored from someone other than himself by finding a willing academic, then “turn it over to them and just be a ghost-writer”. The scientist said it would be best if the paper did not appear to have come from Monsanto. But he was concerned that faculty members “may not want to just take something they did not produce and slap their names on it”.

* When the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry sought to evaluate glyphosate toxicity in 2015, Monsanto expressed concern about what the agency might find and engaged the assistance of EPA officials to delay that review. The efforts delayed the release of the public draft of the review – originally to be issued three years ago – until earlier this month. Just as Monsanto had feared, the agency’s review found links between cancer and glyphosate.

* Although Monsanto was aware of tests showing how easily the chemicals in Roundup are absorbed into human skin, neither the company nor the EPA have warned consumers of a need to wear protective clothing.

* In the 1980s EPA scientists saw that mice dosed with glyphosate developed rare kidney tumors, which they said demonstrated cancer risks for people. But after protests from Monsanto, the EPA’s top brass overruled its own scientists and assured Americans that glyphosate poses no cancer risk.

Precisely because the chemical has been treated as so much safer than other pesticides, over the past 45 years glyphosate has become virtually ubiquitous: residues of the chemical have been documented in food, air, water and soil samples, as well as within the bodies of people who have never used the pesticide. The chemical has even been detected in raindrops.

It all raises this troubling question: if what has been touted as perhaps our “safest” widely used pesticide actually causes cancer, what assurance do we have about the hundreds of other pesticides that the EPA has assured us are safe?

For years the EPA has been called upon to fully ban the brain-damaging pesticide chlorpyrifos but has refused to do so, saying it is still evaluating the science. A federal appeals court recently ordered the EPA to make a final decision, noting the weighty scientific evidence showing the harm the insecticide does to children. The EPA has thus far refused to act but some states are not waiting. Hawaii passed a ban on chlorpyrifos last year. Now New York, Oregon and California are moving to do the same, trying to protect their residents if the EPA won’t.

Many European countries prohibit regulators from approving pesticides that are considered mutagens, carcinogens, reproductive toxicants or endocrine disruptors. But these same products in the US face little to no resistance from regulators.

Monsanto – which was purchased last year by Bayer AG – continues to assert glyphosate’s safety. But with more than 13,000 plaintiffs awaiting their own day in court, a California judge has ordered Monsanto/Bayer to enter into talks to consider settling the cases.

Meanwhile, the evidence revealed within the courtrooms has been resonating across the country as several cities, schools and neighborhoods are limiting or banning glyphosate and other pesticides. New York City council members have introduced legislation that would ban city agencies from spraying glyphosate-based herbicides and other toxic pesticides in parks and other public spaces. City commissioners in Miami voted in favor of a ban on glyphosate herbicides in February, and in March the Los Angeles county board of supervisors issued a moratorium on glyphosate applications on county property.

Harrell’s, a Florida-based turf, golf course and agricultural product supplier, stopped offering glyphosate products as of 1 March. And just as the spring planting season is getting under way, consumers are discovering that Roundup is no longer available at Costco, the retail giant that routinely ranks among the nation’s five largest.

It is heartening to see consumers and some cities and businesses stepping up to try to protect themselves from pesticides known to be harmful.

But until our elected leaders in Congress require the EPA to adopt more transparent, science-based practices that prioritize the health of Americans over industry profits, consumers should assume they’re on their own when it comes to protecting themselves and their families."
Kamala Harris asks DOJ IG to probe whether Trump asked Barr to investigate political opponents,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-doj-ig-bar-trump-political-opponents,"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Friday sent a letter to the Department of Justice’s inspector general demanding he investigates whether the White House had urged Attorney General William Barr to investigate President Trump’s political opponents.

“In response to my questions during the [Senate Judiciary] hearing, Attorney General Barr proved unable or unwilling to state whether he had been directed to open investigations at the request or suggestion of the President or other White House officials -- an alarming response that strikes at the very heart of the rule of law and threatens to undermine the longstanding independence of the Justice Department,” she said in a letter to Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

KAMALA HARRIS TEARS INTO BARR AT SENATE HEARING, AS 2020 DEMS PILE ON AG

“I request that the Office of the Inspector General investigate whether the Attorney General has received or acted upon such improper requests,” she said.

The letter comes days after Harris questioned Barr Tuesday at the Senate hearing over details in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report that noted instances where Trump had either suggested or called for the Department of Justice to investigate Hillary Clinton.

Harris quizzed Barr whether Trump or anyone at the White House had asked him to investigate anyone -- an exchange it detailed in its letter to Horowitz.

In that exchange, Harris asked: “Has the President or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?”

“I’m trying to grapple with the word ‘suggest.’ I mean, there have been discussions of, of matters out there that, uh—they have not asked me to open an investigation,” Barr said.

When Harris asked if anyone had hinted, suggested or inferred, Barr said he didn’t know. Harris’ letter describes Barr as “unable or unwilling to answer the question.”

“There must be no doubt that the Department of Justice and its leadership stand apart from partisan politics, and resist improper attempts to use the power of federal law enforcement to settle personal scores,” she wrote.

The letter is the latest pushback from Democrats against Barr since the release of the Mueller report. In particular, they have zeroed in on Barr’s handling of the report’s release, alleging that he is biased toward the president in his presentation of the report in his initial four-page summary of its conclusions.

Harris criticized Barr’s decision not to personally review the underlying evidence before concluding that there was not enough evidence to establish that the president had committed obstruction of justice. She joined a number of Democrats saying that Barr should resign.

""This Attorney General lacks all credibility and has I think compromised the American public's ability to believe that he is a purveyor of justice,"" she told reporters after the hearing.

‘My dad died at their hands’: WWII vet fatally injured in VA nursing home,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/04/veteran-death-after-traumatic-injury-in-va-nursing-home/3402591002/,"CLOSE Surveillance video captured the deadly blow to the head of 91-year-old James “Milt” Ferguson Sr. Specialists say it could have been prevented. USA TODAY

Jim Ferguson wanted answers.

How was his 91-year-old father, who served in the U.S. Navy in World War II, fatally injured in a Veterans Affairs nursing home, the institution Ferguson had entrusted to care for him?

Huddled around a computer monitor with managers at the VA in Des Moines, Iowa, Ferguson watched a hallway surveillance video that depicted a chilling blow to his father's head.

“I lost it,” Ferguson told USA TODAY. “I broke down.”

In the video, James “Milt” Ferguson Sr., who had dementia and was legally blind, appears confused. He opens a hallway door, rolls his wheelchair into another resident’s room, then wheels back out. No staff members are visible. He circles around and heads back into the room.

Halfway through the door, his chair flips over backward. Milt Ferguson crashes to the floor, landing on the back of his head. Ferguson said he was told the chair was pushed over by the resident in the room, who can't be seen in the video. As staff members rush to assist him, Ferguson is able to turn over and sit up, but the impact causes a massive brain bleed that will kill him within days.

What later would turn the son’s despair into outrage was what he learned about events leading up to his father wheeling around unsupervised last December, and what happened after he smashed into the floor.

“It’s like my dad died at their hands,” Ferguson said.

Serious problems with resident care have occurred in many VA nursing homes across the nation, including the one where Ferguson was being cared for.

USA TODAY reported in March that inspections by a private contractor hired by the VA found deficiencies that caused ""actual harm"" to veterans at more than half of the 99 VA nursing homes reviewed. The inspections found inadequate supervision or hazardous conditions at 53 of them.

In Des Moines – which received the lowest one star out of five in the VA's own ratings, based on surprise inspections – inspectors found managers did not ensure staff treated residents with dignity or followed basic infection-control and prevention measures.

The story of what happened to James Ferguson in Des Moines provides a deeper picture of the care one elderly veteran received. Medical records provided to USA TODAY by his son and legal guardian outline what specialists say was a concerning series of decisions by VA staff, before and after his deadly head injury.

Nine days before, VA caregivers determined Ferguson was a danger to himself and others because his dementia caused him to wander around, agitated. They had him on continuous one-on-one observation with an aide, but took him off the strict monitoring when he entered the VA nursing home. There, staff didn't reinstate the heightened observation, despite his repeatedly straying dangerously into other residents' rooms.

After his injury, staff put him back in his wheelchair but did not report the incident to a supervisor for 40 minutes, the records and surveillance video indicate. Ferguson wasn't transported to an emergency room for two hours after that. Then, it took 2½ hours more to send him to a trauma hospital. The time stamp on the video showed the fall occurred at 3:49 p.m. and it wasn't until just before 9 p.m. that Ferguson was transported to the trauma facility.

'A disaster waiting to happen'

Specialists who reviewed Ferguson's medical records at the request of USA TODAY expressed concern about the quality of his care.

""It was definitely a disaster waiting to happen, and it did,"" said Robyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a Washington-based nonprofit advocacy organization.

""I just am really struck by the predictability with his repeated episodes of going into other people's rooms,"" she said. ""They should have had some intervention so they could provide him with adequate supervision and address the wandering.""

Grant said the length of time it took afterward to adequately evaluate and diagnose the severity of his injury and get him to a trauma facility also raises questions. ""What was happening there, in terms of those delays?"" she said.

VA nursing homes: Feds find 'blatant disregard' for veteran safety

Richard Mollot, executive director since 2005 of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a New York City-based nonprofit advocate of nursing home care improvement, said the shortfalls indicate there was ""very likely"" a lack of skilled or adequately trained staff to meet his needs.

""The point of being in that environment is that you have skilled nursing care and monitoring,"" he said.

Mollot said the reporting delay is particularly concerning. ""How often does this happen that no one's looking at? That's what is so upsetting.""

'All staff acted properly'

A spokesman for the Des Moines VA, Timothy Hippen, said in a statement that a review after the ""untimely death"" concluded ""all staff acted properly.""

""Any time an unexpected death occurs, VA Central Iowa Health Care System reviews its policies and procedures to see if changes are warranted,"" he said. ""We did that here, finding that all staff acted properly.""

In response to questions about the case, national VA spokesman Curt Cashour accused USA TODAY of focusing on ""isolated complaints"" and ""cherry-picking the experiences of a handful of veterans to create the impression of a broad problem.""

Cashour maintained that, overall, VA nursing homes ""compare closely"" with non-VA facilities. More than 40,000 veterans rely on care at the agency’s 134 nursing facilities each year.

USA TODAY reported last year that about 70% of VA nursing homes scored worse than non-VA nursing homes on a majority of quality indicators tracked by the agency, which include rates of infection, serious pain and bed sores.

Hippen declined to respond to detailed questions about Ferguson's case.

""We will not be addressing the specifics of this case publicly, but we have been in direct contact with the veteran’s family to discuss their concerns,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson said he remains upset even though VA officials shared the surveillance video with him and said they were sorry about what happened to his father.

He wants VA staff held accountable. He wants to make sure policies are in place so it doesn't happen to anyone else.

“No one should live their life like that and have what happened to him in the end,” he said. “I want this to be the last person this happens to.”

A gambler called ‘booger’

Even as his dementia worsened, Milt Ferguson flashed glimmers of his younger self.

The former deckhand on the heavy cruiser U.S.S. Pensacola was affectionately known as “booger” at the Des Moines Register, where he worked bundling newspapers for 23 years before retiring in 1995. He loved to play the slots and the horses.

On a note in his medical record, a nurse practitioner wrote: “Patient laughs when his nickname is mentioned.” Jim Ferguson had come for a visit that day, as he did most days. “He was smiling and appeared to be enjoying his son’s company,” the medical record said.

The decision to place him in a nursing home had been a gut-wrenching one, Ferguson said. He had moved in with his parents and cared for them for three years. But in April 2018 his mother died. He said a VA social worker told him his father needed more intensive, round-the-clock care and supervision.

“They made it sound like, well, if he got hurt, I could be charged with a crime,” Ferguson said. “So that’s when I decided to place him in a nursing home.”

‘His dementia was acting up’

Ferguson moved his father to Bishop Drumm Retirement Center, a private facility just outside Des Moines, where his mother worked as a nursing assistant in the Alzheimer’s unit for more than 20 years before retiring.

The center took in Milt Ferguson last August. But three months later, his condition worsened.

""The day before Thanksgiving, I got a call from Bishop Drumm – his dementia was acting up,"" his son said.

He hit two staff members, was “agitated all day” and was “wandering into other residents room(s), causing distress,” a nurse later noted in his medical record. “He is generally ‘sweet’ so this is a departure from his usual behavior.”

Ferguson was taken by ambulance to the Des Moines VA Medical Center, where he was admitted to the acute psychiatry ward. He was put on one-on-one observation with a sitter – an aide tasked with intervening if he lashed out or tried to stray into other patients’ rooms.

They adjusted his medications, and, after a few aggressive outbursts, he appeared calm enough after three weeks to transfer into the VA nursing home on the medical center’s campus.

But there was a catch, a psychiatric nurse wrote in his record: ""Veterans are not put on sitter status over there.""

‘Help me, help me’

After a 22-hour trial period without a sitter, Milt Ferguson moved in to the VA nursing home.

Problems began within hours.

He hardly slept, he hallucinated, he called out ""help me, help me"" over and over again. He was agitated and again, he ""wandered into and out of peers rooms"" day after day, nursing staff wrote in his record.

They gave him medication. Sometimes he calmed down. Sometimes he didn’t.

A psychiatrist was managing his case remotely. According to public records, the doctor worked at a VA facility a few hours away in Lincoln, Nebraska. Through virtual appointments, the psychiatrist advised changes to Ferguson's medication.

On December 19, a week after Ferguson moved in, nursing home staff noted he was still restless and anxious, pacing and screaming and yelling. His care team – psychiatrist, primary care doctor, nursing staff and social workers – met to discuss the case.

The psychiatrist said a review of his records showed ""increased confusion with wandering"" during the past week. The doctor prescribed higher dosages of a mood-stabilizing drug and a sedative. There was no discussion of closer supervision or reinstatement of one-on-one observation, the records show.

“Will ask RN to contact this MD in one week with update,” the psychiatrist wrote.

By then, Ferguson would be dead.

‘A golf ball-sized lump’

On December 20, when two aides rushed to help Milt Ferguson, his head on the floor and legs crumpled to the side, the time stamp on the hallway surveillance video reads 3:49 p.m. But in a report filled out an hour later, a nurse recorded the time of the accident as 4:30 p.m.

His records do not indicate what the staff did with Ferguson during the 41 minutes in between, aside from putting him back in his wheelchair.

By that time, he had a “golf ball-sized lump on the back of his head.” The nurse notified the manager on duty, a nurse practitioner, who wrote at 5:06 p.m. that he had ordered an immediate CT scan of his head.

That didn’t happen until about 6:30 p.m., when Ferguson arrived in the emergency department of the medical center on the Des Moines VA campus, on a bed wheeled by a nursing home aide. The aide said Ferguson had earlier been taken for a CT scan but was uncooperative.

An emergency room doctor quickly had a sedative administered and the scan was completed. By that point, the World War II veteran had a “large bleed” in the back right side of his brain that was so acute, the CT report says his brain had shifted to the left inside his skull.

Sent 'to scanning’

The doctor notified MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center, a trauma hospital, at 7 p.m. For nearly two hours, the doctor tried to keep Ferguson comfortable and his blood pressure under control until an ambulance arrived and took Ferguson to Mercy at 8:55 p.m.

The doctor also kept calling Ferguson’s son, leaving voicemails.

But Jim Ferguson had himself been admitted to a hospital and had provided the VA nursing home with a consent form authorizing staff to contact a close friend if anything happened to his father. That form had been sent ""to scanning” that morning.

When Jim Ferguson retrieved all the voicemails, he rushed to Mercy the next morning.

""He was not responsive. He was laying on his bed, making this horrible noise as they sucked saliva out of his mouth,"" he said. ""I never even got to say any last words to my dad.""

He died the next day.

Specialists who reviewed the case at the request of USA TODAY singled out multiple shortfalls in his care at the VA that may have affected the outcome.

Grant, the policy director at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, said the 22-hour trial of having no sitter was ""not enough time to establish how he was doing.""

When he then acted out day after day, in agitation and confusion, they should not have allowed him to wander into other residents' rooms, she said. Such situations can cause the other residents to lash out in fear or distress and ""lead to an altercation or violence or striking out.""

""One would argue that could have been prevented,"" she said. ""There should have been somebody, somewhere who could have seen that this happened and – particularly when he wheeled himself – to have gone in and intervened, 'Let me help you, let's go to your room.'""

Mollot, the executive director at the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said meeting the standards of care means staff identifies risks and needs and ways to meet them and mitigate them and then does so consistently.

""This is exactly the kind of thing that happens when those standards are not followed,"" he said.

'A safe place'

The spokesman for the Des Moines VA, while declining to answer detailed questions about what happened, said that in general, ""caring for nursing home residents involves balancing patients’ independence with the need for supervision, as appropriate.""

""While tight scrutiny and strict limits on residents’ activities and freedom of movement could possibly lower the risk for adverse events, it would also severely degrade patients’ quality of life, which is precisely what we are trying to preserve for as long as possible,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson still has his father’s wheelchair in the garage. He keeps the sweatshirt his father was wearing when he last used the chair. Ferguson has retained a lawyer, Brad Biren, to help him figure out next steps and how to hold the VA accountable.

“Somebody didn’t watch my dad and let him die,” he said. “It’s supposed to be a safe place.”

Mnuchin refuses to turn over Trump taxes to House Democrats,https://www.cnn.com,"['Donna Borak', 'Lauren Fox']",05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/06/politics/tax-returns-trump-congress-showdown/index.html,"(CNN) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Monday denied a request from House Democrats for access to six years of President Donald Trump's personal tax returns.

""I am informing you now that the Department may not lawfully fulfill the Committee's request,"" Mnuchin wrote in his one-page letter, written in consultation with lawyers from the Department of Justice.

Mnuchin added that the Department of Justice would issue a formal legal opinion.

The denial comes after two missed deadlines by the Treasury secretary, who again in his letter said the request by House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal under an obscure statute of tax law is ""unprecedented,"" arguing it raises ""serious constitutional questions"" that could have dire consequences for taxpayer privacy.

Trump has refused to release his tax information, first as a candidate and now as president, breaking a precedent going back to Watergate.

The fight over Trump's tax returns is escalating just as the President has made increasingly clear that he expects his administration officials to fight requests from the opposing party Attorney General William Barr declined a Democratic request to testify last week in the House about special counsel Robert Mueller's report, a day after appearing in the Republican-controlled Senate.

An administration official familiar with the matter said the Trump administration is not backing down in the fight over the President's tax returns.

""It appears the Justice Department is prepared to litigate"" the matter in the courts if Neal goes that route, the official said.

Neal said in a statement Monday that he was still determining next steps.

""Today, Secretary Mnuchin notified me that the IRS will not provide the documents I requested under Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code,"" Neal said. ""I will consult with counsel and determine the appropriate response.""

The committee chairman could issue a subpoena on top of his request, or Democrats could move to hold the Treasury Secretary or IRS Commissioner for whom the original request was addressed to in contempt of Congress.

Some Democrats made clear Monday that they are eager to escalate, citing the Mueller report as well as the conviction of Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen.

""On a day when his former fixer heads to jail and his current fixer heads the Department of Justice, President Trump obstructs both Mueller and his tax returns from speaking for themselves,"" Texas Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett said in a statement. ""We need immediate legal action. We cannot allow this bad president to set bad precedent.""

The top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, applauded the decision not to turn over Trump's returns.

""After consulting with the Justice Department the Treasury Department has come to the firm conclusion that we have known since day one: this request from House Democrats to weaponize the tax code for purely political reasons is illegitimate and should be treated as such,"" Brady said in a statement. ""This politically motivated abuse of the law violates our Constitution -- and serves no legislative purpose. Abusing the tax writing Committee's authority to go after a political enemy sets a dangerous precedent, and the Administration is right not to go along with it.""

Democrats initially directed their request to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig , the only person with the legal authority to turn over the returns, but Mnuchin has interceded twice in the matter, citing his role overseeing the federal tax collector.

Mnuchin said in April he would deliver a response by May 6.

The Justice Department has declined to comment on the matter.

The fight over the request may ultimately to lead to a court fight -- which would be a rare example of Congress suing the executive branch for information. The Trump administration is already stonewalling other Democratic committee chairman on everything from the Mueller report to interviews with former White House counsel Don McGahn.

Neal made his initial ask for Trump's tax information on April 3 after a months-long deliberation with staff, committee members and House lawyers.

He also sent a follow-up letter demanding that Treasury comply with the request no later than April 23. But Treasury missed the deadlines, a strategy Democrats have argued was an effort to delay the process

Democrats on the tax-writing committee have argued that they have the ability to request Trump's personal tax information under an obscure statute that permits three people to request personal tax information of any individual: the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, the Senate Finance Committee chairman and the chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation.

The statute says that the secretary of the Treasury ""shall furnish"" it.

The statute has been used by Congress before, including in the Republican investigation under President Barack Obama into whether the IRS was discriminating against conservative groups applying for non-profit status. Requests for information using the law are also made on a regular basis for research purposes.

Neal has argued that he needs Trump's taxes in order to conduct oversight of the IRS's presidential audit program to both understand how the IRS is using the program and to see if the program needs to be codified into law.

But Mnuchin has asserted the ""unprecedented"" request raises ""serious constitutional issues"" that could have dire consequences for taxpayer privacy and has consulted with the Justice Department on the matter.

The Treasury secretary has also raised concerns that setting such a precedent could be ""potentially weaponizing"" the IRS.

The Massachusetts Democrat has previously indicated that defying his request would be interpreted as noncompliance and lead to an escalation of a standoff between the Trump administration and House Democrats.

""It is not the proper function of the IRS, Treasury or Justice to question or second guess the motivations of the committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns and return information,"" Neal wrote to Rettig in response to the missed deadline on April 23. ""Please know that if you fail to comply, your failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request.""

In interviews last month, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News that there was no world in which Democrats would get the President's tax returns.

Democrats are up against a barrage of denied requests from the administration, forcing leadership into tough decisions about what oversight priorities are worth pursuing in court.

House Democrats are lodged in an all-out-battle with the Department of Justice after the agency refused to hand over an unredacted Mueller report by Wednesday's deadline. That was despite a subpoena from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler. Nadler has said he plans to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress if the report is not turned over in upcoming days.

Trump's personal lawyers also sued last week to block banks and an accounting firm from turning over Trump's financial records to the House Financial Services, House Intelligence and House Oversight Committees, a move that has led some Democratic chairs to question what the President has to hide.

""Whether it is refusing to sit down in an interview with Mueller or whether it is constantly obstructing justice by trying to stop testimonies and stop people from cooperating, whether it is filing a lawsuit, he obviously has something to hide,"" House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters said last week.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry: It is time for America to boost its dominance in artificial intelligence,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Rick Perry', 'Matthew J. Belvedere']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/07/rick-perry-it-is-time-for-america-to-boost-its-dominance-in-artificial-intelligence.html,"When America agreed to stop underground testing of nuclear weapons, supercomputers from the U.S. Department of Energy provided the precise and sophisticated simulations necessary to ensure the arsenal's ongoing effectiveness.

When scientists sought to model the universe's evolution, they brought their data to the experts and supercomputers at DOE.

When studying cancer, interpreting mammograms, and improving vaccination campaigns and diagnoses for Americans from children to veterans, DOE computers have been crucial to success of researchers seeking to deliver precision care to patients.

The quiet contributions of these incredible machines have solved some of the world's toughest problems and kept the U.S. at the forefront of high-performance computing for decades. They are developed and operated by some of the most gifted scientists in the world. These computers will also fuel America's efforts to maintain the Nation's global leadership in artificial intelligence.

While the United States leads the world in AI capabilities today, China is gaining ground. The government in Beijing has invested in and backed AI efforts in China with one goal in mind: to overtake the United States and dominate the AI world.

Thankfully, we have a president who is committed to ensuring that doesn't happen. That is why he recently issued an executive order creating the government-wide American AI Initiative. The president wants to ensure this innovation occurs in the United States.

The executive order calls for increased access to federal data, models and high performance computing resources for America's AI researchers.

I am proud that some of those resources and computers live at our DOE National Labs, where we currently possess five of the 10 fastest supercomputers in the world, including the top two fastest and the world's top AI supercomputer.

Through this executive order, the president has given DOE and other agencies a mandate to further utilize our world-class high performance computing infrastructure to build upon and accelerate America's existing AI research. We are ready for the challenge.

DOE computing capabilities will be critical to securing America's dominance in artificial intelligence. That is why we must take these already high-performance capabilities to the next level.

I am excited to announce today that along with Cray and AMD, DOE will be building Frontier, a new exascale system at Oak Ridge National Lab, or ORNL.

Exascale systems are capable of at least a billion-billion calculations per second, which means they are at least 10 to 20 times faster than today's fastest supercomputers, and 50 to 100 times more powerful – the equivalent of going from a flip phone to a smart phone or from a dialup to a 4G internet connection.

DOE has committed to building not just one, but three exascale machines at its National Labs: Frontier at Oak Ridge in Tennessee, Aurora at Argonne in Illinois, and El Capitan at Lawrence Livermore in California, all of which we expect to deploy around 2021-22.

With exascale capability, researchers will be able to look deeper and see further than they ever have before. They will develop better answers to more complex questions and meet more complex challenges with greater precision and speed.

Expected applications include identifying next-generation materials like exotic alloys for the defense, aerospace and energy sectors; determining optimal cancer treatments based on a patient's unique genetics; refining earth system models to more reliably assess water cycles and agricultural impacts; deciphering high-energy physics data; and accelerating industrial product design.

DOE-fueled AI work is already being used to optimize grid security and increase energy efficiency – among a host of other energy-related applications. It is also being used to reduce traffic jams, strengthen cybersecurity, predict extreme weather, improve emergency response and even develop better treatments for cancer and traumatic brain injury.

DOE's systems have used machine learning to search through a billion combinations of drugs to find those predicted to maximally inhibit a given tumor, to search through a billion hypothetical compounds to identify those with potential as new drug development candidates, to design new materials, to develop new algorithms to manage electric grid operations.

We must use our supercomputing capabilities to fully develop the potential of AI. That's why we are coordinating those efforts across our National Labs, and have stood up an AI program at DOE.

Those are the stakes in AI and exascale computing.

The competition from China is great, but America is the world's leader, and has never shied away from a challenge … and it always thrived when exploring new frontiers.

DOJ releases second redacted version of Mueller report over FOIA lawsuits,https://thehill.com,[],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/442400-doj-releases-second-redacted-version-of-mueller-report-over-foia,"The Department of Justice on Monday released a second redacted version of the Mueller report, but the document doesn’t appear to make public new details about the special counsel’s investigation and findings.

This redacted version of the report was released in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits filed by the privacy group Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and BuzzFeed News reporter Jason Leopold.

Leopold noted on Twitter that while the lengthy report itself doesn’t seem to provide new public information, it does shed more light on why certain information was withheld.

It appears the version of the report is identical but clearly identifies what info was withheld in response to ongoing investigations, etc. — Jason Leopold (@JasonLeopold) May 6, 2019

While the initial version of the Mueller report released last month labeled redactions in categories such as “harm to an ongoing matter” and “grand jury information,” redactions in this version of the document are aligned with certain FOIA regulations.

Leopold also tweeted out a letter the Justice Department sent him that explains the redactions made to the report under FOIA.

The letter points to FOIA exemptions pertaining to national security, grand jury proceedings and ongoing law enforcement actions. It also cites exemptions that would reveal law enforcement tactics as well as information that could violate individuals’ right to privacy and right to a fair trial or other legal processes.

Attorneys for EPIC and Leopold said in court last week that they intended to challenge each redaction made under the FOIA law.

Justice Department attorneys argued that both parties should wait until they see this newly released version of the report, suggesting that they believed it was unreasonable for each redaction to be challenged, as some would not be overturned.

District Judge Reggie Walton, who is overseeing the case, has set a series of deadlines in the lawsuits that stretch into the summer, indicating that the case will not be fully resolved for several more months.

Walton, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush, said during last week's hearing that both parties have to make challenges to the redactions ""in good faith,"" noting that the government has the right to withhold information such as grand jury matters.

He has also said that he understands the desire to quickly move forward with the case.

EPIC is also suing under FOIA for the Justice Department to release the underlying evidence used to draft the Mueller report.

The privacy group reiterated in a blog post after the second version of the report was released on Monday that it still plans to challenge each redaction made to the document.

'He’s just a loyalist': Trump's ICE pick Mark Morgan blasted by former DHS officials,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hes-just-a-loyalist-trumps-ice-pick-mark-morgan-blasted-by-former-dhs-officials,"Former officials who served at the top of the Department of Homeland Security are worried Mark Morgan, President Trump’s new pick to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is better suited to Fox News than leading the agency.

Two top Homeland Security officials who spoke with the Washington Examiner Monday described Morgan as a career FBI employee with less than one year of experience working in any Homeland Security entity, who likely got the job because he used TV stints to woo Trump.

“What he does is he goes on Fox News and shoots his mouth out — how he was in charge of Border Patrol for three months?” said the first official, who has led two Homeland Security agencies and asked to speak on background to avoid upsetting clients. “People look at that as an expert. He’s far from an expert. He’s just a loyalist, OK? He gets on Fox and talks about how good the president is. The president loves it: ‘Why don’t we hire this guy?’”

Morgan emerged on Fox last year and has since made a name for himself by endorsing Trump's policies, including transporting asylum-seekers to sanctuary cities. One official the Examiner heard from said he may hurt his ability to lead ICE if he steps on the toes of other Homeland Security officials who have more say on border policies than he does as the head of an agency tasked with homeland security investigations and deported unauthorized immigrants.

“Trump may expect him to continue to be an outspoken advocate, but Morgan will step on a lot of toes within Homeland Security if he continually strays outside his lane. Becoming head of ICE will give him a lane he hasn’t had since he left the Obama administration,” a second official wrote in an email. “I think it will be a bit harder for Morgan to 'push the Trump agenda' as head of ICE (if confirmed), especially more so than as he has been able to from outside the system.”

Morgan is slated to take over an agency he has no experience working for. After an 11-year stint in the Marine Corps and 20 years in the FBI, he was tapped in 2014 for assistant commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. In that role, he oversaw the Border Patrol.

But Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, railed against Obama’s pick of Morgan in late 2016 because it marked the first time in the agency’s 93 years a nonagent had been tapped to lead the 20,000 agents. Shortly after assuming office in early 2017, Trump fired the Obama holdover.

Because of Morgan’s reputation as uninterested in working with the Border Patrol union, the second official said he may face problems if he does not work with ICE’s union president, Chris Crane.

ICE has not had a confirmed director since January 2017. Trump’s first pick, Tom Homan, retired after waiting to be confirmed. Last summer, Trump picked Customs and Border Protection Assistant Commissioner Ronald Vitiello to oversee ICE, but let him go in early April to hire someone “tougher.”

But for all Trump has done to find nominees who support his agenda and are willing to serve, the first official said he has made no progress on implementing meaningful changes to immigration and border policies.

“Think about Trump — the only thing Trump has done, he’s raised this issue … But everything he’s tried to do has failed,” the official said. “He has not made a single dent in this whole thing. Matter of fact, it’s worse than ever. He’s hoping this Morgan will bring his enforcement background to this, but he’s going to run up against the same buzz saws.”

For all of the concerns, the same official said he hopes Morgan is confirmed if only so the agency has permanent leadership.

Vitiello wouldn’t comment on how he expects Morgan to perform as director or whether he will be able to get confirmed, he said.

“I wish Mr. Morgan the best as he takes the helm,” Vitiello wrote in an email. “The men and women of ICE, and their loved ones, deserve our never ending support. They work each day to protect the homeland, secure our border and ensure integrity of the U.S. immigration and trade systems. Despite the crisis at our border, exacerbated by congressional inaction, they perform their tasks with Integrity, Courage and Excellence.”"

DOJ sues West Virginia governor's coal companies for $4.8 million,https://www.wdbj7.com,"['Siobhan Mcgirl', 'Eddie Callahan']",,,,https://www.wdbj7.com/content/news/US-sues-coal-companies-in-Virginia-and-other-states-for-47-mill-in-penalties-for-violating-Federal-Mine-Safety-and-Health-Act-509598671.html,"The Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, and his family are under fire with the federal government. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) filed a civil suit Tuesday for nearly $4.8 million dollars in unpaid fines.

The Department of Justice is alleging that 23 companies, either associated with or owned by Justice or his children, have racked up thousands of safety violations over the course of the last five years.

According to a press release from the DOJ, between May 3, 2014 and May 3, 2019, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has filed 2,297 or more citations against the coal companies in Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky.

“As alleged in the complaint, the defendants racked up over 2,000 safety violations over a five-year period and have, to date, refused to comply with their legal obligations to pay the resulting financial penalties,"" said U.S. Attorney Thomas T. Cullen in a press release Tuesday. ""This is unacceptable, and, as indicated by this suit, we will hold them accountable.”

According to the DOJ, the civil penalties were referred to their office in Sept. 2018 after the Department of Treasury made several failed attempts to collect the money. A representative for the DOJ says the companies still failed to pay the debts and continue not to pay both the old and newly assessed penalties.

The US is seeking judgment against the companies for $3.9 million and an additional $821,386.03 in administrative costs and interest, according to the release.

An attorney for James C. Justice Companies told WDBJ7 that his office has been trying to resolve the matter for several months and claimed that many of the penalties were incurred previously when the operations were owned by a Russian company.

""The Justice companies are disappointed that the US Attorneys office has decided to follow this route at this time,"" said Mike Carey, a lawyer representing the James C. Justice Companies.

The Assistant Secretary of Labor for the MSHA said they stand with the DOJ in seeking to hold mine operators responsible.

“In the Mine Act, Congress was extremely clear on enforcement matters: Federal inspectors issue citations for safety and health violations, which carry a monetary fine,"" said Assistant Secretary Zatezalo in a press release Tuesday. ""Failure to pay penalties is unfair to miners who deserve safe workplaces, and to mine operators who play by the rules.”

Carey said that the Justice Companies intend to vigorously defend this case.

Most of Ford's remaining pollution to stay in Ringwood under cheaper cleanup deal with EPA,https://www.northjersey.com,"['Scott Fallon', 'Published P.M. Et May']",05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/environment/2019/05/06/nj-superfund-site-epa-reaches-21-m-deal-ford-and-ringwood/1122272001/,"CLOSE Drone footage of five Superfund sites in North Jersey, including Edgewater, Garfield, Maywood, Passaic and Hudson Rivers. Tariq Zehawi and Danielle Parhizkaran and Scott Fallon, North Jersey Record

Federal environmental officials reached a $21 million settlement late Monday with Ford Motor Co. and Ringwood on a controversial cleanup of the borough's sprawling Superfund site that will leave tons of polluted soil in place under a barrier.

The agreement filed in U.S. District Court is another step toward affirming a plan that would keep 166,000 tons of contaminated soil at the O'Connor Disposal Area despite the objections of residents who live nearby, including many members of the Ramapough Lenape tribe.

""The fight is not over,"" Vincent Mann, chief of the Ramapough's Turtle Clan, said of the settlement. ""We are going to try everything we can to stop this, because that pollution is going to sit there forever and affect our people, the land, the plants and the animals.""

The pollution dates back a half-century to when contractors for Ford Motor Co. began taking toxic paint sludge from its Mahwah factory and dumping it in the forests and old iron mines of Upper Ringwood next to a low-income neighborhood. At the time, Ringwood officials gave permission to Ford, which is why the borough is also on the hook for the cleanup.

The site has been mismanaged in the past. The EPA declared it clean and removed it from the Superfund list only to reinstate it after a series last decade by The Record showed paint sludge was still strewn across the forested mountains of Ringwood.

Tons of contaminated material has since been excavated from the site.

But the EPA had originally planned to have Ford and the borough pay $32.6 million to remove the contamination at O'Connor, off Peters Mine Road. But at the last minute, Ringwood officials introduced plans to build a new recycling center — paid for by Ford — on an asphalt barrier atop O'Connor.

The move lowered the cleanup's cost by $27.2 million to $5.4 million, drawing both outrage from many who want the pollution removed and support from some residents who fear that a costly cleanup would significantly raise their property taxes. Story continues below gallery

EPA officials have said they have no control over local land use and have little choice but to allow the recycling center to be built despite originally calling for excavation. They said the barrier would be protective of human health.

The $21 million settlement would also pay to cap Cannon Mine and Peters Mine at the site where Ford contractors dumped waste. In addition, contaminated soil and other material will be removed from around the opening of the pit near Peters Mine.

Although high levels of lead, benzene and arsenic have long contaminated the 500-acre site, it wasn't until spring 2015 that scientists found a new chemical that made them pause in their plans to cap. It was 1,4-dioxane, a colorless solvent that health officials believe causes cancer.

Subsequent tests over the next 18 months found high amounts of 1,4-dioxane in the groundwater and brooks that run from the Ringwood Superfund site to the northern reaches of the Wanaque Reservoir. The chemical has not been detected in the reservoir.

The chemical's discovery prompted some residents to push for a question on the 2016 municipal ballot about the cleanup, in an attempt to overturn the borough's decision on the recycling center. But a state judge ruled against supporters of the measure.

In a news release issued late Monday, EPA officials said they expect to propose a long-term plan to address groundwater contamination, including 1,4-dioxane, later this year.

Under the terms of Monday's settlement, Ford and the borough will pay an estimated $17.6 million for site work and $3.6 million to reimburse the EPA for ""past costs at the site.""

“This important agreement ensures that the responsible parties will perform the work needed to address contamination at Ringwood Mines,” EPA Regional Administrator Pete Lopez said in a statement.

Lopez also said the EPA ""appreciates the dedication and passion of the community members and the members of the Community Advisory Group, whose active engagement on this site has greatly informed our work.”

Mann said the concerns of his people and many others in the community have fallen on deaf ears.

Mann said he has tried twice to request a meeting this year with the state Attorney General's Office because Gov. Phil Murphy has spoken passionately about supporting environmental justice initiatives.

No meeting has been scheduled, Mann said Monday.

""I don't expect there will be one after this,"" he said.

Pentagon departure expands vacancies in DOD,https://thehill.com,[],05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/442041-pentagon-departure-expands-vacancies-in-dod,"Another Pentagon official is stepping down later this month, adding to the void of confirmed top-tier officials within the Department of Defense (DOD).

Robert Daigle, the director of DOD’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) office, will leave after two years in the role.

“On behalf of the entire Department of Defense, I thank Bob Daigle for his extraordinary service over the past two years,” Shanahan said.

He adds that Daigle and his team “have been key architects of the investment strategies that ensure our military is ready to compete, deter, and win in any high-end fight of the future. These investments have formed the foundation for our Department's FY19 and FY20 strategy-driven budgets, enabling DoD to field new technologies and weapons systems at the speed of relevance.

“We wish Bob and his family all the best in his future endeavors. His strong leadership will be missed across the Department.”

Defense News reported that Daigle is leaving in mid-May to rejoin the private sector.

Daigle had led CAPE since August 2017, overseeing several major decisions, including the move to shutter the USS Truman aircraft carrier — a plan overturned by the Trump administration earlier this week. He also was behind the requirement that the Air Force buy more F-15X fighter aircraft, though service leaders had not asked for them.

His departure adds to the growing number of top positions left empty or filled by individuals in an acting basis, including the secretary and deputy secretary of defense, the Pentagon's chief management officer, the office of the undersecretary of personnel and readiness and the Air Force secretary."
Arizona Democrats urge DHS to send FEMA to southern border,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/arizona-democrats-urge-dhs-to-send-fema-to-southern-border,"Five House Democrats from Arizona on Monday asked the Department of Homeland Security to consider deploying Federal Emergency Management Agency resources and personnel to help respond to the ""humanitarian crisis"" at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Reps. Ruben Gallego, Raúl Grijalva, Ann Kirkpatrick, Tom O’Halleran, and Greg Stanton told acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan in a letter they would be supportive if he chose to activate FEMA to help handle the tens of thousands of families and children coming into federal custody at the southern border each month.

“[D]o you believe that FEMA has the authority to provide additional resources to reduce the burden on other DHS agencies, localities, and local groups who are overwhelmed by this crisis? If so, we strongly urge you to leverage these resources,” the lawmakers wrote.

[Related: Number of Democrats concerned about illegal immigration more than triples]

Sen. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., told reporters at a press conference in Yuma, Ariz., last month she opposed taking money from FEMA and instead wanted to address asylum protocols.

The Trump administration began warning of a “crisis” at the border late last year. Since then, the number of people apprehended for illegal entry has spiked from 70,000 to 92,000 in March.

Although FEMA workers are typically sent to areas where major natural disasters have hit, sending people and resources to the southern border would not be unprecedented. At the height of the unaccompanied minors surge in June 2014, former President Barack Obama called in FEMA to oversee the federal response to the more than 5,000 children arriving at the border.

In March, nearly 9,000 unaccompanied children showed up and another 60,000 people taken into custody were families.

The group of Democrats told McAleenan they are disappointed with the department’s attempt to set up a cell to oversee the federal effort to deal with the ""humanitarian crisis.""

Five weeks ago, then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tapped its Joint Task Force West director, Manuel Padilla, to oversee an interagency border emergency cell. Padilla’s job was to improve the sharing of information and coordinating support among DHS agencies, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, CBP, and Citizenship and Immigration Services.

But the lawmakers said since Nielsen’s sudden departure in mid-April, DHS has not shared any information about the cell’s work or how it is assisting agencies.

“At the moment, it appears that this cell is insufficient to adequately coordinate the response to the humanitarian crisis. Please explain what Mr. Padilla’s role will be moving forward and what resources you will provide him to do his job,” the letter states. “It is imperative that the federal coordinator gather and analyze information from local officials to resolve logistical, personnel, and capacity issues as well as coordinate with and leverage state, local, tribal, and non-governmental resources. This is a complex, multi-jurisdictional problem that requires a centralized command and coordination structure.”

The Democratic coalition wants to see DHS appoint a new federal crisis coordinator or enhance Padilla’s responsibilities so that not only the government response is understood and being carried out swiftly, but nongovernmental organizations can better coordinate with DHS agencies.

In early April, the White House was reported to be considering naming an immigration czar to his staff, though no announcements have been made.

Padilla was temporarily reassigned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's National Response Coordination Center in Washington. He was previously the chief of Border Patrol's busiest sector on the southern border, the Rio Grande Valley in Texas."
