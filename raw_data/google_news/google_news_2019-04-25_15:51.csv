"What Donald Trump actually did in 2016, according to the Mueller report",https://www.vox.com,['Apr'],04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/2019/4/25/18510852/mueller-report-trump-russia-collusion-conspiracy,"In the midst of the Mueller report’s lengthy chronicle of Trump associates’ contacts with Russia or other shady characters during the 2016 campaign, there’s intriguing new information about just what Donald Trump personally was involved in.

The report details how Trump authorized and remained very interested in Michael Cohen’s efforts to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. It also reveals that Trump repeatedly told his campaign associates to find Hillary Clinton’s emails — and that Michael Flynn tried to make that happen for him.

Furthermore, tantalizingly redacted passages of the report appear to describe Trump getting some sort of information about WikiLeaks’ plans to release more damaging material about Clinton — though it remains unclear how accurate this information was or how strong Mueller’s evidence is.

So altogether, what the report reveals is that Trump had ambitions for a lucrative Russian business deal, he was eager to “find” his opponent’s emails, and he apparently heard something about WikiLeaks.

However, Mueller discloses no evidence of any personal involvement from Trump pertaining to Russian contacts from George Papadopoulos, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Carter Page, or Jeff Sessions. He found “no documentary evidence” that Trump was aware of his son’s meeting with a Russian lawyer beforehand.

And, of course, Mueller found no conspiracy between Trump and Russian government officials to interfere with the election — and his report does not give off the impression that he was anywhere close to making such a charge.

Rather than any super-spy conspiracy involving the highest levels of the Trump campaign, then, the Mueller report seems to tell a story of a series of disorganized contacts, missed opportunities — and, occasionally, outright bullshit.

What Trump was personally involved in

The Mueller report’s first volume, on Russian interference with the election, covers a host of events, but only goes into detail about Donald Trump’s personal role in three of them.

1) Trump Tower Moscow: Michael Cohen told Mueller that while Trump was running for president in 2015 and 2016, he approved Cohen’s effort to get a Trump Tower built in Moscow. Cohen said that “on several occasions,” Trump would bring up the project and ask for updates. At one point, Cohen reached out to Vladimir Putin’s press secretary’s office to try to advance the project; he then briefed Trump on the ensuing conversation, he says.

In May 2016 — when Trump was the Republican nominee-in-waiting — Cohen says Trump told him he’d be willing to travel to Russia if that could nail down the deal. That summer, after Trump publicly denied having anything to do with Russia, he checked in with Cohen on the status of the Moscow project, Cohen says. In the end, Cohen was unsuccessful in moving the project forward and it fizzled out that summer.

None of this was criminal, but the details of Trump’s long-running interest in this potentially “highly lucrative” Moscow business deal cast new light on what might have been motivating his unusually warm words for Putin on the campaign trail.

2) WikiLeaks and Roger Stone: Did Donald Trump have some sort of inside information on WikiLeaks’ plans to release hacked Democratic emails?

We still don’t know, because this is one of the most heavily redacted sections in the report — though what we can see of it makes clear that this section describes conversations Trump had with his advisers.

The redactions apparently hide references to Roger Stone, so as not to prejudice his upcoming trial. Prosecutors have alleged that Stone tried to get in touch with Julian Assange in the summer of 2016 in order to get ahold of future WikiLeaks releases related to Clinton. But while the indictment against Stone presented some evidence that he learned the group had leaks related to John Podesta coming, it didn’t attempt to tell the whole story of what he knew.

That whole story — at least as far as Mueller could nail it down — appears to be in pages 51 through 59 of the report’s first volume. And the unredacted bits there have several references to Trump, Cohen, Rick Gates, and Paul Manafort discussing WikiLeaks, apparently with or about Stone.

For instance, at one point, Trump is described as having a phone call with a redacted person, and then telling Rick Gates that more damaging information is coming.

Later in the report, Mueller writes that one potential motivation for Trump to obstruct the Russia investigation would be “potential uncertainty about whether certain events — such as advance notice of WikiLeaks’ release of hacked information” — could be criminal on the part of Trump, his campaign, or his family.

So did Stone and Trump in fact end up getting solid advance information about WikiLeaks’ plans? Or is it a murkier situation? We’ll likely have to wait for either a leak or the end of Stone’s November trial to find out.

3) Trying to find Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails: Whatever did happen with WikiLeaks, Mueller’s report makes one thing clear: Trump wanted to get ahold of Hillary Clinton’s emails.

On July 27, 2016, Trump publicly made his now-infamous comment, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing” — referring to emails that Clinton deleted rather than turn over to investigators, because she said they were personal and not work-related. (These emails became an obsession among some conservatives, who asserted they would reveal Clinton’s corruption.)

Now, the report reveals Trump privately asked his advisers to get Clinton’s emails too: Michael Flynn, then advising Trump’s campaign, “recalled that Trump made this request repeatedly.”

Flynn then took action on Trump’s request, contacting “multiple people in an effort to obtain the emails,” including Republican donor Peter Smith, who suggested he was reaching out to Russian hackers about it. But Mueller’s report implies Smith (who has since died) was bullshitting about that, and Clinton’s own emails never surfaced.

Trump’s request to find Clinton’s emails wasn’t necessarily for illegal activity — some conservatives believed the emails were already out on the “dark web” somewhere, waiting to be found. But it certainly shows a willingness to solicit shady and questionable behavior, and makes one all the more curious to learn what actually happened with WikiLeaks.

Mueller found “no documentary evidence” Trump knew about Don Jr.’s meeting

Nearly two years ago, the world learned that, in June 2016, Donald Trump Jr. eagerly accepted a meeting to get dirt on Hillary Clinton — dirt said to be coming from the Russian government. It seemed to come quite close to the “collusion” that Trump had long denied occurred.

So almost immediately, the question arose of whether Don Jr. told his father about this endeavor. Steve Bannon told journalist Michael Wolff that there was “zero” chance Trump wasn’t involved. And Michael Cohen publicly testified this year that he remembers Don Jr. telling his father about a meeting beforehand — though not mentioning anything about Russia explicitly.

Mueller’s report describes Cohen’s claims, but admits they couldn’t be proved. The special counsel writes that he found no “documentary evidence showing that he [Trump] was made aware of the meeting — or its Russian connection — before it occurred.”

Importantly, the special counsel also seems to accept the Trump team’s longstanding claims that the meeting was a dud, producing no useful dirt or any significant consequences. For instance, Mueller writes that Kushner texted Manafort “waste of time” during the meeting, and writes that “the Russian lawyer’s presentation did not provide” the information offered. The special counsel also writes that “the investigation did not identify evidence connecting the events of June 9 to the GRU’s hack-and-dump operation” — that is, the Democratic email leaks.

So in the end, as shady as the Trump Tower meeting looked, it didn’t amount to anything significant and there was no hard evidence that Trump was aware of it.

Mueller presents no evidence of Trump’s personal involvement in the other incidents Mueller outlines

Finally, though Mueller outlines a rather breathtaking assortment of contacts between members of Trump’s campaign and people with ties to Russia, he doesn’t produce any evidence showing that Trump himself was involved in most of them. Here are seven of the main ones:

1) George Papadopoulos’s “dirt”: In April 2016, Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos got a tip that Russia had dirt on Hillary Clinton, in the form of thousands of emails. (The tip came from a London-based professor, Joseph Mifsud, who said he had connections in the Russia government and had just returned from a visit there.)

In the ensuing weeks, Papadopoulos shared this news about Russian dirt on Clinton with the foreign minister of Greece and a diplomat from Australia. Papadopoulos also talked to Trump campaign aides about messages from the Russian government and a potential trip to Moscow. He even wrote in a journal at one point: “They are talking to us. It is a lot of risk. Office of Putin.”

Naturally, one would think that Papadopoulos also told people in the Trump campaign about the Russian “dirt” on Clinton — it’s big news! But Mueller’s investigation failed to establish that this occurred.

Papadopoulos himself said “he could not clearly recall” having told anyone on the campaign, and the campaign officials Mueller’s team questioned “stated, with varying degrees of certainty, that he did not tell them.” And there’s no apparent evidence of this information making its way to Trump himself.

2) Manafort’s sharing of polling data: Mueller’s report found that Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort had internal campaign polling data sent to a Russian associate, with the understanding it would be given to several Ukrainian and one Russian oligarch. Manafort also met Kilimnik and discussed the campaign’s strategy, including targeting of Midwestern states.

But there is no indication in the report that Trump was aware of or involved in what Manafort was doing. And Mueller’s report leaves open the possibility that Manafort was merely out to drum up future business.

“The Office did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort’s sharing polling data and Russia’s interference in the election,” Mueller writes. He adds: “The investigation did not establish that Manafort otherwise coordinated with the Russian government on its election-interference efforts.”

3) Carter Page’s Moscow visit: The July 2016 trip to Moscow from Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page has stoked conspiracy theories since it was first reported — and it was heavily featured in the Steele dossier. (Steele claimed Page conspired with Russian officials about the DNC email leak and plotted a major financial payoff, but Page has always maintained nothing untoward happened.)

The only new evidence Mueller shows about this in the report looks exculpatory for Page. He reveals an email from Putin’s press secretary discussing Page’s trip, which says: “I have read about [Page]. Specialists say that he is far from being the main one. So I better not initiate a meeting in the Kremlin.” That is: At least one Russian official was wary about meeting Page.

It remains curious that Page emailed Trump campaign advisers from the trip, bragging about “incredible insights and outreach” he’d received from Russian officials. But, Mueller writes: “The Office was unable to obtain additional evidence or testimony about who Page may have met or communicated with in Moscow; thus, Page’s activities in Russia — as described in his emails with the Campaign — were not fully explained.”

In any case, Mueller did not charge Page with any crimes; he writes, “The investigation did not establish that Page coordinated with the Russian government in its efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.” And there’s no sign of any involvement from Donald Trump (whom Page says he’s never even spoken to) in any of this.

4) Roger Stone’s Russian contacts: While many details about longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone’s contacts with WikiLeaks are redacted in the report, Mueller does describe two contacts Stone had during the campaign — contacts that seem not to have led anywhere.

First, in May 2016, Stone took a meeting with a Florida-based Russian named Henry Oknyansky and a Ukrainian associate of his named Alexei Rasin, who tried to sell Stone “derogatory information on Clinton” that he said he had. But a deal does not appear to have been made. Mueller writes that his investigation could not “determine the content and origin of the information” offered, and “did not identify evidence” to any connection to Russian interference efforts.

Second, in August 2016, Stone exchanged Twitter DMs with “Guccifer 2.0,” an online persona created by Russian intelligence officers involved in the hack-and-leak operation. These messages have long been public and seem innocuous. And, Mueller writes, “The investigation did not identify evidence of other communications between Stone and Guccifer 2.0.”

5) The amendment to the Republican platform about Ukraine: During the 2016 Republican convention, one delegate proposed an amendment that would arm Ukraine. The Trump campaign’s efforts to weaken that amendment raised eyebrows, with many wondering if the campaign was carrying water for Moscow.

Trump campaign official J.D. Gordon led this effort — and, per the delegate he butted heads with, Gordon said he had been on the phone with Trump about the topic. But the delegate herself was skeptical about whether that was true, and Gordon’s phone records suggest he may have been engaged in some puffery — they don’t include calls to a number associated with Trump, Mueller writes.

In the end, Mueller concludes: “The investigation did not establish that Gordon spoke to or was directed by the candidate to make that proposal.”

6) Jeff Sessions and Sergey Kislyak: Back in 2017, a media frenzy erupted when word leaked out that Trump’s attorney general Jeff Sessions had met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, during the campaign — despite telling a Senate committee he had not. (Sessions was a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser at the time.)

Mueller writes that his office considered charging Sessions with making false statements, but decided against it. He opines that it is “plausible” that Sessions truly didn’t think of the meeting when asked about it in the heat of the moment during Senate testimony.

Meanwhile, Mueller presents nothing to contradict Session’s story that his meeting with Kislyak barely mentioned the presidential campaign, and that other interactions they had were brief and at public events. Overall, Sessions’s story seems to have held up.

7) Michael Flynn, Sergey Kislyak, and sanctions: In December 2016, after Trump had won the election but before he was sworn in, President Obama announced new sanctions on Russia. Michael Flynn and Kislyak then spoke on the phone, and Flynn urged Kislyak that Russia should respond with restraint. Putin soon announced he would do so, and Kislyak told Flynn his words made the difference.

Flynn lied about these contacts to the FBI, denying that he talked about sanctions with Kislyak. After Flynn struck a plea deal with Mueller’s team in December 2017, many wondered whether Flynn would reveal that Trump had in fact ordered him to send that message to Kislyak — perhaps as a payoff for election help.

But Mueller dug into this matter thoroughly — scrutinizing communication records, accounts from Flynn, and accounts from other Trump transition officials involved — and he concludes: “The investigation did not identify evidence that the President-Elect asked Flynn to make any request to Kislyak.”

Instead, by the account in Mueller’s report, this was a plan hatched among transition advisers — notably Bannon and K.T. McFarland — but not Trump personally. Even a week later, “Flynn did not have a specific recollection of telling the President-Elect about the substance of his calls with Kislyak,” Mueller writes (and he appears to view Flynn’s testimony as credible).

As to why Flynn lied about this afterward, by his account, it was because Trump was angry when word of the Kislyak calls first leaked in the Washington Post. “Flynn recalled that he felt a lot of pressure because Priebus had spoken to the ‘boss’ and said Flynn needed to ‘kill the story,’” Mueller writes. So Flynn started falsely denying there was any talk of sanctions with Kislyak — first to other Trump advisers, then to the FBI.

That didn’t end well for Flynn, but, by Robert Mueller’s account at least, it doesn’t seem to have been part of some massive Trump-Russia conspiracy either."
Lara Trump denounces Biden's 2020 presidential announcement as 'race-baiting',https://www.foxnews.com,['Elizabeth Llorente'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lara-trump-says-that-bidens-third-try-to-be-democratic-presidential-nominee-may-be-the-charm,"President Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign adviser Lara Trump said on “America’s Newsroom” on Thursday that Democratic candidate Joe Biden supports policies that are too far-left for most Americans.

“Joe Biden is just among a sea of other [Democratic] candidates who quite frankly are all trying to out-Bernie one another, [they are] so far left, [have] become so radical,” said Lara, who is married to the president’s son, Eric.

Earlier in the day, the former vice president announced that he was throwing his hat into the ring to be the Democratic nominee for the 2020 presidential election.

Biden said that the “soul of this nation” is at stake if President Donald Trump wins re-election.

OCASIO-CORTEZ-ALIGNED GROUP ATTACKS BIDEN, SAYS HE'S 'OUT-OF-TOUCH' WITH DEMOCRATIC PARTY

The 76-year-old Biden becomes an instant front-runner alongside Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is leading many polls and has proved to be a successful fundraiser. Biden has legislative and international experience that is unmatched in the Democratic field, and he is among the best-known faces in U.S. politics.

Lara Trump said that both Biden and Sanders are to the extreme left of most American voters.

“When you look at things like Bernie Sanders running on socialism…when he claims that the Boston Marathon bombers should have the right to vote – that is so far outside what I think most Americans can back.”

In a video posted on Twitter, Biden focused on the 2017 deadly clash between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia. Biden noted Trump’s comments that there were some “very fine people” on both sides of the violent encounter, which left one woman dead.

“We are in the battle for the soul of this nation,” Biden said. “If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation — who we are. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen.”

MATT GORMAN: JOE BIDEN IS IN THE DEMOCRATIC 'FRIEND ZONE' - HE'S GOING TO REALLY REGRET THIS DECISION

Lara Trump dismissed Biden’s message as “race-baiting as usual, as we see from the Democrats, and identity politics is something I think we’ll see more of.”

“I didn’t hear any proposal for the future of this country in his announcement,” she said.

She said that she expects her father-in-law to do well in the election, including in Biden’s home state of Pennsylvania, because he has kept promises.

LESLIE MARSHALL: BIDEN'S IN FOR 2020 - HERE'S WHY HE'LL MAKE TRUMP A ONE-TERM PRESIDENT

“Pennsylvania is a state that Donald Trump won because he promised the people there that he would get them their jobs back,” she said. “The manufacturing jobs that were taken away that Barack Obama -- who I might remind folks was a partner right alongside Joe Biden and got a lot of nothing accomplished -- said we had lost for good and would never get the manufacturing jobs back. Donald Trump brought them back. That's something the people of Pennsylvania are incredibly grateful for.”

She added: “Whether you are talking about Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio, Florida, Michigan, people are going to look at their lives in 2020 and say 'is stuff better for me now than it was before Donald Trump took office or will we give Joe Biden a chance to do nothing like we saw during the Obama years?'”

Opinion | The Danger in Not Impeaching Trump,https://www.nytimes.com,['Elizabeth Drew'],04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/opinion/trump-impeachment.html,"Many people are getting their history and their definition of impeachment wrong by asserting that what forced Nixon to resign was the revelation in August 1974, very late in the process, of a recording of his trying to obstruct justice. This leads them to the erroneous conclusion that it’s essential to find a “smoking gun” to impeach a president.

In fact, even before that tape was released, the House Judiciary Committee had already approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon. It was widely understood that opinion had moved so strongly against him that the House would approve those articles and the Senate would vote to convict Nixon on those grounds. The tape simply hastened the finale.

By far the most important article of impeachment approved by the House committee on a bipartisan basis was Article II, which called for the punishment of Nixon for abusing presidential power by using the executive agencies (such as the Internal Revenue Service) to punish his enemies and for failing to uphold the oath of office to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed.” It also said, significantly, that a president could be held accountable for a pattern of abusive or even illegal behavior by his aides.

Madison and Hamilton didn’t say anything about holding off on impeachment because it would be politically risky. It’s hard to imagine they’d put political convenience on the same footing as the security of the Constitution. And the Democrats who prefer to substitute the 2020 election for an impeachment fight don’t appear to have considered the implications if Mr. Trump were to win: Would that not condone his constitutional abuses and encourage his authoritarian instincts?

Moreover, the report by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, left clear openings, perhaps even obligations, for Congress to act. Mr. Mueller did not say that there had been no collusion, or conspiracy , or whatever between Russian oligarchs and intelligence agents and members of the Trump campaign — in fact he traced the considerable traffic, or what he called “links” and “contacts,” between them in some detail. But he wrote that he couldn’t “establish” coordination between the Trump campaign and the “Russian government.” In his view, to win a court case, he had to prove some sort of specific agreement between the Trump campaign and that government.

While Mr. Mueller cited 10 likely instances of obstruction of justice on the president’s part, he said he stopped short of charging Mr. Trump with that crime largely because of a Justice Department rule that’s not law but is taken as Holy Writ. Mr. Mueller even invited Congress to address the matter. Almost as a plea, he added that “no person is above the law.”

The Democrats may succeed in avoiding a tumultuous, divisive fight over impeachment now. But if they choose to ignore clear abuses of the Constitution, they’ll also turn a blind eye to the precedent they’re setting and how feckless they’ll look in history."

With the White House Correspondents’ Dinner fast arriving on the Washington social calendar, the standard pose in the capital is one of detachment and disavowal: Sure, I’ll be going because, you know, you kinda have to, right? But it’s become such a drag, and it’s probably time, really, just to blow the whole thing up and start over.

This critique of the dinner has been building steadily for 30 years or more, as it grew from a straight celebration of the press to the frothy mix of power, fame and frivolity televised each spring from the massive 1960s-era ballroom of the Washington Hilton. It is too cozy with the influential people reporters are responsible for covering, the critique goes. It is too soaked in celebrity. The whole spectacle is too swollen and extravagant and irreverent, too far removed from the celebration of serious journalism and support for scholarships that is the dinner’s ostensible purpose.

Story Continued Below

Or at least it was. Come 2019, the image of the dinner as a celebrity-soaked extravagance suddenly feels like it comes from a different era. President Donald Trump announced that he will be skipping the dinner for the third year in a row, and then upped the ante by ordering his whole staff to boycott it. His newfound disdain for the dinner—an event he was only too happy to attend before becoming president—combined with the disdain many celebrities who once flocked to the event feel toward Trump have had an undeniable effect.

After a decade or more in which it built into a kind of fantasy weekend for political journalists—allowing a group drawn disproportionately from geeks and smart-alecks and clumsy kids picked last for dodgeball at last to sit at the cool kids’ table—the WHCD today is, at best, in a semi-flaccid state. People in the local economy of hotels, salons, limo companies, caterers and professional handlers report a marked drop in interest and spending among entertainment and business leaders in attending the dinner and the corresponding four-day marathon of parties that still surround it.

Veteran Washington social observers describe an unmistakable drop in the energy and allure of the dinner. “It certainly is not the glamour place to be in Washington anymore,” says writer and long-time Washington observer Sally Quinn. “What ignites something like this is to have celebrities from Hollywood and New York and the political celebrities from Washington, and when you don’t have either one, you’ve got 3,000 journalists staring at each other.”

This year, for the first time in its modern history, the dinner will not feature a professional entertainer. The White House Correspondents’ Association was besieged with criticism, including from some of its own members, after comedian Michelle Wolf’s sulphurous performance at the dinner last year. Her number included several raunchy bits and personal insults of White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, seated at the head table just a few feet away. This year, instead, the dinner will feature comments from historian Ron Chernow, whose biography of Alexander Hamilton was the basis for the hit musical.

Surely Chernow’s commentary will be intelligent and illuminating. But glitzy seems like a stretch. It’s possible the White House Correspondents’ Dinner won’t even be the most glamorous thing on C-SPAN this weekend.

This week, as reporters and producers drag out their once-a-year tuxedos and gowns, journalists in the capital are facing a paradox, painful or amusing depending on one’s point of view: The dinner actually is transforming into the more subdued and earnest event that journalists have long claimed to desire. And as the evening becomes a dry professional awards ceremony, it’s Donald Trump, the most celebrity-oriented and raucously irreverent president in history, who can take much of the credit.

“It clearly is the toughest time in the history of the dinner,” says George Condon, a National Journal correspondent who led the White House Correspondents’ Association from 1993 to 1994 and is currently writing a history of the press organization. “You’ve never had a president of the United States openly hostile to the dinner,” he adds. “That affects everything else.”



***

Stan Rosenfield, a Hollywood publicist who represents several bold-faced names who have gone to the dinner in the past, such as George Clooney, Helen Mirren and Morgan Freeman, says the dinner “is not the hot ticket it used to be.”

In years past, he says, “It would not be unusual for a client, not only ours but any of the major PR companies, to get five or six offers [from media organizations] to be their guest for the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.” Invitations have dried up, but so has interest: “I don’t know if any of them would want to go if they were invited.”

At one level, the change can be explained by the 2016 election, in which Trump replaced a president whom celebrities genuinely wanted to be near. “It was fun to go when Obama was in the White House,” said the Emmy-winning actress Julianna Margulies, who went to the dinner twice during his term. Now, she says, even if the president did attend, she’d skip it. “Trump just takes the wind out of everyone’s sails. He sucks up oxygen in a room. He doesn’t know how to make fun of himself, and there’s no way I would go and sit through a night of that.” For Hollywood celebrities, there’s also a downside risk to being at a Washington-associated event with the potential for a viral moment gone bad, says D.C. media consultant and connector Tammy Haddad, whose annual brunch is still a signature weekend event: “Non-Washington celebrities aren’t going to put themselves in a situation where they can get hit by social media, by national media or by politicians.”

Trump, after last year’s performance by Wolf, took to Twitter to lambast her “filthy” routine and called the dinner “an embarrassment to everyone associated with it.” He implored, “Put Dinner to rest, or start over!”

What’s notable about the 2019 event is that the White House Correspondents’ Association has largely taken Trump’s advice. Olivier Knox, the current president of the association, says he has been talking about the need for the dinner to “reset” since 2016, when he took his place in line for this year’s presidency. He had grown increasingly disturbed by the celebrity gawking upstaging the organization’s commitment to journalism. “I thought we lost our way,” says Knox, chief Washington correspondent for SiriusXM.

Trump, with his regular attacks on journalists and even the legitimacy of independent media, put longstanding tensions into even sharper relief, Knox says. “Would more people watch this on C-SPAN if Donald Trump was going to speak? Yeah, I bet they would.” On the other hand: “Let’s be clear that the administration curtailing White House press briefings, Pentagon briefings, State Department briefings, is considerably more serious than if the president’s attending the correspondents’ dinner.”

As for the choice of Chernow, Knox says the scholar sits “at an intersection of history and popular culture” and would be “someone who brought some heft to this conversation, while at the same time a lively speaker.”

However laudable, Knox’s effort to recalibrate the tenor of the dinner will likely prove transient, if the history of the past couple decades is any guide. The event has long swung pendulum-like between attempts to be edgy enough to be interesting and a more risk-averse approach, protecting the sensibilities of a crowd that typically enjoys irreverence toward the president and other politicians but is put off by anything suggesting contempt.

In 1999, Aretha Franklin sang at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, and it was television anchor Brian Williams who delivered the repartée. After a year of sex scandal in Bill Clinton’s White House, and just weeks after he survived an impeachment trial, the idea of a professional comedian traversing this field of land mines seemed too exhausting.

In 2006, Stephen Colbert scorched President George W. Bush with a routine many thought went too far, his liberal-friendly irony striking a nasty note for the conservatives who occupied the role of punchline. That led the next year to a dud, as comedian Rich Little was exhumed from the 1970s to deliver a Grampa Simpson-like performance of impersonations that would have been passably funny three decades earlier.

The pendulum will surely swing back again. One likely scenario is that it will be swung by the same person who is shadowing this year’s event by his absence. Trump’s self-dramatizing instincts will surely encourage his eventual acceptance—an occasion that will draw even more interest because of his truancy in recent years.

For now, says former White House press secretary Sean Spicer: “I don’t think the president has ever found it worth his time. … He would have liked to have gone because it would have gotten a lot of attention, [but] it’s not really a productive use of time if you’re going and pretending everything is great. And I don’t think it furthers the cause of journalism by any stretch of the imagination.”



***

Spicer’s view is in convergence with that of one of the most acid sketch artists of capital culture in recent years. Mark Leibovich’s 2013 book, This Town, excoriated precisely the sort of scene-making, status-conscious self-regard that skeptics say is the essence of the correspondents’ dinner. Scaling back the “over-the-top-ness” of the event, says Leibovich, a New York Times Magazine writer, was a belated reaction to a trend that has left people feeling bloated and gassy for years. “It’s one of those things where I think everyone intuitively knew that it was a terrible look for the press, given the disconnect between the contempt that so much of the country seems to have for Washington and the media here compared to the level of self-love and self-celebration that that weekend just represents.”

But Leibovich himself epitomizes the ambivalence of many Washington players toward the weekend. About a decade ago, Dean Baquet—then the Times’ bureau chief in Washington and now its executive editor—pulled the paper out of the dinner for reasons similar to the Leibovich critique. But Leibovich would often attend an even more exclusive event—the Vanity Fair-Bloomberg party held after the dinner, which for the last few years was held at the French ambassador’s home. What’s more, he sometimes showed up in casual garb, not black tie, signaling subtly he was so cool that he hadn’t bothered to go to the stodgy dinner, only the more elite and glamorous after-parties. “If you’re a Washington reporter,” Leibovich says, “there’s no question you can get some work done at these events, and that would include the dinner.”

Vanity Fair and Bloomberg have stopped hosting their famous after-party during the Trump years. (“When Trump came into office, we figured we had it in the good years and decided to leave it at that,” says former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter.) But its sister events have not, by any means, evaporated. Even a subdued White House Correspondents’ Dinner is the epicenter of a weekend of furious social activity for a city in which simply being seen at the right brunch is a pastime in itself. This year, it’s guaranteed that the decline (or moral renewal) of the dinner will be the buzzy topic of conversation at the roughly two dozen events held in a frenetic 72-hour period. One lesson of this year's event might be that it barely even requires a central dinner to prop up a whole social ecosystem.

There are whole sections of Washington’s economy that normally experience a surge around the weekend—like party planning, limos and high-end restaurants—and no one there is exactly sucking wind. But the dropoff in out-of-town power and glitz means some businesses also aren’t pumping in dollars as in years past. A source at one of Washington’s top luxury hotels said the hotel used to charge a two-night minimum during the surge of celebrities and CEOs flying in for the dinner; this year, that’s not necessary, and high-level suites aren’t getting booked as much for the weekend. A source at David Rios Salon and Spa in Georgetown said it is getting fewer customers in for last-minute primping before the dinner.

Condon, the historian of the correspondents’ association, called the subdued event of 2019 a necessary reaction to circumstances—and also, he hopes, a temporary one.

“It’s unlike anything we’ve ever seen in the history of the dinner,” he says. “But it’s what you get when you have a president of the United States who has zero sense of humor and a president of the United States who spends his time attacking who we are and what we do for a living. Of course, you have to defend that, and of course you have to respond to the times.”

On the other hand, he added: “I would like the dinner to go back to being fun.”"
"Ocasio-Cortez claim that Trump wants to privatize VA is 'nonsense,' VA secretary tells Fox",https://www.foxnews.com,['Victor Garcia'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/va-secretary-says-rep-ocasio-cortezs-claim-trump-wants-to-privatize-va-is-nonsense,"Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie struck back at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on Wednesday, calling her accusations that the Trump administration wants to privatize the VA ""nonsense.""

""I won't be rude to the congresswoman and say that it is nonsense, but I will say it's nonsense,"" Wilkie said on ""Fox News @ Night with Shannon Bream.""

""If we are privatizing VA, we are going about it in a very strange way,"" Wilkie said. ""I presented to the Congress a $220 billion budget, the largest budget in the history of the department. We are undergoing basic reforms to make the VA a modern, 21st-century health care administration. But what we are doing is opening the aperture on choice, so that our veterans remain at the center their own health care, and if VA can provide what they need, we will give them the opportunity to go out into the private sector.""

VA SECRETARY WARNS TRUMP'S SIGNATURE PROGRAM COULD COLLAPSE WITHOUT FIX

Ocasio-Cortez claimed during a New York town hall event last week that the VA “isn’t broken” despite the scandals that have plagued the agency over the last decade and claimed the Trump administration aimed to ""privatize"" health care for veterans.

""That is the opening approach we have seen when it comes to privatization, it's the idea that this thing that isn’t broken, this thing that provides some of the highest quality care to our veterans somehow needs to be fixed, optimized, tinkered with until we don’t even recognize it anymore,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, in comments first reported by the Washington Examiner.

""They are trying to fix the VA for pharmaceutical companies, they are trying to fix the VA for insurance corporations, and, ultimately they are trying to fix the VA for a for-profit health care industry that does not put people or veterans first,"" Ocasio-Cortez said.

“And so we have a responsibility to protect it.”

The congresswoman's comments were aimed at Trump administration efforts to expand choice and private health care options in the VA health care system.

President Trump reacted to the congresswoman's comments by taking credit for turning around the VA.

""Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is correct, the VA is not broken, it is doing great. But that is only because of the Trump Administration. We got Veterans Choice & Accountability passed,"" Trump tweeted.

Wilkie defended the Trump administration and supported the president's response on Twitter.

""The other part of our comments or they were answered by the president, who said that under this administration, the VA isn't broken. The scandals that she referred to happened in another administration,"" Wilkie said.

""I can say, as someone who's been accused of being a historian, no president in the post-World War II era has put the veterans at the center of his campaign and administration until President Trump did it. We are seeing this in the way the VA's moving forward.""

The Inspector General ""did not substantiate any of the allegations and determined that Acting Secretary Shanahan fully complied with his ethical obligations and agreements regarding Boeing and its competitors,"" according to a statement from the Pentagon. More than 30 witnesses, including Shanahan, were interviewed by the IG's office, according to the statement.

CNN has previously reported that if Shanahan is cleared of the allegations, President Donald Trump may decide to move ahead and send his nomination to the Senate to become the permanent defense chief.

So far, there are no indications that the White House is considering candidates other than Shanahan. Officials close to the acting secretary say he strongly believes he will be nominated by the White House.

The president had already blamed him for recusing himself from investigations related to the 2016 election, sought his resignation and belittled him in private and on Twitter.

Now, Mr. Trump had another demand: He wanted Mr. Sessions to reverse his recusal and order the prosecution of Hillary Clinton.

“The ‘gist’ of the conversation,” according to the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, quoting Mr. Sessions, “was that the president wanted Sessions to unrecuse from ‘all of it.’”

Mr. Mueller’s report released last week brimmed with examples of Mr. Trump seeking to protect himself from the investigation. But his request of Mr. Sessions — and two similar ones detailed in the report — stands apart because it shows Mr. Trump trying to wield the power of law enforcement to target a political rival, a step that no president since Richard M. Nixon is known to have taken."

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue is moving forward with plans to relocate two influential scientific agencies out of downtown Washington, a cost-saving initiative that critics fear could provoke mass resignations among employees who perform critical agricultural research and produce statistics that shape farm policy.

In a meeting last week, Chris Hartley, acting administrator of the Agriculture Department’s Economics Research Service, told researchers at that agency to expect reassignment letters in mid-May, according to two ERS employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

Although the new location has yet to be announced, Hartley told researchers that they would have about 120 days to uproot their families and report for duty. Of 68 towns and cities in contention to host the agency, College Park and Montgomery County, Md., are within a few dozen miles of its current offices. Many candidates, such as Denver, Des Moines and Kansas City, are hundreds or more than a thousand miles away.

Staff at the National Institute for Food and Agriculture, which Perdue also selected for relocation, haven’t received a date for the move, said a NIFA employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person wasn’t authorized to discuss the move.

The relocation plan was unveiled in August, a prelude to the broad restructuring of the USDA workforce that Perdue announced this month, dubbed “OneNeighborhood.” Among other provisions, it seeks to consolidate USDA employees, moving them out of rented space across the capital region and into two department-owned buildings in the D.C. area that are undergoing renovations.

NIFA rents expensive real estate on the D.C. waterfront. ERS leases offices in the nearby Patriots Plaza. Under the OneNeighborhood plan, some NIFA and ERS employees would move into renovated D.C. offices, according to an April 19 memo obtained by The Washington Post. But the majority of employees at both agencies will be ordered to relocate to a yet-to-be-named site, which Perdue has said would bring them closer to farmers.

The plan has sparked an excited competition in the nation’s agricultural hubs, with nearly 140 businesses, universities, city developers and local economic councils lobbying to become the agencies’ new homes. But it has drawn fierce objections from Democrats in Congress, USDA employees and a bipartisan coalition of former USDA leaders, who fear the move would devastate the two agencies, which are already losing staff in the face of sharp budget cuts proposed by the Trump administration.

The NIFA employee estimated the agency has shrunk from about 400 employees to 200 since President Trump took office. “Every two days, somebody takes off” for another job or early retirement, the staffer said.

ERS is down from more than 300 employees to 250, said Sandra Salstrom, a legal representative at the American Federation of Government Employees, a union for federal workers.

Perdue’s office did not respond to requests to discuss the proposal. In a written statement, the secretary’s press office said the relocation plan is part of a broader “effort to make USDA the most effective, efficient and customer-focused department in the entire federal government,” arguing the move will “minimize costs” while bringing USDA workers “closer to all of their stakeholders.”

Past USDA chief scientists expressed “profound concern” in a letter to Congress, co-signed by more than 70 former USDA officials, university deans and agriculture scientists. “In a major relocation, there will be substantial staff loss because of either an unwillingness or other preventing circumstances to move,” the letter said. Signatories also worried that move could fray the close ties between these offices and nearby federal research agencies, such as the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy.

“This parochial idea of, like, ‘Washington messes everything up. Let’s move it out of town’ overlooks the important role that this agency plays,” said Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), a member of the House Agriculture Committee who has introduced legislation to block the move. “There’s just a heightened level of concern about this administration, generally, about data collection and science.”

There is currently no chief scientist overseeing the research at USDA. Trump’s first nominee, the radio host Sam Clovis, had no scientific credentials and withdrew his nomination in 2017 over links to the Russia investigation. Scott Hutchins, the second nominee, was awaiting Senate confirmation when he was appointed, in January, as the deputy undersecretary for Research, Education and Economics, a position that does not require congressional approval.

The nation has a growing population that needs to be fed, a climate that is changing and a “research process that is continuing to slide,” said Gale Buchanan, who was the undersecretary for Research, Education and Economics under George W. Bush and who signed the letter warning against the proposed move. “We are on a collision course for, I won’t say disaster, but we are on a collision course.”

The Economic Research Service is a statistical agency whose reports, such as its annual survey of rural America, influence policy and industry decisions. Its economists study subjects as diverse as avocado imports, farm labor practices and reliance on the national food assistance program, the latter of which is a frequent Republican target for budget cuts.

NIFA provides funding to researchers at land grant universities and other institutions across the country. It has funded agricultural robots, gene-editing crop science and even space worms — in January the USDA announced a plan to send nematodes, small parasitic worms that kill insects, to the International Space Station to test whether the worms can control pests in microgravity.

“A lot of us see NIFA as the core of USDA, in terms of discovering the knowledge needed for the future of feeding the world,” said Jack Payne, the University of Florida’s vice president for agriculture and natural resources.

NIFA grants also fuel research into agriculture and climate change, science the Trump administration rejects. It also oversees the 4-H youth organization. When NIFA recently produced a policy to support 4-H’s LGBT community, this caused “an enormous stink” in the secretary’s office, said the NIFA employee.

The USDA’s inspector general is reviewing the proposal to determine whether Perdue has the power to move the offices. Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) argued in an April letter that USDA lacks the budgetary authority and must seek approval from the House and Senate appropriations committees.

Congress, in its 2019 appropriations bill, told the secretary’s office to hold off on the plan, citing “insufficient information and justification” for the relocation.

The president’s 2020 budget proposal asks for $15.5 million to relocate ERS and $9.5 million to relocate NIFA. It also slashes ERS funding from $87 million to $61 million, and would trim the agency to 160 positions. The request would also eliminate research into food security and rural economies while keeping a focus on farm financial information, consumer data and trade. Congress ignored similar cuts proposed in 2018 and 2019.

In the fall, the USDA hired accounting firm Ernst & Young, for $340,000, to guide the science agencies’ relocation. Kristi J. Boswell, a senior adviser to the USDA secretary, told members of Congress the secretary plans to reveal the winning selection in May and, simultaneously, release a cost-benefit analysis.

“We have received stacks and stacks and stacks of support letters from senators, members of Congress, governors, community leaders, business leaders associations and local communities,” Boswell said during the March congressional hearing about the proposal.

Tim Daman, president of the Lansing Regional Chamber of Commerce in Michigan, said he was “pleased” that East Lansing is a contender. “Michigan is one of the most agriculturally diverse states in the nation,” he said, home to 50,000 farms, Michigan State University and a new dairy factory designed to produce 300 million pounds of cheese annually (nearly the weight, in cheddar, of two Washington Monuments). “The region is proud of our agricultural roots and the investment the industry has made in our community.”

Craig Beyrouty, the dean of the agriculture school at the University of Maryland at College Park, said his city’s bid would fulfill Perdue’s desire to move the agencies while keeping NIFA on the D.C. Metro’s Green Line. He said a new building could be erected in College Park within 18 months, but declined to provide other details. In addition to the location offered in College Park, the USDA owns 7,000 acres in nearby Beltsville, Md.

“There’s a huge amount of support to keep NIFA and ERS located in, or very close to, the Washington district,” Beyrouty said.

“From the perspective of what we actually do at our agency, we just can’t see any good reason to do this,” the NIFA employee said. “It just doesn’t really make any sense.”

Veterans slam Ocasio-Cortez for her fierce defense of the VA,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/veterans-slam-ocasio-cortez-for-her-fierce-defense-of-the-va,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's fierce defense of the Department of Veteran Affairs, saying, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" has earned her flak from the very people who are served by the scandal-ridden agency: veterans.

During the same town hall, she said VA would be a blueprint if ""Medicare for all"" were to pass: “If you ask me, I would like VA for all.""

Eli Crane, a former Navy SEAL who now runs the company he started from his garage while on active duty, told the Washington Examiner that the New York Democrat's comments about not fixing the VA were ironic, given that Ocasio-Cortez, who identifies as a democratic socialist, ""is trying to fix the world's greatest economy of all time.""

""I would love to see her tell that to the family members of veterans who died waiting for treatment from the VA. As veterans, we deserve the same rights that private citizens have to shop around and find healthcare options, doctors and providers that fit our medical needs,"" said Crane.

Afghanistan veteran Adam Maneen, a small business owner who identifies as a conservative, but also agrees with the idea of universal healthcare, told the Washington Examiner he believes Ocasio-Cortez's strong belief in democratic socialism leads her to fight the wrong battles.

""Ocasio-Cortez is upset with the notion of VA reform and ... is so fixated on socialism that she has developed a reflexive nature against anything that says ‘privatized' and really misses the point about reform,"" Maneen said. ""She is fighting the wrong fight. If she wants support to model universal healthcare after the VA, then she needs to honestly acknowledge the VA’s subpar care, inept leadership, and bureaucratic processes.""

Veterans also expressed their frustration on social media with Ocasio-Cortez's defense of the VA.

Dan Caldwell, executive director of Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group that promotes allowing veterans to pursue private medical care, told Fox News that reformers really just want to let veterans have more choice outside of VA hospitals to get treatment for their issues.

Ocasio-Cortez followed up her comments last week, saying part of the problem with the VA is the department not being fully funded.

If Congress wants to #ProtectTheVA, we shouldn’t starve it + then sell it off for parts, forcing vets into for-profit emergency rooms + to providers who aren’t used to working w/their unique medical needs.

The VA's budget is about $200 billion. The department is now requesting a total of $220.2 billion for the 2020 fiscal year, a 9.6% increase from the previous fiscal year. The VA's large budget was pointed out by Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., who is also a Green Beret.

He said despite the large budget, the VA is still failing veterans.

FYI @AOC the VA budget doubled from $90B to $200B over the last 10 yrs.

"Attorney General Bill Barr Directs John Gore, A Top Justice Department Official, To Defy Congress Over Census",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Betsy Woodruff'],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/john-gore-a-top-doj-official-will-defy-congress,"John Gore, a top official in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, will not appear for a deposition scheduled for tomorrow with the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, according to a letter the Justice Department sent the committee chairman on April 24.

Stephen Boyd, the department’s top Hill liaison, wrote in the letter, which The Daily Beast obtained, that Gore will not appear as long as Chairman Elijah Cummings blocks him from bringing along lawyers from the Justice Department.

“We are disappointed that the Committee remains unwilling to permit Department counsel to represent the interests of the Executive Branch in the deposition of a senior Department official,” Boyd wrote. “Accordingly, Attorney General Barr’s determination that Mr. Gore will not appear at the Committee’s deposition unless a Department attorney may accompany him remains in effect.”

The committee wants to question Gore about his role in the Trump administration’s effort to add a question to the 2020 Census about citizenship. The committee authorized a subpoena of Gore earlier this month. His refusal to participate in a deposition may result in an effort by the committee to hold him in contempt.

“In keeping with longstanding Department of Justice policy, neither Mr. Gore nor anyone else in the Department will be forced to testify in their capacity as a DOJ official on DOJ matters without DOJ counsel,” said Kerri Kupec, a department spokesperson.

In a statement, Cummings said Gore is still obligated to appear for the deposition.

“This is a massive, unprecedented, and growing pattern of obstruction,” he said. “Yesterday, President Trump declared to the entire country that he would obstruct Congress and order all White House officials to defy lawful subpoenas from Congress. Today, the Trump Administration went even further by expanding this policy to employees at federal agencies—even when the subpoenas are bipartisan and supported by Republican Members of Congress.”

He added that Committee staff will be available for the interview if Gore changes his mind.

“Committee investigators will gather tomorrow morning for this deposition—as scheduled—and we hope Mr. Gore will fulfill his legal and ethical responsibilities and appear as ordered,” he said.

A spokesperson for the committee’s Republicans, meanwhile, pointed out that Gore already appeared for a transcribed interview with staff and said Cummings’ subpoena is “part and parcel of his broader partisan oversight agenda.”

Gore will be the highest-profile Trump administration official to defy a congressional subpoena—so far. Earlier this week, the lawyer for Carl Kline, a career official who green-lit Jared Kushner’s security clearance, told Cummings he will not participate in a deposition about that issue unless lawyers from the White House Counsel’s Office can attend. Cummings has taken steps to hold him in contempt of Congress. If the House votes to hold him in contempt—a safe bet—then they may refer the matter to the D.C. U.S. Attorney. That attorney is Jessie Liu, a Trump appointee.

Gore will find himself in a similar situation if the House votes to hold him in contempt.

These cases will test the power of congressional committees. In the past, efforts to compel testimony have garnered mixed results; House Republicans famously voted to hold then-Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt in 2012 while investigating the Fast and Furious scandal. Despite the contempt vote, Holder still didn’t comply with the House’s demands.

The census investigation is of paramount importance to Democrats, who argue the question about the citizenship will discourage participation. Less participation could result in millions of people not being counted, they argue; and undercounting could mean a mis-apportionment of Congressional districts and lower levels of federal funding to communities that are underrepresented. Republicans, meanwhile, argue the federal government has asked about citizenship in the past and that it won’t result in unfairness.

Democrats and other opponents of the citizenship question, including multiple civil rights groups, sued to keep it from appearing on the census. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on that litigation earlier this week. Observers have guessed that the court will lean in the direction of allowing the question."

Trump appears to contradict his own secretary of state in a phone call where he indicated the US supported an attack on Tripoli's UN-backed government,https://www.businessinsider.com,['David Choi'],04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-contradicts-pompeo-on-libya-policy-tripoli-offensive-khalifa-haftar-2019-4,"President Donald Trump appeared to contradict existing US State Department policy through his alleged endorsement of a militia's ground offensive against the UN-recognized government in Libya, according to numerous news reports this week.

During a phone call on April 15, Trump indicated his support for Khalifa Haftar, the leader of the Libyan National Army, and Haftar's offensive against the capital of Tripoli, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.

Haftar's forces launched a campaign to overthrow the embattled UN-backed government in Libya earlier this month. The North African country has been torn by war after the toppling of former Prime Minister Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The remnants of the ongoing civil war bred unrest and introduced a power vacuum on which Islamic State militants could capitalize.

Trump appeared to side with Haftar's assault during his phone call on Friday, according to US officials cited in Bloomberg's report. The officials reportedly claimed the call left the Libyans with the impression that Trump endorsed the ground assault.

State Department officials familiar with US-Libya policy also claimed the phone call took them by surprise, according to a Politico report published on Monday.

The alleged endorsement conflicts with comments the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made on April 7, in which he condemned Haftar's military forces who carried out the offensive.

In a statement following the call, the White House said it ""recognized [Haftar's] significant role in fighting terrorism and securing Libya's oil resources.""

Trump and Haftar were also said to have discussed a ""shared vision for Libya's transition to a stable, democratic political system,"" the White House said.

A National Security Council official disputed Bloomberg's description of the phone call.

""The characterizations of conversations between the [White House] & Field Marshal Haftar are inaccurate,"" National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis said on Twitter. ""We encouraged Bloomberg not to run it with bad information.""

Marquis did not offer any further clarification about the conversations between Trump and Haftar.

If the claims in Bloomberg's report are correct, it would contradict existing US policy on Haftar's offensive. The State Department denounced the violence and urged the Libyan factions to return to the negotiation table as recently as Monday.

Pompeo said he was ""deeply concerned"" with the fighting in his April 7 statement:

""We have made clear that we oppose the military offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces and urge the immediate halt to these military operations against the Libyan capital,"" Pompeo said at the time.

""There is no military solution to the Libya conflict,"" Pompeo added. ""This is why the United States continues to press Libyan leaders, together with our international partners, to return to political negotiations.""

The State Department reiterated on Monday that it condemned the violence and believed Haftar ""can be an important part of a political solution,"" Politico reported.

The State Department did not respond to INSIDER's request for comment on Wednesday afternoon.

Trump has previously left many top officials in the dark with abrupt policy pronouncements. In a tweet in 2017, the president announced a ban on transgender service members. Senior defense officials, such as then-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, were reportedly blindsided by that declaration.

Trump's announcement that the US had officially conquered ISIS in Syria was also met with concern from US officials. He appeared to preemptively claim Syria had been liberated, which the US-supported Syrian Defense Forces was supposed to have announced, officials told the Associated Press."

The Department of Homeland Security's proposed policy to work around the courts could speed up deportations for recent arrivals at the border. | Herika Martinez/AFP/Getty Images Immigration DHS draft proposal would speed deportations

The Homeland Security Department is weighing a plan to bypass immigration courts and remove undocumented immigrants who cannot prove they’ve been present continuously in the U.S. for two years or more.

The proposal is described in a draft regulatory notice, according to two DHS officials and a third person familiar with the planning. If finalized, it would represent the latest escalation of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Story Continued Below

The administration has considered since 2017 expanding a fast-track deportation procedure known as “expedited removal,” but thus far has refrained from moving ahead.

The draft notice — which remains under review — would increase significantly the number of recently arrived undocumented immigrants subject to rapid deportation. Under the current standard, expedited removal is applicable only to immigrants picked up within 14 days of arrival. The two-week cutoff stems from a 2004 regulatory change, not from the 1996 statute that created the process.

The change could speed up the deportation of recent arrivals at the border and reduce the load on federal immigration courts, which have grappled with a soaring case backlog. But such a move likely would draw legal challenges — and a number of Trump polices have been sidelined by federal courts.

The planned regulation also would remove a current requirement to apply expedited removal only to undocumented immigrants arrested within 100 miles of a land border, according to the two DHS officials.

Instead, expedited removal would be applied nationwide, the officials said — giving it the potential to sweep up undocumented immigrants in communities across the country.

The constitutionality of expedited removal has been challenged in federal courts. In March, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that asylum seekers have the right to seek federal judicial review of an expedited removal order. That ruling conflicted with a 2016 decision by a separate federal appeals court."
Barr to testify about Mueller report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/barr-to-testify-about-mueller-report,"Attorney General William Barr will testify before Congress on May 1 about the recently concluded federal Russia investigation.

The Senate Judiciary Committee put out a press release Wednesday that listed him as a witness for a hearing titled “The Department of Justice’s Investigation of Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election.""

Barr’s testimony is scheduled for 10 a.m. Barr will answer senators' questions on special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The Justice Department released a redacted version of Mueller’s nearly 450-page report Thursday, which said President Trump's campaign had “numerous links” to the Russians but “the evidence was not sufficient to support criminal charges.” The special counsel also described several instances of possible obstruction of justice but did not make a conclusion on whether Trump obstructed the investigation.

Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein instead made the conclusion, determining the president did not obstruct justice.

The attorney general was criticized last week for holding a news conference before the release of Mueller’s report. Barr defended Trump’s actions during the investigation, saying the president was “frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents and fueled by illegal leaks” to the media.

Barr testified earlier this month after he sent out a summary on the Mueller report but before its redacted release last week. He appeared before two appropriations panels about the Justice Department budget, but was asked questions about the Mueller report and said ""spying did occur"" on the Trump campaign."
"Trump Justice Department Goes After Seattle, Philadelphia Overdose Prevention Sites as ‘Crack Houses’",https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Zachary Siegel'],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-justice-department-goes-after-seattle-philadelphia-overdose-prevention-sites-as-crack-houses,"Two major U.S. cities are trying to open facilities to save drug users’ lives, but the Trump administration is trying to stop them, arguing the facilities are no different than crack houses.

Seattle and Philadelphia plan to curb overdose deaths by opening facilities where drug users can ingest illicit substances like heroin under medical supervision. So-called overdose prevention sites are part of a strategy that seeks to reduce harm from drug use. The facilities were first popularized in Western Europe and have made their way to Canada and now potentially the U.S. While controversial and seemingly counterintuitive, over 100 such facilities currently operate in several countries, and public health experts consider them a staple of a robust strategy to prevent overdoses. Even Vice President Mike Pence, when he was Indiana’s governor during an HIV outbreak, implemented a similar program to distribute fresh syringes to prevent new infections.

President Trump campaigned on ending the overdose crisis, but federal prosecutors appointed by his administration are thwarting cities from pursuing effective strategies. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein promises “swift and aggressive action” if any cities follow through on their plan to implement the sites in the face of a staggering overdose death toll that has led Denver, New York, Seattle, Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia to consider implementing them. In 2017, more than 72,000 people died from drug overdoses in the U.S. Among overdose deaths involving opioids, more than 28,000 were due to illicit fentanyl, an uber-potent synthetic opioid manufactured in clandestine laboratories.

While overdose prevention sites are no panacea, decades of research from Canada, Australia, and Western Europe demonstrate their effectiveness, especially in times of crisis. A review of the scientific literature finds that these facilities reduce overdose deaths, public injection, neighborhood disorder, and the transmission of blood-borne diseases like Hepatitis C and HIV in the communities they operate. People who use overdose prevention sites also see improvements in their overall health, and overtime seek out treatment and find a path toward recovery.

“ The only thing these sites encourage is safer drug use for people who are already using drugs and unable to or do not wish to stop. ” — social worker Brooke Feldman

Last February, the Justice Department filed a civil lawsuit against Safehouse, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit that plans on operating the country’s first ever overdose prevention site. The civil suit, also a first of its kind, is a preemptive strike that aims for the facility to be deemed illegal by a judge before it ever opens.

“What’s driving the lawsuit is our responsibility to uphold and enforce the rule of law,” the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia, William McSwain, said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “ Possessing, consuming or otherwise sanctioning the use of these dangerous narcotics is clearly against the law in the United States.”

McSwain is referring to what’s known as the “crack-house statute,” a provision that penalizes anyone who manages or owns a building where drugs are being used. Violating the statute can result in hefty fines or jail time. Public health and legal experts suggest the “crack-house statute” was never intended to apply to medical settings where people are receiving services that Safehouse would provide, such as wound care, new syringes, and treatment referrals.

Seattle may soon find itself in the same legal bind as Philadelphia. When asked about a site in Seattle, U.S. Attorney there Brian Moran told city officials: “Don’t go there.”

“As the Deputy Attorney General has made clear, the U.S. Department of Justice will not stand idly by and allow consumption sites to open in cities across the U.S.,” Moran told The Daily Beast . Though Moran has not filed a lawsuit like his Pennsylvania counterpart, he calls the plan to do so a “logical path” were Seattle to move forward on the proposed facility to be called Community Health Engagement Locations (CHELs).

The threat of a lawsuit looms large in the minds of Seattle officials like Mayor Jenny Durkan, whose office said she “thinks it is unfortunate that the Department of Justice would move to block a harm-reduction strategy to the opioid epidemic. However, we are not surprised and take these threats seriously. We continue to monitor the Philadelphia lawsuit while evaluating our legal options.”

Ronda Goldfein, an attorney in Philadelphia who sits on Safehouse’s board, told The Daily Beast that a court date has not been set, but that they are prepared to argue their case. “We have consistently maintained that an overdose prevention site, which includes a supervised consumption room and is operated for the purpose of saving lives, does not violate federal law,” Goldfein says. “We’re looking forward to the opportunity to present our arguments.”

Goldfein, also the executive director of the AIDS Law Project in Pennsylvania, sees many parallels between the modern day overdose emergency and the AIDS epidemic. AIDS activists put relentless pressure on the federal and local governments to fund research for treatment and invest in services like syringe-exchange programs that distribute sterile injection equipment to prevent the transmission of blood-borne diseases. The same way activists distributed syringes before it was legal, there are currently underground overdose prevention sites operating in U.S. cities.

“Among our challenges will be to address the stigma of drug use,” Goldfein says. “In HIV work, it’s clear that stigma continues to fuel that epidemic, despite medical and scientific advances in treatment and prevention.” Despite awareness around drug use as a matter of public health, drug users continue to be arrested and criminalized, she says.

The Department of Justice frequently argues that overdose prevention sites condone and therefore “normalize” injection drug use.

“Not only does the existing research on overdose prevention sites suggest that they do not encourage or increase drug use, but that argument just simply doesn't make sense,” said Brooke Feldman, a social worker in Philadelphia who has found recovery from her own substance use disorder. “The only thing these sites encourage is safer drug use for people who are already using drugs and unable to or do not wish to stop.”

A two-and-a-half-hour drive up the coast from Seattle is an overdose prevention site in Vancouver called Insite, which has been operating since 2003 on the Downtown Eastside.

“We know definitively there is a reduction in things like discarded syringes and public injecting upon the opening of these sites,” Ryan McNeil, a research scientist at the University of British Columbia who has studied the effects of overdose prevention sites. “You would think law enforcement groups would get behind that?”

“All these sites do is ensure that people who are using don’t die,” he added."
"Ex-DHS chief wanted cabinet-level election threat meetings, White House refused: Officials",https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/dhs-chief-wanted-cabinet-level-election-threat-meetings/story?id=62598630,"In recent months before resigning from her position, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was prevented from convening senior cabinet meetings at the White House on potential future Russian interference in the upcoming 2020 U.S. elections, two senior administration officials familiar with the matter told ABC News.

Nielsen, whose department is charged with defending U.S. infrastructure including elections against cyber attacks, had been sounding the alarm publicly before the 2018 midterms. After the midterms, she pushed for the White House to convene a cabinet meeting to address the issue head-on, but the White House ""refused,"" according to one of the officials, forcing DHS to start convening meetings with principals on its own.

Nielsen was also told by White House staff the issue did not need to be brought to Trump’s attention, according to the official.

""The White House didn’t want to focus on the issue at a principals level, period,"" the official told ABC News.

The last in-person principal-level cabinet meetings on the issue occurred before the November 2018 midterm elections, and since then there have been none, according to three senior administration officials. One said there have been smaller discussions about the topic among top national security officials.

“We are far, far better prepared than we were in 2016, but we are still way behind where our adversaries are. It’s clear the administration hasn’t made foreign interference a high enough priority. That’s a feeling felt throughout the interagency,"" one of the officials said.

The New York Times first reported on Wednesday White House pushback to Nielsen’s efforts. The Times reported that acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told Nielsen specifically not to bring it up to the President, reportedly telling her it “wasn’t a great subject and should be kept below his level.”

In a statement to ABC News, Mulvaney said, “I don’t recall anything along those lines happening in any meeting, but unlike the Obama administration, who knew about Russian actions in 2014 and did nothing, the Trump administration will not tolerate foreign interference in our elections, and we’ve already taken many steps to prevent it in the future.”

The Obama administration did take some action against Russian election interference including private warnings and sanctions.

A spokesperson for the DHS did not respond to a request for comment. Nielsen resigned earlier this month. Garrett Marquis, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council, said in a statement, “National Security Council staff leads the regular and continuous coordination of the whole-of-government approach to addressing foreign malign influence and ensuring election security.

“Any suggestion that this Administration is giving less than full-throated effort to secure America’s elections is patently false,” he said.

The redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller’s 448-page report sent to Congress last week laid out both what he described as Russia’s “sweeping and systematic” effort to interfere with the 2016 presidential election, as well as Trump’s concern that acknowledgment of that interference could undercut his electoral victory.

“After the election, the President expressed concerns to advisors that reports of Russia’s election interference might lead the public to question the legitimacy of his election,” the report said.

Even in the lead up to the midterm election lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including intelligence officials expressed frustration over what they saw as the administration's lack of clear strategy to combat more Russian interference.

After the publication of the Mueller report, experts said it was “sobering” to see all of Russia’s efforts to undercut American society and the political process all in one place.

The U.S. intelligence community and previous Mueller indictments had already accused Russia of three interference efforts in 2016: a hack-and-leak operation that targeted democratic figures, a widespread online influence campaign designed to sow social and political discord in the U.S. and cyber attacks targeting election infrastructure itself, such as voter databases. But last week, the Mueller report laid out, in narrative detail, the push by the Kremlin to weaken American democracy – a strategy that officials and experts say continues today.

The 2018 midterm elections did not see the hack-and-leak strategy or any especially significant attacks on voting infrastructure, but foreign online influence operations continued unabated, an intelligence community assessment said. Top U.S. security officials have been vocal in their warnings that Russia, potentially along with China, Iran and others who learned dark lessons from 2016, are likely to take aim at the 2020 race.

“The risk of election interference by a foreign government is an existential national security threat,” John Cohen, a former senior Department of Homeland Security official and current ABC News contributor, said after the Mueller report’s release. “While some agencies like the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Cyber Command are working to mitigate this threat, the U.S. government can and must do more to address the threat to our election process, but that requires visible leadership from the White House and the president himself.”

Former Trump campaign advisor Chris Christie told the ABC News podcast “The Investigation” on April 18 that if he were speaking to the president he would tell him to “shift focus” now to the 2020 threat – both for practical and political reasons.

“You know, bring in [CIA Director] Gina Haspel and [FBI Director] Chris Wray, bring in the DNI [Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats] and say, ‘Listen, we now have a roadmap for what the Russians did, what are we doing to prepare for the 2020 election? I authorize you to do everything it is you need to do to protect the integrity of that election and we’ll work with Congress to make sure… if you need additional funding that you’ll get it in order to protect the integrity of our elections.’

“I have often thought that that would be a really productive thing for him to do, and a smart thing for him to do politically,” Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and current ABC News contributor, said.

Coats, in a statement to ABC News, pushed back on claims that the administration did not take Russian meddling in the election seriously.

“The implication by anonymous sources that the Administration has not or is not taking this issue seriously is false and minimizes the work that continues to be advanced by countless individuals to ensure the integrity of our electoral process,” he said in the statement.

Last week another spokesperson for the White House National Security Council declined to comment on Trump’s personal interest in Russian interference, but pointed to moves by the administration to counter foreign election interference, from broadening offensive cyber rules to paving a pathway for sanctions for those “determined to have interfered in a United States election,” to the Department of Justice indictments against suspected Russian operatives.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that he would warn his Russian counterparts about the “steadfast requirement that Russia not engage in activity that impacts the capacity of our democracy to be successful.""

“And we will make very clear to them that this is unacceptable behavior and as you’ve seen from this administration, we will take tough actions which raise the cost for Russian malign activity,” he said. “And we’ll continue to do that.”"

The Department of Justice has launched a review of a government patent for use of a drug that prevents HIV infection, according to a retired Centers for Disease Control scientist who was among scientists who spoke with a department lawyer last week.

Thomas Folks said a Justice Department lawyer visited the CDC in Atlanta on April 16 to question government scientists who pioneered the use of the drug Truvada for prevention.

Folks, who retired from the CDC in 2007, participated in one of the meetings via telephone and helped explain the scientific discoveries his government team made 15 years ago.

[This HIV pill saves lives. Why is it so hard to get in the Deep South?]

The meetings are the first indications the government is considering action against Truvada’s manufacturer, Gilead, which contends the government’s 2015 patent is invalid and has publicly rebuffed requests for royalty payments.

The government has declined to take the rare next step and sue for patent infringement, The Washington Post reported last month.

The lack of action has enraged HIV activists,with some protesters hecklingthe CDC director at a meeting in Virginia on April 1. It also has attracted attention on Capitol Hill. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) led a small group of senators this week in writing to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, citing The Post article. The senators said taxpayers should be able to recoup public investments and help make vital drugs more affordable.

“The government should also be willing to enforce its patents and take legal action against companies that appear to be infringing on their patents,’’ the senators wrote, “to prevent multinational companies from reaping billions of dollars in profits without properly compensating the government for its investments.’’

Truvada for PrEP, as the prevention use of the drug is known, is expected to form the backbone of President Trump’s promised plan to eradicate HIV by 2030. But the drug costs $1,600 to $2,000 a month, which patient advocates say makes it prohibitively expensive. The drug is distributed for as little as $6.50 a month in Africa, according to researchers.

During the previously undisclosed meeting at CDC on April 16, the Justice Department lawyer was gathering facts about the strength of the government patent but stopped well short of saying the government planned to sue Gilead, said Folks, who ran a CDC monkey research lab and lives in Texas. Folks confirmed the meeting took place after being contacted by The Post.

“I hope they get some good Department of Justice lawyers who can help them and come in and give them some teeth,’’ Folks said of the CDC.

Folks said he believed the Justice Department lawyer leading the meeting was Walter W. Brown, an intellectual property attorney in the commercial litigation division.

Brown did not respond to a request for comment. He forwarded an email from The Post to the Department of Justice media team, which declined to comment.

[A rare deterrent to limitless drug price increases may die under Trump]

Launching a DOJ review — with its potential to lead to a patent infringement suit — could merely be intended to give officials greater leverage in ongoing negotiations with Gilead about cutting Truvada for PrEP prices and making the treatment more widely available. The Department of Health and Human Services would not comment but pointed to recent public statements by top department officials.

“The royalties that would be owed to the department would take years in the making to get to the department’’ in a patent infringement lawsuit, said Admiral Brett P. Giroir, assistant secretary of health and human services, speaking at an event Monday sponsored by the Kaiser Family Foundation. “It wouldn’t really make a difference on the pricing. We’re really going down different avenues to make sure the pricing is lower moving forward. Those negotiations are ongoing.’’

Azar cited those negotiations in an interview with NPR earlier this month — the first high-level confirmation of negotiations with Gilead.

In an emailed statement, Gilead said there were no ongoing negotiations with HHS about the patents owned by the government.

“We are in discussions with the government to determine the best ways to broaden access to Truvada for PrEP to vulnerable populations in the United States and support the federal plan to end the HIV epidemic.’’

HIV activists under the banner PrEP4All Collaboration spent months last year digging into the government’s patent for the development of Truvada for HIV prevention. The group has demanded input into CDC deliberations about how to distribute HIV prevention drugs more widely.

[Anonymous `ghost ship’ is among groups flooding drug pricing debate]

“It is completely unacceptable that CDC and HHS continue to go through this process with zero input by the communities most impacted by HIV,’’ said James Krellenstein, a co-founder of the group. “There has been no public transparency into this process at all.’’

Gilead’s Truvada was approved in 2004 as HIV treatment for people who already had contracted the virus. Gilead supplied the drugs given by CDC scientists to CDC monkeys to test whether it worked for prevention. Gilead then won FDA approval in 2012 to market the drug for that additional use.

Folks, the retired CDC scientist, said the DOJ lawyer who visited Atlanta last week asked CDC officials involved in development of Truvada for PrEP how they came up with ways to test the treatment in monkeys. The CDC’s novel idea was to repeatedly infect the monkeys with a relatively small amount of HIV, an level that would mimic the volume of virus in semen, to prove the drug would work for prevention, Folks said. Earlier experiments had used excessively large volumes of virus, he said.

“We developed the model,’’ he said. “Without the model, you might not have found this.’’"
Dirtiest week for water in EPA history,https://thehill.com,[],04-25-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/440566-dirtiest-week-for-water-in-epa-history,"Before the Clean Water Act was passed in 1972, our nation’s waters were in trouble. Lake Erie was virtually dead, the Cuyahoga River caught on fire, and the Androscoggin River in Maine was so polluted it peeled paint on nearby buildings. Many of America’s waters had become little more than lifeless, open sewers.

Nobody wants to return to the bad old days of polluted, dirty rivers. Nobody, it seems, except the very agency in charge of protecting our waters.

After nearly a half-century of successfully collaborating with states to implement the Clean Water Act, we have just experienced the dirtiest week for water in the Environmental Protection Agency’s history – a three-pronged attack on the Clean Water Act’s ability to keep our water safe and clean.

First, the EPA closed a notably short period for public comment on a proposed rule that would eliminate protections for half of America’s wetlands and countless miles of smaller streams that provide drinking water for millions and serve as the lifeblood of larger streams and rivers. This rule denies the basic science that water flows downhill and that pollution upstream ends up in larger rivers. Similarly, wetlands are the filters and sponges of our aquatic systems. Allowing them to be drained and destroyed for parking lots, corn fields and other uses mean more pollution, larger floods and less habitat for wildlife.

But that was not all. The EPA also announced in an “interpretive statement” that Clean Water Act protections would no longer apply to pollution or sewage discharged into underground wells or aquifers — even if the polluted discharge flows directly into drinking water sources such as lakes or rivers.

Finally, all this happened within days of an order from President Trump Donald John TrumpForget the spin: Five unrefuted Mueller Report revelations Lara Trump: Merkel admitting migrants 'one of the worst things that ever happened to Germany' Financial satisfaction hits record high: survey MORE instructing the EPA to tie states’ hands in protecting local water quality by constraining the time and information they have to decide whether to approve or veto polluting projects. This will limit the ability of states to object to federally permitted projects, like new reservoirs or oil and gas pipelines, which can be harmful to water quality.

Sadly, this dirtiest of dirty water weeks is par for the course for this administration. In the last two years, we’ve seen attack after attack on clean water with attempts to whittle away decades-old safeguards.

For example, the Trump administration is re-writing the rules to restrict EPA’s express authority under the Clean Water Act to block projects with unacceptable environmental impacts. Although it has been used just 13 times, EPA’s actions have saved 210,000 acres of wetlands and 36 miles of rivers and streams in 11 states. Now EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is contemplating overturning a veto from the George W. Bush administration that blocked a particularly egregious wetland drainage project known as the Yazoo Backwater Pumps.

And the list continues. The Army Corps has also drafted new guidance — which has not been made available to the public for input — restricting the time states have to review Clean Water Act permits to dredge or fill wetlands and streams. And the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued an interim final rule that makes it easier for landowners to drain seasonal wetlands while still receiving federal farm bill subsidies.

The public opposes these types of attacks on the nation’s waters. For example, more than half a million Americans spoke out against the proposed reductions to the scope of the Clean Water Act — despite the short public comment period. We cannot do without clean drinking water. And we can’t afford to have an administration or an EPA that are willing to risk the health and well-being of all Americans to benefit a few industries that seek to profit from fouling our waters.

“This afternoon, Secretary Mnuchin notified me that once again, the I.R.S. will miss the deadline,” he said. “I plan to consult with counsel about my next steps.”

But other Democratic lawmakers said they were prepared to escalate things quickly.

“They don’t get to pick and choose the laws with which they will comply,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas. “After so much of their double talk, prompt action must be taken to secure what they have wrongfully refused.”

Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said that Treasury’s lack of cooperation was an example of the Trump administration’s “lawlessness.”

“Secretary Mnuchin and the White House have blatantly interfered with the I.R.S.’s obligation to provide the president’s tax returns, and action is needed to force this administration to follow the law,” Mr. Wyden said.

Mr. Neal has largely dismissed Mr. Mnuchin’s arguments that the request could violate taxpayer privacy and that it was being done for political purposes, saying that they lacked merit. He gave the Treasury Department until Tuesday to comply and said that failing to do so would be “interpreted as a denial of my request.”

In his letter, Mr. Mnuchin said that the delay was not a failure to comply with the request and that portraying it as such would be “a misinterpretation.”

“The committee’s request has not been denied or granted at this time,” he said.

Last week, in a sign of how much attention Mr. Trump is paying to the proceedings, his personal lawyer urged the Treasury Department not to release the president’s tax returns and accused Democratic lawmakers of having a “radical view of unchecked congressional power.”"

The Interior Department’s Office of Inspector General has opened an investigation into whether six of President Trump’s appointees have violated federal ethics rules by engaging with their former employers or clients on department-related business.

The new inquiry, which the office confirmed in an April 18 letter to the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, is looking into senior Interior officials, including Assistant Secretary for Insular and International Affairs Doug Domenech, White House liaison Lori Mashburn, three top staffers at the Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs, and the department’s former energy policy adviser. The Campaign Legal Center detailed the officials’ actions in a Feb. 20 letter to the inspector general’s office, suggesting a probe is warranted.

To avoid conflicts of interest, Trump signed an executive order days after taking office that requires appointees to recuse themselves from specific matters involving their former employers and clients for two years. The complaint, which cites reports in HuffPost and the Guardian as well as extensive public records, outlines how a half-dozen political appointees at Interior continued to discuss policy matters with organizations that had employed them in the past.

Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said in a phone interview Tuesday that the inquiry shows that the president and his top deputies have failed allegedly to deliver on Trump’s 2016 campaign promise to “drain the swamp” in Washington.

“This is demonstrative of the failures at the very top of this administration to set an ethical tone,” Marsco said. “When people come to work for government, they’re supposed to work on behalf of the public. It’s a betrayal of the public trust when senior political appointees seem to give privileged access to their former employers or former clients.

“We hope this investigation will answer whether these officials are working on behalf of the American people or on behalf of the interests that used to pay their salary,” she added.

The Guardian reported in May 2018 that Domenech, the highest-ranking official named in the complaint, continued to interact with the conservative think tank that used to employ him before he joined Interior.

Domenech’s calendars indicated that he twice met with representatives from the Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation on an endangered species listing and a property dispute. The group had lawsuits pending with Interior over both issues and resolved the fight over private property near Texas’s Red River six months after the meeting with Domenech.

In a news release, the foundation described the November 2017 settlement with Interior as “a major win.""

Benjamin Cassidy, a former lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, also has attracted significant attention for his past work on gun-related issues since joining the department as senior deputy director at its Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs.

Calendars released by Interior show Cassidy participating in a December 2017 meeting regarding Trump’s decision to scale back two national monuments in Utah, even though Cassidy had lobbied Congress on a bill addressing the president’s ability to establish national monuments just months earlier. This activity, first reported by HuffPost, could violate the federal ethics pledge because Cassidy was prohibited from engaging in particular matters on which he had lobbied during the two years before joining the department.

Cassidy had also been in contact with a current NRA lobbyist, Susan Recce, about opening up Bureau of Land Management lands in Arizona and Utah to recreational shooting. Interior ultimately decided to allow recreational shooting in the Sonoran Desert National Monument, the option endorsed by the NRA.

After the decision was announced, the NRA published a post on its website quoting Recce as saying that “the BLM backed down from the closure alternative” as “a result of” the work her group and other gun rights advocates had done.

The center also alleges that Mashburn, a former associate director at the conservative Heritage Foundation, violated her ethics pledge by attending multiple private events held by her former employer.

Nancy DiPaolo, a spokeswoman for the inspector general, said in an email, “We have opened an investigation and are considering all the material presented by CLC, but because it is an active investigation, have no further comments.”

The move comes a week after the office launched a probe into whether Interior Secretary David Bernhardt violated federal conflict of interest rules by weighing in on policies that could affect the former clients he represented while working at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

Bernhardt, who was confirmed earlier this month, has denied any wrongdoing and said he has cleared any action affecting his former employer or clients with the department’s ethics office.

[Bernhardt has so many conflicts of interest he needs to carry a card listing them all]

Interior spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort said in an email that while the department does not typically comment on personnel matters, the secretary’s office “immediately consulted” with department ethics officials after receiving the center’s complaint in February.

“Ethics reviewed each matter and provided materials to the chief of staff, who has taken appropriate actions. All of these materials have been provided to the inspector general,” said Vander Voort, who declined to specify what actions the department had taken. “The department takes ethics issues seriously.”

The other two senior officials with the Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs now under investigation are Todd Wynn and Timothy Williams. All of the officials named in the complaint continue to work at Interior, except for Vincent DeVito, who left his job as the department energy policy counselor in August to join an offshore oil drilling firm."
House Oversight opens investigation into EPA administrator's compliance with ethics law,https://www.cnn.com,['Ellie Kaufman'],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/politics/house-oversight-investigation-epa/index.html,"(CNN) The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has opened an investigation into Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler's compliance with an ethics law that requires officials to disclose all sources of money earned in an amount greater than $5,000 two years prior to holding an appointed position, according to a letter House Oversight chairman Elijah Cummings sent Wheeler.

Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, did not disclose that he previously lobbied for Darling Ingredients while working at Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting on his financial disclosure forms, according to documents obtained by the committee.

The committee cited the lobbying firm Faegre's quarterly disclosure forms to point out the omission in Wheeler's financial disclosure report. Wheeler ""engaged in lobbying activities on behalf of Darling"" from April 2015 to May 2016, according to Faegre's forms cited in the House letter to the EPA.

The EPA declined to comment on the committee's request, stating they would respond to the committee through the ""proper channels.""

The Oversight Committee claims this omission means that Wheeler violated the Ethics in Government Act, which requires federal officials to disclose all money earned in an amount greater than $5,000 in the two years before holding a government position.

Justice Department wants Goldman Sachs to plead guilty in bribery scandal,https://nypost.com,['April'],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://nypost.com/2019/04/24/justice-department-wants-goldman-sachs-to-plead-guilty-in-bribery-scandal/,"Justice Department prosecutors are reportedly pushing for a hardball approach to negotiations with Goldman Sachs over its role in a $3 billion Malaysian bribery scandal that has hung over the bank for years.

Career prosecutors at the Justice Department want the negotiating team to insist that the bank agree to a guilty plea, along with any other additional fines and penalties stemming from its role in allegedly defrauding 1Malaysia Development Berhad, the Asian country’s sovereign wealth fund, according to a report in the Financial Times.

In 2012 and 2013, Goldman sold more than $6 billion in bonds to help fund 1MDB, which was then secretly being run by financier Jho Low. About half of that money was then spent by Low to enrich himself and throw lavish parties attended by celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio.

The revelations about the internal government deliberations signal that the 1MDB investigation could be nearing the final stages. A Goldman insider said that the bank hasn’t recently had discussions with the government over final settlement.

It wasn’t clear what charge the government wants Goldman to plead guilty to.

Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment.

Goldman has previously pinned the blame on two of its bankers, including former partner Tim Leissner, who pleaded guilty to aiding the fraud last year.

“We do not believe that such a charge would be warranted by the facts of the case or the law, particularly because senior management was unaware of the criminal activity by Mr. Leissner and his associate who took extraordinary efforts to hide their part in the illegal scheme from management, compliance, and legal functions at the firm,” Jake Siewert, a spokesman for the bank, said in a statement.

The 1MDB scandal — in which Low allegedly embezzled $3 billion to finance “The Wolf of Wall Street” and buy real estate and art — has weighed on Goldman’s stock price, and analysts have predicted that fines could reach as high as $10 billion."
DHS chief regrets loss of public trust after family separations,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/acting-dhs-chief-kevin-mcaleenan-says-he-regrets-family-separations-60-minutes-2019-04-23/,"The acting head of the Department of Homeland Security tells 60 Minutes the White House policy that led to separating thousands of migrant children from their parents at the southern border wasn't successful. Kevin McAleenan says in the interview airing Sunday that he regrets the way the policy was carried out.

""The enforcement of the law against parents who violated our border laws and brought children with them was effective,"" Kevin McAleenan tells correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, ""It reduced the flow, but it didn't work in the sense that we lost the public trust in the implementation of that initiative.

President Trump named McAleenan as acting head of the department following the resignation of Kirstjen Nielsen. McAleenan was the former head of Customs and Border Protection.

In the 60 Minutes report, Alfonsi shows border patrol stations overwhelmed with families the secretary says DHS is trying to house.

""We just had a bipartisan report from the Homeland Security Advisory Council that looked at the situation we're facing on the border and said, 'You need additional facilities,'"" McAleenan tells Alfonsi. ""You need to be able to take families and children out of a Border Patrol station, which is a police station, it's built for single adults who have violated laws. And you need them in a better setting.""

Alfonsi said in an interview with the CBS Evening News that tent cities will be utilized to house families.

""We have learned that DHS actually did start building two tent cities along the border in Texas,"" Alfonsi said. ""And we're told that they're supposed to be completed next week.""

USDA Releases Hemp Seed Import Guidance,https://www.ganjapreneur.com,['Tg Branfalt'],04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.ganjapreneur.com/usda-releases-hemp-seed-import-guidance/,"The United States Department of Agriculture has released guidance allowing hemp seeds to be imported from outside of the U.S. as long as the seeds include documentation that the strains will produce plants below the 0.3 percent THC threshold.

Seeds must include phytosanitary certificates from government plant protection agencies that confirm their origin and that no plant pests are detected. The agency notes that, while the Drug Enforcement Agency no longer has the authority to require hemp seed permits for import purposes, the shipments would be subject to inspection at ports of entry by Customs and Border Patrol.

“The [USDA] regulates the importation of all seeds for planting to ensure safe agricultural trade. Under this authority, USDA is providing an alternative way for the safe importation of hemp seeds into the United States.” — April 18 USDA “Importation of Hemp Seeds” guidance.

The guidance is the first action by the USDA related to hemp, which was removed from the Controlled Substances Act last December as part of the 2018 farm bill. The measure requires states to submit their hemp industry plans to the USDA for review before they can be implemented. The agency is responsible for developing federal rules but those rules are not expected until later this year.

Since the bill’s passage, several states have moved on, or approved, legislation to either align their state hemp cultivation rules with those outlined in the federal legislation or legalize hemp production. Currently, just seven states still have laws in place outlawing hemp production.

Department of Defense identifies Army soldier who died in Iraq,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/department-of-defense-identifies-army-soldier-who-died-in-iraq,"Spc. Michael T. Osorio of the U.S. Army died in Taji, Iraq, on Tuesday.

The Department of Defense announced Wednesday that Osorio died in a noncombat related incident and that the circumstances surrounding his death are under investigation. Osorio, 20, was an intelligence analyst supporting Operation Inherent Resolve, the global coalition effort to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

This was Osorio’s first overseas deployment. The soldier, who joined the Army in 2017, had been in Iraq since Feb. 23.

Osorio was from Horseshoe Bend, Idaho, and was assigned to the 4th Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Armored Brigade Team, 4th Infantry Division based out of Fort Carson, Colo.

He had received the Army Achievement Medal, the Army Commendation Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal.

""The 3rd Armored Brigade would like to extend its deepest condolences to the friends, family, and fellow Soldiers of Spc. Michael Osorio. Spc. Osorio’s dedication to the mission and his unit, made him a valued member of the Iron Brigade. His loss will be felt throughout our formations,” said Col. Michael J. Simmering, the commander of the 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division.

Col. Simmering added: “We ask that everyone keep the Osorio family in their hearts and prayers as they deal with the tragic loss of their Soldier.”

This is the second noncombat related death in Iraq in the past week. Spc. Ryan Riley, 22, of the 101st Airborne, died in Ninawa Province on Saturday. Based out of Fort Campbell in Kentucky, Riley was on his first deployment to Iraq as well."
EPA head Andrew Wheeler never disclosed chemical lobbying job: congressman,https://nypost.com,['April'],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://nypost.com/2019/04/24/epa-head-andrew-wheeler-never-disclosed-chemical-lobbying-job-congressman/,"The head of the Environmental Protection Agency failed to disclose lobbying work he did for a company that is regulated by the agency, according to a federal lawmaker.

When EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler joined the agency in 2017, he neglected to mention on required financial disclosure forms that he had just left a two-year gig at Darling Ingredients, which has a hand in making fuel and fertilizers regulated by the EPA.

“These documents indicate that you may have improperly omitted Darling from your financial disclosure, and they raise concerns that you may have failed to identify other clients who paid for your services as a lobbyist during the period covered by your disclosure report,” House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings wrote in a Tuesday letter to Wheeler.

The omission came to light when his former lobbying firm, Faegre Baker Daniels Consulting, filed disclosure reports that showed the income.

Wheeler’s former work on behalf of EPA-regulated companies — including coal outfits — has come under scrutiny by Democrats.

At a town hall meeting Monday, presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren criticized the EPA chief for his previous work.

“No coal lobbyists for head of EPA,” Warren said at the event.

The scrutiny comes less than a year after former EPA head Scott Pruitt resigned in disgrace from the agency in July amid a cloud of ethics controversies.

He was probed by the House and the Senate for his profligate spending at the EPA, which included lavish first-class air travel, a $43,000 soundproof booth for making private phone calls from his office, and $1,560 on a dozen custom fountain pens."
"No, Donald Trump is not the first president with low approval amid a good economy",https://www.politifact.com,[],04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2019/apr/23/donald-trump/no-donald-trump-not-first-president-low-approval-a/,"""In the ‘old days’ if you were president and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism.""

During an hours-long tweetstorm, President Donald Trump complained that he wasn’t getting enough credit for presiding over a strong economy.

In an early morning tweet on April 23, Trump wrote, ""In the ‘old days’ if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism. Remember, ‘It’s the economy stupid.’ Today I have, as President, perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the Mainstream Media, it means NOTHING. But it will!""

In the “old days” if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism. Remember, “It’s the economy stupid.” Today I have, as President, perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the Mainstream Media, it means NOTHING. But it will! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 23, 2019

We wondered whether Trump was right that historically, ""if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism."" (His mention of ""It's the economy, stupid,"" was something Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign team would say to remind themselves to stay on message.)

Short answer: Trump is wrong.

Looking at approval ratings

For starters, we’ll note that ""criticism"" of government leaders is virtually inevitable given the First Amendment, which protects ""freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.""

""Presidents have never been ‘immune’ to criticism, regardless of the economy,"" said Jeremi Suri, a historian at the University of Texas and its Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. ""From Washington to Trump, every president has faced serious criticism from domestic adversaries and various groups. That is as American as apple pie.""

But even if you define the issue more broadly, Trump’s statement lacks evidence.

For a quick-and-dirty analysis, we looked at two statistics that measure the strength of the economy and public support for every post-World War II president: the unemployment rate, and the president’s approval rating from the polling firm Gallup.

We found four presidents -- Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and George W. Bush -- who experienced roughly similar low unemployment rates as Trump but whose approval percentages ranged from the low 20s to the high 30s.

Here’s a summary:

Truman’s strong-economy doldrums lasted for the better part of two years, Johnson’s for a year and a half, Nixon’s for a couple of months, and Bush’s for about six months.

What they all shared is a major issue other than the economy that sapped public support.

""If a president has a good economy, it gives them the chance to get a good approval rating -- but it’s not a guarantee,"" said Jeffrey A. Engel, director of the Southern Methodist University Center for Presidential History.

For Truman, Johnson and Bush, a war proved unpopular. For Nixon, it was Watergate.

""War, when it is protracted, tends to be a downer for presidential approval,"" said Bert A. Rockman, an emeritus political science professor at Purdue University. ""All things being equal, a booming economy is a help to a president, unless they are caught up in conflicts that produce high numbers of casualties over a protracted period of time and that seem to be at an impasse.""

Johnson faced problems beyond the Vietnam War. ""I think he could have survived the war if not for race riots and assassinations,"" Engel said. ""It wasn’t just one thing. It was the multiplicity of them.""

Even presidents who maintain their approval ratings aren’t immune from ""criticism"" during good economic times, Suri said.

Johnson and Bill Clinton ""were presidents during two of the best economic periods in post-war U.S. history, but both faced intensive criticism from Republicans and some Democrats,"" Suri said. ""The Republicans impeached Clinton at a moment of very low unemployment, strong economic growth, and even a budget surplus."" (Clinton’s approval rating on the eve of his impeachment vote in the House was 63 percent.)

Low unemployment rates don’t guarantee that everyone will be happy with the economy, either, Suri added.

""There is also the question of who benefits from good economic numbers,"" he said. ""Growing inequality, despite low unemployment, has been a source of criticism for all presidents since at least Nixon.""

The White House did not respond to an inquiry.

Our ruling

Trump said, ""In the ‘old days’ if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism.""

Even setting aside the constitutionally protected right of Americans to petition the government with their grievances, Trump lacks basic evidence for his assertion. At least four prior presidents served during good economic times yet had approval ratings lower than Trump’s are currently, usually because of wars or scandal.

DHS plan for face scanning at airports sparks alarm,https://thehill.com,[],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://thehill.com/policy/technology/440323-dhs-plan-for-face-scanning-at-airports-sparks-alarm,"Lawmakers and civil liberties advocates are calling on the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to halt plans to begin using facial recognition technology on nearly all departing air passengers within the next four years.

The agency’s plan has reignited the fight over the sensitive technology. Critics say facial recognition technology is not ready for large-scale deployment and that DHS has failed to establish specific rules to prevent abuses and policies for handling the collected data.

So far, according to Markey’s office, the department has ignored their warnings.

DHS has been implementing its “biometric exit” program, which photographs some visitors when they are departing the U.S., for years, expanding to 15 major airports with plans to reach five more. President Trump Donald John TrumpForget the spin: Five unrefuted Mueller Report revelations Lara Trump: Merkel admitting migrants 'one of the worst things that ever happened to Germany' Financial satisfaction hits record high: survey MORE in 2017 signed an executive order speeding up the rollout of the face-scanning technology, and Congress in 2016 authorized up to $1 billion over the next 10 years to implement the program.

The stated purpose of the program is to identify non-U.S. citizens who have overstayed their visas, but it captures the faces of U.S. citizens as well. The agency says it has successfully identified 7,000 people at major U.S. airports who have overstayed their visas.

The DHS report published last week, which was provided to the House and Senate judiciary committees, is the latest sign that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) — DHS’s largest federal law enforcement agency — is fast-tracking the implementation of the program at the country’s largest airports.

That has privacy advocates in an uproar. They say DHS is ignoring concerns that facial recognition technology wrongly recognizes certain populations at higher rates and allegations that the agency ignored formal procedures required to implement such a wide-ranging program.

“DHS wants to scan your face before it has issued formal rules to protect your privacy,” Harrison Rudolph, an associate at Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology, told The Hill. “Without rules, there could be little that stands in the way of DHS breaking its privacy promises. That’s deeply alarming.”

According to a tranche of documents released by the Electronic Privacy Information Center last month, CBP skipped parts of the formal rulemaking process that requires federal agencies to solicit public comments before they adopt technology that will be used on U.S. citizens.

Privacy advocates have continued to call for CBP to undertake a rulemaking process, which would allow them to push for safeguards and limits on its data collection.

As it stands, CBP says it keeps the photos of those identified as U.S. citizens for 12 hours before disposing of them. The agency keeps photographs of departing non-U.S. citizens for up to 14 days.

Neema Singh Guliani, a senior legislative council at the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Hill that she is concerned by CBP’s refusal to establish rules around how passengers can opt out of face scanning.

“The agency has not undertaken any rulemaking to clarify how it’s going to use this information, what privacy protections will apply, what recourse individuals may have in the event that their privacy is violated,” Guliani said. “They haven’t provided clarity or information as to how U.S. citizens or others can opt out of face recognition.”

The agency says it is working to propose a rule that would require all travelers, including U.S. citizens, to be photographed. But it is unclear what safeguards that would include.

Currently, CBP says passengers are welcome to decline to participate in the program. But according to the airlines partnering with the agency, very few passengers do so.

And CBP also says it cannot prevent the private companies that provide the facial recognition technology from keeping the biometric data they capture. Airports and airlines solicit third-party vendors to provide the cameras used by CBP.

“If any airline wanted to suddenly start their own photograph database, that’s their business to do with their customer, but it cannot in any way connect to us for any matching,” a CBP official told The Hill. The official noted that “nobody wants to be in the biometric game” or “keep this data” because they recognize it is a “responsibility.”

Those vendors include SITA, a multinational information technology company that focuses on airport transportation; NEC Corporation, a Japanese information technology company; and Vision-Box, a Portugal-based multinational technology company.

SITA, which has worked with JetBlue and CBP on biometric exit at three U.S. airports, in an emailed statement told The Hill that it does not distribute “biometric information to any party other than the customer ... and to CBP.” It said it only uses personal information to share with CBP and “expedite passengers’ departure.”

The other two companies did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment.

Besides the concerns around data collection, critics say facial recognition is not ready for large-scale deployment.

DHS face scans have been shown to misrecognize U.S. citizens, as well as young and old people, at higher rates, according to a September audit of biometric exit by the DHS Office of the Inspector General.

U.S. citizens, according to the watchdog report, were up to six times more likely to be rejected by DHS than non-U.S. citizens last year. And individuals under the age of 29, who accounted for 18 percent of all passengers, accounted for 36 percent of all passengers rejected by DHS’s system.

A CBP official told The Hill that its facial recognition system will be undergoing an external assessment over the next six months.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology, a non-regulatory federal agency, will be assessing DHS’s face scanning system for bias testing. The two agencies have signed all the appropriate paperwork and started holding exploratory meetings in the past few weeks, according to the official.

Officials are trying to calm worries about the new technologies.

“Nobody wants to have an anomaly in the way the system matches and operates,” the CBP official said. “The federal government has policies against that, and we don’t want to do that.”

Lawmakers, though, note that there are no laws in the U.S. specifically governing the use of facial recognition technology even as it is being rapidly deployed at airports. And they want DHS to address their concerns.

“DHS has a statutory requirement to submit a report to Congress detailing the viability of biometric technologies, including privacy implications and accuracy,” Markey and Lee wrote in a statement last month.

“DHS should pause their efforts until American travelers fully understand exactly who has access to their facial recognition data, how long their data will be held, how their information will be safeguarded, and how they can opt out of the program altogether.”"
How did Alabama prisons stack up in latest DOJ report?,https://www.al.com,"['William Thornton', 'Wthornton Al.Com']",04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.al.com/news/2019/04/how-did-alabama-prisons-stack-up-in-latest-doj-report.html,"Alabama was one of only two states in the U.S. that significantly decreased its number of people in state prisons by the end of 2017, but the state’s prisons remain overcrowded.

That’s according to reports released today by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the U.S. Department of Justice agency responsible for collecting the nation’s crime and criminal justice statistics.

The drop in inmate population between 2016 and 2017 came during a period in which the DOJ was in the midst of investigating reports of rampant violence, sexual abuse, and living conditions within the walls of Alabama’s state men’s prisons. That investigation, which began in the fall of 2016, led to a report issued earlier this month and a deadline by the DOJ for Alabama to take steps towards fixing the problems or face legal action.

The decrease noted in today’s report kept pace with a national trend, as incarceration rates in both prisons and jails nationwide shrank by more than 10 percent from 2007 through 2017. Over that decade, the national incarceration rate among state and federal prisoners sentenced to more than a year also dropped by 13 percent.

Still, the numbers gave a mixed picture for Alabama, which decreased its count of sentenced prisoners by 4,080 from 2016 to 2017. The decrease likely reflects sentencing reforms enacted six years ago for nonviolent crimes, which were aimed at sentencing fewer offenders to prison. The Alabama Legislature is expected to consider more sentencing reforms this session.

But between 2016 and 2017, the state saw one of the largest increases in the U.S. of people newly sentenced to more than a year behind bars in state and federal prisons. That figure was up by 1,400, the report stated.

And advocates say the number of people going in is still getting higher. The Equal Justice Initiative says on its website that ADOC reported admitting more than 14,000 people in 2018, the highest number of admissions in a single year in the department’s history.

Alabama held 27,608 inmates in its state and federal correctional institutions by the end of 2017, according to the report. Of those, 12,600 were white, and 14,857 were black. There were no figures for the number of Hispanic inmates.

In its latest internal report of facilities, the Alabama Department of Corrections, as of this January, had 27,242 in its custody, which includes all inmates serving time within ADOC facilities and programs, as well as in the custody of other correctional authorities, such as county jails, other states, community correction programs, and federal and private prisons.

Nationally, the imprisonment rate for sentenced black adults declined by 31 percent from 2007 to 2017 and by 4 percent from 2016 to 2017, the largest declines of any racial group. But the imprisonment rate for sentenced black males was almost six times that for sentenced white males.

Overall, the rate of inmates serving sentences of one year or more in Alabama prisons dropped from 571 per 100,000 to 486 per 100,000 - a rate surpassed only by nine other states.

There was little surprise in one notation about Alabama’s state prison system in today’s report – “The majority of Alabama prisons were overcrowded.”

According to the Alabama Department of Corrections’ internal overview in 2017, the state’s 15 medium and close security prisons at the time were occupied by 160.5 percent more inmates than they were designed to hold.

Torture, rape, murder: Shocking details from the federal investigation of Alabama’s prison crisis Alabama prisons have the highest homicide rate in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Alabama’s overcrowded, aging prisons were only one area of focus in this month’s report on Alabama’s men’s prisons by the U.S. Department of Justice, which found there is reasonable cause to believe conditions in Alabama prisons violate the Constitution. The report said Alabama prisons have the highest homicide rate in the nation and that violence has increased dramatically in the last five-and-a-half years.

Today’s report also shed light on other areas of the state’s prison picture. The number of Alabamians held in private prisons was down 24 percent from 2016 to 2017, but that number of prisoners – 348 – makes up barely 1 percent of the total of incarcerated people. The state also held 817 non-U.S. citizens in federal and state prisons, or about 3.7 percent of its total imprisoned population. Only 17 prisoners statewide were the age of 17 or younger.

Nationally, the prison incarceration rate dropped 2.1 percent from 2016 to 2017, bringing it to the lowest level since 1997.

The rate of people in jails also decreased by 12 percent from 2007 to 2017, but did not decline from 2016 to 2017. Half of jail inmates were white and a third were black. In fact, the demographic characteristics of people in jails shifted from 2005 to 2017. During this period, the percentage of white prisoners increased from 44 percent to 50 percent, while the percentage that was black decreased from 39 percent to 34 percent. The Hispanic proportion nationwide remained unchanged from 2005, at 15 percent.

At the end of fiscal year 2017, nearly half of all federal prisoners were serving a sentence for drug trafficking, the report stated.

The report on jails did not provide state by state numbers.

President Trump's often-repeated campaign promise to “drain the swamp” in Washington of special interests is getting yet another test.

The Interior Department’s internal watchdog office is looking to see whether six of Trump's appointees in the department have violated federal ethics rules by engaging with their former employers or clients on department-related business, Juliet Eilperin and I reported Tuesday.

To avoid conflicts of interest, Trump signed an executive order days after taking office that requires appointees to recuse themselves from specific matters involving their former employers and clients for two years.

But a complaint from the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center, which sparked the inspector general's probe, outlines how a half-dozen of his political appointees at Interior continued to discuss policy matters with organizations that had employed them in the past.

The officials being investigated include:

Doug Domenech , assistant secretary for insular and international affairs. The Guardian reported in May 2018 that Domenech, the highest-ranking official named in the complaint, continued to interact with the conservative think tank that used to employ him before he joined Interior. Domenech’s calendars indicated that he twice met with representatives from the Austin-based Texas Public Policy Foundation on an endangered species listing and a property dispute. The group had lawsuits pending with Interior over both issues and resolved the fight over private property near Texas’s Red River six months after the meeting with Domenech.

Benjamin Cassidy , a former lobbyist for the National Rifle Association, who has attracted significant attention for his past work on gun-related issues since joining the department as senior deputy director at its Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs. Calendars released by Interior show Cassidy participating in a December 2017 meeting regarding Trump’s decision to scale back two national monuments in Utah, even though Cassidy had lobbied Congress on a bill addressing the president’s ability to establish national monuments just months earlier.

Lori Mashburn, White House liaison. The center alleges the former associate director at the conservative Heritage Foundation violated her ethics pledge by attending multiple private events held by her former employer.

“This is demonstrative of the failures at the very top of this administration to set an ethical tone,” Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said. “When people come to work for government, they’re supposed to work on behalf of the public. It’s a betrayal of the public trust when senior political appointees seem to give privileged access to their former employers or former clients.”

The move comes a week after Interior's inspector general's office launched a probe into whether Interior Secretary David Bernhardt violated federal conflict of interest rules by weighing in on policies that could affect the former clients he represented while working at the law firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck.

Bernhardt, who was confirmed earlier this month, has denied any wrongdoing and said he has cleared any action affecting his former employer or clients with the department’s ethics office.

Interior spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort said in an email that while the department does not typically comment on personnel matters, the secretary’s office “immediately consulted” with department ethics officials after receiving the center’s complaint in February.

“Ethics reviewed each matter and provided materials to the chief of staff, who has taken appropriate actions. All of these materials have been provided to the inspector general,” said Vander Voort, who declined to specify what actions the department had taken. “The department takes ethics issues seriously.”

— More potential lobbying issues: This time, it's over at the Enviromental Protection Agency. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) is asking agency chief Andrew Wheeler why he left a former client, Darling Ingredients, off of financial disclosure forms. The chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee found documents about Wheeler's lobbying work for Darling that ""raise concerns that you may have failed to identify other clients who paid for your services as a lobbyist during the period covered by your disclosure report,"" he and Rep. Harley Rouda (D-Calif.) wrote in a letter to Wheeler. Darling Ingredients makes ingredients for fertilizers, animal feed and other products.

— Another day, another lawsuit against the Trump administration: A bevy of environmental and public health advocacy groups — including the mothers of two men who died from methylene chloride exposure — sued the EPA over not including professional contractors in a ban on that toxic solvent. It's at least the second such lawsuit over the agency's efforts to craft a rule regulating the paint-stripping chemical in a way that satisfies both manufactures and consumer advocates.

— Two more states pass clean energy bills: In a flurry of votes in recent days pegged to Earth Day, the state legislatures in Washington and Nevada each passed measures aiming to eliminate climate-warming emissions from the states' electricity sectors.

In Nevada, Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) signed a bill setting a goal of zero carbon emissions from power producers by the middle of the century, according to the Reno Gazette-Journal. The governor's mansion in Carson City was one of several that Democrats took back in the 2018 blue-wave election.

And in Washington, presidential candidate Jay Inslee (D), whose day job is still governor of the state, is about to cement to big legislative win on climate change after years of struggling to do so. This week, state lawmakers passed a pair of climate bills, including one that phases the state away from fossil-fuel-generated electricity by 2045, the Seattle Times reports.

Make that five: The two states join Hawaii, California, and New Mexico as the only ones with legal mandates to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation. Lawmakers in other blue states like New York and Massachusetts are considering codifying similar requirements for 100 percent clean energy.

""However prepared the pod might be for the move, though, National Aquarium chief executive John Racanelli says they will probably have to wait beyond the 2020 target moving date to leave Baltimore, in part because of climate change. Aquarium officials have reviewed — and vetoed — more than 50 potential sanctuary locations from consideration because of unclean water caused by human development or the threat posed by climate-change-related events such as sea-level rise, rapid seaweed blooms in warming waters and extreme storms.""

— ""Awash in oil"": Trump economic advisor Larry Kudlow tried to tamp down concerns that sanctioning buyers of Iranian oil will tighten petroleum markets and, in turn, raise fuel prices right before the summer driving season. ""The world is awash in oil,"" Kudlow told an audience at the National Press Club, per The Hill. ""The center of the world energy system is the United States. We’re the driver.""

What's actually happening: Oil prices surge to a six-month high after the State Department announcement, with the cost of the international benchmark Brent crude nearing $75 per barrel Tuesday. Analysts told the Associated Press that the price ""could rise to $80 per barrel or higher, depending on what happens in other countries where supply is at risk.""

Matt Gaetz: Evidence of FBI-media 'corruption' coming out before DOJ inspector general report,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-21-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/matt-gaetz-evidence-of-fbi-media-corruption-coming-out-before-doj-inspector-general-report,"Rep. Matt Gaetz says evidence of FBI officials improperly receiving incentives from the media in exchange for leaks will soon come out.

During an interview on Fox News late Saturday, the Florida Republican said the Justice Department inspector general is examining the FBI's relationship with some members of the press. But, he said some of this information will be made public before the watchdog report's release.

""One of the other nuggets that the inspector general is working on is the corruption that existed between the media and members of of the FBI,"" Gaetz said. ""Where members of the mainstream media were giving concert passes and athletic tickets and other incentives to people in the FBI to leak to them so we'll be seeing that even before we see the inspector general's report on how this fraudulent investigation began.""

Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz announced the initiation of a FISA abuse investigation in March 2018 after requests from both then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Republican members in Congress. He is expected to wrap up by May or June.

It's unclear where Gaetz may have gotten his information. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

However, his fellow GOP colleagues Reps. Mark Meadows and Jim Jordan recently said they discussed the FISA investigation with Horowitz. The lawmakers claimed the Justice Department and FBI had abused the FISA process and misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in their investigation and surveillance of President Trump and his associates during the campaign, as well as during the Trump administration.

Gaetz questioned the veracity of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, noting how he cited media reports ""as if they're gospel when they clearly are not.""

[Read more: Obama DOJ has to fess up on FISA 'spying' after Mueller finds no collusion, GOP investigator says]

Mueller's report, which was released in redacted form on Thursday, found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Mueller declined to make a conclusion about possible obstruction of justice by the president.

The DOJ inspector general released a report last summer that found many FBI officials talking to the press and attending ""social events"" with the media during the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private emails, breaking with FBI policy limiting employees who are authorized to speak to the media.

In October, the inspector general released more information in a summary that said a senior FBI official, who had since retired, accepted tickets to a sports event from a television reporter who regularly covered the bureau."
WV MetroNews DOJ unit focused on political hot potatoes leads probe of Governor Justice's properties,http://wvmetronews.com,['Brad Mcelhinny'],04-23-2019,2019,4,http://wvmetronews.com/2019/04/23/doj-unit-focused-on-political-hot-potatoes-leads-probe-of-governor-justices-properties/,"By Brad McElhinny in News | April 23, 2019 at 6:56PM

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A subpoena requesting information about Gov. Jim Justice’s private properties did not come from federal prosecutors in West Virginia.

Instead, the subpoena is addressed from the U.S. Department of Justice’s Public Integrity Section, a designation that may reflect the investigation is high-profile and sensitive.

The Public Integrity Section’s own description of its role says it “oversees the federal effort to combat corruption through the prosecution of elected and appointed public officials at all levels of government.”

Mike Stuart, the U.S. Attorney for Southern West Virginia, has talked proudly of his office’s efforts to challenge public corruption. ““Public corruption is a cancer on our system of government,” Stuart has said.

Stuart’s office spearheaded fraud prosecutions of state Supreme Court Justices Allen Loughry and Menis Ketchum last year.

But the investigation involving the governor appears to have gone beyond Stuart and his staff.

“One of the reasons it could be taken to Public Integrity Section would be appearance of conflict,” said former assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Callaghan, who is now in private practice in Charleston.

“In my experience the Public Integrity Section would oversee any public official investigation. They may or may not take over the case. It just depends on circumstance.”

As West Virginia’s governor, Jim Justice is already a prominent political figure. Add to that his family’s sprawling, complicated and, by all appearances, financially-strained business operation.

A subpoena demanding records from the state Department of Commerce to The Greenbrier Resort, The Greenbrier Classic golf event and Old White Charities — all run by the governor’s family — was revealed earlier this month.

The subpoena is not evidence of wrongdoing, but does indicate an investigation is underway.

Last week, when reporters asked Justice what he believes the investigation is about, the governor said he doesn’t know.

“I don’t have one earthly clue,” Justice said. “I honestly don’t. And I want to re-emphasize that I want to be respectful of these people and the job they’re doing.

“Let’s just be fair here. They’re here to protect us. And that’s just the job they do. I guess I make a mistake now and then, and then I try to correct it.”

He went on to describe the economic difficulties of coal, where his family has many of its holdings, along with the catastrophic flood of 2016 that hurt The Greenbrier’s properties and forced the annual PGA Tour golf tournament to be canceled.

“It’s tough. It’s really tough,” Justice said. “And so, I guess, in an organization as big as our organization you surely are going to be able to find something that doesn’t look right or whatever. But I promise you to God above, you’ll never find anything that Jim Justice has purposefully done to benefit Jim Justice.”

The Public Integrity Section was created in 1976 following the Watergate scandal.

Following the dismissal of corruption charges against Alaska Sen. Ted Stephens in 2009, the unit’s reputation was perceived as tarnished.

That was further complicated in 2010 with a string of congressional investigations that ended without resolution. One of those was an investigation of Congressman Alan Mollohan, a West Virginia Democrat, over whether he had benefited from federal earmarks for his district.

By 2014, as the section rallied, a headline in The New York Times declared, “At Justice Department, a Watchdog on Graft Finds Its Teeth Again.”

The Public Integrity Section provides an annual report to Congress. The most recent one from 2017 depicts an active prosecutorial unit that remains involved with corruption investigations.

The report notes that cases handled by the Public Integrity Section generally fall into one of the following categories: recusals by United States Attorneys’ Offices, sensitive cases, multidistrict cases, referrals from federal agencies and shared cases.

“I can’t tell you for sure they’ve taken over this case,” Callaghan observed. “By appearances they have.”

In some instances, local prosecutors might recuse themselves.

“Public corruption cases tend to raise unique problems of public perception that are generally absent in more routine criminal cases,” the Public Integrity section wrote in its most recent report to Congress.

“An investigation of alleged corruption by a government official, whether at the federal, state, or local level, or someone associated with such an official, always has the potential of becoming a high-profile case simply because its focus is on the conduct of a public official. In addition, these cases are often politically sensitive because their ultimate targets tend to be politicians or government officials appointed by politicians.”

Similarly, a case may be so sensitive that it is best handled away from where it would have the most political impact.

“Sensitive cases may also include those that are so politically controversial on a local level that they are most appropriately handled in Washington,” the Public Integrity Section wrote."
Acting DHS chief predicts a lot of progress building southern border wall despite Congressional inaction,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Sam Dorman', 'Sam Dorman Is A Freelance Reporter For Fox News.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/acting-dhs-chief-predicts-a-lot-of-progress-building-southern-border-wall-despite-congressional-inaction,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Tuesday that his department needed more troops on the southern border, where he expected to leverage a ""robust partnership"" with the Department of Defense and continue making rapid progress on a barrier blocking unauthorized entry.

He was responding to Fox News host Dana Perino on ""The Daily Briefing"" when she asked how he planned, without additional funding from Congress, to give voters the sense that the administration was making progress building the border wall that the president had made a central part of his 2016 campaign.

""We're going to show a lot of progress this year,"" he told Perino, noting that wall construction had already outpaced the progress seen in federal projects of similar size. ""We've already built the FY17 funding in less than two years. That shows how aggressively we're moving out on this.""

He also pointed to support from the Department of Defense, which he said has been ""critically engaged"" in border security and freed up the border patrol to focus on primary law enforcement duties.

FORMER ICE ACTING DIRECTOR ON BORDER: 'THIS IS A CRISIS I'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE AT THIS LEVEL'

Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted that the wall was ""being rapidly built."" ""The Wall is being rapidly built! The Economy is GREAT! Our Country is Respected again!"" he said.

For much of the president's first term, he and congressional Democrats repeatedly clashed over the border wall. When the two sides couldn't agree on the issue at the end of 2018, the government shut down and only re-opened alongside Trump's decision to declare a national emergency in order to expedite wall funding.

Trump has taken a multi-faceted approach to immigration policy and faced legal challenges to many of his decisions. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on his administration's decision to ask about citizenship on the 2020 Census — a move Democrats blasted as illegal.

HOUSE DEMS FAIL TO OVERRIDE TRUMP VETO IN FIGHT OVER BORDER EMERGENCY DECLARATION

During his interview with Perino, McAleenan reiterated the president's concern about the law surrounding unaccompanied minors and migrant families at the border. He highlighted two particular changes he'd like to see from Congress.

""The two targeted changes we need the most are the ability to detain families together through a fair and expeditious immigration proceeding,"" he said.

$1.5 Million Grant Program Opened by USDA to Support Dairy,https://www.dairyherd.com,['Wyatt Bechtel'],,,,https://www.dairyherd.com/article/15-million-grant-program-opened-usda-support-dairy,"A $1.5 million in competitive grant funding program has been made available by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that seeks to help the dairy industry.

The Dairy Business Innovation (DBI) Initiatives is authorized through the 2018 Farm Bill and supports dairies that diversify with on-farm processing and product marketing. The program also supports the use of regional milk production and aims to reduce risk for dairies while developing high-value dairy products. The program was announced on April 16 by USDA.

Funds from the DBI Initiatives are to be used for grants directly to dairy business, while also used for technical assistance. These grant projects have to be used for existing dairy industry resources. These include dairy farm density and farmland suitability for dairying, as well as activities conducted by dairy promotion and research programs, research organizations, dairy businesses, or academic and industry stakeholders.

Grants can be used for niche markets like specialty cheese or to assist dairy businesses with dairy products derived from the milk of a specific type of dairy animal, including products made from cow, sheep and goat milk.

The DBI Initiatives program has the support of Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.) who proposed the Dairy Business Innovation Act during the lead up to the latest farm bill. Baldwin was particularly pleased with the grant initiative moving forward because of the support it can bring Wisconsin farmers.

“Wisconsin’s dairy businesses are a key driver of our state’s economy, but recently our dairy farmers have faced very challenging times with an oversupply of milk and low milk prices. It’s critical that farmers, cheesemakers and dairy processors have tools to innovate and develop new Made in Wisconsin dairy products to build a brighter future for our dairy farms and drive our rural economy forward,” Baldwin says. “I’m proud to create these new initiatives and open up new resources for our dairy businesses to foster innovation, update their manufacturing practices and reach new markets so Wisconsin’s dairy industry can continue to lead the nation.”

Applications must be submitted electronically through www.grants.gov by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on June 17, 2019. For more information about grant eligibility, visit DBI Initiatives or contact AMSGrants@usda.gov."

Re “Don’t Let a Killer Pollutant Loose,” by John Balmes (Op-Ed, April 15):

I agree with Dr. Balmes about recent troubling efforts to undermine established evidence showing the grave dangers of air pollution.

I am an epidemiologist and a former scientist with the Environmental Protection Agency who helped sift through thousands of peer-reviewed research studies that collectively support and strengthen the conclusion that exposures to even low levels of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) cause heart disease, cancer and early death — a finding that is confirmed by the World Health Organization.

Accepting the scientific conclusions in the E.P.A.’s assessment should lead to a reduction in the amount of harmful PM 2.5 that’s allowed from smokestacks and tailpipes.

Tightening our air pollution standards for PM 2.5 may be a problem for the polluters with cozy ties to the Trump administration and the former lobbyists now in charge of the E.P.A., but stronger air pollution limits will benefit the health and welfare of millions of Americans and also help mitigate the global climate crisis."

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt began working on policies that would aid one of his former lobbying clients within weeks of joining the Trump administration, according to a POLITICO analysis of agency documents — a revelation that adds to the ethics questions dogging his leadership of the agency.

Bernhardt’s efforts, beginning in at least October 2017, included shaping the department's response to a key portion of a water infrastructure law he had helped pass as a lobbyist for California farmers, recently released calendars show. The department offered scant details at the time about meetings that Bernhardt, then the deputy secretary, held with Interior officials overseeing water deliveries to the farmers, leading many observers to believe he was steering clear of the issues he had previously lobbied on.

Story Continued Below

But newly disclosed schedule ""cards"" prepared by Interior officials for Bernhardt show more than three dozen meetings with key players on California water issues, including multiple lengthy meetings on specific endangered species protections at the heart of his previous work. Those appointments were only vaguely identified on his official calendars.

Interior's inspector general is probing whether Bernhardt violated ethics rules by working on policies he had pushed as a lobbyist for the Westlands Water District, a job that earned his former firm more than $1.3 million in the five years before he returned to government service.

Bernhardt's ethics agreement barred him from participating in any ""particular matters"" involving Westlands until August 2018, one year after he arrived at the agency, and it was only after that recusal period ended that then-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke publicly tasked him with working on California water issues. But the newly released information shows that Bernhardt had weighed in on discussions around Westlands' policy priorities for nearly a year by that point.

""They were creating the perception that he was not involved in these issues that his former client had a major stake in, when we now know he was deeply involved in them,” said Doug Obegi, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council who works on California water issues.

One previously undisclosed meeting likely to draw new scrutiny is a fall 2017 briefing on the implementation of the very provision of water law he won for the agricultural district after years of lobbying. The meeting adds to issues around Bernhardt's relationship with Westlands that have been flagged to the inspector general by outside groups like the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog, and congressional Democrats.

""I think with this calendar entry saying that he sat in on a meeting that is actually implementing the precise regulation that he lobbied on, I mean, that is really, really problematic,"" said Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel for the Campaign Legal Center. ""You cannot participate in the development, the implementation, the interpretation, the application of the regulation in individual cases if you lobbied on it prior to joining government.""

Interior argues Bernhardt handled ethical matters diligently, and that information about Bernhardt’s meetings, including numerous ones with industry officials, was kept off his official calendars due to security concerns, scheduling and convenience.

“Secretary Bernhardt is in complete compliance with his ethics agreement and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations,” spokesperson Faith Vander Voort said in a statement.

Transparency issues have dogged Bernhardt, who won Senate confirmation as secretary on April 11. Environmental groups and Democrats charge that the former lobbyist for energy and agricultural interests has failed to disclose who he has met with while shaping policy.

The National Archives and Records Administration has an ongoing investigation into whether the department violated the Federal Records Act by failing to keep detailed records of his meetings and actions.

From 2011 to 2016, Bernhardt lobbied Congress on various iterations of drought legislation aimed at relaxing endangered species protections that restrict pumping from California’s main water hub, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, to farms and cities in central and southern California. Westlands, which delivers water to about 700 farmers in California's Central Valley, holds junior water rights on the federal water project and is among the first to see its deliveries curtailed when supplies are low. For that reason, the changes stood to benefit its farmers disproportionately.

Bernhardt deregistered as the group’s lobbyist in November 2016, although records show he continued to advise Westlands on legislation and other legal matters through at least April 2017 — the month President Donald Trump nominated him to be deputy secretary.

The final version of the drought legislation Bernhardt had lobbied on passed in December of 2016 as part of a broader water infrastructure bill, with the key California provisions directing Interior to take a looser interpretation of existing endangered species protections for a five year period.

Shortly after being confirmed as deputy interior secretary in July 2017, Bernhardt launched work on a process on the same endangered species and pumping issues that could bring an even bigger and longer-lasting win for Westlands.

In October 2017, Bernhardt's calendars show he had begun directing a series of specific steps to rewrite the underlying protections for the Delta smelt, a 3-inch-long fish that lives only in the Bay-Delta and which scientists say is teetering on the brink of extinction in large part because of water pumping. He also directed a rewrite of protections for winter-run Chinook salmon, which also restrict water exports. Those changes are aimed at cementing far looser species protections than the drought bill secured, and for years going forward.

Although Bernhardt was recused from working on “particular matters” affecting Westlands until August 2018, agency ethics officials gave him verbal approval to work on some issues that affect the agricultural district before then, including endangered species protections. But written guidance from the ethics officials did not come until this past February, more than a year after his calendars indicate he began work on those issues, and several days after a New York Times report on his involvement in Westlands-related policies.

The Interior Department ethics officials concluded that Bernhardt did not have to recuse himself from the process for rewriting endangered species protections. It said the steps he directed Interior to take were not “particular matters” because they affect parties beyond just Westlands.

But independent ethics officials disagree.

Virginia Canter, a long-time federal ethics attorney who now serves as chief ethics counsel at the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said it does not appear that ethics officials got all the necessary details about Bernhardt’s work for Westlands before drafting what she described as a “very generic” memo.

She argued that the lack of detailed analysis in the ethics memo means it will offer Bernhardt less of a shield in the inspector general's investigation.

“This is a complicated issue,” she said. “If he was relying in good faith on advice of an ethics official, there should be evidence of what advice he was given. It should have been documented either in a memo to him or a memo in the ethics department’s files. They have produced none of that evidence.”

The Interior ethics officials determined that the overall infrastructure bill does not qualify as a ""particular matter."" But Canter said that the fact that the drought provisions had previously been in stand-alone bills means they may have qualified as “particular matters” from which Bernhardt should be recused.

That Bernhardt could go, in less than a year, from lobbying on a specific provision for a client to directing its implementation “seems to undercut the very purpose of the ethics pledge,” Canter said.

Indeed, Bernhardt's calendars indicate he was directly involved in the provision's implementation, with a Nov. 22, 2017 briefing on “WIIN Act Winter Operations.” The highly controversial California drought provision governs pumping operations in the Delta during heavy rains, which occur primarily in the winter in California.

And while much of Westlands’ federal lobbying has focused on endangered species protections and Delta pumping operations, the district also has an interest in a number of other, interrelated California water issues in which Bernhardt has played a role. Those include former Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposal to build a pair of massive tunnels under the Delta, the coordination of federal and state water project operations and a state plan to improve Delta water quality by requiring farms and cities to leave more water in the rivers.

Interior and state officials announced a grand bargain on some of these issues in late December, including a deal allowing the federal water project — which delivers water to Westlands and other largely agricultural users — to pump as much as 65 billion gallons more from the Delta, while requiring the state project — which serves largely municipal users — to pump an equal amount less.

The calendars also show that Bernhardt met with at least one Westlands farmer, Mark Turmon of Sierra Valley Almonds. That meeting, on Feb. 12, 2018, was about fires, Vander Voort said.

Another meeting, with former Westlands Board President Jean Sagouspe, appears on the calendars two weeks later, although both Interior and Sagouspe say it was canceled. Instead, Sagouspe said he met with Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Brenda Burman and Jason Larrabee, the political official overseeing the Fish and Wildlife Service — two key officials in the smelt protection rollbacks.

In February 2017, Sagouspe, a co-owner of Sierra Valley Almonds, published a column in the Wall Street Journal criticizing the “scorched-earth campaign by environmentalists” that restricts water deliveries to his farm. That column was published one day before Bernhardt, described as a member of the Trump transition team, spoke at a meeting of The Steamboat Institute, on whose board Sagouspe sits.

Letter from Justice Department on why it won't comply with House subpoena over citizenship question on census,https://www.cnn.com,[],04-24-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/politics/doj-letter-to-cummings/index.html,"The Justice Department has informed the House Oversight Committee that it will not comply with a subpoena demanding the appearance of an official as part of the Democrats' probe into the addition of a citizenship question on the census, according to a letter obtained by CNN."
Supreme Court Census Case Could Decide the 2024 Election,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Jay Michaelson'],04-23-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/department-of-commerce-v-new-york-supreme-court-case-could-decide-2024-election-9,"Update: At oral arguments Tuesday, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh, the two potential swing votes in the census case, both indicated that they were inclined to accept the administration's proffered rationale: that the citizenship question is necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act. If that holds, the citizenship question will almost certainly be retained.

If the Trump administration succeeds in adding the question “Are you a U.S. Citizen?” to the 2020 census, the Census Bureau estimates that 6.5 million people won’t respond to the census at all.

Most of those will be Hispanics or people with immigrants in their families who are fearful of exposing themselves or their family members to deportation, investigation, or worse. According to a Harvard University study, between 7.7 and 9.1 percent of Hispanics will skip the census entirely.

And that, in turn, will lead to fewer representatives in the House from states with large Hispanic populations—like California, New York, Illinois, Arizona, and Texas—and, accordingly, fewer electors in the electoral college to choose a president.

It’s no exaggeration to say that the 2024 election could be decided on the basis of this census question.

That’s what’s at stake Tuesday as the Supreme Court takes up the case of Department of Commerce v. New York, representing four challenges to the citizenship question.

As we’ve learned over the course of those lawsuits, these anti-democratic effects of the question aren’t unintended consequences: they’re the whole reason it’s in there. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, whose department oversees the census, lied about the reasons for the change, failed to follow the law on making it, and illegally ignored the opinion of the Census Bureau itself, which urged him against it.

If true (as several lower courts have found), these are violations both of administrative law and of Article I, Sections 1 and 2 of the Constitution, which provides that for the purposes of determining congressional representation, “The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.""

The “Enumeration Clause,” as it is known, has been held to require the government to get the best count possible. Here, however, Ross and his minions went against the advice of their own department, their own experts, and five previous directors of the census bureau (Republicans and Democrats alike), who said that the citizenship question would lead to an inaccurate count of how many people reside in the United States.

“The Census Bureau’s own analysis showed lower response rates, but Ross ignored them,” said Professor Jennifer Nou on a briefing call held by the American Constitution Society. “He either refused to consider evidence in the record, or actually falsified the record.”

As Ohio State University law professor Daniel Tokaji put it on the same call, “The record shows that he decided what he wanted to do first, and then came up with a pretext later.”

“ The Constitution requires that all people be counted. ”

Ross has also baldly lied about the process by which the question was added. In March, 2018, he testified that the Department of Justice asked him to make the change so that they could better enforce the Voting Rights Act.

Turns out, that was false. In fact, Ross had asked DOJ send the letter to justify the policy change, and the real sources of the proposal were White House advisers Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach. (Ross also lied under oath about meeting Bannon and Kobach at all.) It was politics, in other words, engineered by two of the most ardent ethno-nationalists in the Trump White House.

The claims about the Voting Rights Act were just a pretext—a ruse. Which makes sense, because, as amicus briefs filed in Department of Commerce v. New York discuss in detail, there is absolutely no rational connection between a citizenship question and the Voting Rights Act.

In fact, the flimsiness of the pretext may be dispositive in the case. The Department of Commerce, like other administrative agencies, enjoys wide discretion under the Census Act—in which Congress delegated its constitutional responsibilities to the executive branch. Courts will not overturn an agency’s action simply because they think there’s a better way.

But if there is simply no conceivable relationship between the decision and its reason, that would fail even a deferential standard of review.

Professor Tokaji said the Voting Rights Act reason is “totally not true, which is why all three lower courts found that to be the case.”

In other words, even if it can’t be proven that Ross added the question for a discriminatory reason, if the reason he offers makes no sense whatsoever, and he blatantly ignored administrative law requirements in making it, that is enough for the question to be removed.

Again, the Constitution requires that all people be counted. If the Commerce Department changes the form in a way that leads to a worse count, that’s a violation of its statutory and constitutional mission.

Ironically, the Trump administration and conservative amicus groups are making the opposite argument in the census case from the one they made just a few weeks ago, in a case about deference to agency decisions. In Kisor v. Wilkie, they argued that agency decisions don’t deserve much deference—part of their overall effort to “roll back the administrative state.” Now, however, they argue that Secretary Ross deserves all kinds of deference, even if he failed to follow the law and clearly acted against his constitutional mandate.

The outcome of this case—congressional representation for ten years, electoral votes in the 2024 presidential election, and over $900 billion of federal aid that’s disbursed according to population—may come down, as many recent Supreme Court cases have, to that very question.

And recent cases have been all over the place.

Most infamously, in Trump v. Hawaii, Chief Justice Roberts allowed the so-called “travel ban” to stand, notwithstanding Trump’s countless promises to ban Muslims from entering the country, because the State Department came up with other reasons for the ban that didn’t discriminate on the basis of religion.

And more recently, the Supreme Court took the government at its word that transgender soldiers are a danger to the military, even though a yearlong Defense Department study showed that they weren’t, because a much shorter study slapped together by the Trump administration said so.

On the other hand, just two years ago, the Court struck down a Texas law requiring abortion clinics to have all sorts of unnecessary equipment and certifications, finding that Texas’s proffered reasons had no relationship to reality.

Interestingly, Professor Nou noted that the Trump administration has a far worse record in such cases than usual. Normally, Nou said, the government wins about 60% of cases reviewing agency decisions. “This administration is winning about six percent.”

That order of magnitude difference is a shocking statistic, but one that suggests that courts are doing their jobs. When it’s taken to court, suddenly the anti-science and anti-truth Trump administration bangs into reality. One can only hope, for the sake of the integrity of the electoral process, that reality wins this week."
Does the Vice Presidency Give Joe Biden an Advantage in the Race to the Top? Here’s How VPs Before Him Fared,http://time.com,['Olivia B. Waxman'],,,,http://time.com/5549797/joe-biden-president-2020-history/,"Capping off months of speculation and concern, the 47th Vice President of the United States Joseph R. Biden announced Thursday morning that he will join the 2020 race for the Democratic Party nomination for President. He thus joins a small club of people who have held the role of VP and made a run for the top.

And if Joe Biden is successful, he’ll join an even smaller club: So far in American history, Richard Nixon has been the only example of a Vice President successfully running for President after time has passed since he was Vice President.

Here’s what to know about where Biden’s run fits into that history — and how being VP can help and hurt a candidate — from an expert on the history of the vice presidency. Joel K. Goldstein is the author of The Modern American Vice Presidency: The Transformation of a Political Institution and The White House Vice Presidency: The Path to Significance, Mondale to Biden. He spoke to TIME in advance of Biden’s announcement.

TIME: What kind of historical parallels does Biden running for President in 2020 bring to mind?

GOLDSTEIN: I don’t really see a precise historical parallel. Nixon had run as a sitting VP in 1960 and almost beat Kennedy; then he runs for California Governor and loses. Then he makes a comeback and defeats a sitting Vice President, Hubert Humphrey. In 1984, Walter Mondale ran against a popular President [Reagan] who has much broader appeal than Trump did and Mondale had the baggage, the perception of 21% interest rates during the Carter administration. Then you have Dan Quayle who had abbreviated runs in 1996 and in 2000; in one instance he was sidelined by health problems but he really wasn’t getting much traction. But he and Bush had lost in ’92, so Quayle wasn’t perceived in the same way Biden is.

Biden is a former Vice President who served with a popular President — one who leaves office as a popular President — doesn’t run, and then runs four years later. And he has the unusual situation of his son’s illness and death, and the way he persevered. In modern times, if the President is popular, and even if he isn’t, the Vice Presidency tends to be a stepping stone. It was for Nixon, though that was a different nominating system.

How did the change in the process for nominating presidential candidates impact a former Vice President’s ability to run for President?

Before 1972, the nominations on both sides were pretty much controlled by party leaders. So in the world in which Nixon ran in ’60 or Humphrey in ’68, they were nominated not because they did well in the primaries or the caucuses, but because they were popular among party leaders who controlled state delegations. But that whole system changed in ’72, so it makes the Vice President more challengeable.

It sounds as if you’re saying the distance between Nixon’s time as Vice President and the time he was elected President in 1968 may have helped him.

I think that was one of the things that was helpful for Nixon, having the time [so] he can present himself as not just Eisenhower’s number two. But the Julie [Nixon]-David [Eisenhower] romance during the campaign brought back the Eisenhower ties in a way that was probably helpful to Nixon. And then there’s the disaster of the Vietnam War, and the fact that the Republican party is sort of split and Nixon runs as a centrist who can unite the party.

It’s hard for a party to win three straight times, a problem faced when a Vice President is running immediately to succeed the President he or she serves with. You’re limited. You can’t very well criticize, or it’s hard to set yourself apart from the President, hard to position yourself as a leader. When a former Vice President runs after a gap during which the party has been thrown out of office, like Mondale in ’84 and Quayle in ’96, there’s a certain amount of baggage since the administration is viewed negatively. Biden doesn’t have that problem since he and Obama left office very popular and Biden never sacrificed his brand as Vice President.

How do Vice Presidents who run for President typically fare?

The office has changed so much [since] Chester Arthur and Garret Hobart. If you ask how do [vice presidents’ presidential campaigns] normally turn out in history, well, then the statistic is that 14 Vice Presidents have become President. Nine became President by succession — eight after the deaths of Presidents, and one after a President resigned — and four sitting Vice Presidents were elected [John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren and George H.W. Bush]. Nixon was a non-sitting Vice President who got elected.

If you combine the four sitting vice presidents who were elected president and Richard Nixon in 1968, a former vice president who was also elected, five vice presidents first became president through election in addition to the nine who succeeded to the office following the death or, in one case, resignation of their predecessor. In addition, in recent times three other sitting vice presidents — Nixon in 1960, Hubert Humphrey in 1968 and Al Gore in 2000 — lost in very close races.

The statistic that only four out of 47 vice presidents ran and were elected when they were sitting vice presidents is really misleading because a bunch of vice presidents die and a bunch get blocked by incumbent presidents who ran for re-election and lost, so it wasn’t really possible for the sitting VP to be elected, [for example] Hoover-Curtis, Carter-Mondale, Bush-Quayle. (With Pence, there have been 48 vice presidents, although he hasn’t had a chance to run.) So it’s not really fair to say a lot of sitting Vice Presidents don’t get elected because a lot of times they don’t really have a chance to run. I think the Vice Presidency is the best stepping stone, but it’s not a guarantee.

What qualities of the vice presidency make it easier or harder for someone in that position to run for President?

The office has changed a lot. Vice Presidents are doing a lot of political events, traveling over the country, all over the world, and becoming really involved in national security matters. The political role comes with visibility. You look at when Biden’s a Senator — the number of people who don’t have an opinion or don’t know anything about him is pretty high. Nixon in the 1950s saw the Vice Presidency as a way he could move forward. Eisenhower wanted to be above politics, so Nixon was the political guy who really leveraged it. Since Mondale became part of presidential decision-making and a close presidential advisor, Vice Presidents have gotten used to dealing with policy and making choices in a pretty serious way.

If a Vice President serves with an unpopular president, they inherit the baggage of that term. That’s a problem Hubert Humphrey had in ’68 [over the Vietnam War] and that Mondale had in ’84. Ronald Reagan could run against Mondale and blame him for 21% interest rates under Jimmy Carter and for the Iran hostage crisis. The other problem of being a sitting Vice President who runs for President is you’re perceived as the number two. When people look for a Presidential candidate, they want to see a number one.

Emerging from the shadows isn’t as much of a problem for a former Vice President. Vice Presidents go from being number two to the President, to being the leading figure of party who is eligible to run next time. Nixon runs in ’68 with experience as a statesman other people didn’t have.

Are there any myths or misconceptions about the vice presidency’s impact on a candidate’s chances?

People will say, “Biden has run twice before and he hasn’t done well.” But that’s true of a lot of people. Lyndon Johnson lost the race for the Democratic nomination for president in 1960. Then he [is picked to be John F. Kennedy’s Vice President and] becomes President by succession and wins in a landslide in 1964. The springboard benefit of being VP is really considerable. I imagine if you asked the Democratic presidential candidates whether they would rather be running as a former Vice President or a Senator or former Governor or former member of Congress or a former mayor, I think probably every one of them would say the Vice President.

On Easter Sunday, a series of bombs exploded at churches and luxury hotels in the country, killing nearly 300. It was the deadliest series of attacks the South Asian island country had seen since a bloody civil war there ended a decade ago. Most of the attacks occurred in or around Colombo, the capital. The U.S. said “several” Americans were among the dead.
