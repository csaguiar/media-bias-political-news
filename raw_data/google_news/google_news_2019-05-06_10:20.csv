Pelosi: Trump needs to lose so decisively in 2020 that he won't challenge the results,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Frank Miles', 'Frank Miles Is A Reporter', 'Editor Covering Geopolitics', 'Military', 'Crime', 'Technology', 'Sports For Foxnews.Com. His Email Is Frank.Miles Foxnews.Com.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pelosi-trump-lose-decisively-2020-challenge-results,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is worried President Trump might not step down if defeated in 2020, according to a report published Saturday.

“We have to inoculate against that, we have to be prepared for that,” she told The New York Times.

She urged the Democrats to win the debate that matters most to many voters inside the party: electability. “Own the center-left, own the mainstream,” she said.

Pelosi also said that in order to beat Trump, liberals have to play at his level, and the best way to do that is to win big, so he can’t challenge the results.

“If we win by four seats, by a thousand votes each, he’s not going to respect the election,” she said. “He would poison the public mind. He would challenge each of the races. He would say you can’t seat these people.”

Last Wednesday, Pelosi pushed out a statement taking aim at the Trump administration in the aftermath of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, blasting the president as “immoral, unethical, corrupt and unpatriotic.”

The statement kicked off by taking aim at Trump over his comments last week that he would “fight all the subpoenas,” accusing the president of “blanket, Unprecedented Stonewalling.""

“The President has made clear that he will broadly defy requests for information from Capitol Hill. Trump’s obstruction extends to Democrats’ inquiries on issues that address the challenges facing American families from the Administration’s efforts to sabotage Americans’ health care to its cruel family separation policy,” the statement read.

Trump told Fox News last Thursday that he would not allow former White House counsel Don McGahn or other administration officials to testify. “They've testified for many hours, all of them. I would say, it's done,” the president said. “Nobody has ever done what I've done. I've given total transparency. It's never happened before like this. They shouldn't be looking anymore. It's done.”

Goldman Sachs: Here's what could happen next with the US-China trade war,https://www.cnbc.com,['Weizhen Tan'],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/06/goldman-sachs-on-trumps-threat-of-trade-tariff-on-china.html,"U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of increased tariffs on Chinese goods is an indication that U.S.-China trade negotiations ""might have reached a sticking point,"" Goldman Sachs said on Sunday.

The bank said in a note that chances of a successful deal are now lower, but suggested that an increase in tariffs could still be avoided — especially if the Chinese delegation still attends its meeting with U.S. negotiators this week.

Referring to Trump's latest gambit, Goldman economists said: ""This represents a shift from the optimistic statements from US officials over the last few weeks and suggests that the probability of a near-term agreement is at least slightly lower than it seemed to be recently.""

U.S. officials had claimed in recent weeks that trade talks were going well, and sources had told CNBC that a deal was possible by this Friday. But major sticking points were said to remain, such as intellectual property theft and a disagreement as to whether tariffs should remain in place as a way to ensure Beijing sticks to its commitments.

Trump said in a Sunday afternoon Twitter post that the current 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods will rise to 25% on Friday. He also threatened to impose 25% levies on an additional $325 billion of Chinese goods ""shortly.""

Yet Goldman said it believes an agreement could still be reached, adding that it is still ""slightly"" more likely to happen than an increase in duties. It put the odds of a tariff escalation by the end of the week at 40% currently.

Investors will have a very clear signal to monitor, the bank added.

""The most important near-term indicator to watch will be whether the large delegation of Chinese officials comes to Washington on May 8, as scheduled. If they do, this would indicate that they believe a deal is still reasonably likely,"" Goldman said.

If both sides end up meeting after all, the tariff rate would rise only if they are unable to reach an agreement by Thursday — before the hike takes effect on Friday, it added.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He had planned to bring a large delegation to Washington on Wednesday to hash out a trade deal. But two sources briefed on the talks told CNBC the Chinese side may back out of this week's negotiations.

Goldman warned that could be a sign of an extended trade war: ""If the upcoming visit is canceled, an agreement in the coming week would then seem very unlikely. In such a scenario an increase in the tariff rate to 25% would become the base case.""

The U.S. imports goods from China totaling $539.5 billion and the trade deficit stood at $419.2 billion in 2018, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. If Trump follows through with his threats, virtually all goods imported from China to the U.S. would face some sort of tariff.

But there is still hope yet, as Trump has the power to ""walk the policy back through an executive order if negotiations progress favorably throughout the week,"" Goldman said.

Trump: 2 years of my term were ‘stollen’,https://www.politico.com,['Quint Forgey'],05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/05/trump-term-mueller-1302643,"""[T]hey have stollen two years of my (our) Presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back,"" President Donald Trump wrote online. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images White House Trump: 2 years of my term were ‘stollen’

President Donald Trump on Sunday floated the idea of extending his constitutionally limited time in office, complaining online that two years of his first White House term were “stollen” as a result of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.

“I now support reparations — Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term as pay back for time stolen by this corrupt failed coup,” Jerry Falwell Jr., a conservative religious leader and Trump ally, tweeted in a message reposted by the president.

Story Continued Below

Trump echoed Falwell’s sentiment in a pair of tweets an hour later, writing online : “Despite the tremendous success that I have had as President, including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history, they have stollen two years of my (our) Presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back.”

He added : “The Witch Hunt is over but we will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”

The president’s retweets regarding an extended stay in the Oval Office follow a New York Times report on Saturday in which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was concerned that Trump would refuse to give up power in 2020 if he lost reelection by a narrow margin.

The posts also feature implicit contradictions Trump has not hesitated to repeat since Mueller submitted his report to the Justice Department in March: that it was, at once, a partisan document conceived by “18 Trump Hating Angry Democrats,” as well as a “Total EXONERATION” for the White House."
"In Tiger Woods, Trump Finds a Hero and a Business Opportunity",https://www.nytimes.com,"['Annie Karni', 'Kevin Draper']",05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/us/politics/tiger-woods-trump-medal-of-freedom.html,"Mr. Woods has appeared happy to return the support. The day before the 2014 World Golf Championships-Cadillac Championship, Mr. Woods appeared with Mr. Trump and three of his children to inaugurate the Tiger Woods Villa at Doral.

“What Donald has done with this place is phenomenal, and he does nothing halfway,” Mr. Woods said at the ribbon-cutting. One month later, Mr. Woods announced the Tiger Woods Charity Playoffs, a series of nine charity golf tournaments for amateurs. One of the eight regional qualifiers was held at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J.

That year, Mr. Trump also announced that Mr. Woods would design a course for his Dubai property. While Mr. Woods’s team has tried to play down the business connection, arguing that the golfer’s contract was with the developer, DAMAC Properties, Mr. Trump has been eager to advertise Mr. Woods as his business partner. On Twitter, he has shared links that mention that the two men are “teaming up” and that Mr. Woods is “working for” Mr. Trump.

The course, which was expected to be completed by the end of 2017, has yet to open, however. Glenn Greenspan, the longtime spokesman for Mr. Woods, did not respond to a request to discuss their business ties.

Nonetheless, Mr. Trump has made it known over the years that he sees Mr. Woods as a great investment. “I want to sponsor those children,” he told Extra TV in 2013, when he was asked to weigh in on the romantic relationship between Mr. Woods and Lindsey Vonn, the champion World Cup ski racer. The two are no longer a couple.

And when Mr. Woods won a tournament at the Trump National Doral by two strokes that year, Mr. Trump used the moment to plug his course as one of the greatest in the world, promoting the victory — and himself — on Twitter and in an interview on “Fox & Friends.”

Mr. Woods has played golf with Mr. Trump at least three times since the pairing became a political statement: twice since Mr. Trump became president and once when he was the president-elect. Mr. Woods, who has taken some blowback for engaging with Mr. Trump, has argued that he is not a political person and simply respects the office of the president."
Trump Objects to Mueller Testifying Before Congress,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Michael Tackett', 'Maggie Haberman']",05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/05/us/politics/trump-mueller-testimony.html,"Two people close to Mr. Trump said he had been moving toward an objection to Mr. Mueller testifying over the last few days as a counter to the call from some Democrats to impeach Mr. Barr for how he handled his own testimony last week to Congress.

But some of Mr. Trump’s advisers have warned that he risks turning Mr. Mueller into a martyred figure if he demands that he not testify. Others close to the president say he is making a mistake for a different reason in trying to restrain Mr. Mueller.

The special counsel, they say, would most likely face tough questions from Republicans about two F.B.I. officials, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, who in text exchanges were deeply critical of Mr. Trump as they were investigating Russian interference in the election. Those questions would undercut Mr. Mueller’s investigation, those close to the president say, and allow them to paint it as a partisan attack on Mr. Trump.

Mr. Barr, during a hearing about the report before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, was pressed on whether Mr. Mueller should be allowed to testify.

“I’ve already said publicly I have no objection to him testifying,” Mr. Barr responded.

By Sunday, the president did have an objection. “Are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion?” Mr. Trump tweeted. “There was no crime, except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the Report), and NO OBSTRUCTION.”

Democrats say it is essential to hear from Mr. Mueller given the friction between the special counsel’s office and Mr. Barr over how the report has been characterized.

After Mr. Mueller delivered his report to Mr. Barr in March, the attorney general issued a four-page summary in which he said there was no finding of collusion between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia. But he also quoted Mr. Mueller saying he could not exonerate the president on the obstruction issue."

The offshore Chinese yuan also declined to 6.7790 against the dollar, from highs of around 6.72 last week. Its onshore counterpart changed hands at 6.7655 against the greenback, from around 6.73 last week.

Trump said in a tweet Sunday afternoon that the current 10% levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods will rise to 25% on Friday. He also threatened to impose 25% tariffs on an additional $325 billion of Chinese goods ""shortly.""

Meanwhile, China is considering canceling its trade talks with the U.S. this week in light of Trump's latest threats, sources told CNBC.

""President Trump set the tone for the new week expressing dissatisfaction at the pace of China trade negotiations amid Beijing's attempt to renegotiate,"" Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank, wrote in a morning note.

""An increase in tariffs would be bad news for risk assets and would (threaten) the prospect of a global growth recovery,"" Catril said.

""This is reckless ... most people thought we'd get something by the end of May,"" said Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments.

""There's a risk this tactic could blow up on him. I don't think the Chinese would like to get bullied,"" Valliere said."
Devin Nunes: Clinton 'dirt' tipster Joseph Mifsud has ties to State Department,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-clinton-dirt-tipster-joseph-mifsud-has-ties-to-state-department,"Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud — the man who told former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos the Russians had thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails — likely has links to ""U.S., British, and Italian intelligence services"" and the State Department where Clinton served as the country's top diplomat.

Mifsud, a London-based professor and former Maltese diplomat, has long been suspected of deep ties to Russian intelligence. He is an elusive figure who has stayed out of the spotlight and is the subject of a letter Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee ranking member, sent to U.S. intelligence agencies and the State Department on Friday seeking relevant documents.

Nunes told Fox News on Sunday there were many questions that arose from special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, which his letter said “omits any mention of a wide range of contacts Mifsud had with Western political institutions and individuals,"" that still need to be answered.

""They can't even tell us who Joseph Mifsud is,"" he told host Maria Bartiromo, adding, ""We believe he has ties to the State Department."" He noted how in 2017 Mifsud attended an event at the U.S. Capitol hosted by Global Ties U.S., a nonprofit group that partners with the State Department and featured ambassadors and U.S. congressmen at the event.

Nunes' letter also photographs of Mifsud in close proximity to Western officials at events hosted by Rome-based Link University Campus, where Mifsud taught.

Mueller's 448-page report, released last month with redactions, states that Mifsud traveled to Moscow in April 2016, after which he met Papadopoulos in London. It was at this meeting that Mifsud informed Papadopoulos that during his trip he learned that the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, who served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and was President Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos later repeated this claim to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who informed the FBI and prompted the original counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign in July 2016.

Although Mueller's team portrayed Mifsud as a Russian asset with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Nunes said the team decided to""cherry pick"" information from news reports, leaving out that he was described as a Western intelligence asset. ""It seems like Mifsud has an awful lot of ties to U.S., British, and Italian intelligence services,"" Nunes said.

The FBI spoke with Mifsud in early February 2017, and believe he left the U.S. on Feb. 11. The FBI accused Papadopoulos of misleading the bureau about his communications with Mifsud in January 2017, which they alleged ""undermined investigators’ ability to challenge the Professor [Mifsud] or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States.""

As part of Mueller’s Russia investigation, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and served 12 days in prison late last year.

Papadopoulos, who also was contacted by FBI assets during the 2016 campaign, including informant Stefan Halper, now feels he could have been the target of entrapment.

Appearing on Fox News before Nunes, he said he got caught in a ""perjury trap."" He also said he is ""pretty sure there are a lot of recordings and transcripts between myself and a lot of these assets and I'm very hopeful that these are going to get public soon.""

Nunes said his letter to U.S. intelligence agencies and the State Department seeks ""all of the underlying information,"" adding, ""so if the FBI does in fact have transcripts of Papadopoulos talking to anyone, whether it's Mifsud, or Downer, or whoever, I think Congress and the American people have the right to know this.""

In his letter, Nunes asks Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel, FBI Director Christopher Wray, National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to hand over all documents they have on Mifsud by May 10."
‘My dad died at their hands’: WWII vet fatally injured in VA nursing home,https://www.usatoday.com,"['Donovan Slack', 'Published A.M. Et May']",05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/04/veteran-death-after-traumatic-injury-in-va-nursing-home/3402591002/,"CLOSE Surveillance video captured the deadly blow to the head of 91-year-old James “Milt” Ferguson Sr. Specialists say it could have been prevented. USA TODAY

Jim Ferguson wanted answers.

How was his 91-year-old father, who served in the U.S. Navy in World War II, fatally injured in a Veterans Affairs nursing home, the institution Ferguson had entrusted to care for him?

Huddled around a computer monitor with managers at the VA in Des Moines, Iowa, Ferguson watched a hallway surveillance video that depicted a chilling blow to his father's head.

“I lost it,” Ferguson told USA TODAY. “I broke down.”

In the video, James “Milt” Ferguson Sr., who had dementia and was legally blind, appears confused. He opens a hallway door, rolls his wheelchair into another resident’s room, then wheels back out. No staff members are visible. He circles around and heads back into the room.

Halfway through the door, his chair flips over backwards. Milt Ferguson crashes to the floor, landing on the back of his head. Ferguson said he was told the chair was pushed over by the resident in the room, who can't be seen in the video. As staff members rush to assist him, Ferguson is able to turn over and sit up, but the impact causes a massive brain bleed that will kill him within days.

What later would turn the son’s despair into outrage was what he learned about events leading up to his father wheeling around unsupervised last December, and what happened after he smashed into the floor.

“It’s like my dad died at their hands,” Ferguson said.

Serious problems with resident care have occurred in many VA nursing homes across the nation, including the one where Ferguson was being cared for.

USA TODAY reported in March that inspections by a private contractor hired by the VA found deficiencies that caused ""actual harm"" to veterans at more than half of the 99 VA nursing homes reviewed. The inspections found inadequate supervision or hazardous conditions at 53 of them.

In Des Moines – which received the lowest one star out of five in the VA's own ratings, based on surprise inspections – inspectors found managers did not ensure staff treated residents with dignity or followed basic infection-control and prevention measures.

The story of what happened to James Ferguson in Des Moines provides a deeper picture of the care one elderly veteran received. Medical records provided to USA TODAY by his son and legal guardian outline what specialists say was a concerning series of decisions by VA staff, before and after his deadly head injury.

Nine days before, VA caregivers determined Ferguson was a danger to himself and others because his dementia caused him to wander around, agitated. They had him on continuous one-on-one observation with an aide, but took him off the strict monitoring when he entered the VA nursing home. There, staff didn't reinstate the heightened observation, despite his repeatedly straying dangerously into other residents' rooms.

After his injury, staff put him back in his wheelchair but did not report the incident to a supervisor for 40 minutes, the records and surveillance video indicate. Ferguson wasn't transported to an emergency room for two hours after that. Then, it took 2½ hours more to send him to a trauma hospital. The time stamp on the video showed the fall occurred at 3:49 p.m. and it wasn't until just before 9 p.m. that Ferguson was transported to the trauma facility.

'A disaster waiting to happen'

Specialists who reviewed Ferguson's medical records at the request of USA TODAY expressed concern about the quality of his care.

""It was definitely a disaster waiting to happen, and it did,"" said Robyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a Washington-based nonprofit advocacy organization.

""I just am really struck by the predictability with his repeated episodes of going into other people's rooms,"" she said. ""They should have had some intervention so they could provide him with adequate supervision and address the wandering.""

Grant said the length of time it took afterward to adequately evaluate and diagnose the severity of his injury and get him to a trauma facility also raises questions. ""What was happening there, in terms of those delays?"" she said.

VA nursing homes: Feds find 'blatant disregard' for veteran safety

Richard Mollot, executive director since 2005 of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a New York City-based nonprofit advocate of nursing home care improvement, said the shortfalls indicate there was ""very likely"" a lack of skilled or adequately trained staff to meet his needs.

""The point of being in that environment is that you have skilled nursing care and monitoring,"" he said.

Mollot said the reporting delay is particularly concerning. ""How often does this happen that no one's looking at? That's what is so upsetting.""

'All staff acted properly'

A spokesman for the Des Moines VA, Timothy Hippen, said in a statement that a review after the ""untimely death"" concluded ""all staff acted properly.""

""Any time an unexpected death occurs, VA Central Iowa Health Care System reviews its policies and procedures to see if changes are warranted,"" he said. ""We did that here, finding that all staff acted properly.""

In response to questions about the case, national VA spokesman Curt Cashour accused USA TODAY of focusing on ""isolated complaints"" and ""cherry-picking the experiences of a handful of veterans to create the impression of a broad problem.""

Cashour maintained that, overall, VA nursing homes ""compare closely"" with non-VA facilities. More than 40,000 veterans rely on care at the agency’s 134 nursing facilities each year.

USA TODAY reported last year that about 70% of VA nursing homes scored worse than non-VA nursing homes on a majority of quality indicators tracked by the agency, which include rates of infection, serious pain and bed sores.

Hippen declined to respond to detailed questions about Ferguson's case.

""We will not be addressing the specifics of this case publicly, but we have been in direct contact with the veteran’s family to discuss their concerns,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson said he remains upset even though VA officials shared the surveillance video with him and said they were sorry about what happened to his father.

He wants VA staff held accountable. He wants to make sure policies are in place so it doesn't happen to anyone else.

“No one should live their life like that and have what happened to him in the end,” he said. “I want this to be the last person this happens to.”

A gambler called ‘booger’

Even as his dementia worsened, Milt Ferguson flashed glimmers of his younger self.

The former deckhand on the heavy cruiser U.S.S. Pensacola was affectionately known as “booger” at the Des Moines Register, where he worked bundling newspapers for 23 years before retiring in 1995. He loved to play the slots and the horses.

On a note in his medical record, a nurse practitioner wrote: “Patient laughs when his nickname is mentioned.” Jim Ferguson had come for a visit that day, as he did most days. “He was smiling and appeared to be enjoying his son’s company,” the medical record said.

The decision to place him in a nursing home had been a gut-wrenching one, Ferguson said. He had moved in with his parents and cared for them for three years. But in April 2018 his mother died. He said a VA social worker told him his father needed more intensive, round-the-clock care and supervision.

“They made it sound like, well, if he got hurt, I could be charged with a crime,” Ferguson said. “So that’s when I decided to place him in a nursing home.”

‘His dementia was acting up’

Ferguson moved his father to Bishop Drumm Retirement Center, a private facility just outside Des Moines, where his mother worked as a nursing assistant in the Alzheimer’s unit for more than 20 years before retiring.

The center took in Milt Ferguson last August. But three months later, his condition worsened.

""The day before Thanksgiving, I got a call from Bishop Drumm – his dementia was acting up,"" his son said.

He hit two staff members, was “agitated all day” and was “wandering into other residents room(s), causing distress,” a nurse later noted in his medical record. “He is generally ‘sweet’ so this is a departure from his usual behavior.”

Ferguson was taken by ambulance to the Des Moines VA Medical Center, where he was admitted to the acute psychiatry ward. He was put on one-on-one observation with a sitter – an aide tasked with intervening if he lashed out or tried to stray into other patients’ rooms.

They adjusted his medications, and, after a few aggressive outbursts, he appeared calm enough after three weeks to transfer into the VA nursing home on the medical center’s campus.

But there was a catch, a psychiatric nurse wrote in his record: ""Veterans are not put on sitter status over there.""

‘Help me, help me’

After a 22-hour trial period without a sitter, Milt Ferguson moved in to the VA nursing home.

Problems began within hours.

He hardly slept, he hallucinated, he called out ""help me, help me"" over and over again. He was agitated and again, he ""wandered into and out of peers rooms"" day after day, nursing staff wrote in his record.

They gave him medication. Sometimes he calmed down. Sometimes he didn’t.

A psychiatrist was managing his case remotely. According to public records, the doctor worked at a VA facility a few hours away in Lincoln, Nebraska. Through virtual appointments, the psychiatrist advised changes to Ferguson's medication.

On December 19, a week after Ferguson moved in, nursing home staff noted he was still restless and anxious, pacing and screaming and yelling. His care team – psychiatrist, primary care doctor, nursing staff and social workers – met to discuss the case.

The psychiatrist said a review of his records showed ""increased confusion with wandering"" during the past week. The doctor prescribed higher dosages of a mood-stabilizing drug and a sedative. There was no discussion of closer supervision or reinstatement of one-on-one observation, the records show.

“Will ask RN to contact this MD in one week with update,” the psychiatrist wrote.

By then, Ferguson would be dead.

‘A golf ball-sized lump’

On December 20, when two aides rushed to help Milt Ferguson, his head on the floor and legs crumpled to the side, the time stamp on the hallway surveillance video reads 3:49 p.m. But in a report filled out an hour later, a nurse recorded the time of the accident as 4:30 p.m.

His records do not indicate what the staff did with Ferguson during the 41 minutes in between, aside from putting him back in his wheelchair.

By that time, he had a “golf ball-sized lump on the back of his head.” The nurse notified the manager on duty, a nurse practitioner, who wrote at 5:06 p.m. that he had ordered an immediate CT scan of his head.

That didn’t happen until about 6:30 p.m., when Ferguson arrived in the emergency department of the medical center on the Des Moines VA campus, on a bed wheeled by a nursing home aide. The aide said Ferguson had earlier been taken for a CT scan but was uncooperative.

An emergency room doctor quickly had a sedative administered and the scan was completed. By that point, the World War II veteran had a “large bleed” in the back right side of his brain that was so acute, the CT report says his brain had shifted to the left inside his skull.

Sent 'to scanning’

The doctor notified MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center, a trauma hospital, at 7 p.m. For nearly two hours, the doctor tried to keep Ferguson comfortable and his blood pressure under control until an ambulance arrived and took Ferguson to Mercy at 8:55 p.m.

The doctor also kept calling Ferguson’s son, leaving voicemails.

But Jim Ferguson had himself been admitted to a hospital and had provided the VA nursing home with a consent form authorizing staff to contact a close friend if anything happened to his father. That form had been sent ""to scanning” that morning.

When Jim Ferguson retrieved all the voicemails, he rushed to Mercy the next morning.

""He was not responsive. He was laying on his bed, making this horrible noise as they sucked saliva out of his mouth,"" he said. ""I never even got to say any last words to my dad.""

He died the next day.

Specialists who reviewed the case at the request of USA TODAY singled out multiple shortfalls in his care at the VA that may have affected the outcome.

Grant, the policy director at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, said the 22-hour trial of having no sitter was ""not enough time to establish how he was doing.""

When he then acted out day after day, in agitation and confusion, they should not have allowed him to wander into other residents' rooms, she said. Such situations can cause the other residents to lash out in fear or distress and ""lead to an altercation or violence or striking out.""

""One would argue that could have been prevented,"" she said. ""There should have been somebody, somewhere who could have seen that this happened and – particularly when he wheeled himself – to have gone in and intervened, 'Let me help you, let's go to your room.'""

Mollot, the executive director at the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said meeting the standards of care means staff identifies risks and needs and ways to meet them and mitigate them and then does so consistently.

""This is exactly the kind of thing that happens when those standards are not followed,"" he said.

'A safe place'

The spokesman for the Des Moines VA, while declining to answer detailed questions about what happened, said that in general, ""caring for nursing home residents involves balancing patients’ independence with the need for supervision, as appropriate.""

""While tight scrutiny and strict limits on residents’ activities and freedom of movement could possibly lower the risk for adverse events, it would also severely degrade patients’ quality of life, which is precisely what we are trying to preserve for as long as possible,"" he said.

What William Barr misses about presidential accountability,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Bradley D. Hays', 'Bradley D. Hays Is An Associate Professor Of Political Science At Union College. His Scholarship Is On Constitutional Politics', 'History', 'May At Am']",05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/05/what-william-barr-misses-about-presidential-accountability/,"

Attorney General William P. Barr testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the special counsel report on Wednesday, May 1, 2019. (J. Scott Applewhite)

Bradley D. Hays is an associate professor of political science at Union College. His scholarship is on constitutional politics, history and development.

Last week, Attorney General William P. Barr testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee on his apparent attempt to whitewash special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s findings, particularly those related to potential obstruction of justice by President Trump. In the course of his defense, Barr said, “We have to stop using the criminal justice process as a political weapon.”

His statement echoed language that President George H.W. Bush used when announcing a controversial pardon in the final weeks of his presidency — after consultation with Barr, who was serving his first stint as attorney general. These statements make plain Barr’s view that prosecutorial investigations of executive officials are inherently partisan and, therefore, illegitimate under the rule of law. But this idea calls into question one of the central principles of the American constitutional system: executive accountability.

In Federalist 70, Alexander Hamilton trumpets the advantages of a unitary executive, that is, the notion that all executive branch authority rests with the president, rather than being divided up among different executive officers, as states such as Texas and New York do.

One of Hamilton’s central arguments was that a unitary executive increases accountability: The buck stops with the president. In a divided executive, it could be unclear whether the president or another executive officer should be held to account for unpopular, unscrupulous or unlawful actions. By making the president accountable for all such action, the people will know how to vote in future elections.

Notably, Hamilton’s ideas on accountability extend beyond the president paying at the ballot box for unpopular action. In Federalist 65, he clearly states that a president impeached for misconduct is also “liable to prosecution and punishment in the ordinary course of law.” In other words, the presidency was not designed to be free from prosecutorial inquiry.

Holding the president and other, subordinate executive branch officials to account was central to our constitutional design and the rule of law, part of the delicate compromise between those at the constitutional convention who wanted a weak executive and those who wanted a strong one.

Hamilton’s reasoning on executive accountability has featured prominently in the development of the concept over time. For example, the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously in Clinton v. Jones that the president is not immune from civil litigation due to the constitutional mandate of executive accountability. Indeed, such accountability was not only allowed, but may well have been necessary to protect the rule of law.

Barr, however, rejects this notion — and did so long before Donald Trump entered the political arena. On Christmas Eve 1992, Bush issued a pardon to former secretary of defense Caspar Weinberger for his role in the Iran-contra affair during the Reagan administration. In violation of U.S. law, Weinberger had allegedly facilitated the sale of American missiles to Iran to help fund the contras in Nicaragua. An independent counsel was appointed to investigate the scandal and a grand jury brought indictments on two counts of perjury and one count of obstructing justice. Weinberger protested the fairness of the indictments, but the evidence of wrongdoing was substantial. (Bush, who was vice president during the Iran-contra affair, was implicated but ultimately not indicted.)

When Bush explained his rationale for the pardon, he did not contest Weinberger’s likely guilt. Instead he praised Weinberger’s long record of service to the nation and his role in bringing down the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union.

Bush went further, though, not resting on Weinberger’s meritorious service alone. He pivoted to attack the prosecutions — 14 people associated with the Reagan administration were indicted, and 11 convicted — themselves as inconsistent with law’s necessary neutrality. Bush argued that the prosecutions represented “the criminalization of policy differences” and that “[t]hese differences should be addressed in the political arena, without the Damocles sword of criminality hanging over the heads of the combatants.” Reports at the time indicated that Bush worked closely on the pardon with Barr, which is unsurprising given the views Barr espoused last week.

Indeed, when reading this pardon in conjunction with Barr’s testimony, it's clear that Barr holds a narrow understanding of executive accountability. In both the cases of Weinberger and Trump, prosecutors statutorily shielded from partisan influences found substantial evidence that the figure in question obstructed justice.

Yet because the targets of the investigations were political actors and, ostensibly, the opposition party would benefit from a successful prosecution of them, Barr considers any such prosecution inherently partisan and ill-suited for the courts. In other words, any attempt to investigate whether presidential action was unlawful must be partisan and, therefore, is inappropriate for nonpartisan legal institutions. Instead, as Bush identified in the Weinberger pardon, “the proper forum” for executive accountability was the “voting booth, not the courtroom.”

But this essentially gives the president (and other executive officials) a blank check: Unless misconduct rises to the level of impeachment, or if the partisan realities in Congress render impeachment an impossibility, the president is essentially immune from sanction for breaking the law, at least until leaving office.

This is not how Hamilton and his fellow Founders envisioned the system working. Worried about an out-of-control executive, they aimed to create checks and balances — and accountability. Checks and balances and the rule of law are not just formal institutional arrangements, they are norms of governance that invigorate principles central to the American system of government. Accountability is even more crucial in 2019 than it was in 1787, given how much more power the president wields today than in the 18th and 19th centuries.

When an ideology like Barr’s undermines those norms, the system of accountability carefully crafted by Hamilton and his fellow Founders and developed over two centuries threatens to become unbalanced. The result is a president unmoored from the norms that tether the executive to lawful behavior. That risks the entire American constitutional structure crashing down, as the president asserts himself with little to fear until at least the next election. While executive power has advanced steadily throughout the 20th century, what Barr envisions would be another leap, putting the United States on dangerous ground. It is not too much to ask our presidents not to violate the law. And when they fail to meet that standard, the consequences should be swift and assured."

""We can use lots of different terms to describe what's taking place,"" Pompeo responded, again saying that he has spoken out about the camps.

The CBS host also pressed him on the number of people held in the camps, saying that the Pentagon put the number of people in the camps at 3 million.

Brennan later asked if human rights would be included in the trade deal with China.

Pompeo said the topic would not, but that they ""are going to be addressed.""

""We've done so,"" he added. ""I've raised it in multiple conversations with my counterpart their foreign minister and with others.""

DOJ Asks Courts To Lighten Up On Qualcomm As It Battles China For 5G Supremacy,https://dailycaller.com,"['Chris White', 'Energy Reporter']",05-03-2019,2019,5,https://dailycaller.com/2019/05/03/doj-qualcomm-technology/,"The Department of Justice wants the legal system to go lenient on Qualcomm as the telecommunications giant wrestles with a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit claiming the company is a monopoly.

“[I]n the event that the court finds liability on any of the FTC’s claims, the court should order additional briefing and hold a hearing on issues related to a remedy,” the DOJ said in a statement of interest filed in a U.S. district court in California. The court should be careful, the DOJ added, noting its concerns that a punishment could affect fifth generation mobile phone development.

“There is a plausible prospect that an overly broad remedy in this case could reduce competition and innovation in markets for 5G technology and downstream applications that rely on that technology,” the DOJ wrote Thursday. “Such an outcome could exceed the appropriate scope of an equitable antitrust remedy. Moreover, it has the distinct potential to harm rather than help competition.”

Officials are not happy with the lawsuit. Representatives with the Department of Defense, for instance, had sit-down discussions with the FTC in March to encourage the agency to stop suing Qualcomm. They argued that financial losses from a court defeat would hamper Qualcomm’s ability to compete with China’s top chip maker, Huawei.

Qualcomm’s legal troubles began in 2017 when Apple started complaining that some of the technology in the telecom’s patent bundle also is in its chips. In short, Qualcomm is getting paid twice for the same technology, Apple argued. The FTC sued Qualcomm in January 2017 as well over the same complicated reason.

Apple licensed Qualcomm’s technology for the iPhone, helping the phone maker break into the wireless industry. The decision allowed Apple to concentrate on making touchscreen computers and helped turn marketing genius Steve Jobs’ project into the most valuable company on Earth. (RELATED: DOD Officials Warn Trump Administration To Stop Hassling Giant 5G Developer)

The companies finally agreed in April to dismiss all litigation stemming from the disagreement, with both companies hammering out a six-year licensing agreement and a multiyear supply agreement. Apple will pay Qualcomm an unspecified amount, according to the companies’ statement.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is targeting Huawei, one of Qualcomm’s biggest competitors, in a seemingly unrelated matter. The DOD charged the Chinese telecommunications giant in January on several counts of fraud as President Donald Trump applies more pressure on China’s beleaguered economy.

Officials accused executive Meng Wanzhou of bank fraud, wire fraud and violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. Meng, the CFO of Huawei and daughter of the company’s founder, was arrested in December 2018 in Vancouver by the Canadian Justice Department. China warned Canada in December that it faces “severe consequences” if officials don’t release the executive.

Trump continues to press U.S. telecommunications companies to blow past China. “I want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible. It is far more powerful, faster, and smarter than the current standard,” the president told his Twitter followers in February.

FTC did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment and Qualcomm refused to make a statement.

Kamala Harris asks DOJ IG to probe whether Trump asked Barr to investigate political opponents,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-doj-ig-bar-trump-political-opponents,"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Friday sent a letter to the Department of Justice’s inspector general demanding he investigates whether the White House had urged Attorney General William Barr to investigate President Trump’s political opponents.

“In response to my questions during the [Senate Judiciary] hearing, Attorney General Barr proved unable or unwilling to state whether he had been directed to open investigations at the request or suggestion of the President or other White House officials -- an alarming response that strikes at the very heart of the rule of law and threatens to undermine the longstanding independence of the Justice Department,” she said in a letter to Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

“I request that the Office of the Inspector General investigate whether the Attorney General has received or acted upon such improper requests,” she said.

The letter comes days after Harris questioned Barr Tuesday at the Senate hearing over details in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report that noted instances where Trump had either suggested or called for the Department of Justice to investigate Hillary Clinton.

Harris quizzed Barr whether Trump or anyone at the White House had asked him to investigate anyone -- an exchange it detailed in its letter to Horowitz.

In that exchange, Harris asked: “Has the President or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?”

“I’m trying to grapple with the word ‘suggest.’ I mean, there have been discussions of, of matters out there that, uh—they have not asked me to open an investigation,” Barr said.

When Harris asked if anyone had hinted, suggested or inferred, Barr said he didn’t know. Harris’ letter describes Barr as “unable or unwilling to answer the question.”

“There must be no doubt that the Department of Justice and its leadership stand apart from partisan politics, and resist improper attempts to use the power of federal law enforcement to settle personal scores,” she wrote.

The letter is the latest pushback from Democrats against Barr since the release of the Mueller report. In particular, they have zeroed in on Barr’s handling of the report’s release, alleging that he is biased toward the president in his presentation of the report in his initial four-page summary of its conclusions.

Harris criticized Barr’s decision not to personally review the underlying evidence before concluding that there was not enough evidence to establish that the president had committed obstruction of justice. She joined a number of Democrats saying that Barr should resign.

""This Attorney General lacks all credibility and has I think compromised the American public's ability to believe that he is a purveyor of justice,"" she told reporters after the hearing.

DoJ Weighs in on FTC vs. Qcomm,https://www.eetimes.com,"['Rick Merritt', 'David', 'Finch']",,,,https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1334647,"By , 0

SAN JOSE, Calif. – The U.S. Department of Justice filed an unusual “statement of interest” in a suit against Qualcomm brought by the Federal Trade Commission, advising District Judge Lucy Koh to take caution in her pending ruling. The DoJ told Koh if she rules against Qualcomm she should hold a hearing and briefing, letting the company and potentially others argue about impact any punitive actions could have for the emerging 5G cellular market.

“Because an overly broad remedy could result in reduced innovation, with the potential to harm American consumers, this Court should hold a hearing and order additional briefing to determine a proper remedy that protects competition while working minimal harm to public and private interests,” said the seven-page statement signed by Andrew C. Finch, a principal deputy assistant attorney general.

“There is a plausible prospect that an overly broad remedy in this case could reduce competition and innovation in markets for 5G technology and downstream applications that rely on that technology. Such an outcome could exceed the appropriate scope of an equitable antitrust remedy. Moreover, it has the distinct potential to harm rather than help competition,” Finch wrote.

“This is a very surprising move by the DOJ. It is extremely rare for them to interfere in the Federal Trade Commission’s cases,” said Mark A. Lemley, a Stanford law professor who has followed the case.

In the San Jose case, the FTC asked the court to prohibit Qualcomm from requiring a patent license as a condition of selling its chips, a policy it said chilled competition. Qualcomm’s “no license, no chips” policy remains central to its licensing program that generates much of its corporate profits.

The judge’s decision in the FTC case could force Qualcomm to renegotiate some of its licensing deals and rates. It could also force it to license rival chip vendors with its standard-essential patents.

Testimony in the case ended in late January after generating a bookshelf worth of evidence binders. When the parties rested, Koh advised both sides she would need time significant time to review the evidence before ruling.

A decision is expected any day. However, Apple and Qualcomm, two of the main players in the dispute, settled their differences over cellular patents in mid-April.

Qualcomm reported this week it will book at least $4.5 billion in payments and released liabilities from Apple as a part of the deal which includes a multi-year product supply agreement.

In calling for a hearing on any Qualcomm punishment, the DoJ pointed to an appellate court’s decision in U.S. vs. Microsoft, an earlier antitrust suit. It said a “party has the right to judicial resolution of disputed facts not just as to the liability phase, but also as to appropriate relief,” something the judge in that case apparently did not provide.

“Remedies should not crush a tiger’s spirit; they should train, not tame. Among other things, this means that equitable remedies should not interfere with the defendant’s innovation incentives going forward,” Finch wrote, quoting one legal scholar.

The DoJ letter has a political element of the Trump Administration weighing in on a case originally brought under the Obama Administration, according to a Reuters report. FTC commissioners are currently divided over the case, in part because one commissioner had to recuse himself from the case due to having done work for Qualcomm, it said.

It’s an “odd situation for sure, with the DOJ weighing in and asking for ‘leniency’ from the judge, so to speak, in a suit brought by the FTC. It makes the whole thing look awfully partisan, given that the suit was brought by two Democratic Commissioners against the objections of the single Republican Commissioner at that time,” said Jennifer Rie, a senior antitrust litigation analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence who attended parts of the San Jose trial.

“We don't know why Qualcomm has not been able to reach a settlement with the FTC...The DOJ antitrust division chief has been pretty open about his disagreement with the suit and the approach taken by the FTC. It will be very interesting to see how this all plays out,” added Rie.

Did House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., just jump the shark? By stating unequivocally that Attorney General William Barr lied to Congress and adding, as if for emphasis, that it is a crime, Pelosi may have thought she was just getting in front of her herd of angry Democrats. But inadvertently, the speaker also revealed, in stark relief, a disturbing new trend in our politics: If you don't tell Congress what it wants to hear, then you are by default lying and, hence, a criminal.

By this logic, truth is no longer an absolute. It is a relative norm. Barr is never fast and loose with the truth. His real sin, in the eyes of the shouting Democrats, may simply involve being too serious for a day in which men such as Michael Avenatti are able to look in the mirror and see a president.

Some didn't like the attorney general's four-page letter to Congress on March 24, which drew key conclusions about the Mueller report. Some didn't like that the attorney general didn't tell Rep. Charlie Crist, D-Fla., about the March 27 letter he had received from special counsel Robert Mueller, in which Mueller expressed frustration about the coverage of Barr's March 24 letter. And some, such as Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., were irked that Barr called the use of investigators using false identities and deceit to probe a Trump campaign employee overseas ""spying.""

Having patiently endured a show trial in the Senate, who could blame Barr for passing on the chance to repeat the experience in the notoriously more raucous House of Representatives? Just as the leak of Mueller's March 27 letter set the stage for the Senate spectacle, Pelosi's accusation that the nation's top Justice Department officer has himself committed a crime sets the stage for whatever production the Democrat-controlled House is now frantically concocting. And it could be anything. We are talking about a group of elected officials who must have thought it was a real home run to use a plastic chicken for a photo op in hopes of making some point about the attorney general of the United States.

It's not clear that Democratic leadership knows what its endgame really is. Across the board, polling shows public support for impeachment dwindling, even among Democrats. Quinnipiac on Thursday showed that two-thirds of Americans overall oppose impeachment, with only 56% of Democrats favoring it - a drop of nearly ten points among Democrats in recent months. But some, such as Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif. - who seems to have replaced Anthony Weiner as Pelosi's new attack dog - want to impeach not only President Donald Trump, but Barr as well.

Cooler heads in the Democratic camp read these numbers and foresee the disaster to which the march to impeachment would likely lead. But if the speaker's pronouncement is any indication, the rational thinkers are being shouted out by those who are driven by fear. The Wall Street Journal's ever clear-eyed Kimberly Strassel agrees, noting on Thursday that Barr does spark fear among the Democrats. As if that was not enough, the Democrats see other numbers like Friday's report of 263,000 new jobs created in April, bringing unemployment down to 3.6% - a level not seen since 1969. The fear, then, may be not only of Barr but also in having no issue on which to run next year.

As Hiram Johnson, a progressive senator from California, noted more than a hundred years ago, the first casualty in war is truth. Feeling robbed by Mueller of the grounds with which to wage war against Trump, the Democrats have been reduced to calling Barr a liar and to characterizing him as a chicken. What does falling apart look like? Fear and desperation have usually led us down the bumpiest roads in our history. Maybe it is time for everyone to buckle their seat belts."

Teachers Begin To See Unfair Student Loans Disappear,https://www.npr.org,"['Chris Arnold', 'Cory Turner']",05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/03/711373657/teachers-begin-to-see-unfair-student-loans-disappear,"Teachers Begin To See Unfair Student Loans Disappear

Enlarge this image toggle caption Beth Nakamura for NPR Beth Nakamura for NPR

Nearly 2,300 teachers have just had a mountain of student loan debt lifted off their backs, according to previously unreleased figures from the U.S. Department of Education. The move follows reporting by NPR that exposed a nightmare for public school teachers across the country.

In exchange for agreeing to work in low-income schools, aspiring teachers could get federal Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants from the department to help pay their way through college. But those grants were often unfairly turned into loans that teachers had to pay back.

In December, the Education Department proposed a fix. Now, that fix has been expanded, and thousands more teachers are likely to get help.

""We've put teachers who didn't deserve this stress, this pressure, this financial burden in a position that is frightening and confusing,"" says Education Department acting undersecretary and acting assistant secretary Diane Auer Jones. ""I can't give them back those years, and I can't take away the gray hairs and I can't take away the stress. It seems like a small thing to do to say, 'I'm sorry,' but I'm very sorry. And we want to work to fix it and correct it.""

Kaitlyn McCollum is one of the teachers who lost her grant money unfairly and, like many of them, her story began with a letter that sent her reeling.

The mailbox

Enlarge this image toggle caption Stacy Kranitz for NPR Stacy Kranitz for NPR

Two years ago, the high school teacher in Columbia, Tenn., walked to the mailbox, pregnant with her first child, and opened an official-looking letter from the Education Department.

""I remember going out to the mailbox — I even opened it up at the mailbox — and sheer panic just set in,"" McCollum says.

Her federal TEACH Grants had been turned into more than $20,000 in loans. The reason: McCollum had narrowly missed a deadline for mailing in some annual paperwork.

She walked inside, sat at the family table beside her husband, A.J., and sobbed.

Not only was this sudden, crushing debt unfair, McCollum later argued to the Education Department, she couldn't afford to pay it on her meager teacher's salary. And she didn't understand why the department wouldn't turn the loans back into grants since she could prove she was teaching, just as she'd promised. She appealed but was told her loans could not possibly be turned back into grants.

McCollum was not alone. NPR's reporting over the past year found that the same thing was happening to thousands of other public school teachers.

The problem at the heart of the TEACH Grant story is that small paperwork issues often triggered this catastrophic consequence. In order to qualify for a grant, aspiring teachers agreed to teach for four years in a low-income public school. But the rules also required that teachers send in a form every year to prove they were actually teaching.

The forms were often due over the summer when teachers and principals, who had to sign them, were away on vacation. And if teachers sent in this annual form even one day late, missing a signature or date, or with any other little problem, their TEACH Grants would be turned into loans, with interest. And this process was irreversible. Teachers were told their loans could not be converted back to grants.

For two years, the debt haunted McCollum and her young family. They went into forbearance — a brief reprieve but with interest accruing. They even moved to a smaller, less expensive house to prepare for what now seemed inevitable. No one was listening. Fair or not, the debt was growing and would need to be repaid.

And then, just a few Saturdays ago, another letter arrived in the mail. McCollum opened it in the car, her husband driving, their young son Louther chirping in the back seat. A much-needed spring break vacation lay ahead.

""Do you see that word, 'Congratulations!'?"" McCollum said, smiled and laughed. It was official: That debt, now $24,000, had finally been turned back into grants.

""You're free baby,"" her husband, A.J., said.

""Two years of us fighting this,"" McCollum said. ""We won,"" she tells NPR. ""We raised our voices and they finally heard us. Disbelief followed by a relief like I have not felt before.""

The scale of the problem and the fix

The federal TEACH Grant program was created in 2007 with the best of intentions: to help aspiring teachers, who committed to teach high-need subjects in low-income schools, pay for college. And the program succeeded in attracting bright young teachers to work in some of the nation's most underserved schools. According to the most recent data, roughly 21,000 teachers have successfully completed the program's four-year teaching requirement.

But that compares to 94,000 recipients who have had their grants turned into loans. Many of those conversions were justified — young students who later decided teaching was not for them and didn't complete their required service. But many others were undoubtedly like Kaitlyn McCollum: They have taught as promised but were trapped in the program's administrative quicksand.

In December, after multiple NPR reports on the depth of the TEACH Grant problem, the Education Department announced it would offer relief for any teacher who could prove they had fulfilled — or could still fulfill — their teaching service. Grants that had unfairly become loans because of these minor paperwork problems would, at last, become grants again. The irreversible became reversible.

""From internal reports, from the work that [NPR] did, it was abundantly clear to us that there was a problem with TEACH Grants,"" says the Education Department's Jones, who served in the same role in 2007, when the TEACH rules were first written. ""We realized that there were certain things that seemed like a good idea when we wrote the [regulation], but they were just too cumbersome for students. And unfairly so.""

The number of teachers getting help is likely to rise. According to the department, since it rolled out its fix in January nearly 6,000 teachers have applied for relief. So far, nearly 2,300 have been approved for the fix and are getting their loans turned back into grants and fewer than 20 teachers have been denied. In short, the vast majority of teachers who apply for the fix are getting their grants back.

Expanding the fix

In addition to the department's current relief efforts, advocates have also pushed for an overhaul of the TEACH Grant's rules. That process, known as negotiated rulemaking, recently concluded with something of a surprise: The department agreed to expand its fix to reach even more teachers and to make the program much easier to navigate.

Once these new rules go into effect, TEACH Grants can no longer be turned into loans just because of late or incomplete annual paperwork. So that draconian penalty for such a small infraction will disappear.

The department is also committing to help teachers who had their credit hurt when they defaulted on these loans.

But hanging over this process has been one thorny question: what to do about teachers who lost their grants and, as a result, decided to change schools or quit teaching altogether. In other words, they lost their grants, were told there was nothing they could do, and so they moved on with their lives.

""On the phone, honestly, I cried at one point. [Because] I was like, this isn't right. You know, it's not fair,"" remembers Victoria Libsack, who taught for three years in a low-income Phoenix school. But after she narrowly missed a paperwork deadline and her grants were converted to loans, Libsack eventually moved to a different state and took a job at a school that doesn't meet TEACH requirements.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Beth Nakamura for NPR Beth Nakamura for NPR

The problem for Libsack and teachers like her is that the program requires four years of teaching within an eight-year window. Even with the department's initial fix, Libsack would have very little time to quit her current job, potentially move again, and find a new job in a qualifying school to complete her required service. And some teachers have no time left at all.

In February, Libsack flew to Washington, D.C., to share her story with the government committee that has been tasked with rewriting the rules.

""Living on a teacher's salary at a low-income school, I had just enough to live,"" Libsack told the committee. ""I loved teaching, but I felt overwhelmed and defeated when my TEACH Grant was converted.""

That rules committee heard Libsack and voted to expand the department's fix to include teachers like her. They agreed to go back and pause the eight-year clock at the time when a teacher's grants were first converted.

For Libsack, that means she should now have five more years to complete her final year of service. She'll still need to change schools to qualify. That's not ideal, she says, but it will mean she won't have to pay upward of $20,000 in loans. Libsack says she's now feeling ""hopeful"" because her government finally listened.

""For me, as a teacher, it's awesome,"" she says, ""because then I can convey that to the students and say, 'Hey, you do have a voice. You are citizens. You do have a role in our government.' ""

The department's fix has not been entirely smooth. Many teachers have told NPR that some call-center staff seemed unfamiliar with the new rules — and that the paperwork they were sent, even after they got approved, was really confusing.

Some advocates argue the department should do even more for teachers like Libsack. Patrick Llewellyn, an attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group, says the government should be more flexible with teachers who lost their grants unfairly many years ago. He says it should reduce the number of years they're required to teach in order to satisfy the program's requirements and keep their grants.

""For people who were converted eight, nine, 10 years ago, it is a lot to ask of them [to quit their current job and find another one] if they are doing something completely different,"" Llewellyn says, especially since they are in this position because of how the program has been mishandled.

But on this point the department is holding firm with the original terms of the deal: Teachers have to teach for four years.

Perhaps the biggest challenge remaining for the Education Department is one of outreach and communication.

""There is relief available for teachers,"" says Llewellyn, ""but they need to know about it.""

Some teachers who were hit with these unfair debts still may not realize they qualify to have them forgiven or refunded if they've already paid them. Many have changed addresses, both physical and email, and may be difficult to find. The department says it is reaching out, to make sure those who need the help know that it's finally there. It also encourages any teachers who think they might qualify to proactively ask for help."

Trump says Putin described the investigation as ""something to the effect that it started off as a mountain and it ended up being a mouse."" (May 3) AP

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a testy exchange with Fox News host Chris Wallace on Sunday about the administration's response to Russian election interference.

""You are looking at the administration that has been tougher on Russia than any of its predecessors, and yet you continue to be fixated on something that Robert Mueller wrote down,"" Pompeo told Wallace during an interview on ""Fox News Sunday.""

Pompeo grew frustrated after Wallace shared a quote from special counsel Robert Mueller's 448-page report that said Russia ""interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion."" Wallace followed the quote with two clips of President Donald Trump answering questions Friday about a recent telephone conversation that he had with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In the first clip, Trump implied he agreed with Putin's assessment that special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation – which he again referred to as the ""Russia hoax"" – ""started off as a mountain and it ended up being a mouse."" In the second clip, Trump was asked whether he told Putin not to interfere in the next election. Trump shrugged and said, ""we didn't discuss that.""

""Why doesn't the president get tough with Putin about what everyone seems to agree is clear: meddling in 2016 and the threat of meddling in 2020?"" Wallace asked Pompeo.

""Chris, this administration has been tougher on Russia than any of its predecessor administrations,"" the secretary of state said. ""I could go through the list but there's not time in the show to talk about all the things we've done.""

Pompeo cited increased defense spending and the administration's effort to ""make sure that every election is as safe as they can possibly be."" He said the Department of Homeland Security and U.S.intelligence agencies are ""all working"" to ""ensure"" that ""2020 will continue to be successful.""

""I take your point, because in terms of specific policies the U.S. ... "" Wallace responded before Pompeo cut him off.

""So, Chris, I don't get your point. I'm confused,"" he said, before calling Wallace ""fixated on something that Robert Mueller wrote down.""

""I'm not fixated about Robert Mueller, I'm fixated on the president's conversation with Vladimir Putin, and the fact that in a conversation he doesn't even mention meddling in 2020,"" Wallace replied. ""And the question I'm asking – I think it's a legitimate one, a lot of people are asking it, sir – is, 'Why not?'""

Pompeo explained that as someone who often speaks to foreign leaders, he understands that ""sometimes conversations just aren't long enough to include every issue that might be brought up.""

""But no one should misunderstand from your question today, your viewers should not be misled, this administration has taken seriously the threat of election interference and will continue to do so.""

Before that exchange, Wallace had asked Pompeo about an apparent discrepancy between Trump and Pompeo, as well as national security adviser John Bolton, about Putin's role in Venezuela's political and economic crisis.

Bolton said last week that Russia ""would love to get effective control of a country in this hemisphere."" And Pompeo said last week that President Nicolas Maduro has been prepared to step down before ""the Russians indicated he should stay.""

But on Friday, Trump told reporters that Putin ""is not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela, other than he’d like to see something positive happen."" Several commentators compared the discrepancy to the president's news conference last year with Putin in Helsinki where he appeared to accept the Russian president's denial of election interference over the conclusions of his own intelligence agencies.

When asked about the president's comment, Pompeo said Trump ""has been very clear on this"" and referred to a previous statement from Trump that Russia needs to ""get out"" of Venezuela.

Wallace asked Pompeo what he plans to tell Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov when he meets with him in Finland on Monday.

""I'm going to tell him the same thing the president told the world: that every country must get out, including the Russians,"" Pompeo said. ""We don't want anyone messing around with Venezuela, because we want them to be an autonomous, independent, sovereign state.""

Wallace referred to their testy exchange later in the interview when he asked Pompeo about comments from North Korean officials who said the secretary of State has a ""mean character"" and that he should be replaced by someone more ""careful and mature.""

""The immaturity thing I'm not so sure about. The rest of it, I'll let the world decide,"" Pompeo said.

""There were some moments in this conversation where I thought 'mean' might be correct,"" Wallace said with a grin and a chuckle.

Catherine Rampell: The worst thing Barr did this week had nothing to do with the Mueller report,https://www.sltrib.com,"['Catherine Rampell', 'The Washington Post']",05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2019/05/03/catherine-rampell-worst/,"Video: President Trump says the Republican Party will become ‘the party of healthcare,’ but columnist Catherine Rampell argues that if the GOP actually tried to devise a health system that fulfilled both conservative principles and public promises, it would probably come up with something like . . . Obamacare. (Joshua Carroll/The Washington Post)

The worst thing that Attorney General William P. Barr did this week arguably had nothing to do with possible contempt of Congress or the Mueller report.

It had to do with health care.

On Wednesday, amid the circus over alleged special counsel snittiness, the department that Barr oversees formally asked a federal appeals court to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, jeopardizing access to health care for tens of millions of Americans.

If the Trump administration prevails, everything in the law would be wiped out. And I do mean everything: the protections for people with pre-existing conditions, Medicaid expansion, income-based individual-market subsidies, provisions allowing children to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26, requirements that insurance cover minimum essential benefits such as prescriptions and preventive care, and so on.

The administration’s rationale was laid out in a policy brief supporting a lawsuit challenging Obamacare by 20 red states. Their logic: When Congress, as part of President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, set the penalty for not carrying health insurance to zero, that effectively made it no longer really a “tax,” and therefore made it unconstitutional. Somehow, that rendered the rest of the law unconstitutional, as well — including lots of provisions having nothing to do with the mandate.

This reasoning has been rejected even by conservative legal scholars otherwise opposed to the law. But legal merits (and demerits) aside — which are likely to be ultimately adjudicated by the Supreme Court — it's also not clear what political upside Republicans could possibly see in mounting yet another overt attack on Obamacare.

The GOP's November congressional losses were largely motivated by voter rage over the party's attacks on Obamacare, after all. Trump has, of course, more recently proclaimed the GOP the ""party of health care,"" and he and other party leaders continue repeating the obvious fiction that they're cooking up ""something terrific"" to replace the ACA.

Yet Trump's party has never been able to come up with (let alone pass) a viable replacement plan, even when it had unified control of government.

There are more productive things Trump and lawmakers could do to improve the health care system that don’t involve dismantling the ACA. Obamacare, after all, did a lot to expand coverage and not nearly enough to improve affordability.

Article continues below

In fact, if Republicans are looking for more fruitful areas for improvement, they might contemplate a survey focused on employer-sponsored insurance plans that was released Thursday by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Los Angeles Times.

About half of the U.S. population has employer-based coverage, including 60 percent of nonelderly adults. While most say they are generally satisfied with these health plans, many nonetheless struggle with the financial burden they impose — particularly the high-deductible plans that cover 4 in 10 people with employer-sponsored insurance.

Deductibles in employer-sponsored insurance have been rising since long before the ACA. They have nearly quadrupled over the past 12 years and now average $1,350 for a single-person plan. But separate survey data show that only half of nonelderly, one-person households report having at least $2,000 in savings available.

It's no wonder, then, that many with ""good"" health coverage still report trouble paying for care. In fact, half of adults with job-based coverage say they or someone in their household has skipped or delayed getting medical care or filling prescription drugs in the past 12 months because of the cost.

Figuring out how to reduce out-of-pocket costs — including deductibles so high that they're tantamount to not having insurance at all — turns out to be much more challenging than simply burning down the entire system. After all, requiring employers to spend more on health insurance might just end up hitting workers in the form of lower wages.

Even so, there are promising paths forward.

For instance, the latest version of a plan known as the Medicare for America Act — introduced Wednesday by Reps. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-Conn., and Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. — would create an expansive public insurance option to compete with the employer-sponsored system. The public option would cap premiums and out-of-pocket costs and have no deductibles. The bill would allow employer-sponsored plans to continue, as long as they covered a minimum average share of enrollees' health expenses.

Other options might include refundable tax credits to offset out-of-pocket spending, as have been proposed by Democrats before.

Trump administration officials may not like these alternatives. Fine. But if they're going to persist in trying to blow up the current system — through administrative sabotage, funding cuts and bogus court challenges — the onus remains on them to propose better ways to rebuild it.

Trump official names former Secret Service head to top DHS post,https://thehill.com,[],05-03-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/442096-trump-official-names-former-secret-service-head-to-top-dhs-post,"Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan has named Randolph “Tex” Alles, the former head of the Secret Service, to a top Homeland Security post.

McAleenan announced Friday that Alles, who stepped down as Secret Service director this week, will take over as acting Deputy Under Secretary for Management at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

ADVERTISEMENT In his role, Alles ""will oversee all aspects of the Department’s management programs, including financial, human capital, information technology, procurement, security, and asset management,"" according to the DHS statement.

The post has been held by Chip Fulghum, who stepped up to fill the position following the departure of Claire Grady. Grady, who served as DHS's acting deputy secretary, resigned last month amid a shakeup at the department.

""Mr. Fulghum has served the men and women of DHS with distinction since first joining in 2012, and we are forever grateful for his service. I wish him the very best in the years ahead,"" McAleenan said in the statement Friday.

The White House announced last month that Alles was being replaced as Secret Service director by James Murray, the former deputy assistant director of the Office of Protective Operations.

Alles departed the agency amid reports that his relationship with Trump had soured for months. Trump reportedly made fun of the Secret Service director’s appearance, calling him “Dumbo” because of his ears.

DOJ confirms: Girls found in Seymour home were murdered,https://www.weau.com,[],,,,https://www.weau.com/content/news/509502961.html,"The Wisconsin Department of Justice is declaring the deaths of two girls in Seymour last month were homicides.

Mattelin ""Mattie"" Annie Samson, age 4, and Hailey Kaye Poppe, age 3 months, were found dead on April 19 after the Outagamie County Emergency Response Team entered their home.

A man, 35-year-old Andrew R. Poppe, was also found dead. The DOJ confirmed Friday he died of a self-inflicted wound.

Documents obtained by Action 2 News earlier this week said all three had wounds consistent with stabbing.

The mother is not a suspect in the investigation, the statement from the DOJ says.

Police had responded to the home to execute a search warrant based on a domestic violence incident the day before, on April 18. The victim victim of the domestic violence said Poppe threatened to kill her and her children if she called police.

On April 19, at 6:59 a.m., Seymour Police attempted to make contact with Poppe by telephone but he did not answer.

About one hour later, the emergency response team forced entry into the home and found the girls and Poppe dead in an upstairs room. An affidavit states that they ""showed no signs of life and each had wounds consistent with that of a stabbing.""

The affidavit states that Poppe had a history of domestic violence. Police records show an arrest in June 2015 for battery/domestic violence.

Police also executed a search warrant after the deaths and seized a cell phone, electronic devices, clothing and documents.

Mattie and Hailey were laid to rest on April 25. Donations are being collected through the Muehl-Boettcher Funeral Home website. CLICK HERE for information on making a donation to the family.

The Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation is leading the investigation into the deaths at the request of the Seymour Police Department.

"EPA Seeks Public Comment on Use of Monsanto’s Weedkiller, Glyphosate on Oats Used in Foods Marketed to Kids",https://www.ewg.org,[],,,,https://www.ewg.org/release/epa-seeks-public-comment-use-monsanto-s-weedkiller-glyphosate-oats-used-foods-marketed-kids,"WASHINGTON – The Environmental Protection Agency is formally requesting feedback on a petition submitted by EWG and food companies seeking to significantly limit the use of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Bayer/Monsanto’s weedkiller Roundup, on oats that are used to make a wide array of children’s foods, like breakfast bars and cereals.

EPA announced today that it will open up a 30-day public comment period beginning Monday, May 6.

Two rounds of laboratory tests commissioned by EWG found glyphosate in nearly every sample of oat-based cereal and other breakfast products at levels higher than what EWG considers protective for children’s health.

“No parent should worry whether feeding their children healthy oat-based foods will also expose them to a chemical linked to cancer,” said EWG Legislative Director Colin O’Neil.

“If EPA ultimately supports this petition, it could be the beginning of the end for one of the primary sources of glyphosate exposure in the diets of both children and adults,” said O’Neil. “We can be sure that the pesticide/agrichemical lobby won’t sit on the sidelines, though. Over the next month, it will be paramount that EPA hear from as many Americans as possible in order to build the necessary pressure to finally prohibit this needless use of Monsanto’s cancer-causing weedkiller.”

“For far too long, millions of Americans have been getting a dose of this toxic herbicide along with their breakfast,” said EWG Senior Science Advisor for Children’s Environmental Health Olga Naidenko, Ph.D. “If the EPA really cares about children’s health, it should cut off the largest source of glyphosate exposure from foods that children eat daily.”

The EPA’s legal limit on glyphosate residues is 30 parts per million, or ppm. The petition, joined by 18 industry leaders, asks the EPA to set a more protective standard of 0.1 ppm, which was the legal limit in 1993.

Over the past 25 years, the EPA has increased the amount of glyphosate residue allowed on oats 300-fold. The first increase, to 20 ppm, was granted in response to a 1997 petition from Monsanto, when farmers around the world first began using glyphosate widely as a late-season drying agent. It was increased to the current 30 ppm level in 2008.

Since then, scientists have linked glyphosate to cancer, and researchers around the world have called for stricter limits on glyphosate exposures.

In 2015, 17 of the world’s top cancer researchers convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer reviewed hundreds of studies on glyphosate and voted unanimously to classify the weedkiller as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” In 2017, California added glyphosate to its official list of chemicals known to cause cancer.

A new analysis of glyphosate, released in April by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, gives weight to studies connecting glyphosate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and recommends monitoring children’s exposure to this toxic weedkiller.

The petition, first filed in September by EWG, now includes MegaFood, Ben & Jerry’s, Stonyfield Organic, MOM’s Organic Market, Nature’s Path, One Degree Organic Foods, National Co+op Grocers, Happy Family Organics, Amy’s Kitchen, Clif Bar & Company, Earth’s Best Organic, GrandyOats, INFRA, KIND Healthy Snacks, Lundberg Family Farms, Organic Valley, Patagonia Provisions and PCC Community Markets.

A gay president? The majority of Americans believe the country isn't ready,https://www.cnn.com,['Analysis Harry Enten'],05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/politics/poll-of-the-week-gay-president/index.html,"(CNN) First things first: The theme song of the week is from the television show Beverly Hills, 90210.

A new Quinnipiac University poll finds that 70% of voters (including 86% of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic) say they are open to electing a gay president.

The same poll also discovered, however, that only 36% of voters (including 40% of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic) think the United States is ready to elect a gay president.

What's the point: Right now, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is one of the top 5 contenders vying for the Democratic nomination process. He is a married gay man.

These poll results suggest that most Americans -- and Democrats in particular -- are open to electing him president, so long as he meets other qualifications.

Yet, it seems like Buttigieg may run into electability concerns for the simple reason that Democrats don't think (perhaps wrongly if you believe this poll) the country is ready. It's also possible that some voters are not willing to admit to homophobia, while signaling it by saying essentially, ""I'm ready, but others may not be.""

Either way, this poll suggests that Buttigieg might hit a wall in a Democratic primary in which voters are placing a high emphasis on the ability to beat President Donald Trump.

I should note that polling on whether the country is ready for a gay president differs significantly from polling on whether Americans thought the country was ready for a black president in 2007 or a woman president in 2015.

Fox News poll taken after then-Sen. Barack Obama declared in February 2007 found that 69% of Democrats and 69% of voters thought the country was ready to elect a black president. In other words, electability was less of a problem for Obama then than Buttigieg now.

Voters were even more sure that the country was ready to elect a woman president after former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared a second bid for the presidency in April 2015. A CBS News poll conducted in the spring of that year showed that 89% of Democrats and 78% of all Americans said the country was ready for a woman president.

Interestingly, in all three instances, more voters said they were ready for a black, female or gay president than thought the country was ready for one.

But even if Americans are more tolerant of gay Americans than voters think they are, more are prejudiced against gay Americans than they were against black Americans in 2007 or women in 2014. Today, about a quarter of all voters (including 10% of Democrats) told Quinnipiac that they weren't open to vote for a gay man for president. Back in 2007 and 2015, 5% or less of Americans and Democrats said they weren't willing to vote for a qualified black person and woman to be president, respectively.

Prejudice against gay Americans is evident in other polling as well. About 35% of Americans openly admitted in the 2018 General Social Survey that they thought ""homosexual sex relations"" were almost always or always wrong. Even more than 25% of Democrats said it was almost always or always wrong.

Now, Americans have certainly become more comfortable with the idea of a gay president than they used to be. The percentage of Americans who say they would vote for a gay person for president is up 15-20 points since 2007 , depending on the poll you look at. The percentage of Democrats who say they would vote for a gay person for president is up around 25 points.

Further, it's possible that if Buttigieg becomes successful on the campaign trail, then Americans may become even more open to the idea of a gay president.

Still, it's pretty clear from the numbers that there is still a portion of the electorate for whom Buttigieg's sexuality is an issue."

""We’ve supported the National Assembly’s choice. Juan Guaidó is the interim president of the country, and as you know, these things sometimes have bumpy roads."" Pompeo told ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl on ""This Week"" Sunday.

""(Maduro's) ruling for the moment, but he can't govern. There's enormous poverty, enormous starvation, sick children that can't get medicine,"" Pompeo added. ""This is not someone who can be part of Venezuela's future and whether that change takes place today or tomorrow or a week from now, one can't predict.""

Pompeo also said on Sunday, ""Maduro cannot feel good about the security of his position today, and he shouldn't. Because the Venezuelan people will demand, ultimately, that he leave.""

The opposition-controlled National Assembly declared Guaidó interim president in January, but months of demonstrations and U.S. sanctions have not forced Maduro from his grip on power -- even after a major uprising Tuesday. According to The Washington Post, in an interview on Saturday, Guaidó acknowledged that the opposition had not drawn enough support from the military and members of Maduro’s inner circle to force him to step down.

""Maybe because we still need more soldiers, and maybe we need more officials of the regime to be willing to support it, to back the constitution,"" Guaidó told the Post.

Earlier this week, Pompeo charged that Russia had blocked U.S. efforts to get Maduro out of the country, persuading him at the last minute not to take a waiting plane to Cuba. Karl asked Pompeo if Maduro would still be in power if he did not have the support of the Cuban and Russian governments.

""Without the Cubans, there would be no possibility he would still be in power. They are -- they are at the center of this,"" the secretary said, noting Cuban security forces are guarding Maduro.

Karl pressed, ""You said the Cubans. How about the Russians?""

""Oh, the Russians -- the Russians need to get out, too,"" Pompeo said. ""We want every country -- Iran is in there today. They need to leave as well. Every country that is interfering with the Venezuelan people's right to restore their own democracy needs to leave.""

Sitting alongside activist Fabiana Rosales, Guaidó's wife, in the Oval Office at the end of March, President Donald Trump told reporters that ""Russia has to get out"" of Venezuela. However, on Friday, after an hour-long call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump told reporters that Putin wasn't ""looking to get at all involved in Venezuela.""

""We talked about many things. Venezuela was one of the topics. And he is not looking at all to get involved in Venezuela other than he'd like to see something positive happen for Venezuela. And I feel the same way,"" the president said.

""Aren’t they already deeply involved in supporting Maduro?"" Karl asked Pompeo on ""This Week.""

""The president has said that the Russians must get out. ... The objective is very clear; we want the Iranians out, we want the Russians out, we want the Cubans out. That’s ultimately what has to take place in order for Venezuelan democracy to be restored,"" the secretary said. ""I don’t think anything the president said is inconsistent with that.""

America's top diplomat said that the administration has ""a full range of options"" prepared to respond to the situation in Venezuela, including some that involve the U.S. military. Pompeo was at the Pentagon on Friday discussing these options.

He told Karl that he was there ""making sure that when this progresses, and a different situation arises, that the president has a full-scale set of options; diplomatic options, political options, options with our allies, and then ultimately, a set of options that would involve use of U.S. military. We’re preparing those for him so that when the situation arises, we’re not flatfooted.""

He did not elaborate on what kind of situation would lead to the U.S. military taking action.

In a press release Saturday, Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, called on the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to hold a hearing with administration officials about this possibility.

""The brutal Maduro Regime has caused unspeakable suffering amongst the citizens in Venezuela and I commend the brave Venezuelans who are standing up for their freedom and for their basic human rights. However, I am concerned by reports of possible U.S. military intervention in Venezuela,"" the press release read.

""Does the president believe that he can intervene militarily without getting congressional authorization?"" Karl asked Pompeo on ""This Week.""

""The president has his full range of Article II authorities and I’m very confident that any action we took in Venezuela would be lawful,"" he said."
"White House rips Mueller in letter to DOJ, says team ‘failed in their duty to act as prosecutors’",https://www.foxnews.com,"['John Roberts', 'John Roberts Currently Serves As The Chief White House Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc . He Joined The Network As A Senior National Correspondent In January', 'Based In The Atlanta Bureau.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-rips-mueller-in-letter-to-doj-says-his-team-failed-in-their-duty-to-act-as-prosecutors,"The White House tore into Robert Mueller and his investigators in a recent letter to Attorney General Bill Barr that argued the special counsel's team included ""political statements"" in their Russia report and ""failed"" to act as traditional prosecutors -- while stating President Trump reserves his right to invoke executive privilege on matters related to the report.

In the April 19 letter to the Justice Department obtained Thursday by Fox News, White House Counsel Emmet Flood laid out a series of concerns with the Mueller report, specifically on the team's handling of the investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice.

TRUMP: 'NO REASON' TO HONOR DEMS' 'VERY PARTISAN' SUBPOENAS

“The Special Counsel and his staff failed in their duty to act as prosecutors and only as prosecutors,” Flood wrote, complaining that the report ""suffers from an extraordinary legal defect"" by failing to comply with the ""requirements of governing law.""

Flood raised concerns that the team did not reach a determination on the obstruction question while still going into great detail about the probe's findings and including a pointed passage that stated the probe did not exonerate the president. That passage read: “The evidence we obtained about the President’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”

Flood noted prosecutors “simply are not in the business of establishing innocence” and described these as ""political statements.""

The letter was sent a day after the redacted version of the Mueller report was made public. But the points in the letter aligned with testimony from Barr himself this week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he said he did not understand why Mueller did not reach a conclusion on the obstruction question.

Flood, in his letter, said ""the one thing the SCO (Special Counsel's Office} was obligated to do is the very thing the SCO -- intentionally and unapologetically -- refused to do. The SCO made neither a prosecution decision nor a declination decision on the obstruction question."" Flood complained that the report was instead “laden with factual information that has never been subjected to adversarial testing or independent analysis.”

He also said Mueller ""produced a prosecutorial curiosity,"" describing the report as ""part 'truth commission' report and part law school exam paper.""

Despite Trump himself claiming the report exonerated him, the document only said Mueller did not find evidence of collusion with Russia while leaving the obstruction question open. Barr determined the obstruction evidence did not constitute a crime, but the report's section on that issue included extensive and damaging details about the president's actions, including the allegation that he told his former White House counsel to have Mueller removed.

Flood took issue with the analysis that Mueller intentionally didn’t issue a conclusion on obstruction, but rather decided to provide information about his investigation so Congress could decide whether to take action, like impeachment.

WHITE HOUSE DENIES DEMS INFO ON SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESS

“By way of justifying this departure, it has been suggested that the report was written with the intent of providing Congress some kind of ‘road map’ for congressional action,” Flood wrote, adding if that’s the case, “it too serves as additional evidence of the [Special Counsel Office’s] refusal to follow applicable law.”

Flood, meanwhile, asserted that Trump waiving executive privilege on the report does not constitute a blanket waiver, as senior aides face subpoenas on Capitol Hill related to the Russia investigation.

The letter comes as the White House has signaled it intends to vigorously oppose subpoenas that might run up against executive privilege, a power sanctioned by the Supreme Court that allows the president and members of the executive branch to shield certain internal communications from disclosure, absent a compelling overriding justification.

“We're fighting all the subpoenas,"" Trump told reporters at the White House last week.

Trump has argued that he has been “transparent” as president and had already turned over documents to Mueller’s team – suggesting it’s not necessary to cooperate with the Democratic probes.

The White House has signaled plans to fight House Democrats' subpoena of testimony and documents from ex-White House counsel Don McGahn. The brewing fight over the McGahn subpoena was poised to set up a series of other contentious legal showdowns as Democrats seek to publicly question more current and former Trump aides who featured prominently Mueller's report on the Russia investigation.

Trump administration proposal would make it easier to deport immigrants who use public benefits,https://www.cnbc.com,['Tucker Higgins'],05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/03/doj-weighs-making-it-easier-to-deport-immigrants-on-public-benefits.html,"US President Donald Trump tours the border wall between the United States and Mexico in Calexico, California, April 5, 2019.

The Trump administration is considering reversing long-standing policy to make it easier to deport U.S. legal permanent residents who have used public benefits, part of an effort to restrict immigration by low-income people.

A Department of Justice draft regulation, seen by Reuters, dramatically expands the category of people who could be subject to deportation on the grounds that they use benefits.

Currently, those legal permanent residents who are declared to be a ""public charge,"" or primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, can be deported — but in practice, this is very rare.

The draft regulation would use a more expansive definition to include some immigrants who have used an array of public benefits, including cash welfare, food stamps, housing aid, or Medicaid.

While the plan is at an early stage, might not become official government policy, and is likely to attract lawsuits, it is one part of efforts by the Trump administration to restrict legal immigration, in addition to its efforts to reduce illegal immigration to the United States.

The full possible impact is not known, but the change in policy could affect permanent residents — also known as ""green card"" holders — who are legally entitled to use public benefits soon after their arrival in the United States, such as refugees.

A Department of Justice spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

U.S. law allows for the deportation of immigrants who have become ""public charges"" within five years of admission if their reason for seeking help preceded their entry to the United States — for example, if they had a chronic health condition that was not disclosed.

But due to a 1948 ruling, the deportation of immigrants for using public benefits has been strictly limited to cases in which the government has demanded payment for public services, and the person has failed to pay. Immigration lawyers said they have rarely if ever heard of someone being deported for using public benefits.

The draft rule indicates the government would override that precedent to allow for deportation of some permanent residents who have used certain public benefits within five years of admission.

For the plan to go into effect, it would be subject to public comment, after which it could be revised. Attorney General William Barr would then have to sign off on it.

The public benefits in question include Supplemental Security Income (SSI), given to disabled and older people; the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps; Section 8 housing vouchers; many Medicaid benefits; and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a cash assistance program.

According to federal policy, many permanent residents do not qualify for public benefits unless they have had a green card for five years, making it unlikely they could be targeted for deportation on the basis of ""public charge"" even under the draft rule.

But dozens of states have looser rules — for instance, allowing pregnant women and children who are permanent residents to access Medicaid without a waiting period. And the effort to tighten the rules could affect thousands of immigrant veterans, refugees and asylees, who are eligible to receive many benefits without time restrictions. Active members of the military would not be affected.

Administration officials had earlier indicated that the Justice Department, which oversees U.S. immigration courts, planned to issue a regulation on who can be deported for using public benefits, but its details were not previously known."
VA Comes Out Against Bills on Medical Marijuana for Veterans,https://www.military.com,['Patricia Kime'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/05/02/va-comes-out-against-bills-medical-marijuana-veterans.html,"The Department of Veterans Affairs opposes three legislative proposals that would expand research on medical marijuana at the VA and give veterans access to the drug in states where it is legal.

During a hearing Tuesday on eight VA health-related bills under consideration by Congress, VA officials told House lawmakers that as long as marijuana is illegal under federal law, the department cannot support legislation that promotes its role at the VA.

""[The House Veterans Affairs Committee] can make strong proposals for us to move forward with recommendations of filling out forms and such but, in the end, we need to go back to the [Drug Enforcement Agency] and [Justice Department] for their opinion,"" said Larry Mole, chief consultant for population health at the VA.

Three of the bills before the House Veterans Affairs health subcommittee relate to medical marijuana. One, the Veterans Equal Access Act, H.R. 1647, sponsored by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, would allow VA health providers to recommend medical marijuana to their veteran patients and fill out the necessary paperwork for them to enroll in state marijuana programs.

Related content:

Blumenauer, who has introduced the bill in every Congress since 2014, said that, for some veterans, marijuana and cannabis derivatives are lifesavers that keep them from using addictive medications such as opioids to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic pain, seizures and glaucoma. Yet VA health care providers are not allowed to recommend it.

""Opioids steal the lives of 115 Americans every day ... as veterans with PTSD, chronic pain and any number of ailments are looking for relief, lethal opioid overdoses among VA patients are almost twice the national average. We are doing something wrong,"" he said.

Another bill, the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act, H.R. 712, would direct the VA to conduct a large-scale clinical trial on the effects of cannabis on conditions such as PTSD and chronic pain.

Bill sponsor Rep. Lou Correa, D-California, said the research would examine the effectiveness of cannabis on various health conditions, as well as delivery methods.

""It's time to do research. It's time for veterans to know what cannabis is good for and what cannabis is not good for,"" Correa said.

A third, the Veterans Cannabis Use for Safe Healing Act, H.R. 2192, would protect veterans' benefits by prohibiting the VA from denying health care and compensation for veterans participating in a state medical marijuana program.

Keita Franklin, the VA's national director of suicide prevention, said that while the department supports medical marijuana research and is currently involved in a trial for treating PTSD, it opposes the bills.

According to Franklin, VA doctors would be subject to criminal prosecution if they recommended medical marijuana or made referrals to state agencies, as specified by DEA guidance.

And Correa's bill, she said, would not follow standard practice in medical research.

""Typically, a smaller early-phase trial would advance our knowledge and the benefits and risks regarding cannabis before moving to the expansive approach described in this legislation,"" she said. ""Any trial involving human subjects must include an evaluation on the risks and the safety, and include the smallest number of participants to avoid putting the subjects at increased risk unnecessarily. For these reasons, we don't support this legislation.""

She added that the third piece of legislation is unnecessary because VA policy states that the department cannot deny benefits based on marijuana use, although VA physicians are allowed to tailor a patient's prescription medications based on whether they are using cannabis.

Veterans advocates who testified expressed varying levels of support for the bills.

Carlos Fuentes, director of national legislative service for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said the VFW does not support the Veterans Equal Access bill because it doesn't think the VA should recommend unproven medical treatments, nor should it authorize a treatment for a veteran that would require the former service member to get it outside the VA, where they would be responsible for finding a quality product and paying for it.

The VFW does, however, support VA research on cannabis.

""VA's overreliance on opioids to treat chronic pain and other conditions has led to addiction and even deaths. To its credit ... VA has reduced the number of patients to whom it has prescribed opioids by 22 percent. Now, VA must expand research on the efficacy of nontraditional alternatives to opioids,"" Fuentes said.

Joy Ilam, national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, agreed.

""We want to make sure there is no harm done. Research is the first step in doing that,"" Ilam said.

Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America research director Stephanie Mullen said the IAVA supports cannabis research and access to it.

""It's past time for VA to catch up,"" Mullen said. ""Veterans are suffering from their injuries today.""

Among the other bills and draft bills discussed at the hearing was one that seeks to expand complementary and alternative therapies and treatments at VA medical facilities, and another that would require the VA to report suicides and attempts that occur on VA campuses within a week of them happening.

Franklin said the VA supports both proposals.

Interior Dept. Loosens Offshore-Drilling Safety Rules Dating From Deepwater Horizon,https://www.nytimes.com,['Coral Davenport'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/climate/offshore-drilling-safety-rollback-deepwater-horizon.html,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday made public its rollback of a major offshore-drilling safety regulation, significantly weakening an Obama-era rule that was put in place after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and sent 4.9 million barrels of oil gushing into the sea, causing the worst oil spill in American history.

Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who was confirmed by the Senate last month to head the agency that oversees the nation’s public lands and waters, announced the plan Thursday afternoon in Port Fourchon, La., the vast industrial hub that serves as the onshore base for most companies that drill in the Gulf of Mexico.

The oil industry praised the move. Environmental groups warned that the rollbacks could pave the way for similar crises to happen again.

The weakened safety rules come as the Trump administration has also sought to vastly expand offshore drilling in the nation’s waters. Last year the Interior Department proposed opening almost the entire United States coastline to drilling, although Mr. Bernhardt recently said the administration may delay those plans while court challenges are addressed."
"America’s Presidents have been far from perfect, but many historians say ours was the worst",https://www.pennlive.com,"['Joyce Davis', 'Joyce M.

As the new book “The Presidents” points out, it can take some time before history really judges a President, and those ridiculed, rejected and even despised during their day may be viewed as heroes a few generations later. Or vice versa.

As the new book “The Presidents” points out, it can take some time before history really judges a President, and those ridiculed, rejected and even despised during their day may be viewed as heroes a few generations later. Or vice versa.

It’s one of the main points authors Brian Lamb and Susan Swain emphasize in the book they’ve compiled from interviews with historians interviewed on C-Span. Lamb is founder and CEO of the cable news channel and Swain is co-CEO. Over C-Span’s four decades of providing access to newsmakers, it’s featured its share of historians assessing U.S. Presidents. Both were recently in Harrisburg to promote their book at a forum at the Midtown Scholar Bookstore.

“The Presidents” is based on C-SPAN’s noted Historians Survey of Presidential Leadership and the text from their TV interviews with famous historians such as Ron Chernow, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Robert Caro and others.

In “The Presidents,” they’ve compiled a readable, if subjective, ranking of the men who have occupied the Oval Office. There’s a section on Donald Trump’s potential legacy, but he can’t be assessed until he actually leaves office.

Chambersburg, Pa., Dec. 6, 1952. The cabin where President James Buchanan was born. It was moved there from Cove Gap and in 1953 was moved to the grounds of Mercersburg Academy.

There’s little disagreement, the worst, so far, has been our own James Buchanan, a lifelong bachelor who ascended into office at a critical time in the nation’s history – just before the Civil War.

He proved the wrong man for the job.

“He couldn’t make a decision,” Swain said. “He was a consummate waffler . . . He was bad.”

If Buchanan is generally perceived to be the worst President, there is also general consensus on the best – Abraham Lincoln.

Abraham Lincoln’s contemporaries attacked him in editorials, speeches, journals, diaries, and private letters. Even without Twitter and social media, they criticized his upbringing, his lack of formal education, and even his appearance.

Unlike Buchanan, Lincoln had the backbone to make a decision and stick to it, even if it meant Civil War.

So decisiveness is one of the chief factors that signals whether a President will go down in history as great leader or as a loser. But it turns out it’s hard to predict greatness based on a resume.

Buchanan had a resume chock full of accomplishments. Lincoln did not.

“No man ascended to the office with a longer resume,” said Swain of Buchanan, while Lincoln had very few qualifications to recommend him for the highest office in the land one of the most critical times in the nation’s history.

Truth be told, history is in the pen of the writer. And perspectives of who’s great and who’s not can change over the centuries.

Take Andrew Jackson. For a long time, he was considered among the nation’s best Presidents.

Decisive and a great military leader, Jackson’s ranking among our Presidents has dropped in recent years.

“Some of the things we reflect on now, like the Indian Removal Act, will hurt him from now on.” Thousands of Native Americans died upon orders of President Jackson to remove them from their ancestral lands. Today, we would call it genocide.

History, especially Presidential history, has frequently been whitewashed, and key facts, such as genocide have been downplayed or completely omitted.

So what would America's 3rd president make of his country's current mess?

Take another President considered among the greats – Thomas Jefferson. “He had a lot of slaves,” Lamb said, and for a long time, no one talked about Sally Hemings, the black woman who bore him at least six children. It took modern times and the irrefutable evidence of DNA to add Ms. Hemings to the history books.

And while Presidential dalliances were once hush-hush, all the lured details are now written in plain English in the annals of America’s greats.

We already know about President Bill Clinton. But what about Warren G. Harding and Nan Britton? Not to mention our beloved JFK. Our Presidents were not always men of morality or integrity, and even the good ones had their lapses.

“Presidential scandals go all the way from Thomas Jefferson using James Calendar to write nasty things about John Adams . . . all the way up to Clinton and the different women in his life . . . to JFK , who got away with all of the affairs with women,” said Lamb. “It’s pretty bad stuff.”

And it’s all right there in “The Presidents.”

There are few surprises, as well. Did you know Barack Obama ended his courtship with a long-time girlfriend, allegedly, historians speculate, because she might not be the right Presidential wife material?

Seems he always had his eyes on the Presidency and wound up among the best at number 12, at least according to “The Presidents” rankings.

How these rankings will change after President’s Trump’s stint in office is anyone’s guess. But “The Presidents” provides a glimpse of how history judges the men who have held the office, and how it is likely to judge the man there now."

Did the Department of Justice Give the Mueller Letter to the Post to Screw the Times?,https://www.vanityfair.com,"['Joe Pompeo', 'Vanity Fair', 'Bess Levin', 'Mark Seliger']",,,,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/05/did-the-department-of-justice-give-the-mueller-letter-to-the-post,"It was a familiar one-two in the age of Trump. On Tuesday, the day before Attorney General William Barr’s Senate testimony, The Washington Post published a staggering scoop, one that’s driven the news ever since: Robert Mueller had written a letter to Barr complaining that his initial summary of the Mueller report “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance” of the special counsel’s work.

Minutes later, The New York Times published a story with almost precisely the same reporting. “I felt a flashback to the days of 2017 and 2018 when the Times and the Post published dueling scoops the way fighters trade blows,” CNN’s Brian Stelter remarked in his newsletter that night.

The Times and the Post are both well sourced and are often in pursuit of the same stories. In this instance, however, the Times has been left with the distinct impression that the Department of Justice intentionally screwed it by helping its competitor get the scoop. “We’ll certainly be more cautious going forward when we deal with D.O.J.,” a Times reporter familiar with the matter told me. (A D.O.J. official likewise told me the department will do the same when dealing with the Times.)

Here’s what happened, as far as I’ve been able to piece it together from multiple sources with direct knowledge of how things went down: the D.O.J. learned on Sunday that the Times was working on a story about the letter, which Mueller sent to Barr on March 27. The Times believes it was the first news outlet to nail down reporting on the letter and reach out to the D.O.J. On Tuesday, the D.O.J. confirmed the letter not to the Times, but to Devlin Barrett of the Post, and also allowed him to review it. Barrett and Matt Zapotosky broke the story for the Post just after 7 P.M. The Times immediately rushed out a story by Mark Mazzetti and Michael Schmidt, followed by other news outlets. By the next day, Times reporters had heard from contacts within the D.O.J. that the department had wanted “to teach Schmidt a lesson.” Here’s where the plot thickens: It turns out the Post had its first conversations about the letter with the D.O.J. the previous week, and from its perspective, it got the story fair and square.

In recent days, within the club of journalists who report on federal-law enforcement, there’s been a lot of chatter about how the Mueller letter leaked, and depending on who you talk to, the D.O.J. either laid some dark arts on the Times, or played ball with the Post in a respectable way. But the one thing that’s abundantly clear, based on hours of conversations I had about the episode on Friday, is that the tiff has only inflamed tensions between the D.O.J. and at least some of the Times reporters who cover it. (The Times and the D.O.J. declined to comment, as did the Post.)

Even before this, it’s safe to say there was no love lost between the D.O.J. and the Times, which by now has logged a deep backlist of stories—many carrying Schmidt’s byline—that have triggered conniptions at 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, such as last year’s article about Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein reportedly suggesting that he might secretly record President Donald Trump, or that piece from April 3 reporting that some members of Mueller’s team thought Barr “failed to adequately portray the findings of their inquiry.” At least one D.O.J. official has communicated to Times reporters that the department believes the Times sits on stories, only to drop them at crucial moments—say, immediately before a high-profile congressional hearing. As a journalist from another news outlet observed, “In general, there’s a lot of bad blood at this point.”

At the same time, the truth is that reporting can be a film-noir activity, filled with horse-trading and dirty tricks and black eyes. As another Times reporter familiar with the situation put it, “If you’re gonna play in this sandbox on a big story, shit like this happens. But the game goes on.”

"Ned Ryun: FBI, DOJ abuses in Russia collusion probe must be exposed – Lawbreakers should go to prison",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Ned Ryun', 'Ned Ryun Is The Founder', 'Ceo Of American Majority', 'A National Grassroots Organization. Learn More At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/ned-ryun-fbi-and-doj-abuses-in-russia-collusion-probe-must-be-exposed-lawbreakers-should-go-to-prison,"As the media and Democrats lose control of their fairy tale claim that there was collusion between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign to elect Donald Trump president, it is fascinating to watch them flailing about, doubling and even tripling down on a hoax and conspiracy theory.

Now Trump opponents have a growing sense of impending dread that the truth of what took place over the last several years might actually come to light.

We now have a real attorney general in William Barr. He refuses to cower in the face of careerists at the Justice Department and FBI, and he faces down congressional Democrats for the political hacks they are.

SARAH SANDERS: RUSSIA INVESTIGATION IS OVER, 'TIME FOR DEMOCRATS TO MOVE ON'

Barr has stated clearly that he believes there was spying on the 2016 Trump campaign. He has said there are multiple investigations currently taking place regarding illegal leaks from the Justice Department and FBI. And he has pledged to get to the bottom of apparent abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

Is it any wonder that there have been concerted attacks on Barr in recent weeks by Trump opponents to delegitimize the attorney general?

Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s report on FISA abuses will be coming out later this month or in June. We will then get some clarity and a detailed explanation of what took place regarding the FBI’s FISA applications to conduct surveillance of communications involving Carter Page, a foreign policy adviser on the Trump presidential campaign.

The only way we can deal with this abuse is to have serious consequences for these actions. People must go to prison for breaking the law.

As all of this is taking place, President Trump has said he will release the unredacted applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to authorize surveillance under FISA.

What we know right now is that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testified under oath to the House Intelligence Committee in December 2017 that the surveillance applications would not have been possible without the Steele dossier, a collection of memos assembled by former British spy Christopher Steele.

The dossier was described by former FBI Director James Comey as “salacious and unverified.”

We also know that this was substantiated by a memo from Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., and a memo for Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

The senators wrote in their memo that several of FISA applications were almost wholly based on the unsubstantiated Steele dossier.

There are rumors that the Horowitz report will be devastating to some individuals who were involved in the FISA process. What will likely happen after the release of the report is that Barr will use it as the basis to appoint and empower someone within the Justice Department to investigate the matter further. That person will be given the power to impanel grand juries, use subpoenas and seek indictments for prosecution.

Many of us have believed for the last several years that a small, but extremely powerful cabal within the intelligence community and law enforcement felt – because of their self-righteous arrogance and partisan leanings – that they could use the immense power of the surveillance state to conduct a partisan attack on a political opponent.

These officials felt justified in their actions because they believed Donald Trump was not a suitable person to be president of the United States and because they had policy differences with Trump.

All of what we have seen over the last several years has revealed the FISA safeguards are an utter sham. If FBI agents and Justice Department lawyers are willing to lie and falsify information to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court – and more importantly, if there are no consequences for those actions – then FISA is a joke. This also means that our civil liberties are a joke and we will have accepted a police state that can use a piece of partisan propaganda or anything else as a justification to spy on private citizens.

In addition, it appears that some in that cabal feared Trump becoming president because they believed he would demand great accountability and transparency inside of the intelligence and law enforcement community.

I hope that investigations likely coming out of the inspector general’s report will lead to answers regarding former CIA Director John Brennan’s role in giving credence to the Steele dossier.

And I hope the inspector general’s report will provide answers to why the initial FISA application authorizing surveillance of Page was approved and then renewed three more times.

I suspect that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judges took the FBI at its word and that someone who is guilty at a minimum of the crime of falsifying by omission did not admit to the court that the applications were based on a piece of partisan propaganda.

All of these things are deeply troubling because our surveillance and law enforcement regimes are based primarily on trust. Trust that those seeking FISA applications to surveil American citizens are being honest, and trust that they are above reproach.

The problem that we now confront is that the trust placed in these people and in the process has been shattered. We must remember that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was enacted in response to abuses at the FBI under Director J. Edgar Hoover, who headed the bureau from 1924 until his death in 1972.

During the Hoover years, the FBI spied on Americans based on suspicions without verified evidence. Targets of the spying included civil rights leader Martin Luther King, members of Congress and Vietnam War protesters.

As a response to these abuses, the FISA regime was created. FISA requires the FBI to have verified evidence that it must submit to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to gain approval to spy.

All of what we have seen over the last several years has revealed the FISA safeguards are an utter sham. If FBI agents and Justice Department lawyers are willing to lie and falsify information to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court – and more importantly, if there are no consequences for those actions – then FISA is a joke.

This also means that our civil liberties are a joke and we will have accepted a police state that can use a piece of partisan propaganda or anything else as a justification to spy on private citizens.

The only way we can deal with this abuse is to have serious consequences for these actions. People must go to prison for breaking the law.

I hope that in the midst of all of this, Attorney General Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray will realize that beyond serious consequences, there must be radical transparency to return trust in the Justice Department and FBI.

Barr and Wray need to understand that their greatest loyalty is to the Constitution, not to institutions, because it is upon that great document that those institutions rest. The Justice Department and FBI do not exist for the sake of the institutions, but to protect and guard our civil liberties and the rule of law. We would all do well to remember that.

Athens and Griffin fail to make shortlist for USDA agencies,https://www.ajc.com,[],,,,https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/athens-and-griffin-fail-make-shortlist-for-usda-agencies/gdymfyPnfGuqPs5HdEqy7N/,"Georgia failed to make the shortlist in the headquarters search for two research agencies that the U.S. Department of Agriculture wants to move out of Washington.

In a press release Friday, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue announced Indiana (multiple sites), the Greater Kansas City area and the Research Triangle region in North Carolina are the department’s top three candidates for the headquarters of the Economic Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture.

St. Louis and Madison, Wis., are listed as alternates.

The failure of Georgia’s two candidates — Athens and Griffin — to make the cut is a blow to a state some observers believed had an inside track to win the two agencies and more than 600 jobs. Perdue is a former governor of Georgia and a former state lawmaker.

“While we would have loved the opportunity to be on USDA’s shortlist, we look forward to connecting with the department and the site selection consultants to hear what we could have done to stay in the process,” said Bert Brantley, the chief operating officer of the state’s Department of Economic Development. “We always want to use these types of projects to get better for the next one that comes along.”

The department said its priorities included low costs of living and operations, workforce quality and access to an international airport.

“Relocation will help ensure USDA is the most effective, most efficient, and most customer-focused agency in the federal government, allowing us to be closer to our stakeholders and move our resources closer to our customers,” Perdue said in the release. “Our commitment to the public and our employees is to continue to be transparent as we proceed with our analysis.”

Though many of Georgia’s GOP congressional members supported the state’s bid, U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Albany, tried to block money for the move in spending bills. Bishop is the chairman of a House Appropriations subcommittee with power over USDA funding.

Bishop said Perdue hadn’t produced cost estimates justifying the move, and the congressman raised concerns about a relocation harming morale and the agencies’ objectivity.

The ERS and NIFA conduct and fund agricultural research. Many scientific groups also have panned Perdue’s plans to relocate the agencies.

On Friday, Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, applauded the inclusion of the Kansas City area on the department’s shortlist.

“There’s no better place for ERS and NIFA to relocate than Kansas City,” Roberts said in a news release.

Idaho still in running for Western headquarters of Interior Department | Idaho Statesman,https://www.idahostatesman.com,"['Dan Elliott', 'Kyle Green', 'Juan Zamorano', 'Kathia Martínez', 'Associated Press']",,,,https://www.idahostatesman.com/article230039514.html,"Boise is among the potential sites for a new Western headquarters of the Interior Department. A decision is expected by September. kgreen@idahostatesman.com

The U.S. Interior Department said Tuesday it plans to choose a Western city as the new headquarters for its vast public lands holdings by the end of September.

The department also said it may move the headquarters of its U.S. Geological Survey — best known for monitoring earthquakes and publishing detailed topographical maps — to the Denver area.

Both agencies currently have their headquarters in the Washington area.

The department wants to move the Bureau of Land Management to the West to be closer to the land it oversees. The bureau manages nearly 388,000 square miles (1 billion square kilometers), and 99% is in 12 Western states.

Officials said previously that Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico and Utah are in the running for the new bureau headquarters.

The proposed moves are part of a far-reaching Interior Department reorganization launched by then-Secretary Ryan Zinke. The plan includes consolidating 49 regional boundaries of eight sub-agencies into 12 unified regions.

Zinke — who stepped down in January amid ethics allegations — and current Interior officials have said the reorganization will make the department more efficient and bring policy makers closer to the people most affected by their decisions.

Skeptics, including some Democrats in Congress, say the plan is a waste of money and suggested it was a way to get rid of employees by forcing them to move or quit. Department officials dispute those claims.

Scott Cameron, a deputy assistant secretary at the department, appeared before the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight Investigations Tuesday to defend the plan. In testimony and a written statement, he said the department is still drawing up the details, including what the directors of the newly created regions would do.

Cameron said about 40 Bureau of Land Management positions would be moved West this year. He said the bureau would ask employees to move voluntarily rather than forcing them.

He said the department hopes to decide on the location for the new bureau headquarters by the end of the fiscal year, which is Sept. 30.

Cameron said the Geological Survey does not have money in this year’s budget to move many employees. He noted the agency already has a big presence in the Denver area, including the National Earthquake Information Center .

He said the Interior Department would ask Congress for another $27.6 million next year to continue the reorganization. Lawmakers approved $17.5 million for this year."
U.S. DOJ Moves to Detain Defendant in Crypto ‘Shadow Banking’ Case,https://www.coindesk.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.coindesk.com/u-s-doj-moves-to-detain-defendant-in-crypto-shadow-banking-case,"U.S. prosecutors are seeking to detain Reginald Fowler until his trial for operating an unlicensed money transmission business which may have processed funds for the Bitfinex crypto exchange.

In a court filing Wednesday – which was shared online but is not yet available on the government’s Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system – first assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Strange and assistant U.S. Attorney Gary Restaino detail concerns that Fowler may flee the country if he is not held in custody, citing his “disregard” for the FBI’s investigation last year.

Moreover, because “this scheme involves a staggering amount of money,” the U.S. government believes that Fowler may be able to avoid prosecution by accessing funds around the world.

“The government, through email search warrants, has obtained a document entitled ‘Master US Workbook,’ which details the financial operations of the scheme as of January 2019,” the filing says, adding:

“This workbook indicates that the scheme had received over $740 million in 2018 alone. It lists approximately sixty different bank accounts, held at both domestic and international banks, with a combined account balance of over $345 million as of January 2019. Notably, this workbook indicates that approximately $50 million is held in domestic accounts, with the rest located abroad.”

Fowler was charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmission service earlier this week by the U.S Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.

Alongside an associate, Tel Aviv-based Ravid Yosef, Fowler is alleged to have provided cryptocurrency exchanges with banking services illicitly and may be an operator of Crypto Capital, the payment processor at the heart of the Bitfinex/Tether scandal.

Indeed, the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) investigation may be one reason why Crypto Capital’s funds were frozen, which in turn hampered Bitfinex’s ability to process its customers’ withdrawals.

It was Bitfinex’s loss of access to some $850 million through Crypto Capital which resulted in its taking out a $625 million loan from Tether, the stablecoin issuer it is closely affiliated with.

The filing appears to confirm this, noting that “recent public reporting, which is corroborated in part through interviews conducted in the course of this investigation, indicates that companies associated with defendant have failed to return $851 million to a client of defendant’s shadow bank.”

Other crimes

Fowler may have also been involved in other crimes, the filing said. Roughly $14,000 in counterfeit bills – largely $100 bills – were recovered from Fowler’s office, indicating that he may have been involved in producing counterfeit money.

“Thus, it may be that this case is only one of multiple criminal and legal proceedings facing defendant,” the filing says.

Therefore, unless the prosecutors come to an agreement with Fowler with “a package of conditions,” his appearance at a hearing cannot be “reasonably assure[d],” and so he should be detained, Strange and Restaino wrote.

Fowler was arrested on April 30, and faces a maximum sentence of 30 years on the bank fraud charge.

DOJ attorneys defend Mueller's ability to investigate Trump in Roger Stone filing,https://www.cnn.com,['Katelyn Polantz'],05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/03/politics/doj-mueller-trump-investigation/index.html,"(CNN) The Justice Department attorneys prosecuting Roger Stone -- who no longer work under special counsel Robert Mueller -- defended the special counsel's investigation of President Donald Trump Friday, saying it inherently did not hamper his ability to lead the country.

The argument came amid a series of filings Friday night in Stone's case, in which prosecutors pushed back on the longtime Trump ally's legal attacks on Mueller and the criminal charges he faces . Stone has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him and asked the court to dismiss them.

""While the Department of Justice's position is that 'the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions,' it also takes the position that a criminal investigation during the President's term is permissible,"" the prosecutors wrote.

If the Constitution ""prevented any investigation of a President or his campaign while he was in office, the government could not preserve evidence while memories are fresh and documentary materials are available. Nor, it would seem, could the government conduct an investigation that may clear the President of alleged wrongdoing.""

State Department OKs nearly $6 billion in weapons sales to Gulf allies,https://www.reuters.com,"['Reuters Editorial', 'Min Read']",05-03-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-arms/state-department-oks-nearly-6-billion-in-weapons-sales-to-gulf-allies-idUSKCN1S924P,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved a possible $6 billion worth of weapons sales to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in three separate packages, the Pentagon said on Friday after notifying Congress of the certification.

The United States depends on allies in the region, including Saudi Arabia, to counter Iranian influence. In April, the U.S. moved ahead with part of a THAAD missile defense system sale to the kingdom.

In one of the notifications sent to Congress on Friday, Bahrain could potentially buy various Patriot missile systems and related support and equipment for an estimated cost of $2.48 billion. That potential Bahraini deal included 36 Patriot MIM-104E Guidance Enhanced Missiles known as GEM-T, an upgrade that can shoot down aircraft and cruise missiles.

In a separate State Department notification sent to Congress, Bahrain was also given the nod for various weapons to support its F-16 Block 70/F-16V aircraft fleet for an estimated cost of $750 million. That package included 32 AIM-9X missiles, 20 AGM-84 Block II Harpoon missiles and 100 GBU-39s which are 250-pound small diameter bombs and other munitions.

In a third State Department notification, the United Arab Emirates was given potential approval for $2.73 billion worth of Patriot missiles and related equipment including 452 Patriot Advanced Capability 3 (PAC-3) Missiles Segment Enhanced (MSE) and related equipment.

The Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale. The notification process alerts Congress that a sale to a foreign country has been approved, but it does not indicate that a contract has been signed or negotiations have concluded.

The principal contractors for the sales were Raytheon Co and Lockheed Martin Co."
Ginnie Mae considering changes to VA loan rules as refinances continue to soar,https://www.housingwire.com,"['Ben Lane Is The Editor For Housingwire. In This Role', 'He Helps Set A Leading Pace For News Coverage Spanning The Issues Driving The U.S. Housing Economy', ""Helps Guide Housingwire'S Overall Direction. Previously"", 'He Worked For Townsquarebuzz', 'A Hyper-Local News Service. He Is A Graduate Of University Of North Texas.']",,,,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/48962-ginnie-mae-considering-changes-to-va-loan-rules-as-refinances-continue-to-soar,"For more than 18 months, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Ginnie Mae, and the Department of Veterans Affairs have been investigating whether certain lenders are aggressively targeting service members and military veterans for quick and potentially risky refinances of their mortgages.

The investigation led to some lenders being booted from Ginnie Mae’s primary mortgage securities platforms, and other lenders being restricted for questionable conduct.

Ginnie Mae even went so far as to issue new rules for VA loan refinances, restricting how soon a loan could be refinanced after its original origination date.

And while Ginnie Mae says that those changes have made a positive impact on its mortgage-backed securities, the agency is also now stating that more changes may be necessary to get the pervasiveness of VA loan refinances under control.

Ginnie Mae on Friday announced that it is seeking input on potential changes to its rules for VA loans. Namely, the agency is considering making more changes to its rule to “address abnormal prepayment patterns in some mortgages pooled in Ginnie Mae MBS that negatively affect MBS pricing.”

Ginnie Mae offers federally insured mortgage bonds for FHA and VA mortgage lenders. And according to the agency, the frequency of refinances, specifically cash-out refinances, is having a negative impact on its mortgage bonds.

Specifically, Ginnie Mae said that some of its securities are not trading where they should be compared to securities issued by Fannie Mae. According to Ginnie Mae, it recently identified “certain adverse trends” in the trading of its securities.

“It’s clear from published analysis and investor commentary that GII MIP securities were believed to be susceptible to refinance activity out of proportion to what should be expected from prevailing economic conditions,” Ginnie Mae said in its request for input.

“Ginnie Mae’s concern, then and now, is that investor trepidation about this activity will negatively impact investor confidence in the performance of the securities and the relative price that they receive in the market,” Ginnie Mae added. “Deterioration in market pricing translates directly into a higher cost of homeownership for the homeowners the Ginnie Mae MBS program is intended to serve.”

Put simply, Ginnie Mae appears to be concerned that investors aren’t as attracted to its mortgage bonds because they prepay to often. MBS investors seek stability, not volatility. They want their payouts over time, when they expect them, at the amounts they expect them to be. If the loans are being prepaid too often, investors don’t get their expected payouts.

And when that happens, investors turn to other options (like Fannie Mae bonds apparently) for their expected returns.

Ginnie Mae appears to have a problem with that.

The bottom line, according to Ginnie Mae, is that the previous actions it took towards its bond programs had “moderate success” in decreasing the “refinance spikes” that seem to not make sense given market conditions, but the agency appears to not believe that its controls are “sufficient” enough yet.

“Non-correlated VA refinance activity continues to be evident, and the extent to which it is a focus of analysts and investors is unhealthy for Ginnie Mae’s ability to fulfill its mission,” Ginnie Mae.

One of the main issues, according to Ginnie Mae, is a rise in VA cash-out refinances, as detailed earlier this year by CoreLogic.

According to CoreLogic, last year, of all refinances on government-backed loans offered by the FHA and VA, 76% were cash-outs – the highest share in the 20 years that this data has been collected.

More than 106,000 cash-out refis were backed by the government in 2018, more than twice as may as there were in 2014.

Ginnie Mae previously attributed the overall surge to its toughened standards for VA refis, but those rules don’t apply to cash-outs, a loophole that it was predicted Ginnie Mae would address.

And now, Ginnie Mae is considering making more changes.

“Ginnie Mae is confronting a situation in which the GII MIP, because of the combination of greater volume of VA loans and present-day borrowing/lending practices, is being utilized to support short-term consumer financing for veterans to a greater degree than has previously been the case,” Ginnie Mae said.

Therefore, Ginnie Mae said that it is considering changing its rules to “excluding from (or restricting within) the GII MIP loan type categories that can be expected to prepay at significantly higher rates from the loan types whose performance is better correlated with market trends and the intended purpose of the GII MIP securities.”

More directly, the agency said that it may exclude or restrict VA cash-out refinances in excess of 90% loan-to-value ratio from being include in multi-issuer pools.

Beyond that, Ginnie Mae said it may consider offering single-issue custom securities, basically separating the lenders that appear to be refinancing more often; creating a new mortgage bond offering specifically designed to include “shorter duration loan type categories;” and other changes.

“Protecting the value of our securities and, thereby, the borrowers Ginnie Mae serves, is paramount and, as such, modifications to our pooling parameters are under consideration,” said Ginnie Mae Acting President Maren Kasper. “This RFI enables the agency to take views from a wide variety of stakeholders under consideration as we work to eradicate abnormal prepayment patterns that are negatively impacting the performance of the Ginnie Mae MBS program.”

U.S. may have to stop borrowing later this year: Treasury,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jason Lange', 'Min Read']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-treasury-refunding/u-s-may-have-to-stop-borrowing-later-this-year-treasury-idUSKCN1S73U4,"FILE PHOTO - A man walks away from the U.S Treasury Department in Washington, U.S., August 6, 2018. REUTERS/Brian Snyder

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government will have to stop borrowing money between July and December if Washington doesn’t agree to raise a legal restriction on public debt, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday.

Hitting that so-called “debt ceiling” could trigger a U.S. default on its debt and an immediate recession, a risk that has become a regular facet of U.S. politics over the last decade.

The current debt limit was set in March. Treasury has been able to continue borrowing from investors by using accounting measures such as limiting government payments to public sector retirement funds.

“Treasury expects that the extraordinary measures will be exhausted sometime in the second half of 2019,” Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary Brian Smith said in a statement announcing the department’s quarterly debt issuance plans.

Wall Street also sees Treasury exhausting its borrowing authority in the third or fourth quarter, according to the minutes of a meeting of a Treasury advisory committee of financiers.

The debt ceiling is already affecting how the government funds itself. Issuance of Treasury bills - short-term debt - is expected to gradually decline over the second quarter due to debt ceiling constraints, Smith said.

Treasury said it was holding issuance size steady for auctions of debt coupons during the third quarter, and that it anticipates no changes in the following three-month period either."
Mark Meadows sends criminal referral targeting Nellie Ohr to DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-criminal-referral-targeting-nellie-ohr-to-doj,"Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, is the subject of a criminal referral sent to the Justice Department on Wednesday.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., wrote up the referral addressed to Attorney General William Barr, citing concerns that Ohr ""knowingly provided false testimony"" last year to a joint task force of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees that were investigating decisions made by the Justice Department and FBI surrounding the 2016 election.

The Hill reported Meadows, a member of House Oversight, has filed a referral with the Justice Department in the evening Wednesday. The Washington Examiner has not independently confirmed it has been sent and has reached out to Meadows' office.

""During her transcribed interview, Ms. Ohr testified she 'would not have any knowledge of what [was] going on in an ongoing investigation' at DOJ and would not 'have any knowledge of the Department of Justice’s investigations on Russia.' Ms. Ohr also denied she shared her research on Russian organized crime and Donald Trump with individuals outside of Fusion GPS (her employer); her husband, DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele,"" Meadows wrote in the referral.

""However, documents reviewed by our committees raise concerns Ms. Ohr not only had knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation, but that she shared information and research on Russian organized crime to assist DOJ, in direct contradiction with her testimony,"" he added.

Ohr conducted research on connections between Russia and President Trump, having been contracted by Fusion GPS, the same opposition research firm behind the infamous Trump dossier. Meadows pointed to emails made public though a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch that show Ohr was in contact with Justice Department officials in 2016.

""For example, in March 2016, DOJ official Lisa Holtyn sent Bruce Ohr an email asking if Nellie would be able to speak with Ivana Nizich and Joe Wheatley to discuss her research as part of an ongoing investigation as she was told 'Nellie might be a great resource.' When Mr. Ohr checked if Nellie would feel comfortable speaking with DOJ, Nellie emailed 'Sure!'"" Meadows said.

""A separate email chain indicates Ms. Ohr shared her research on Russian organized crime in contradiction to her testimony. Specifically, on a separate email chain between Nellie Ohr, Mr. Ohr, Ms. Holtyn, and DOJ officials Joe Wheatley and Ivana Nizich, Ms. Ohr provides the Department of Justice with analysis of Shakro, a Russian mafia boss, and the separatists in the Donbass war,"" he added.

""Taking these communications into account, in addition to other information we have reviewed, Meadows said, ""Ms. Ohr misled the committees when she testified she would not have any knowledge of what was going on in an ongoing DOJ investigation, and that she had not shared her research outside of Fusion GPS, her husband, and Christopher Steele. Truthful witness testimony is crucial to the integrity of investigations conducted by the House of Representatives. Ms. Ohr violated her oath to tell the truth by making demonstrably false statements during her testimony before the Committee. Accordingly, I am referring Nellie Ohr to the Department of Justice for investigation of potential violation(s) of 18 U.S.C.§1001 et seq.""

Ohr testified to the Oversight and Judiciary committees in October. The transcript was made public by Judiciary ranking member Doug Collins in March.

The testimony focused heavily on her time with Fusion GPS and its relationship with the DOJ. Nellie Ohr said she met three times with Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier that contained unverified claims about Russia having compromising information about Trump. The last of those meetings took place on July 30, 2016, a day before the FBI initiated a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. It is believed that FBI agent Peter Strzok, now-infamous for exchanging anti-Trump text messages with a colleague, signed the order that launched the inquiry.

Ohr's husband, Bruce Ohr, acted as an unofficial back channel between the FBI and Steele. He was demoted when it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr also told lawmakers his wife shared a thumb drive with him to hand over to the FBI.

The dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, has been a subject of concern for GOP lawmakers, particularly for how it was used by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications to gain the authority to spy on onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

The FBI suspended its relationship with Steele in October 2016 for unauthorized contact with the media. Despite this, the FBI maintained an unofficial back channel with Steele up to at least November 2017 via Ohr

More criminal referrals from Meadows could be in the works. At an event Tuesday, the congressman said he knows of ""two or three individuals"" tied to Fusion GPS who could be the subject of criminal referrals for lying to Congress."
Homeland Security to launch pilot program of DNA testing at border,https://www.foxnews.com,['Samuel Chamberlain'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/homeland-security-to-launch-pilot-program-of-dna-testing-at-border,"Migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border with children will be asked to submit to a voluntary DNA test in order to prove they are related, Department of Homeland Security (DHS), officials said Wednesday.

The officials said the pilot program could be set up as soon as next week, but did not specify at which locations the tests would take place so as ""not to change the flow of people"" approaching the southern border.

Individuals who consent to the DNA test will be asked to swab their cheeks and those of the children with them before presenting the evidence to officials from DHS or Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The DHS officials said the testing would take an average of two hours to complete, after which the genetic data is to be destroyed and won't be used as evidence in any criminal case.

Information from the tests will be used to investigate individuals suspected of human trafficking, identity theft and other crimes. The officials added that someone claiming to be a child's legal guardian will have to provide supporting documentation.

""This pilot is by no means a silver bullet for these investigations,"" a DHS official said Wednesday. ""Trained professionals will continue to rely on a myriad of data inputs and their experience to determine whether a group presenting as a family unit is a fraud based on law enforcement observations, documentary evidence or other intelligence.""

Last month, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said the Border Patrol had identified more than 3,100 parents and children accused of making ""fraudulent claims"" between April 2018 and March of this year. That number coincides with a surge of border crossings by family units.

The Border Patrol says it made about 66,000 apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally in February, including 36,000 parents and children, a monthly high. ICE officials said that since Dec. 21 it had released 107,000 family members while they await court dates. The agency also says it has identified 101 possible instances of fraudulent families since April 18 and determined one-third were fraudulent

The fiscal year ending Oct. 1, 2018, saw more than 107,000 family units apprehended at the southwestern border, a 42 percent increase from the previous year, when more than 75,000 were apprehended. Since Oct. 1, ICE says it has uncovered more than 1,000 cases of fraudulent families and referred 45 cases for prosecution. The fraud could also include the use of false birth certificates or documents, and adults accused of fraud aren't necessarily prosecuted for it; some are prosecuted for illegal entry or other crimes.

Homeland Security officials have also warned of ""child recycling,"" cases where they say children allowed into the U.S. were smuggled back into Central America to be paired up again with other adults in fake families — something they say is impossible to catch without fingerprints or other biometric data.

But the department hasn't identified anyone arrested in such a scheme or released data on how many such schemes have been uncovered. Advocates say they're worried that in the name of stopping fraud, agents might take personal information from children that could be used against them later.

WASHINGTON (WRDW/WAGT)-- Tyson Foods recalls nearly 12 million pounds of frozen, ready-to-eat chicken strip products that may contain pieces of metal, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced Saturday.

Approximately 11,829,517 million pounds may be contaminated with ""extraneous materials,"" according to FSIS.

The frozen, ready-to-eat chicken strip items were produced on various dates from Oct. 1, 2018 through March 8, 2019 and have “Use By Dates” of Oct. 1, 2019 through March 7, 2020.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number “P-7221” on the back of the product package. These items were shipped to retail and Department of Defense locations nationwide, for institutional use nationwide and to the U.S. Virgin Islands.

In a Saturday press releases, FSIS says officials discovered the possible contamination after two consumer complaints but now, they are aware of six complaints involving pieces of metal alleged to have caused mouth injuries.

If you have purchased any of the ready-to-eat chicken strip products, you are urged to return them to the store or simply throw them away.

"Senators question whether Interior watchdog, solicitor nominees can handle mounting scandals",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/interior-scandals-trump-bernhardt-koch-e022d03abd43/,"Senators questioned two senior Interior Department nominees Thursday about their ability to fairly and independently do their work while the Interior secretary and several top officials are under investigation for potential ethics violations.

Daniel Jorjani, a former Koch adviser, would oversee legal, ethical, and public records decisions as solicitor. Mark Greenblatt would be responsible for probing these decisions as inspector general, head of the department’s internal watchdog.

These are among “the most important” roles at the Interior Department due to their oversight responsibilities, said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), ranking member on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, adding they must both be willing “to speak truth to power.”

The nominees, however, have come under scrutiny regarding concerns about Jorjani’s potential conflicts of interest along with questions about both Jorjani and Greenblatt’s ability to hold officials to account.

As inspector general, Greenblatt — an attorney who previously worked at the Commerce Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) — would be responsible for investigating allegations of ethics violations by Secretary David Bernhardt, including allegations that he failed to disclose controversial meetings on his public calendar.

There are also six other senior officials who are under investigation for potentially violating their ethics pledges due to interactions with former employers and clients.

In response to a question by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) regarding yet another scandal — the reported suppression of documents related to a Fish and Wildlife Service study on the impact of pesticides on endangered species — Greenblatt said, “I have zero intent of walking in the door and shutting down that investigation or any matter in front of the OIG.”

Testifying alongside Greenblatt on Thursday was Jorjani, a man who will likely be among those investigated by Greenblatt due to his role as acting solicitor since May 2017.

“The grotesque scandals at the Interior Department, in effect, are going to be part of an especially bizarre twist this morning,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) said as he began his questioning. “Jorjani believes he deserves an ethics promotion,” yet his work coincided with “a blizzard of ethical lapses by [former Secretary] Mr. Ryan Zinke.”

“Next to him is Greenblatt,” who is nominated to “a job charged with being a key line of defense against corruption,” Wyden continued.

Prior to his time at the Interior Department, Jorjani worked as a former adviser to Charles Koch as well as general counsel at Freedom Partners, a nonprofit funded by Charles and his brother David. The billionaire petrochemical brothers are well-known for funding climate science denial.

But as Hirono noted, the biography submitted by Jorjani to the committee failed to mention his years working for the Kochs. “It’s hard to imagine this did not impact your opinions [issued in favor of oil and gas at Interior],” she argued.

In his current role, Jorjani is facing a number of legal challenges, including his opinion issued in favor of narrowing of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to remove an Obama-era interpretation that allowed federal officials to prosecute energy companies that accidentally kill birds in the course of their business activities.

He also approved the release of mineral leases to a company planning a copper-nickel mine near Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

Both of these decisions were seen as victories for extractive industries.

Thursday’s hearing also provided an opportunity to question Jorjani about his work under the scandal-ridden former secretary, Ryan Zinke.

Jorjani boasted about having “successfully protected” Interior political appointees from facing investigations, according to a March 2017 email to colleagues, telling them it was their job to do the same for Zinke. “At the end of the day our job is to protect the Secretary,” he wrote.

In response to multiple questions on Thursday about this email, Jorjani claimed that he was speaking about protecting the secretary from the misuse of taxpayer money “and poor judgement” by another Interior official.

But Wyden countered that, instead, the responsibility should be “protecting the best interest of the American people before those of the secretary or special interests.”

Jorjani came under further scrutiny during the hearing for his role in overseeing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Right before stepping down, Zinke quietly issued a secretarial order giving Jorjani authority to oversee all FOIA requests at the department. A surge in requests, along with increased litigation and subsequent delays, were reasons given for the change. Jorjani would continue overseeing FOIA requests in the new role if confirmed.

Critics, however, have expressed concern that putting a political appointee in charge of public records requests gives the Trump administration greater power to withhold information from the public.

Given all of these issues, Wyden pressed Greenblatt on what specific steps he would take to “maintain your independence” while “someone like Mr. Jorjani is attempting to interfere with your work?”

“I have no problem making referrals over to the Department of Justice… I’ll have DOJ on speed dial if I need to,” Greenblatt replied, asserting he’d “follow the evidence wherever it goes.”

The committee must vote on both nominations before they advance to the Senate floor, where they will likely be confirmed by the Republican-controlled chamber."
"Devin Nunes demands CIA, FBI, NSA, and State Department hand over documents on Joseph Mifsud",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-asks-cia-fbi-nsa-and-state-department-for-docs-on-joseph-mifsud,"Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., is requesting documents from a slew of federal agencies about Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, the man who told former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos the Russians had thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails.

The House Intelligence Committee ranking member seeks information about who Mifsud was working for at the time and wrote in a letter that special counsel Robert Mueller “omits any mention of a wide range of contacts Mifsud had with Western political institutions and individuals"" in his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Mifsud, a London-based professor, has long been suspected to have deep ties to Russian intelligence and is an elusive figure that has stayed out of the spotlight in recent years.

Mueller's 448-page report, released last month with redactions, states that Mifsud traveled to Moscow in April 2016, after which he met Papadopoulos in London. It was at this meeting that Mifsud informed Papadopoulos that during his trip he learned that the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, President Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos later repeated this claim to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who informed the FBI and prompted the original counterintelligence investigation into President Trump's campaign in July 2016.

As part of Mueller’s Russia investigation, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and served 12 days in prison late last year.

The FBI interviewed Mifsud in the U.S. about his communications with Papadopoulos in early February 2017. The special counsel’s sentencing memo to the District Court for the District of Columbia said Papadopoulos hindered the FBI's ability to ""challenge"" Mifsud. ""The defendant’s lies undermined investigators’ ability to challenge the Professor or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States. The government understands that the Professor left the United States on February 11, 2017 and he has not returned to the United States since then,"" the memo said.

In his letter, Nunes says it is ""still a mystery how the FBI knew to ask Papadopoulos specifically about Hillary Clinton’s emails"" if the bureau had not spoken with Mifsud.

Nunes asks Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel, FBI Director Chris Wray, National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to hand over all documents they have on Mifsud by May 10.

The letter, obtained by the Washington Examiner, contains photographic evidence of Mifsud in close proximity to Western officials.

""If he is in fact a Russian agent, it would be one of the biggest intelligence scandals for not only the United States, but also our allies like the Italians and the Brits and others. Because if Mifsud is a Russian agent, he would know all kinds of our intelligence agents throughout the globe,"" Nunes said during an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity."
