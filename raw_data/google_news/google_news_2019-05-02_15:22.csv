CNN Poll: Trump's approval rating on the economy hits a new high,https://www.cnn.com,['Grace Sparks'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/02/politics/cnn-poll-trump-economy-2020/index.html,"(CNN) President Donald Trump hits a new high on his economic approval ratings in a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS , reaching 56% of Americans saying he's doing a good job on the economy.

The result comes on the heels of the announcement that the US economy grew at a much better rate than expected in the first quarter, and Trump's performance on the economy becomes one of his prime selling points for next year's general election.

Trump's previous high mark in CNN polling on handling the economy came in March 2017 when 55% approved. Since then, he's edged above 50% four times, but this is the first time it's been meaningfully over the 50% line.

White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney spelled out Trump's 2020 economic message on Tuesday -- suggesting voters would still be willing to support the President even if they don't like him personally.

""You hate to sound like a cliché, but are you better off than you were four years ago? It's pretty simple, right? It's the economy, stupid. I think that's easy. People will vote for somebody they don't like if they think it's good for them,"" Mulvaney said during a talk at the Milken conference in Los Angeles.

The economy is the President's best issue tested in the new poll, with his other approval ratings all below 50%. Even among those who disapprove of the way the president is handling his job generally, 20% say they approve of his work on the economy. That's larger than crossover approval for any other issue by 12 points.

The President's approval rating on the economy dipped to 48% earlier this year on the heels of the government shutdown. Since then, Trump has improved his ratings on the economy by double-digits among those under age 35 (up 16 points), non-whites (up 13 percentage points), independents (up 11 points), women (up 10 points) and even Democrats (up 10 points).

Trump's approval on health care policy has improved slightly since June 2018, up five points to 38%, his worst approval rating tested in the poll. Slightly more, 42% approve of how he's handling immigration and foreign affairs, and 39% approve of his handling of race relations.

His approval on race relations has increased since September 2017 -- up 6 percentage points -- but the last poll was taken amidst the protesting in the NFL by kneeling, when Trump called for owners to fire protesting players. His increases since 2017 came largely among conservatives, Republicans and whites.

At the same time, Trump's favorability rating has hit its highest point since the 100-day mark of his presidency: 45% of Americans have a favorable opinion of the President.

More, 54%, continue to hold a negative view. But the latest movement marks a 5-percentage point increase since a December 2018 poll. His largest favorability increases come among independents (up 9 percentage points), those with a college education (9 percentage points) and women (8 percentage points).

Half of Americans say Trump is doing a good job keeping the important promises he made during his presidential campaign, steady from October 2018.

Those numbers on the economy, favorability and promise-keeping -- along with the President's best approval ratings since April 2017 -- ought to bode well for his chances in 2020. But head-to-head match-ups with the top Democratic contenders for the nomination in this poll aren't overwhelmingly positive for the President.

Registered voters in the survey were randomly assigned three of the top six Democratic contenders and asked whether they would be more likely to vote for that person or for Trump in 2020. Support for each Democrat tested ranged from a low of 47% backing South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren over Trump to a high of 52% backing Beto O'Rourke over the president.

Joe Biden (51%), Bernie Sanders (50%) and Kamala Harris (49%) fell in between. Trump's numbers ranged from 42% to 48%.

Although some of the Democratic contenders do hold a meaningful edge over the President, these results suggest a close race at this point, and there is a lot of time for voters to change their minds. In CNN's first test of a general election matchup between Trump and Hillary Clinton in June of 2015, Clinton led Trump by 14 points among registered voters.

Although it is very early in the process, some patterns emerged across all these matchups that are worth noting.

Each Democratic candidate topped Trump by a double-digit margin among women, while Trump held an edge among men over each candidate tested. Whites without college degrees broke for Trump in each case, but whites with degrees split, favoring Trump in match-ups with Buttigieg, Warren, Sanders and Biden, but breaking in the Democratic Party's favor for Harris and O'Rourke.

Harris prompts the largest gap between whites without degrees and those who hold a four-year degree, with a nearly 40-point swing in preferences between the two groups. Non-whites favored the Democratic candidate in each matchup.

The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS April 25 through April 28 among a random national sample of 1,007 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.

Random half-samples can result in smaller subgroup sizes that fall below our minimum for publishing crosstabs for those groups. Members of groups not shown in the published crosstabs are fully represented in the results for each question in the poll. Unweighted sample sizes for registered voters under age 45 for each of the hypothetical 2020 matchups ranged from 111 to 127, for non-white voters they ranged from 107 to 130."

The former vice president’s campaign said that he had always acted to carry out United States policy without regard to any activities of his son, that he had never discussed the matter with Hunter Biden and that he learned of his son’s role with the Ukrainian energy company from news reports.

But new details about Hunter Biden’s involvement, and a decision this year by the current Ukrainian prosecutor general to reverse himself and reopen an investigation into Burisma, have pushed the issue back into the spotlight just as the senior Mr. Biden is beginning his 2020 presidential campaign.

They show how Hunter Biden and his American business partners were part of a broad effort by Burisma to bring in well-connected Democrats during a period when the company was facing investigations backed not just by domestic Ukrainian forces but by officials in the Obama administration. Hunter Biden’s work for Burisma prompted concerns among State Department officials at the time that the connection could complicate Vice President Biden’s diplomacy in Ukraine, former officials said.

“I have had no role whatsoever in relation to any investigation of Burisma, or any of its officers,” Hunter Biden said Wednesday in a statement. “I explicitly limited my role to focus on corporate governance best practices to facilitate Burisma’s desire to expand globally.”"

Shortly after Trump’s 2016 election victory, Moore quipped: “There’s that great cartoon going along, that the New York Times headline: ‘First thing Donald Trump does as president is kick a black family out of public housing.’ And it has Obama leaving the White House. I mean, I just love that one.”

“I shouldn’t have said it,” Moore said Tuesday on PBS’s “Firing Line with Margaret Hoover.”

TRUMP TO NOMINATE ECONOMIC ANALYST STEPHEN MOORE FOR FED BOARD AS CONSERVATIVE WATCHDOG OVER ECONOMY

The 2016 comment was the latest of Moore’s past columns and comments to be used as fodder against his nomination. CNN has reported that multiple columns Moore wrote appeared to be disparaging against women.

Moore has apologized, telling Fox News’ “Your World with Neil Cavuto” last week: ""Look, I'm no angel. If you go back 15, 18, 20 years as reporters are doing and look at things I have written in terms of the thousands of articles and, you know, hundreds and hundreds of media appearances I have done and speeches you will maybe be able to find things that I said that were impolitic.”

The controversy has spooked some of his GOP colleagues. At least a half-dozen GOP senators have publicly raised concerns. Sen. Joni Ernest, R-Iowa, who made headlines earlier this year after coming forward with her story of being raped by a former boyfriend, told reporters Monday: “(Moore’s) past writings are ridiculous. I’m not enthused about supporting him, let’s put it that way,” Politico reported.

Exclusive: Foreign government leases at Trump World Tower stir more emoluments concerns,https://www.reuters.com,"['Julia Harte', 'Min Read']",05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-emoluments-exclusive/exclusive-foreign-government-leases-at-trump-world-tower-stir-more-emoluments-concerns-idUSKCN1S80PP,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department allowed at least seven foreign governments to rent luxury condominiums in New York’s Trump World Tower in 2017 without approval from Congress, according to documents and people familiar with the leases, a potential violation of the U.S. Constitution’s emoluments clause.

The 90-story Manhattan building, part of the real estate empire of Donald Trump, had housed diplomats and foreign officials before the property developer became president. But now that he is in the White House, such transactions must pass muster with federal lawmakers, some legal experts say. The emoluments clause bans U.S. officials from accepting gifts or payments from foreign governments without congressional consent.

The rental transactions, dating from the early months of Trump’s presidency and first revealed by Reuters, could add to mounting scrutiny of his business dealings with foreign governments, which are now the subject of multiple lawsuits.

Congressional staffers confirmed to Reuters that the Trump World Tower lease requests were never submitted to Congress. Elijah Cummings, chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, said his committee has been “stonewalled” in its efforts to obtain detailed information about foreign government payments to Trump’s businesses.

“This new information raises serious questions about the President and his businesses’ potential receipt of payments from foreign governments,” Cummings said in a statement to Reuters. “The American public deserves full transparency.”

A State Department spokesperson referred Reuters to the Justice Department because the subject involved “matters related to ongoing litigation.” The Justice Department declined to comment. The White House referred a request for comment to the State Department and the Trump Organization, which did not comment.

The 1982 Foreign Missions Act requires foreign governments to get State Department clearance for any purchase, lease, sale, or other use of a property in the United States. Through the Freedom of Information Act, Reuters obtained diplomatic notes sent to the agency under this requirement from early 2015 until late 2017.

The records show that in the eight months following Trump’s January 20, 2017 inauguration, foreign governments sent 13 notes to the State Department seeking permission to rent or renew leases in Trump World Tower. That is more solicitations from foreign governments for new or renewed leases in that building than in the previous two years combined.

The governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Thailand and the European Union got the green light to rent a combined eight units in Trump World Tower and followed through with leases, according to other documents viewed by Reuters and people familiar with the leases. Five of those governments - Kuwait, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and the European Union - had also sought to rent units there in 2015 and 2016, State Department records showed.

Reuters could not confirm whether the State Department signed off on two other lease requests from Algeria and South Korea and three additional requests from Kuwait.

“Letting this go without Congress knowing about it condones the creation of a second, opaque track of foreign policy,” said Harold Hongju Koh, a professor at Yale Law School and former legal adviser at the State Department. “What it might lead to is a group of countries enriching the people in power on the mistaken belief that it’s going to improve their access.”

The 18-year-old luxury skyscraper is located next to the United Nations headquarters near the East River, and is not to be confused with Trump Tower, the Fifth Avenue landmark where Trump maintains a residence. Trump World Tower is controlled by a limited partnership owned by Trump and managed by the Trump Corporation, a Trump-owned company that draws its income from fees paid by unit owners, according to the building’s financial records.

When privately-owned units are leased, their owners typically use the rental income to cover those common charges, according to unit owners and real estate experts interviewed by Reuters. The State Department records did not make clear who owned the units in question.

The revenue Trump draws from foreign government business at his properties, such as the recently opened Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., has sparked lawsuits by U.S. lawmakers and the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, alleging this income violates the emoluments clause.

Trump’s attorneys have argued in court that the Constitution only requires him to seek congressional approval for foreign emoluments offered in connection with his role as president. Trump has retained ownership of his global business interests while president, but handed off day-to-day control to his oldest sons and a longtime company executive.

On Tuesday, a U.S. federal judge denied Trump’s motion to dismiss one of the emoluments lawsuits against him, saying Trump’s narrow definition of emoluments was “unpersuasive and inconsistent”. Courts may ultimately decide whether some of Trump’s business dealings violate the Constitution.

Issuing such judgments is not the job of the State Department office in charge of reviewing foreign government property requests, according to Patrick Kennedy, who from 2007 to 2017 was the top State Department official in charge of the internal administration of the agency. He said that office’s mandate is to screen for national security and diplomatic concerns, not for potential emolument violations.

If the State Department began obstructing requests from foreign governments to lease units in Trump-affiliated properties, he said, it could prompt them to retaliate against U.S. diplomats seeking housing in their territories.

“The State Department’s interest in saying ‘no’ is probably zero if there’s no security threat and we have good reciprocal relations with the countries,” Kennedy told Reuters.

‘CONVENIENT AND COMFORTABLE’

According to the State Department records obtained by Reuters, which covered the period from January 2015 through September 2017, Trump World Tower was the only Trump-affiliated building in the United States where foreign governments sought to lease or buy units.

In 2017, the median monthly asking rent for units in Trump World Tower was $8,500, according to real estate website StreetEasy. That was more than 2.5 times the median in the surrounding neighborhood, known as Turtle Bay.

Some of the foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia, had previously purchased property in the building, where the average unit currently sells for nearly $7 million, according to StreetEasy.

Mohammad Alkadi, a spokesman for the Saudi Mission to the United Nations, said Trump World Tower’s prime location near U.N. headquarters was the kingdom’s motivation to lease there.

“The governments pay for these units in the building not to get favors from Trump or anything, but just because it’s very convenient and comfortable for us,” Alkadi said. He said he moved into his own unit in Trump World Tower at the end of 2017.

The Trump administration has closely aligned itself with Saudi Arabia on a host of issues, despite a CIA assessment that the country’s crown prince ordered the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, and U.S. congressional opposition to American involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has driven millions of Yemenis to the brink of starvation.

Slovakia, another Trump World Tower renter, said in a statement that its lease was “fully in line with U.S. legislation and our internal guidelines.” Slovakia’s prime minister is scheduled to meet with Trump at the White House on May 3 to discuss security cooperation and other issues.

The Malaysian mission to the United Nations said it was not currently renting a unit in Trump World Tower when reached by phone in April. It declined to comment on the unit it rented in 2017. That lease was confirmed to Reuters by a person familiar with the transaction.

All the other governments that sought to rent units after Trump’s inauguration declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.

In 2017, the president earned more than $15 million in management and related fees through the properties managed by the Trump Corporation, according to the president’s financial disclosure. The document did not reveal how much of that sum came from Trump World Tower.

Limbaugh: Sen. Hirono's treatment of Barr due to 'poisonous hatred' for Trump,https://www.foxnews.com,['Victor Garcia'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/limbaugh-sen-hironos-treatment-of-barr-due-to-poisonous-hatred-for-trump,"Radio host Rush Limbaugh ripped Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii Wednesday over her treatment of Attorney General William Barr during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Mueller report, calling her “ignorant” and “a liar.”'

Limbaugh said Hirono mischaracterized Barr's work and -- like Sen. Lindsey Graham-- accused the senator of ""slandering"" his integrity. ""He didn’t change anything in the Mueller report,” Limbaugh said on his radio show.

BARR: MUELLER REPORT IS DONE. WE NEED TO STOP USING DOJ AS 'POLITICAL WEAPON'

Barr's testimony Wednesday was wide-ranging. It covered his decision not to pursue an obstruction case against President Trump and the delay in the release of the redacted version of the report.

Hirono accused Barr of lying to Congress and said he should resign.

""Mr. Barr, now the American people know that you are no different from Rudy Giuliani or Kellyanne Conway or any of other people who sacrifice their once-decent reputation for the grifter and liar who sits in the Oval Office,"" Hirono said to Barr during a long build-up to a question.

Committee chairman, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., cut Hirono off. ""You slandered this man from top to bottom,"" Graham said to the Hawaii senator.

Limbaugh argued that Hirono never intended to ask any meaningful questions to Barr but really intended to hurt his “integrity.”

“It was the kill session. Her mission during these hearings has been to kill Barr professionally, and his integrity,” Limbaugh said.



The radio host blamed Hirono’s “poisonous hatred” for President Trump for her treatment of Barr.



“I think it is her essential consuming, poisonous hatred for Donald Trump, and Barr is the way she can get to Trump today, so Barr becomes her target,” Limbaugh said."
Mark Meadows sends criminal referral targeting Nellie Ohr to DOJ,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mark-meadows-sends-criminal-referral-targeting-nellie-ohr-to-doj,"Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, is the subject of a criminal referral sent to the Justice Department on Wednesday.

Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., wrote up the referral addressed to Attorney General William Barr, citing concerns that Ohr ""knowingly provided false testimony"" last year to a joint task force of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees that were investigating decisions made by the Justice Department and FBI surrounding the 2016 election.

The Hill reported Meadows, a member of House Oversight, has filed a referral with the Justice Department in the evening Wednesday. The Washington Examiner has not independently confirmed it has been sent and has reached out to Meadows' office.

""During her transcribed interview, Ms. Ohr testified she 'would not have any knowledge of what [was] going on in an ongoing investigation' at DOJ and would not 'have any knowledge of the Department of Justice’s investigations on Russia.' Ms. Ohr also denied she shared her research on Russian organized crime and Donald Trump with individuals outside of Fusion GPS (her employer); her husband, DOJ attorney Bruce Ohr, and Christopher Steele,"" Meadows wrote in the referral.

""However, documents reviewed by our committees raise concerns Ms. Ohr not only had knowledge of an ongoing DOJ investigation, but that she shared information and research on Russian organized crime to assist DOJ, in direct contradiction with her testimony,"" he added.

Ohr conducted research on connections between Russia and President Trump, having been contracted by Fusion GPS, the same opposition research firm behind the infamous Trump dossier. Meadows pointed to emails made public though a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch that show Ohr was in contact with Justice Department officials in 2016.

""For example, in March 2016, DOJ official Lisa Holtyn sent Bruce Ohr an email asking if Nellie would be able to speak with Ivana Nizich and Joe Wheatley to discuss her research as part of an ongoing investigation as she was told 'Nellie might be a great resource.' When Mr. Ohr checked if Nellie would feel comfortable speaking with DOJ, Nellie emailed 'Sure!'"" Meadows said.

""A separate email chain indicates Ms. Ohr shared her research on Russian organized crime in contradiction to her testimony. Specifically, on a separate email chain between Nellie Ohr, Mr. Ohr, Ms. Holtyn, and DOJ officials Joe Wheatley and Ivana Nizich, Ms. Ohr provides the Department of Justice with analysis of Shakro, a Russian mafia boss, and the separatists in the Donbass war,"" he added.

""Taking these communications into account, in addition to other information we have reviewed, Meadows said, ""Ms. Ohr misled the committees when she testified she would not have any knowledge of what was going on in an ongoing DOJ investigation, and that she had not shared her research outside of Fusion GPS, her husband, and Christopher Steele. Truthful witness testimony is crucial to the integrity of investigations conducted by the House of Representatives. Ms. Ohr violated her oath to tell the truth by making demonstrably false statements during her testimony before the Committee. Accordingly, I am referring Nellie Ohr to the Department of Justice for investigation of potential violation(s) of 18 U.S.C.§1001 et seq.""

Ohr testified to the Oversight and Judiciary committees in October. The transcript was made public by Judiciary ranking member Doug Collins in March.

The testimony focused heavily on her time with Fusion GPS and its relationship with the DOJ. Nellie Ohr said she met three times with Christopher Steele, the author of the dossier that contained unverified claims about Russia having compromising information about Trump. The last of those meetings took place on July 30, 2016, a day before the FBI initiated a counterintelligence investigation into links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. It is believed that FBI agent Peter Strzok, now-infamous for exchanging anti-Trump text messages with a colleague, signed the order that launched the inquiry.

Ohr's husband, Bruce Ohr, acted as an unofficial back channel between the FBI and Steele. He was demoted when it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr also told lawmakers his wife shared a thumb drive with him to hand over to the FBI.

The dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, has been a subject of concern for GOP lawmakers, particularly for how it was used by the FBI in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications to gain the authority to spy on onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

The FBI suspended its relationship with Steele in October 2016 for unauthorized contact with the media. Despite this, the FBI maintained an unofficial back channel with Steele up to at least November 2017 via Ohr

More criminal referrals from Meadows could be in the works. At an event Tuesday, the congressman said he knows of ""two or three individuals"" tied to Fusion GPS who could be the subject of criminal referrals for lying to Congress."
"EPA says Roundup weed killer is safe, in a win for Bayer",https://www.cbsnews.com,['Kate Gibson'],,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/roundup-weed-killer-is-safe-epa-says-giving-bayer-a-win/,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gave Bayer a boost when it decided that its Roundup week killer didn't cause cancer.

Two recent court cases found just the opposite, ruling against Bayer and Roundup.

Environmental advocates, including the National Resources Defense Council, denounced the EPA's decision.

After two recent defeats in court, Bayer has won a round — this one delivered by regulators — as it contends with more than 10,000 lawsuits claiming a chemical in its widely used Roundup weed killer causes cancer. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday said it ""continues to find that there are no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label and that glyphosate is not a carcinogen.""

The agency said its findings were consistent with those of ""many other countries and other federal agencies."" But environmental advocates, including the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) denounced the decision.

""Health agencies and credible non-industry experts who've reviewed this question have all found a link between glyphosate and cancer,"" Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at NRDC said in a statement. The World Health Organization in 2015 termed glyphosate as ""probably carcinogenic to humans.""

Jury finds Monsanto's Roundup weed killer contributed to man's cancer

Bayer, which acquired Roundup in 2018 when it purchased U.S. agricultural chemical company Monsanto, called the agency's review ""significant,"" reiterating its stance that ""science supports the safety of glyphosate-based herbicide."" The EPA's stance reaffirmed earlier findings by the agency on the safety of the glyphosate, but it differs greatly from that of jury rulings in recent years that found the chemical caused cancer in two people.

Since acquiring Roundup with its purchase of Monsanto last year for $66 billion, Bayer's legal losses have helped knock $39 billion off its market value. In addition to lawsuits, Bayer has found itself trying to tamp down a bout of unwelcome PR that came with reports by consumer groups contending traces of the chemical were showing up in beer and wine, as well as some children's cereals. Bayer dismissed the claims as ""misleading.""

Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in U.S. agriculture. Beyond its use by farmers, Roundup is sprayed on golf courses and residential lawns to kill weeds.

Bayer has also helped finance damage control on behalf of Scotts Miracle-Gro, to which it licenses its consumer business. Scotts CEO Jim Hagedorn told analysts in a conference call that the controversy made the future less than clear. ""I can't predict that it's going to be as good next year,"" Hagedorn said Wednesday. ""It's the court of public opinion and consumers that matter here."""

REUTERS/Brian Snyder

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government will have to stop borrowing money between July and December if Washington doesn’t agree to raise a legal restriction on public debt, the Treasury Department said on Wednesday.

Hitting that so-called “debt ceiling” could trigger a U.S. default on its debt and an immediate recession, a risk that has become a regular facet of U.S. politics over the last decade.

The current debt limit was set in March. Treasury has been able to continue borrowing from investors by using accounting measures such as limiting government payments to public sector retirement funds.

“Treasury expects that the extraordinary measures will be exhausted sometime in the second half of 2019,” Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary Brian Smith said in a statement announcing the department’s quarterly debt issuance plans.

Wall Street also sees Treasury exhausting its borrowing authority in the third or fourth quarter, according to the minutes of a meeting of a Treasury advisory committee of financiers.

The debt ceiling is already affecting how the government funds itself. Issuance of Treasury bills - short-term debt - is expected to gradually decline over the second quarter due to debt ceiling constraints, Smith said.

Treasury said it was holding issuance size steady for auctions of debt coupons during the third quarter, and that it anticipates no changes in the following three-month period either."

I cannot help but smile when I think upon our friendship, Mr. President. (Jim Bourg/Reuters)

Columnist

“As I submit my resignation effective on May 11, I am grateful to you for the opportunity to serve: for the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations, and for the goals you set in your inaugural address: patriotism, unity, safety, education, and prosperity, because “a nation exists to serve its citizens.” The Department of Justice pursues those goals while operating in accordance with the rule of law. The rule of law is the foundation of America. It secures our freedom, allows our citizens to flourish, and enables our nation to serve as a model of liberty and justice for all.”

— An actual quote from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein’s resignation letter

Dearest Mr. President,

The Justice Department made rapid progress in achieving the administration’s law enforcement priorities — namely, to use the law enforcement tools on literally any subject except for you. We have staffed the department and the U.S. attorneys’ offices with skilled and principled leaders, sometimes both, devoted to the values that make America great — in the sense that “making America great” means “getting you into office and keeping you there.”

Our nation is safer, our elections are more secure, and, most important of all, our citizens are better informed about all the ways you were not involved in covert foreign influence efforts and schemes to commit fraud.

I am just so grateful to you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to serve the American people — but who embodies the people better than you, a living god who can do no wrong, legally? Donald Trump is one of the best things about America. You have displayed such incredible courtesy and humor in our personal conversations. I understand that you feel the need to hide these virtues from the rest of the world, but I am so glad you had the courage to share them with me.

Your courtesy and humor go without saying — why, I remember the time you made Reince Priebus swat a fly, and I’ve always thought that was a display of both. Your courtesy and humor are only exceeded by your wisdom and wit, or is it the other way around? You are as beautiful as a freshly dedicated Trump property.

Am I Deutsche Bank? Because I want to get you a loan, and I trust every statement you have made about your personal valuations. Is that a mirror in your administration? Because after giving my soul away, I’m going to miss seeing myself in it. Are you holding a copy of the entire unredacted Mueller report, or is that how large your hands are normally? I honestly cannot tell. Also, you smell nice.

If I ever attempted to record you, it was only so I could have a treasury of your remarks to pore over on long winter nights and re-cherish each pearl of wisdom.

Your pores are very clear, by the way, and you have an eloquence like that of Julius Caesar — although he spoke Latin, which almost nobody understands, whereas you speak English, the greatest English of anyone, and are understood immediately by all. Whenever you make statements, or issue new guidance about immigration, I see people weeping, probably from the beauty. I don’t weep. I smile.

Here at the Justice Department, we enforce the law without fear or favor, because justice is not partisan (though if it were, it would be Republican, 100 percent), and truth is not determined by opinion poll (although it is true that every opinion poll released places Trump at the very top!). We ignore fleeting distractions, such as the Mueller report, because a republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle. Indeed, it might be better off without a news cycle at all, especially if that news continues to say mean things about the president.

Here at the Justice Department, we keep the faith, we follow the rules, and we put America first, not in the sense of the folks who wanted us to pursue a bad, insular policy and ignore the rise of Nazism, but the other sense. I’m sure there is another sense.

LYLADAG,

Conducting oversight on Trump makes us seem obsessed and creepy, House Republicans worry

Trump administration confused as to why an inaccurate census is a ‘bad thing’"
Trump’s Labor Department weighed in on gig workers’ rights.,https://www.vox.com,['May'],05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/5/1/18525459/gig-economy-labor-department-trump-uber-lyft-doordash-taskrabbit,"Approximately 57 million people in the US do some sort of work in the gig economy. Some of them drive cars for Uber and Lyft, deliver groceries for Instacart and Doordash, walk dogs for Wag and Rover, clean houses through Task Rabbit and Handy, and manage apartment properties on Airbnb.

The market has grown quickly over the past few years, bringing in as much as $864 billion annually, according to some estimates. And with it, there’s been a lot of talk about the rights of these workers. They’ve been fighting for fair treatment for a while now; since they’re considered contractors, they don’t get benefits like insurance, worker’s comp, or paid vacation. Sociologists, labor experts, and economists have all weighed in on the issue, largely agreeing that gig workers deserve the same fair treatment as regular employees.

On April 29, the United States Labor Department offered its own interpretation on the matter. After a lawyer working for an unnamed cleaning company reached out to clarify how gig workers should be classified, the department responded in a letter that’s since been posted online. In the letter, the Labor Department said it classifies gig workers as contractors, not employees:

“Based on the facts you provide in your letter, it appears that the service providers who use your client’s virtual marketplace are independent contractors. Your client provides a referral service. As such, it does not receive services from service providers, but empowers service providers to provide services to end-market consumers.”

The letter could have huge implications for the future of the gig economy. It essentially renders gig workers exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act, a law written in 1938 that guarantees overtime pay and a minimum wage to many who work more than 40 hours.

It’s caused plenty of disagreement. On Monday, the National Employment Law Project tweeted that the letter essentially allows gig economy companies to “underpay and overwork” this class of workers.

DOL opinion letter attempts to allow an unnamed #GigEconomy company to underpay and overwork its workers by misclassifying them as independent contractors. But if workers have all the restrictions of employees, they should get the protections. https://t.co/b6m5NFlFaF — NELP (@NelpNews) April 29, 2019

So what’s the department’s logic? It reasoned that, because the unnamed cleaning company doesn’t pay for professional certification, licensing, or let workers expense products, they should clearly be seen as contractors. It also points out that since workers don’t have set hours or shifts, they should be free to “pursue any and all external opportunities at their leisure,” which means that the company should not be seen as the main party responsible for them.

This type of reasoning is pretty different from how the Labor Department under Barack Obama’s administration viewed the gig economy. In 2015, for example, it issued a new interpretation of the word “employ,” writing that the administration believes “most workers” should be included in the FSLA. Obama’s Labor Department called on Uber and Lyft to reconsider how they classify their workers, pointing out that one crucial detail in the debate of contractor versus employee was whether the workers are “integral,” and that drivers were, indeed, integral to Uber and Lyft.

This opinion, though, has all but been abandoned by the Trump administration, as the New York Times points out. Trump’s Labor Department largely tossed Obama’s favorable interpretations of gig workers in favor of Silicon Valley.

The Labor Department’s letter does not necessarily represent the law; the opinion currently only applies to the unnamed cleaning company that had written to the agency. But as Reuters notes, though, it “can be presented in court to boost claims by plaintiffs or defendants in cases involving similar issues.”

Public opinion can work in favor of these workers’ rights, however. Back in February, for example, grocery delivery app users were outraged to learn about allegations of tipping theft at Instacart and DoorDash, and vowed to stop using these services. This response led Instacart to revamp its tipping policy. Uber and Lyft, too, have responded to public pressure, and agreed in December 2018 to pay drivers in New York City a minimum wage of $17.22 an hour. So even if the current administration isn’t on the side of gig workers, outside pressure could still result in change.

(Jose Cabezas/Reuters)

Homeland Security officials said Wednesday they will start an “unprecedented” pilot program to test the DNA of families arriving at the U.S. border as soon as next week, calling the measure an investigative tool to root out fraudulent cases of migrants traveling with children who are not their own.

Under the pilot program, Homeland Security investigators can request cheek-swab DNA samples if they suspect that an adult and a minor claiming to be family members do not in fact have a parent-child relationship.

A record number of Central American families have been crossing the southern border with Mexico in recent months, and DHS officials say the migrants are taking advantage of “loopholes” in the U.S. immigration system that enable those arriving with a child to avoid detention and swift deportation.

A private contractor, Ande, which specializes in “rapid DNA” screening for law enforcement and other government purposes, will conduct the DNA tests at the border. Results will be available in two hours, DHS officials said, after which samples and data will be destroyed.

“This pilot will help us determine whether this technology can strengthen our investigative processes and potentially rescue more children from dangerous situations,” said a DHS official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to brief reporters.

DHS officials said they have detected more than 1,000 cases of fraudulent families trying to cross the border since October, reaching that determination through document screenings and other traditional investigative methods. The agency has been reluctant to introduce DNA testing procedures, in part because of privacy and data storage concerns, officials said.

In some instances, migrant children are paired with uncles, cousins or other relatives who might not be a parent but are part of the same family. But there have been other, more worrisome allegations that some desperate families are accepting payment in exchange for allowing their children to travel with adults who view the minors as an entry ticket to the United States.

[For Central Americans, children open a path to the U.S.--and bring a discount]

Jennifer Podkul, senior policy director at Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), said she is concerned that legitimate families — including those traveling with adopted children — could be separated because of the DNA tests.

“We have one case of a child who said, ‘That’s my dad,’ but didn’t know he was the stepfather,” she said. “That’s very different from being smuggled by a human trafficker.”

DHS officials say the DNA tests will be one of several investigative methods they will employ, and they will evaluate the full circumstances of suspected fraud cases to target criminal acts.

Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), will lead the pilot program — not the U.S. Border Patrol. But officials said they view the program as a chance to evaluate its potential for expanded use.

HSI teams working on the pilot said they have interviewed 101 parents and children since April 18 who “presented indices of fraud,” and detected 29 families making false claims. From those investigations, 45 individuals were referred for prosecution and attorneys filed charges against 33, officials said.

If U.S. authorities determine that a child is not with a biological parent, they typically separate them and refer the minor to the Department of Health and Human Services, which operates a network of shelters of “unaccompanied” migrant children.

Other cases that DHS considers fraudulent involve parents arriving with children who claim to be underage but are, in fact, older than 18. And officials said document fraud is common at the border; homeland security officials say that corrupt officials in Central American countries — especially in Guatemala — have been issuing inexpensive fake birth certificates.

This year, unauthorized border crossings have surged to their highest levels in more than a decade, and U.S. authorities along the Mexico border detained more than 103,000 migrants in March. Nearly 60 percent were families, a greater share than ever, and large groups of migrants continue to cross the border and surrender to U.S. authorities, often to request asylum.

Many of the Central Americans say they are fleeing violence and desperate poverty, but there are financial incentives to bring children on the journey. Smuggling organizations offer discount pricing, because families need only be escorted to the U.S. border — not across it — so they can surrender to U.S. agents and start the asylum process."
Roundup cancer cases could cost Bayer billions,https://fox2now.com,['Cnn Wires'],05-01-2019,2019,5,https://fox2now.com/2019/05/01/roundup-cancer-cases-could-cost-bayer-billions/,"A popular weedkiller is wreaking havoc at drugs and chemicals giant Bayer.

The inventor of aspirin is in the grip of a huge shareholder revolt after its $63 billion purchase of Roundup owner Monsanto put the German company at risk from thousands of US cancer lawsuits tied to the weedkiller.

Over 55% of voting shareholders did not endorse the actions of management during last Friday’s annual meeting, a rebuke that Berenberg bank analyst Sebastian Bray described as “unprecedented” in Germany.

Investors have cause to be upset. Bayer’s stock price has collapsed by 40% since the Monsanto deal closed in June 2018. The company is now only worth roughly what it paid for the US chemical maker.

While not binding, the shareholder vote increased pressure on CEO Werner Baumann and forced Bayer’s supervisory board to issue a statement reiterating its support for the leadership team.

Roundup lawsuits

The purchase of Monsanto, which took almost two years for regulators to approve, didn’t always look like a dud.

Dow and DuPont had already announced a tie-up in agrochemicals when the Monsanto deal was struck in September 2016. So had ChemChina and Switzerland’s Syngenta. Bayer, the thinking went, needed to act in order to stay competitive.

But events over the past year have cast serious doubt on the wisdom of the purchase.

Two US juries have sided with men who claimed that glyphosate, the key ingredient in Roundup, caused them to develop cancer. Bayer is appealing both rulings but could be on the hook for tens of millions of dollars in payouts.

That could be just the beginning. Bayer faces glyphosate lawsuits from roughly 13,400 US plaintiffs.

The company says that scientific research proves glyphosate is safe when used as directed, and is not carcinogenic. The US Environmental Protection Agency said the same earlier this week. But Bayer could still opt to settle the thousands of pending cases, according to analysts.

Damien Conover, an analyst who covers Bayer for Morningstar, estimates that it could wind up paying €2 billion ($2.2 billion) in costs related to glyphosate litigation.

In a worst-case scenario, Conover predicts costs could rise above €13 billion ($14.6 billion). It’s hard to put an exact number on the liability without knowing more about the quality of the cases, he said.

Moody’s said in a report Tuesday that settlement payments of €5 billion ($5.6 billion) would be manageable, but €20 billion ($22.4 billion) in payments could affect the company’s credit rating.

The question from investors is whether management did their homework on Monsanto. Some believe it’s time to consider dramatic structural changes, such as dividing up Bayer’s pharmaceutical and agriculture businesses.

“They are of the opinion that US legal liabilities are difficult to quantify and unlikely to go away any time soon,” Bray said.

Shareholder ire

Concerns about the company’s legal exposure were on full display at last week’s shareholder meeting.

Ingo Speich, who represented Deka Investment at the event, said he voted against the management because the Monsanto deal had been “value destroying.”

Deka is demanding “far more transparency” on the potential financial impact of litigation, Speich said. “The biggest problem with the share price is uncertainty,” he added.

Bayer Chairman Werner Wenning said in the statement of support for management that the “top priority” is to “vigorously and successfully defend the company” in court proceedings related to glyphosate.

Baumann, the CEO, acknowledged that the Roundup lawsuits and early verdicts had placed a “heavy burden” on the company and its investors. But he said market reaction had been “exaggerated.”

He argued that the company was right to purchase Monsanto and that the acquisition was already contributing to the company’s bottom line.

Investors are unlikely to reward the company’s performance before its legal liability becomes clear.

“The market is not apt to give the company much credit as clouds of uncertainty hang over the business,” Bray said.

DOJ lays out case for striking down Obamacare in its entirety,https://www.cnn.com,"['Ariane De Vogue', 'Cnn Supreme Court Reporter']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/politics/affordable-care-act-lawsuit-trump/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration offered its first full argument Wednesday for its reversal on the Affordable Care Act, arguing in new court filings that the entire law ""should not be allowed to remain in effect.""

The government argues in the filings that the so-called ""individual mandate"" requiring Americans to have coverage is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law should therefore also be struck down, even if the government ""might support some individual provisions as a policy matter.""

The landmark legislation provides health care coverage to millions of Americans.

In the filing, Assistant Attorney General Joseph Hunt acknowledged that the administration had previously argued that parts of the law could remain in effect even if the individual mandate were struck down, but he said, the administration had come to believe it could no longer defend that position. He suggested that rewriting the statute by ""picking and choosing which provisions to invalidate"" would interfere with the role of Congress and the ""proper course"" for the courts would be to strike down the law in its entirety.

The brief was filed with the conservative-leaning 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which will hear arguments in July and possibly tee up a Supreme Court case next term that could finally decide the fate of the law and render a decision during the heart of the presidential election.

The Justice Department Suddenly Changed Its Mind About the Constitution to Defend Trump’s Businesses,http://time.com,['Kathleen Clark'],,,,http://time.com/5581308/trump-emoluments-justice-department/,"When Justice Department lawyers introduce themselves in court, they proclaim a specific affiliation: “I represent the United States.” That’s because the Justice Department has the responsibility by statute to represent the interests of the nation. That obligation to act on behalf of the nation has also motivated the Department’s legal advice on a question central to the integrity of our democracy — until now. Recent arguments show that the Department is putting President Trump’s interests before the nation’s.

For more than 150 years, the Department interpreted the Constitution’s “emoluments” clause to protect the government from the corrupting influence of foreign powers through gifts, emoluments and titles. The Department has issued more than 50 legal opinions declaring that the clause prohibits important federal officials from accepting anything of value — even token gifts — from such powers, unless Congress consents.

The prohibitions went further. Engineers and scientists who work for the federal government are prohibited from accepting any benefit (including consulting fees or travel reimbursement) that comes from a foreign government. The Department even prohibited a part-time federal employee who was also a partner in a law firm from accepting any money from the firm’s legal work for foreign governments, even though he had not worked on those cases, because “the partnership would in effect be a conduit” for foreign governments. When it interpreted this constitutional clause, the Department explicitly examined whether the particular payment “would raise the kind of concern [i.e.,] the potential for ‘corruption and foreign influence’… that motivated the Framers in enacting the constitutional prohibition.” At every turn, the Justice Department was on the lookout to ensure that federal officials did not accept direct or indirect foreign government payments.

But starting two years ago, the Department veered away from this long track record. In response to three lawsuits filed by an anti-corruption group, Democratic members of Congress and, jointly, the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia, the Department chose to defend President Trump’s ability to receive money from foreign governments instead of defending the republic. (On April 30, a U.S. District Judge ruled that the Congressional Democrats’ case can move forward.)

Trump’s personal lawyers have argued that the emoluments clause allows Trump — and all federal officials — to accept unlimited amounts of money from foreign governments, as long as those payments are in the form of commercial transactions with a business owned by the federal official. Contradicting its entire history, the Department adopted Trump’s lawyers’ argument, contending that the emoluments clause only prohibits compensation in exchange for a “personal service in his capacity as [an] officeholder” — in other words, a bribe.

Under this new interpretation of the emoluments clause, the government’s engineers and scientists would still be prohibited from accepting travel reimbursements from a foreign government, but any federal official who owns a company may accept unlimited amounts of money from foreign governments through commercial transactions. In effect, the Justice Department now claims that our founders only wanted to prohibit officials from receiving a second salary from a foreign government.

Foreign governments appear to be falling over themselves to spend money at Trump properties. Saudi Arabia’s lobbyists spend lavishly at Trump’s hotels in Washington, D.C., and New York City. Bookings at Trump’s Chicago hotel from Saudi Arabia have more than doubled since 2016, while bookings from Qatar have increased 17 times over the same period. The governments of Kuwait, Malaysia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain and the Philippines host multiple events at Trump properties, with the Philippines ambassador acknowledging that such spending is “a statement that we have a good relationship with this president.”

Trump wants to personally benefit from foreign government payments, and therefore seeks a narrow interpretation of the emoluments clause. He has a right to advocate for that narrow interpretation, but it is his personal attorneys — not the Justice Department — that should make such arguments. While we do not know the exact source of this new logic, Trump’s Justice Department is effectively acting as if it is a private law firm. Government employees are supposed to act in the public interest, not anyone’s personal interest. This is a fundamental principle of government ethics. If Justice Department lawyers are going to say that they “represent the United States,” they better have the interests of the country — not the financial interests of the President — at heart.

Barr says DOJ investigating whether Steele dossier was part of Russian disinformation campaign,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/barr-says-doj-investigating-whether-steele-dossier-was-part-of-russian-disinformation-campaign,"Attorney General William Barr says he is unable to rule out the possibility that the so-called Steele dossier was part of a disinformation campaign carried out by the Russians.

During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday, Barr said he is “concerned about it” and is investigating the matter.

The dossier was compiled by British ex-spy Christopher Steele at the behest of Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was being funded by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm. Steele's dossier was based on sources Steele says were close to the Kremlin and was filled with salacious and unverified allegations. The dossier was circulated within both the media and the federal government and was used in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act applications to justify the surveillance of a former member of the Trump campaign, Carter Page.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, brought the matter up with Barr, saying that “Steele, of course, was a former British intelligence officer hired to do opposition research by the Hillary Clinton campaign on her political adversaries, including President Trump, or candidate Trump at that time.”

Cornyn asked Barr point blank: “How do we know that the Steele dossier is not itself evidence of Russian disinformation campaign knowing what we know now that basically the allegations made were second hand, hearsay, or unverified? Can we state with confidence the Steele dossier was not part of the Russian disinformation campaign?”

Barr said he couldn’t rule out the possibility. “I can't state that with confidence and it's one of the areas that I'm reviewing. I'm concerned about it and I don't think it's entirely speculative,"" he said.

Special counsel Robert Mueller's report already confirmed that the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm, carried out disinformation activities on social media meant to interfere with the 2016 election. Mueller further stated that GRU, Russia’s military intelligence, carried out cyberattacks against the Clinton campaign and the DNC and provided the hacked emails to WikiLeaks for distribution.

“I called what bullshit the dossier was a year and a half ago … It’s likely FSB [the successor agency to the KGB] disinformation,"" former CIA Moscow station chief Daniel Hoffman recently told the Washington Examiner.

By January 2017, some FBI agents trying to verify the dossier’s allegations had reportedly concluded that some of the dossier’s contents may have been based upon “rumors and hearsay” which were “passed from source to source,” perhaps even originating as “Russian disinformation.”

Watergate journalist Bob Woodward has been calling Steele’s dossier “garbage” for more than two years. And Michael Isikoff, the chief investigative correspondent for Yahoo News whose September 2016 news article based on the dossier was used in FISA applications, recently said the media should have shown ""more skepticism"" over Steele's dossier, which he described as ""thirdhand stuff.""

Mueller’s Russia report, released last month, undercut some of the most scandalous allegations included in the dossier. He found that Cohen “had never traveled to Prague,” as Steele's research had alleged. Mueller also found no criminal collusion between President Trump or any of his associates and Russia. Steele's dossier alleged there was a high-level conspiracy between Trump and the Kremlin.

The dossier’s biggest claims appeared to be knocked down by Mueller, who said that, despite the Russian government’s extensive election interference efforts, “the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.”

Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is now investigating FISA abuse. Horowitz is reportedly focusing on Steele, but Steele has declined to cooperate with the probe. Barr has said the investigation might wrap up this month.

Beyond the investigation into whether the Steele dossier was part of a Russian disinformation operation, Barr also said the Department of Justice itself is looking into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, the conduct of the investigators involved at the FBI and Justice Department, and criminal leaks to the media."
VA Comes Out Against Bills on Medical Marijuana for Veterans,https://www.military.com,['Patricia Kime'],05-02-2019,2019,5,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/05/02/va-comes-out-against-bills-medical-marijuana-veterans.html,"The Department of Veterans Affairs opposes three legislative proposals that would expand research on medical marijuana at the VA and give veterans access to the drug in states where it is legal.

During a hearing Tuesday on eight VA health-related bills under consideration by Congress, VA officials told House lawmakers that as long as marijuana is illegal under federal law, the department cannot support legislation that promotes its role at the VA.

""[The House Veterans Affairs Committee] can make strong proposals for us to move forward with recommendations of filling out forms and such but, in the end, we need to go back to the [Drug Enforcement Agency] and [Justice Department] for their opinion,"" said Larry Mole, chief consultant for population health at the VA.

Three of the bills before the House Veterans Affairs health subcommittee relate to medical marijuana. One, the Veterans Equal Access Act, H.R. 1647, sponsored by Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, would allow VA health providers to recommend medical marijuana to their veteran patients and fill out the necessary paperwork for them to enroll in state marijuana programs.

Related content:

Blumenauer, who has introduced the bill in every Congress since 2014, said that, for some veterans, marijuana and cannabis derivatives are lifesavers that keep them from using addictive medications such as opioids to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic pain, seizures and glaucoma. Yet VA health care providers are not allowed to recommend it.

""Opioids steal the lives of 115 Americans every day ... as veterans with PTSD, chronic pain and any number of ailments are looking for relief, lethal opioid overdoses among VA patients are almost twice the national average. We are doing something wrong,"" he said.

Another bill, the VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act, H.R. 712, would direct the VA to conduct a large-scale clinical trial on the effects of cannabis on conditions such as PTSD and chronic pain.

Bill sponsor Rep. Lou Correa, D-California, said the research would examine the effectiveness of cannabis on various health conditions, as well as delivery methods.

""It's time to do research. It's time for veterans to know what cannabis is good for and what cannabis is not good for,"" Correa said.

A third, the Veterans Cannabis Use for Safe Healing Act, H.R. 2192, would protect veterans' benefits by prohibiting the VA from denying health care and compensation for veterans participating in a state medical marijuana program.

Keita Franklin, the VA's national director of suicide prevention, said that while the department supports medical marijuana research and is currently involved in a trial for treating PTSD, it opposes the bills.

According to Franklin, VA doctors would be subject to criminal prosecution if they recommended medical marijuana or made referrals to state agencies, as specified by DEA guidance.

And Correa's bill, she said, would not follow standard practice in medical research.

""Typically, a smaller early-phase trial would advance our knowledge and the benefits and risks regarding cannabis before moving to the expansive approach described in this legislation,"" she said. ""Any trial involving human subjects must include an evaluation on the risks and the safety, and include the smallest number of participants to avoid putting the subjects at increased risk unnecessarily. For these reasons, we don't support this legislation.""

She added that the third piece of legislation is unnecessary because VA policy states that the department cannot deny benefits based on marijuana use, although VA physicians are allowed to tailor a patient's prescription medications based on whether they are using cannabis.

Veterans advocates who testified expressed varying levels of support for the bills.

Carlos Fuentes, director of national legislative service for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said the VFW does not support the Veterans Equal Access bill because it doesn't think the VA should recommend unproven medical treatments, nor should it authorize a treatment for a veteran that would require the former service member to get it outside the VA, where they would be responsible for finding a quality product and paying for it.

The VFW does, however, support VA research on cannabis.

""VA's overreliance on opioids to treat chronic pain and other conditions has led to addiction and even deaths. To its credit ... VA has reduced the number of patients to whom it has prescribed opioids by 22 percent. Now, VA must expand research on the efficacy of nontraditional alternatives to opioids,"" Fuentes said.

Joy Ilam, national legislative director for Disabled American Veterans, agreed.

""We want to make sure there is no harm done. Research is the first step in doing that,"" Ilam said.

Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America research director Stephanie Mullen said the IAVA supports cannabis research and access to it.

""It's past time for VA to catch up,"" Mullen said. ""Veterans are suffering from their injuries today.""

Among the other bills and draft bills discussed at the hearing was one that seeks to expand complementary and alternative therapies and treatments at VA medical facilities, and another that would require the VA to report suicides and attempts that occur on VA campuses within a week of them happening.

"Obamacare ‘must be struck down,’ Justice Department tells court",https://www.washingtontimes.com,"['The Washington Times Http', 'Tom Howell Jr.']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/may/1/obamacare-must-be-struck-down-justice-department-t/,"A Texas judge “correctly held” that Obamacare’s individual mandate to hold insurance is inseparable from the rest of the law, the Trump administration told an appeals court Wednesday in arguing the entire program must fall.

The Justice Department’s brief solidified President Trump’s support for a lawsuit that could decimate his predecessor’s signature health program, even though Republicans haven’t reached consensus on a replacement.

It’s also a change of heart.

Administration lawyers once took a limited view of the state-driven challenge, saying a narrow slice of Obamacare should be struck after Congress decided to zero out the penalty for shirking insurance as part of the GOP tax overhaul.

They changed course after the lower court sided with state Republicans who say the tweak made the entire program unconstitutional, including its protections for sicker Americans, subsidies for private coverage and sweeping expansion of Medicaid in dozens of states.

“In the district court, the Department of Justice took the position that the remainder of the ACA was severable, but upon further consideration and review of the district court’s opinion, it is the position of the United States that the balance of the ACA also is inseverable and must be struck down,” Justice attorneys wrote to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

If upheld on appeal, the case would force Washington to revisit health reform. Yet any decision that wipes away Obamacare’s sweeping benefits could politically injure the GOP in the middle of the 2020 campaign.

Despite that risk, red states that filed the lawsuit in 2018 urged the appeals court to affirm the Texas ruling from December.

“The district court correctly recognized all this in declaring the ACA unlawful in its entirety,” the states said in their own brief Wednesday. “The Department of Justice now agrees — and so too should this court.”

Blue-state attorneys general and House Democrats are fighting back in the appellate courts. They say the challenge before the Fifth Circuit is misguided, because Congress intentionally left the rest of Obamacare alone when it attacked the individual mandate.

They also stress the potential consequences of striking down the entire law, since millions gained coverage under its most popular provisions.

For his part, Mr. Trump thinks the Supreme Court will strike down Obamacare in the end.

He recently said it would clear the way for the GOP to repeal and replace the law after their embarrassing failure in 2017.

Senate GOP leaders said they have no intention of revisiting the issue, however — for one thing, Democrats control the House. That forced the president back off from his nascent push and punt a repeal vote until after the 2020 elections.

Some Democrats are looking beyond Obamacare and proposing a sweeping, government-run plan known as single-payer health care or “Medicare for All,” citing the nearly 30 million who remain uninsured despite the 2010 law.

The Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday released a laundry list of complexities for drafters of a single-payer plan to consider, such as government’s role in administering the plan and funding it, who would be eligible for coverage and whether enrollees must pay a share of costs.

Architects of the system would also have to figure out whether private insurers could exist alongside the government plan, or if they’d be relegated to covering things like cosmetic surgery.

“Establishing a single-payer system would be a major undertaking that would involve substantial changes in the sources and extent of coverage, provider payment rates, and financing methods of health care in the United States,” the CBO wrote.

"EPA: Glyphosate, the Herbicide in Roundup, Does Not Cause Cancer",https://www.usnews.com,[],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2019-04-30/epa-glyphosate-the-herbicide-in-roundup-does-not-cause-cancer,"The EPA deemed Tuesday that glyphosate, an ingredient in the Monsanto-made herbicide Roundup, does not cause cancer. Reed Saxon/AP

The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday reaffirmed its finding that the most widely used herbicide in the country does not cause cancer.

Glyphosate does not pose a public health risk when used as directed, EPA found in its proposed interim registration review , which is the latest step in the agency's review process for the herbicide.

""The agency's scientific findings on human health risk are consistent with the conclusions of science reviews by many other countries and other federal agencies,"" EPA said in a press release.

This finding comes roughly a month after a federal jury awarded a California man $80 million in damages after finding that the popular weed killer Roundup, which contains glyphosate, played a substantial role in his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Bayer, the company that owns Roundup's producer, Monsanto, is appealing the verdict. Thousands of similar cases are pending at the federal and state level.

The latest step affirms EPA's findings in its preliminary risk assessments from 2017.

Many public comments on the agency's preliminary risk assessments focused on the herbicide's possible cancer risk as well as its potential harm to monarch butterflies and pollinators like bees. EPA responded to the comments in its proposed interim registration review, saying that there are scientific uncertainties behind the decline of monarch and pollinator populations.

The proposed interim registration review found that ""the benefits that glyphosate confers to growers outweigh the geographically limited risks to non-target organisms.""

It did identify potential risks to mammals and birds, but said these would be limited to at or near the application area of the pesticide. The agency is proposing spray drift management measures to reduce risk to non-target organisms.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue cheered the finding, saying it is based on science and consistent with the findings of other regulatory authorities.

""If we are going to feed 10 billion people by 2050, we are going to need all the tools at our disposal, which includes the use [of] glyphosate,"" Perdue said.

Green groups continue to stand by research that ties glyphosate to cancer, specifically non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

""Health agencies and credible non-industry experts who've reviewed this question have all found a link between glyphosate and cancer,"" said Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""EPA should take the advice of its own science advisors—who have rejected the agency's no-cancer-risk classification.""

Environmental Working Group, an activist group that petitioned EPA to reduce the tolerance level of glyphosate in food like oats, pointed to a toxicological report on glyphosate from an arm of the Department of Health and Human Services that found that ""a possible association between exposure to glyphosate and risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma could not be ruled out, based on conflicting results.""

""We think EPA's finding is not accurate and makes the rest of the risk assessment hard to interpret,"" says Alexis Temkin, a toxicologist for the Environmental Working Group.

Registered pesticides must undergo review at least once every 15 years. EPA's review process for glyphosate is intended to make sure that as changes in science, public policy and pesticide use occurs, ""products in the marketplace can continue to be used safely,"" according to EPA.

EPA plans to release a decision in late 2019 with enforceable restrictions for the use of glyphosate.

Once the notice is published in the Federal Register, the public will have 60 days to comment on it.

Top Veterans Affairs official hits back at AOC's claim the VA doesn't have enough money,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/top-va-official-hits-back-at-aocs-claim-the-va-doesnt-have-enough-money,"Richard Stone, the Department of Veterans Affairs executive in charge, poked a hole in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's claim the agency is not fully funded.

Stone was asked Monday during a House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs hearing on the trend of veterans committing suicide and, specifically, addressing the recent number of veterans committing suicide on VA property.

""I think having sat through the last couple hours here with me, you understand, well understand very well my answer. This is not a financial problem,"" said Stone. ""This is a problem of the society that we live in. And this is about the interpersonal connections that we each have, to each other as a society.

""I can hire another 20,000 mental health providers and what I can say to you is that people in crisis will get great care. And they will come in or be seen in the same day as they are today,"" Stone said. ""I can hire additional people for at risk, but this is about moving to the left, moving towards the fact that we need to reduce risk. And it goes back to your colleagues’ comments earlier about whole health and identifying what connects us as humans, to other humans, and finding stabilization, as a society, that is much different than it was for those veterans that came home 30, 40, and 50 years ago.""

[Related: Veterans slam Ocasio-Cortez for her fierce defense of the VA]

During the hearing, the VA officials noted how of the more than 20 veterans who commit suicide every day, only a fraction of them are receiving care through the VA, with a majority never accessing the resources available to them.

The hearing took place hours after a veteran committed suicide at the Cleveland VA Medical Center, according to Fox 8.

After the hearing, Stone told the Washington Examiner the issue of veteran suicide is a multifaceted one that money alone cannot solve.

""Ten years ago we had a $4 billion budget for mental health, today I have an $8.9 billion budget for mental health,"" he said. ""I've doubled the number of mental health providers over these years, but yet we haven't changed the suicide rate. What I'm saying this is not just about adding more personnel. Certainly we can always add more personnel and we can go move from one to two day wait time for mental health.""

When asked by another reporter what the VA needs from Congress right now, instead of saying money, Stone said the bureaucracy needs be clearer and faster on certain issues.

""No. 1, we need clarity on the never-activated guardsmen and reservists: Are they veterans or aren't they veterans? Should they be allowed to come in?"" he said. ""Our option is, we're here. We have an established system. These are people who had served in uniform. The fact they just weren't activated shouldn't keep them from coming in.""

Stone said it takes too long to build new intake centers, as approval can take four to seven years before construction begins: ""We need to be much more agile in that.""

Stone's comments are in stark contrast to New York Democrat Ocasio-Cortez's insistence that the VA is not fully funded, at least when it comes to preventing veteran suicide.

Like many public systems, GOP want to rip the battery out + say the whole car doesn’t work, so they can sell it for parts.

Michael W. McConnell, a former federal appellate judge, is a law professor and director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.

Never before have so many congressional committees issued so many subpoenas demanding documents and testimony from so many executive-branch officials, with so little attempt at negotiation or accommodation. President Trump says he will invoke executive privilege on “all” of them. Attorney General William P. Barr balks at appearing before a House committee to discuss the Mueller report without changes in the format. Democrats threaten impeachment, and solemn commentators proclaim that Trump’s refusal to comply subverts America’s constitutional system of checks and balances.

How quickly Washington forgets — when it is convenient. Trump is not the first president to resist congressional investigation of the inner workings of his administration, and Barr is not the first Cabinet officer to negotiate the terms of his appearance before a committee. In fact, the responses are unremarkable.

Does anyone remember President Barack Obama? In 2011, the House Oversight Committee investigated a disastrous Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives operation, intended to track illegal gun sales, that put weapons in the hands of Mexican criminals. An assistant attorney general denied to Congress that the Obama administration even knew of the program. The administration later admitted the claim was false.

The Oversight Committee subpoenaed Justice Department documents about “Operation Fast and Furious” and the deceptive claim. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said he would comply with the subpoenas only if the House committee agreed in advance to close its investigation. The committee threatened to hold the attorney general in contempt.

Obama invoked executive privilege. The administration claimed that compliance with the subpoena would “inhibit the candor” of executive-branch deliberations and that “compelled disclosure would be inconsistent with the separation of powers established in the Constitution.”

The House voted 255 to 67 declaring Holder in contempt of Congress — but Holder unsurprisingly declined to prosecute himself. The House went to court seeking to force his compliance, but the Obama administration ran out the clock. Holder never complied with the subpoena and went unpunished for the contempt.

Then there was President George W. Bush and his response to the House Judiciary Committee subpoenas regarding his administration’s 2006 dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys: Bush invoked executive privilege. The House voted White House Counsel Harriet Miers and Chief of Staff Josh Bolten in contempt of Congress and went to court seeking enforcement of the subpoenas: the first such lawsuit in American history. The House won in district court, but a court of appeals immediately stayed the decision, which ceased to matter at the end of the Bush administration.

Resistance to congressional demands for documents and testimony goes back to America’s earliest days. After Gen. Arthur St. Clair’s calamitous encounter with native tribes in the Ohio territory in 1791, the House launched the first oversight investigation into executive malfeasance. The House empowered a committee “to call for such persons, papers, and records, as may be necessary to assist their inquiries.” The House demanded relevant papers and testimony from Secretary of War Henry Knox.

President George Washington convened a Cabinet meeting to discuss the demand. According to the notes of Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, the Cabinet unanimously agreed that the House had the right to conduct an inquiry (apparently because it involved the expenditure of public money) but that congressional requests for information from a Cabinet officer must be presented through the president himself. Washington and his Cabinet also concluded that the president has the right to withhold any papers he believed “the disclosure of which would injure the public.”

In response, the House passed a substitute motion “that the President of the United States be requested” to provide what papers “of a public nature” as might be “necessary to the investigation.” In the end, after exercising his discretion, Washington sent the House all the papers it had asked for.

What does this history tell us? That disputes over congressional demands for documents and testimony are as old as the republic. Congresses demand; presidents resist. Generally, after a political tussle the two sides meet somewhere in the middle. As a leading scholar of the subject, Cornell law professor Josh Chafetz, has written, “most disputes between the executive and legislative branches over information have historically been settled by negotiation and accommodation.”

This process cannot take place if one side assumes that it has unilateral authority to demand whatever it wishes and that any delay or resistance from the other branch is categorically illegitimate. Trump should abandon his attempt to defy “all subpoenas,” but the House should recognize that the executive is an equal branch of government with constitutional privileges of its own. For a president to assert the rights of his office, as almost every president has done, is neither blameworthy nor impeachable.

Schiff refers Blackwater founder Prince to DOJ over alleged false statements to Congress,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/schiff-refers-blackwater-founder-erik-prince-to-doj-over-alleged-false-statements-to-congress,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., formally referred Blackwater founder Erik Prince to the Justice Department for a criminal investigation over whether Prince lied to the panel about a 2016 meeting in the Seychelles islands with a Russian banker tied to Vladimir Putin.

In a statement, the committee said it had “identified at least six categories of materially false statements” Prince made about the meeting with Kirill Dmitriev when he appeared before the committee in November 2017.

In a letter to Attorney General William Barr, Schiff said Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials “strongly indicates that Erik Prince knowingly and willfully provided materially false testimony,” which Schiff argued “hindered the Committee’s ability to fully understand and examine foreign efforts to undermine our political process and national security, develop appropriate legislative and policy remedies to counter future malign influence operations targeting campaigns and presidential transitions, and inform the American public, as appropriate.”

SCHIFF HEDGES ON TRUMP IMPEACHMENT, SAYS INSTEAD, 'VOTE HIS A-- OUT OF OFFICE'

“I do believe that there is very strong evidence that he willingly misled the committee and willingly made false statements to the committee,” Schiff told The Washington Post’s Bob Costa during a panel event earlier Tuesday.

“The evidence is so weighty that the Justice Department needs to consider this. His testimony, which I can discuss because it is public record, was that his meeting in Seychelles with this Russian banker [Dmitriev] was purely by chance. He just happened to go to Seychelles for about a day and have a chance meeting with the Russian banker.”

Prince, the founder of the private military contractor Blackwater, and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, testified in 2017 that the meeting with the Russian banker was a chance encounter. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report revealed that the meeting was set up ahead of time.

“We know from the Mueller report that this was not a chance meeting,” Schiff said Tuesday. “We know there were communications after he returned.”

Schiff added that Prince had “discussions” with former White House adviser Steve Bannon about the meeting before he left, and “communications” after he returned from the meeting, a claim the lawmaker said was contradicted by the Mueller report.

SCHIFF REFUSES TO BACK DOWN ON CLAIMS AGAINST TRUMP, SAYS HE HAS NO REGRETS

“Somehow, mysteriously, magically, the communications between Prince and Bannon have apparently fled their devices,” Schiff said. “In very material ways, I think the evidence strongly suggests that he willingly misled our committee and the Justice Department needs to consider whether there’s a prosecutable case.”

Schiff added that when Bannon appeared before his committee, he “refused to answer almost all of our questions.”

“He said he was not answering questions because the White House asked him not to,” Schiff said.

Schiff was also asked whether his panel felt that President Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., or his son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner gave false testimony.

“I don’t want to comment on any others. We have reached the point of ripeness with Prince’s testimony that we feel it appropriate to refer it,” Schiff said. “I don’t want to comment on any others.”

Schiff’s comments come in the midst of a heated battle between Congress and the White House over subpoenas for former and current officials to testify before House committees leading sweeping Trump-focused probes. Schiff’s panel is currently investigating the president’s finances.

State Department preparing for clash of civilizations with China,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/state-department-preparing-for-clash-of-civilizations-with-china,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s team is developing a strategy for China based on the idea of “a fight with a really different civilization” for the first time in American history.

“This is a fight with a really different civilization and a different ideology and the United States hasn't had that before,” Kiron Skinner, the director of policy planning at the State Department, said Monday evening at a security forum in Washington, D.C.

Skinner is leading an effort to develop a concept of U.S.-China relations on the scale of what she called “Letter X” — the unsigned essay by George Kennan, who assessed “the sources of Soviet conduct” in 1947 and outlined the containment strategy that guided American strategists for the rest of the Cold War. China poses a unique challenge, she said, because the regime in Beijing isn’t a child of Western philosophy and history.

“The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family,” Skinner said, noting Karl Marx’s indebtedness to Western political ideas. “It’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.”

Skinner credited retired Army Gen. H.R. McMaster, who served as White House national security adviser from March 2017 to March 2018, with recognizing the need for a National Security Strategy organized around the return of great power competition with Russia and China. But those two rivals are not equivalent, she said, identifying Russia as a mere “global survivor” that pales in comparison to China.

[Related: Pompeo: China threatens 'our continued democracy']

“We see it as a more fundamental long-term threat,” Skinner told New America CEO Anne Marie Slaughter. “In China, we have an economic competitor, we have an ideological competitor, one that really does seek a global reach that many of us didn't expect a couple of decades ago.”

Slaughter, who served as the head of policy planning for the State Department from 2009 to 2011, suggested that Skinner was offering the U.S.-China relationship as the ""clash of civilizations"" outlined in another landmark essay that discussed how geopolitics would change after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Skinner concurred.

""Some of those tenets, but a little bit different,"" she answered. ""I think we have to take the rose-colored glasses off and get real about the nature of the threat. And, I think we also have to give a kind of respect for, I think, what the Chinese seek to accomplish.""

[Also read: State Department compares China to Nazi Germany in human rights briefing]

Trump has made a trade war with China one of the major undertakings of his administration, in pursuit of a trade deal to rebalance the relationship between the world’s two largest economies. U.S. officials have also rebranded the Asia Pacific region as the Indo-Pacific, partly as a nod to China’s surge in Africa and the potential for India to function as a counter-weight to the Communist power.

But Pompeo has sounded the alarm about China’s influence around the world, warning of security threats in Europe and the Arctic, as well as predatory lending in the Western Hemisphere.

“Trade is not the only problem and maybe not the biggest in the long run with China,” Skinner said. “But we're now looking more deeply and broadly at China. And, I think State is in the lead in that broader attempt to get something like a Letter X for China, what Kennan wrote. You can't have a policy without an argument underneath it.”

Pompeo’s team has rebuked China repeatedly for human rights abuses, especially the hostility to religious beliefs displayed by the regime’s mass detention of Uighur Muslims and the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities. But Skinner suggested that human rights arguments might not be as useful against China as they were against the Soviet Union, which was weakened by a 1975 agreement that allowed Soviet dissidents to cooperate indirectly with Western powers to advocate for “the rights of emigration and religious freedom,” according to the State Department.

“It was a really important Western concept that opened the door really to undermine the Soviet Union, a totalitarian state, on human rights principles,” she said. “That's not really possible with China.”"

""In the best of times, DHS is unruly and difficult to manage organization and we are not in the best of times,"" said former Inspector General John Roth during a House Homeland Security Committee hearing. Vacancies, ""particularly those that remain vacant for a long time, cripple the ability of the Department to move forward,"" wrote Roth in testimony.

A little over three weeks ago, amid the ouster of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, a shakeup in the leadership ranks at DHS left the department with numerous acting officials in top posts and the departure of senior leaders. After the purge in leadership , Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan was tapped to take on the acting secretary role, leaving CBP with an acting leader as well.

""This lack of settled leadership contributes to the significant morale problems that are endemic to DHS components,"" Roth said in his written testimony.

There are currently acting officials serving in eight positions at DHS that require Senate confirmation, according to the Government Accountability Office.

On the first anniversary of taking office, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addresses unveils a new departmental ""ethos"" in the lobby of the State Department in April 2019. (Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

Daniel W. Drezner is a professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a regular contributor to PostEverything

Once upon a time, the director of policy planning for the State Department was a pretty prestigious job. George Kennan, he of the “Long Telegram” and “Sources of Soviet Conduct” fame, was the first director. Some of the others — Paul Nitze, Bob Bowie, Walt Rostow, Dennis A. Ross, James Steinberg, Richard Haass, Anne-Marie Slaughter — have been among the more distinguished foreign policy thinkers in this country. A strong director of policy planning can serve as a vital adjunct to the secretary of state and act as a reminder about the nation’s strategic interests. A good policy planning director is adept at avoiding trivia, distinguishing the important from the urgent, and acting as a check against an administration’s worst impulses.

Brian Hook, the director of policy planning under Rex Tillerson, was granted a tremendous amount of authority but stumbled badly. He was a relative neophyte attempting to counsel a complete neophyte on the ins and outs of the job. He did ... poorly.

When Mike Pompeo came on, he hired Kiron Skinner to run policy planning. In contrast to Hook, she has thought about this stuff for a while. She has the academic credentials and publishing record one would expect for that job. She is also an African American woman, a rarity in the upper echelons of the Trump administration (particularly in the diplomatic corps).

Since coming on in September of last year, however, Skinner has made some odd statements. She penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed last December that made it clear she had written Mike Pompeo’s badly received Brussels speech that caricatured multilateralism beyond all recognition. In the op-ed, she claimed that “the Trump administration is acting to preserve a just, transparent, and free world of sovereign states,” which sounds way too close to Vladimir Putin’s notion of “sovereign democracy” for my comfort.

On Monday, she sat down with Slaughter to chat about the Trump administration’s grand strategy at the New America Foundation. The New Yorker’s Masha Gessen attended and found it unnerving:

A large part of Skinner’s job is listening to what the President says and trying to make sense of it. She said as much. “The president provides the hunches and instincts,” she said, “and it’s my job, and that of Secretary Pompeo, to turn those hunches and instincts into hypotheses.” She called the hypotheses the “Trump Doctrine” and the “Pompeo Corollary.” Slaughter, logically, asked what the Trump Doctrine was. “That’s a tough one,” Skinner responded, without a hint of irony. “It is, in a kind of broad way, a set of pillars that address 21st-century realities.” The pillars were: the “return to national sovereignty”; national interest; reciprocity in international relations and trade; “burden sharing,” particularly in defense; and “new regional partnerships” for what she described as “particular crises.”

Skinner’s comments unnerved Gessen for the same reason that her WSJ op-ed unnerved me: “I had heard the isolationism and destruction of Putin’s rule be framed in phrases such as ‘sovereign democracy’ and in a lot of other plausible-sounding policy gobbledygook that served to rob every word of familiar meaning.”

To be fair, however, Skinner did say some things that were a lot of things, but decidedly not gobbledygook. The Washington Examiner’s Joel Gehrke reported on that element of Skinner’s comments, in which she was described as leading an effort to develop a concept of U.S.-China relations akin to what Kennan did for the Soviet Union:

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s team is developing a strategy for China based on the idea of “a fight with a really different civilization” for the first time in American history.... “The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family,” Skinner said, noting Karl Marx’s indebtedness to Western political ideas. “It’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.”.... Skinner suggested that human rights arguments might not be as useful against China as they were against the Soviet Union, which was weakened by a 1975 agreement that allowed Soviet dissidents to cooperate indirectly with Western powers to advocate for “the rights of emigration and religious freedom,” according to the State Department. “It was a really important Western concept that opened the door really to undermine the Soviet Union, a totalitarian state, on human rights principles,” she said. “That’s not really possible with China.”

So there’s a lot going on in just those few paragraphs. Because I was just handed a whole bunch of final papers to grade, I have grading on the brain right now. Here’s how I would grade Skinner if she had made an oral presentation like this one for my Art and Science of Statecraft class:

Kiron,

You observe, correctly, that Donald Trump has forced the foreign policy community to revisit “first principles.” And what you said to Slaughter was certainly consistent with the key components of the Trump’s administration’s National Security Strategy, which prioritizes great power competition as the priority for the United States going forward. Furthermore, although controversial, your implicit use of Huntington’s “clash of civilizations” frame does get at one aspect of the Chinese challenge: to Beijing, this is not about a rise to great power status, it is a return to that status, consistent with its civilizational history.

That said, there are some real flaws with your oral defense. For one thing, your claim that China represents the first non-Caucasian great power competitor to the United States is factually incorrect, unless the Germans really did bomb Pearl Harbor. For another thing, why in the name of all that is holy would you make a racial distinction with respect to the great powers?! If you want to say that China is Confucian, or based on a different set of civilizational principles than the United States, sure, give it a try. Why say “not Caucasian”?! Does this mean India or Japan or South Korea should also be approached differently, because they are not white civilizations?! Why use race as your unit of analysis?

Furthermore, if you are going to use a Huntingtonian frame, you should know that he treated Russia as “Orthodox” and therefore distinct from Western civilization. Sure, the Soviet Union incorporated the very Western thought of Karl Marx, but last I checked — hold on a sec — yep, I just checked again and it turns out that China’s ruling party is also totally into Marx! Why is China so different?

Finally, I am very unclear as to why China’s civilization renders it less vulnerable to human rights treaties than the Soviet Union. If you recall, conservatives really disliked the Helsinki Final Act when it was actually negotiated, and it caught many of them by surprise that it helped inspire the Charter 77 movement and other acts of dissidence. It is not like China has no history of dissident appeals to Western liberal values (see here and here). Furthermore, you should be familiar with works by Iain Johnston, or Stacie Goddard, or Rosemary Foot and Andrew Walter, that discuss how China’s participation in Western institutions has had an impact on its self-perception.

There are perfectly valid reasons for the Trump administration to prioritize China as a strategic threat. This is one of the few Trump statements that generates bipartisan support. If you are trying to articulate a “Sources of Chinese Conduct” essay, however, it would be a very good idea to get beyond the fact that China is not a country filled with Caucasians. In fact, maybe just disregard the race angle altogether. It inflames far more than it illuminates.

Kennan could write “Sources of Soviet Conduct” because he was a longstanding expert on Soviet politics. Your comments on China suggest you could use a few old Asia hands to help with some tutoring. You clearly have a lot more work to do to persuade me that American grand strategy isn’t doomed.

Is America Ready for a Gay President? ‘You’re Going to See the Wall Crumble’,https://www.nytimes.com,['Jeremy W. Peters'],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/us/politics/pete-buttigieg-2020.html,"A lot of the younger generation grew up with kids who were out in high school, or in middle school even. So they wouldn’t see that as extraordinary. But does that make you worry about losing perspective on the progress that has been made?

It’s worthy of celebration that they lived their adolescence and young adulthood in a far different culture than I did. It’s what we worked so hard for all these decades. I try talking to them about what it was like growing up in the ’70s. And I never even fantasized or dreamed of getting married, of having kids, of having job protection, of being able to be open and in politics. I never dreamed that I would be anything but fearful and hide. Or the alternative was to move to Greenwich Village or San Francisco.

For people who are not quite there yet, do you think that in order for them to support a gay candidate they need to see something else first, something other than gay? Like small-town mayor or veteran, as is the case with Mr. Buttigieg?

But isn’t that true of any candidate that isn’t a straight white male? The women candidates, the African-American candidates, the Latino candidates, Asian candidates. We all have to prove ourselves as worthy of being elected rather than simply saying, “Oh, I have this difference, so elect me.” You don’t see candidates start off with whatever their diversity is. What they talk about is what their experience is, what they bring to the office.

There’s no question the “first” aspect of Obama’s 2008 campaign motivated people, especially African-Americans, in historic numbers. Do you expect something similar with Mr. Buttigieg or are there not enough people who will think that the first gay president is an equivalently significant milestone?"
Barr 'working very closely' with DOJ inspector general to investigate FISA abuse,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/barr-working-very-closely-with-doj-inspector-general-to-investigate-fisa-abuse,"Attorney General William Barr told Congress he was “working very closely” with the Justice Department’s Inspector General Michael Horowitz as they both conduct investigations into the investigators who ran the Trump-Russia investigation at the DOJ and FBI.

Horowitz has been looking into possible Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuse for more than a year. Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday that he was looking into the origins of the investigation into Trump, any criminal leaks from the FBI or DOJ to the media, the possibility the ""Steele dossier"" — compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele — was Russian disinformation, and more.

Barr said: ""I talked to Mike Horowitz a few weeks ago about it. It's focused on the FISA, basis for the FISA and handling of the FISA applications. But by necessity, it looks back a little earlier than that. The people helping me with my review will be working very closely with Mr. Horowitz.""

He suggested the investigation into Trump may be broader than previously thought: “Many people seem to assume that the only intelligence collection that occurred was a single confidential informant and a FISA warrant. I would like to find out whether that is, in fact, true. It strikes me as a fairly anemic effort if that was the counterintelligence effort to stop the threat as it is being represented.

“As I've said before, the extent there was any overreach I believe it was a few people in the upper echelons of the bureau and perhaps the department. But those people are no longer there, and I'm working closely with [FBI Director] Chris Wray, who I think has done a superb job at the bureau, and we're working together on trying to reconstruct exactly what went down.”

Earlier in the hearing, Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., asked, “Do you share my concerns about the FISA process?”

Barr replied simply: “Yes.”

The Steele dossier was used in applications to the FISA Court to justify warrants against at least one Trump associate, Carter Page. Steele was paid for his research by Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was funded in part by the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee through the Perkins Coie law firm.

Steele has come under increased scrutiny, with Barr saying Wednesday the DOJ is now investigating whether his dossier was based in part upon Russian disinformation.

Last year, Horowitz announced the launch of the FISA abuse investigation after requests from both then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Republican members of Congress. The lawmakers claimed the Justice Department and FBI had abused the FISA process and misled the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in their investigation and surveillance of Trump and his associates during the campaign, as well as during the Trump administration.

Horowitz said he would “examine the Justice Department’s and the FBI’s compliance with legal requirements, and with applicable DOJ and FBI policies and procedures, in applications filed with the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court relating to a certain U.S. person [Page].”

He stated that he would “review information that was known to the DOJ and the FBI at the time the applications were filed from or about an alleged FBI confidential source. Additionally, the OIG will review the DOJ’s and FBI’s relationship and communications with the alleged source as they relate to the FISC applications.” This “alleged FBI confidential source” is Steele.

Barr, who stood by his use of the word “spying” in front of the Senate Wednesday, said the DOJ inspector general report could be in by the end of June."
Pentagon to deploy 320 more troops to US-Mexico border,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/pentagon-to-deploy-320-more-troops-to-us-mexico-border,"The Pentagon announced Monday that 320 more troops will be sent to the U.S.-Mexico border, following a request from the Department of Homeland Security for help responding to the “humanitarian crisis at the border.”

“Approximately 320 DoDO personnel will be required to support the DHS request for assistance through September 30, 2019, at an estimated cost of $7.4 M,” the Pentagon said in a statement.

The troops will assist driving Customs and Border Protection vehicles to carry migrants. They will conduct administration support, including providing meals and “monitoring the welfare” of those in Customs and Border Protection custody. Attorney support to Immigration and Customs Enforcement will also be provided.

The Pentagon said the personnel will not conduct law enforcement during their deployment.

There are nearly 3,000 U.S. troops at the border already, along with approximately 2,000 National Guardsmen.

The decision was approved by acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan and relaxes certain rules that prevents troops from interacting with migrants. The former Boeing executive was cleared by the Pentagon’s inspector general last week, after Shanahan was accused of showing favoritism toward Boeing.

Trump, who has made securing the border a top priority, is expected to announce Shanahan, 56, as his nominee to be permanent defense secretary in the coming days."
DHS Tries Again to Build a Contract for Agile Development,https://www.nextgov.com,['Aaron Boyd'],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2019/04/dhs-tries-again-build-contract-agile-development/156657/,"The Homeland Security Department’s future IT acquisitions are governed by a new strategy that relies on governmentwide best-in-class contracts, with in-house contract vehicles to be created for specific needs. Agile development will be among those special areas, though a department-specific contract is likely years away.

In December, Homeland Security Chief Procurement Officer Soraya Correa announced the third iteration of the Enterprise Acquisition Gateway for Leading-Edge Solutions, or EAGLE, contract would actually be more of a procurement strategy than a single marketplace. The new strategy, dubbed Eagle Next Gen, pushes Homeland Security programs and offices to use five established governmentwide acquisition contracts, or GWACs.

The approved GWACs include the National Institutes of Health’s CIO-SP3 and CIO-SP3 Small Business and the General Services Administration’s Alliant 2, 8(a) STARS II and VETS 2. The initial strategy also included Alliant 2 Small Business, but awards on that vehicle were rescinded in March.

Any IT requirements that cannot be serviced by one of those vehicles will be covered by contracts built in-house at Homeland Security.

The department has yet to identify all potential special cases but started building an in-house contract for cloud and data center optimization. The agency issued a request for information in February and received 105 responses, according to Kshemendra Paul, the cloud action officer who leads the new DHS Cloud Steering Group.

“The centerpiece—I think it’s safe to say, the flagship of Eagle Next Gen is going to be the resultant family of RFPs that come out of that RFI across DHS,” Paul said during a panel Tuesday hosted by ACT-IAC.

Paul said the department is in the midst of reviewing those responses now and hopes to have a set of RFPs out to market this fall.

But agile was also an early consideration, as evidenced by a request for information released by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in February asking for industry feedback on whether GSA schedules could meet its needs.

While fielding a question about agile development, Jaclyn Rubino, director of DHS’ Strategic Sourcing Program Office, noted that’s another area that will likely require a specialized DHS-built contract.

“From the department’s standpoint, we’ve been talking about agile for a while,” she said, citing the failed Flexible Agile Support for the Homeland, or FLASH, contract. The $1.5 billion software development contract was slammed with protests over the evaluation process and pricing, prompting the agency to cancel the contract months after it was awarded in 2017.

Rubino, who is also executive director of the Shared Services and Governmentwide Security Category, said Homeland Security components have been using EAGLE II to support their agile development work, with different programs and offices currently at different phases of the procurement process.

“What you’re going to see is different components coming out with their procurements to support their agile development requirements over the course of the next couple of years while we are pulling together a departmentwide agile contract vehicle,” she said.

Rubino said that DHS-specific vehicle is still a few years out, at this point.

“We’re working with the CIO community to establish what really is the requirement,” she said. “How are we going to approach agile from a departmentwide viewpoint?”

As with the requirements, the exact procurement strategy is still pending, as well, Rubino told Nextgov. While the contract will be specific to Homeland Security needs and components, it might be a full and open competition or a blanket purchase agreement using pre-vetted vendors from existing sources, such as the GWACs offered by GSA and NIH."

EPA stalls biofuel waiver transparency plan after White House blowback: sources,https://www.reuters.com,"['Jarrett Renshaw', 'Min Read']",05-01-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-epa-biofuels/epa-stalls-biofuel-waiver-transparency-plan-after-white-house-blowback-sources-idUSKCN1S62KL,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has suspended work on its plan to publish the names of refineries securing exemptions from federal biofuels law after receiving blowback from the White House and parts of the oil industry, according to four sources familiar with the matter.

The sources said EPA announced the plan on April 12 before the White House had time to review it, and without forewarning oil refiners who fear that publicly receiving waivers would be bad for their image and undermine their competitive edge.

If the EPA ditches or significantly alters the plan, it would anger the powerful corn lobby that has long agitated for more transparency in the notoriously opaque biofuel waiver program.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refineries must blend certain volumes of biofuels into gasoline and diesel fuel or purchase credits from those that do. Small refineries of 75,000 barrels-per-day or less can get waivers if they prove complying with the regulation would cause them financial hardship.

The EPA currently does not name companies that apply for or receive the lucrative waivers, arguing the information is confidential. The corn industry wants that changed because it believes profitable companies are securing waivers, which is hurting farmers.

The sources told Reuters that the White House and oil industry were surprised by the plan, and that U.S. senators from states with small refineries were worried that plants would be forced to disclose sensitive financial information.

“The White House found out about it, but it was after the wheels were in motion,” said one source who was briefed by the agency. “They certainly did not get time to review it or consider the implications.”

The EPA has yet to publish the rule in the Federal Register, a step that normally happens swiftly to start the clock on finalizing the plan.

“I am not sure it ever gets in the register at this point,” said another source, a DC-based oil lobbyist.

Michael Abboud, an EPA spokesman confirmed the provision has still not been sent to the Federal Register yet but did not elaborate further. White House did not immediately have comment.

The waiver program became a bone of contention between the rival oil and corn industries after President Donald Trump’s EPA loosened eligibility requirements for exemptions, granting far more than ex-President Barack Obama’s EPA did.

Small refineries owned by profitable oil majors like ExxonMobil and Chevron are among those that have gotten waivers since 2017, according to Reuters reporting.

Supporters of the expansion of the waiver program say EPA was forced issue more waivers after a U.S. Appeals Court said it was being too stingy with exemptions.

But critics say the expansion was politically motivated to help the energy industry, something EPA officials have denied."

Bruce Ohr raised 'possible ethics concerns' with DOJ lawyer,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/bruce-ohr-raised-possible-ethics-concerns-with-doj-lawyer,"Justice Department official Bruce Ohr brought up ""possible ethics concerns"" ahead of his testimony before Congress last year.

An email exchange between Ohr and a Justice Department ethics lawyer in January 2018 was obtained by conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch.

Much of what is said is redacted, but provides some insight into Ohr's thought process after the Senate and House intelligence committees had requested to interview him about investigations into possible Russian interference in the 2016 election.

""Shortly after receiving the Senate request, a series of stories broke in the press about my alleged connections to Chris Steele, the author of the so-called Trump dossier. [Redacted],"" Ohr wrote to Justice Department lawyer Cynthia Shaw. ""My question has to do with [redacted]. Are there any guidelines for [redacted] in order to satisfy any possible ethics concerns?""

Shaw's response to Ohr is largely redacted. ""Can you obtain [redacted],"" she said.

Ohr acted as an unofficial back channel between the FBI and Christopher Steele, the author of the so-called Trump dossier. He was demoted when it was revealed he met with Steele and Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS, which commissioned Steele's work. Ohr also told lawmakers his wife Nellie Ohr was employed by Fusion GPS and shared a thumb drive with him to hand over to the FBI.

The dossier, which contained unverified claims about Trump's ties to Russia, has been a subject of concern for GOP lawmakers, particularly for how it was used by the FBI to in Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant applications to gain the authority to spy on onetime Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.

The FBI suspended its relationship with Steele in October 2016 for unauthorized contact with the media. Despite this, the FBI maintained an unofficial back channel with Steele up to at least November 2017 via Ohr.

The emails were obtained as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit Judicial Watch filed against the Justice Department. The group also obtained records that suggest close working ties between Nellie Ohr and Russia experts at the Justice Department.

“Bruce Ohr was the conflicted center of the [Hillary] Clinton-[Democratic National Committee] effort to launder fraudulent Russia material into the Justice Department and FBI,” Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in a statment. “These documents show that Bruce Ohr was aware enough to look for advice — or look for cover — on ethics issue. His wife, Fusion GPS employee Nellie Ohr, had chummy relationships with various Justice Department officials, which illustrates perfectly why it was so easy for Fusion GPS to sell its anti-Trump Dossier scam.”"
