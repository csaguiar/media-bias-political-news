"Trump threatens Cuba with 'full and complete' embargo, 'highest-level sanctions,' citing Venezuela role",https://www.foxnews.com,"['Gregg Re', 'Gregg Re Is An Editor', 'Attorney Based In Los Angeles. Follow Him On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-cuba-embargo-sanctions-citing-venezuela,"As Venezuela plunged into a dramatic televised scene of chaos and violence on Tuesday, President Trump warned he would impose a ""full and complete embargo"" and sanctions on Cuba if its troops do not cease operations in the ravaged South American nation.

National Security Adviser John Bolton alleged earlier Tuesday that Cuban troops were keeping Maduro in power in Caracas.

“It’s a very delicate moment,” Bolton said, adding that ""all options"" remained on the table -- including, potentially, a U.S. military intervention. “The president wants to see a peaceful transfer of power.""

Trump's dramatic threat came hours after his administration resoundingly endorsed an ongoing Venezuelan opposition effort, headed by Juan Guaido and Leopoldo Lopez, to spark a military uprising against embattled President Nicolas Maduro. The Trump administration also has worked to roll back Obama-era easing of Cold War sanctions on Cuba.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters Tuesday that Maduro had been on his way out of the country bound for Cuba, but that Russia told him to remain. Bolton, meanwhile, warned Russia against interfering.

The U.S. government said about 20,000 Cuban troops and agents have been working in Venezuela to prop up Maduro's government, a figure disputed by Cuba.

In February, Navy Adm. Craig S. Faller, commander of U.S. Southern Command, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that Maduro, fearing for his own safety, has “completely surround[ed]” himself with Cuban security.

“I think it’s a good sense of where the loyalty of the Venezuelan people are, that his immediate security force is made up of Cubans,” Faller told the committee.

In January, the White House announced billions of dollars in crippling new sanctions against Maduro and the country's state-owned oil monopoly PDVSA, less than a week after Trump first acknowledged Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader.

The White House has long linked Venezuela's fortunes to Cuba. At a major foreign policy address earlier this year, Trump declared: ""When Venezuela is free, and Cuba is free, and Nicaragua is free, this will become the first free hemisphere in all of human history.""

Trump continued, as the crowd roared: ""The days of socialism and communism are numbered not only in Venezuela, but in Nicaragua and Cuba as well. Do we love Cuba? Do we love Nicaragua? Great countries. Great potential.""

The U.S. and about 50 other nations have taken the position that Maduro's re-election last year was marred by fraud and he is not the legitimate president of Venezuela, a once prosperous nation that has the world's largest proven oil reserves.

VENEZUELANS CLASH WITH PRO-MADURO CODE PINK ACTIVISTS OUTSIDE DC EMBASSY

In January, the administration took the unusual step of recognizing Guaido, the opposition leader of the National Assembly, as interim president. It also imposed punishing sanctions on the country's oil sector, deepening the country's economic crisis.

Despite these and other measures, Maduro, the hand-picked successor to Chavez, has retained his hold on the country and the support of the security services.

That support had seemed to crack Tuesday with the launch of what the opposition was calling ""Operation Freedom,"" which began with the early-morning release of a short video of Guaido and Lopez alongside a few dozen national guardsmen urging people to ""take to the streets.""

In a video broadcast live on telecasts across the world, an armored vehicle could be seen driving over the center of a road, hitting a crowd of demonstrators loyal to Guaido who were purportedly throwing rocks at security forces. Dozens of injuries have been reported.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-FL., denounced the actions by Venezuelan security forces, saying that “military and security leaders must realize they are and will be held responsible for this,” he said on Twitter.

""What we are seeing today in Venezuela is the will of the people to peacefully change the course of their country from one of despair to one of freedom and democracy,"" Pompeo tweeted in an early reaction. ""The U.S. stands with them.""

Still, the Trump administration was caught slightly off-guard by Guaido's decision to launch the campaign on Tuesday. Elliott Abrams, the special representative for Venezuela, said the administration had expected major marches and protests to take place on Wednesday for the May Day holiday.

Why Trump Wants to Block Deutsche Bank From Sharing His Financial Records,https://www.nytimes.com,['David Enrich'],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/business/deutsche-bank-donald-trump.html,"Over two decades, Deutsche Bank lent Donald J. Trump billions of dollars, even as his tarnished financial record put him off limits for most of Wall Street.

“You are a great friend,” Mr. Trump wrote to his Deutsche Bank contact in 1998. “We have a great relationship,” he said in 2013. “They are totally happy with me,” he declared three years later.

Now, Deutsche Bank is putting the president on the defensive.

Lawyers for the bank have spent months cooperating with investigators from two Democratic-controlled congressional committees, which issued what one lawmaker called a “friendly subpoena” to the bank in mid-April. The bank could end up sharing decades of his personal and corporate financial records.

That prospect prompted Mr. Trump to file a lawsuit in federal court in Manhattan on Monday in an attempt to block Deutsche Bank and another financial company, Capital One, from sharing documents. Mr. Trump’s lawyers said the subpoenas had no legitimate purpose and were an attempt to pry into his finances for political gain."
Iranian economy collapsing as Trump administration tightens sanctions: report,https://www.foxnews.com,['Elizabeth Llorente'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/iranian-economy-collapsing-as-trump-administration-tightens-sanctions-report,"Iran’s economy is on the brink thanks to the Trump administration’s sanctions, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Iran is in a deep recession, with inflation at roughly 40 percent, the organization said, marking the highest such level since 1980.

The crisis is intensifying a chasm between President Hassan Rouhani’s allies and those who oppose diplomatic exchanges with the U.S. government, the Financial Times noted.

And Iran’s problems are expected only to worsen once President Trump’s promised sanctions on the leading buyers of the Islamic Republic’s oil take effect. They include Japan, South Korea, Turkey, India and China.

The administration had granted oil sanctions waivers when it re-imposed sanctions on Iran after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the landmark 2015 nuclear deal.

IRANIAN LAWMAKERS CONVENE WITH CHANTS OF 'DEATH TO AMERICA'

Trump has declared the landmark 2015 agreement “horrible,” leaving the Iranian government flush with cash to fuel conflict in the Middle East. Iran has accused the U.S. of reneging on the nuclear agreement, signed by the Obama administration, and of causing Iranian economic unrest.

IRAN'S FOREIGN MINISTER ACCUSES TRUMP OFFICIALS, MIDEAST ALLIES OF 'DRAGGING' US INTO CONFLICT WITH IRAN

The Trump administration is seeking to further ramp up pressure on Iran by strangling the revenue it gets from oil exports.

The oil sanctions waivers were granted in part to give the countries that had been granted them more time to find alternate energy sources but also to prevent a shock to global oil markets from the sudden removal of Iranian crude.

The Iranian government is responding defiantly.

“The enemy wants to drag us to the negotiating table through economic pressure,” said General Qasem Soleimani, commander of the overseas arm of the hardline Revolutionary Guards, on Monday, according to the Financial Times. “Any negotiations under the current circumstances will be mere surrender and we definitely will not undergo this humiliation.”

The IMF noted the U.S. sanctions-- as well as a more sluggish Saudi economy and conflicts in Iraq, Syria and Yemen -- had adversely affected growth in the region.

Rouhani’s problems are by no means just triggered by international forces. Iranians have complained that jobs are harder to come by and the cost of living has risen.

“Every day when I go shopping, I think yesterday I was better off than today,” one woman, identified only as Maryam, told the FT. “I wake up every morning and realize there has been a jump in the price of chicken or a doubling in the price of onions and tomatoes.”

Trump and Democrats Agree to Pursue $2 Trillion Infrastructure Plan,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Annie Karni', 'Emily Cochrane', 'Alan Rappeport']",04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/us/politics/trump-infrastructure-plan.html,"The original plan was also one that everyone rejected from the beginning — Mr. Trump even criticized public-private partnerships, which were key to the plan’s financing — and no new plan has been put forward since.

But Democrats went to the White House for a meeting, intent to play along as if there was a chance.

Ms. Pelosi requested the meeting with Mr. Trump, in part to change the conversation from impeachment to infrastructure and to demonstrate that Democrats want to proceed with a policy agenda, and not merely with investigations of the president.

For Mr. Trump, an infrastructure deal would provide him with a bipartisan achievement he could point to while campaigning.

Democrats arrived on Tuesday with a dozen-member delegation of lawmakers. Mr. Trump was accompanied by Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, as well as seven White House aides, including his daughter Ivanka Trump, who is also a presidential adviser; Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council; and Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel.

“I would like to do something,” Mr. Trump told the group, according to a Democratic aide. “It may not be typically Republican.” The president made it clear that he had never supported the public-private partnership model to fund a bill that his aides, like Gary D. Cohn, his former top economic adviser, had pitched. “That was a Gary bill,” he said of his earlier attempt at an infrastructure bill. “That bill was so stupid.”

Meetings between the president and the two Democratic leaders have often taken a surprising turn.

Mr. Trump has conducted supposedly closed-door sessions on live television, or shuttled his guests to the Situation Room for maximum privacy. They, in turn, have surprised him by getting out their versions of what happened as soon as they got to the driveway in front of the White House, where reporters are usually waiting.

In September 2017, for instance, after Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi joined the president for in-house Chinese food, they announced that Mr. Trump had agreed to work on an immigration deal, including protections for thousands of young immigrants from deportation. Mr. Trump was later forced to backtrack from that position."
"Trump Calls For Asylum-Seekers To Pay Fees, Proposing New Restrictions",https://www.npr.org,['Laurel Wamsley'],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.npr.org/2019/04/30/718627010/trump-calls-for-asylum-seekers-to-pay-fees-proposing-new-restrictions,"Trump Calls For Asylum-Seekers To Pay Fees, Proposing New Restrictions

President Trump is calling for his administration to restrict the asylum process, issuing a presidential memorandum that proposes charging asylum-seekers fees and other broad changes.

Trump's proposals were widely criticized by Democrats and immigration advocates, who predicted a new legal battle over the president's policy.

""Seeking asylum is a right under U.S. and international law — not a privilege to pay for,"" said Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona.

In the memo, Trump said he is giving Attorney General William Barr and acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan 90 days to propose new regulations to speed up the processing of asylum claims, charge application fees for those seeking asylum, and to bar work authorization for certain applicants.

Issued Monday evening, the memo also calls on Homeland Security personnel to ""improve the integrity"" of credible fear determinations, and to prioritize the deportation of immigrants who have received final orders of removal.

Trump often mocks the asylum system, calling it a ""loophole"" that attracts immigrants to the U.S. This memo is the Trump administration's latest effort to make it harder for migrants to stay in the country, and it comes amid a spike in border crossings, including a large number of families seeking asylum.

Trump derided the current immigration laws as ""weak, ineffective and dangerous,"" but he has made little effort to work with Congress to change them.

In response to Trump's proposals, immigrants' rights advocates said they found the idea of charging asylum-seekers fees to process their applications to be particularly egregious.

""[T]he idea that we will charge asylum seekers a fee to seek refuge from persecution, torture, or death is offensive and counter to our values,"" the American Civil Liberties Union tweeted.

The Immigration and Nationality Act already includes a provision that permits the U.S. to impose fees on foreign nationals seeking asylum or work authorization. But critics say such fees may be impossible for many asylum-seekers to pay, unless financial waivers are granted liberally.

Melissa Crow, senior supervising attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, says the memorandum is another in a string of the Trump administration's attacks on vulnerable asylum-seekers. ""We've seen it over and over again, from turning away asylum-seekers at ports of entry, to trying to make those who enter between ports of entry ineligible for asylum, and most recently until now, sending asylum-seekers back to Mexico to wait for their court hearings,"" she says. ""The Trump administration has had their hand slapped numerous times by the courts, and I suspect that this time will be no different.""

It's too soon to tell exactly how the proposed measures would play out for asylum-seekers, because the actual regulations have yet to be written by the attorney general and DHS. But Crow says one of her concerns is that the proposed changes could prevent migrants from applying for different types of relief for which they may be eligible.

When migrants come to the U.S. border and express a desire to apply for asylum, the first step is often the credible-fear interview, in which they must convince an asylum officer that they have a credible fear of returning home.

If they make it over that hurdle, they can apply for any type of relief that's available to them. For instance, people who were trafficked can apply for a T visa, and young people who have been abused, abandoned or neglected by a parent may apply for special immigrant juvenile status.

But with the proposed changes, Crow worries people may only be referred for asylum or withholding of removal proceedings — categories that have different standards and which aren't available to some people, including those who have previously been deported and then unlawfully reentered the country.

As it released Trump's memo, the White House included a sheet of statistics and arguments to bolster its case. ""Our immigration system has reached a breaking point as we continue to see an overwhelming surge of migrants, with more than 100,000 arriving at our border in March alone,"" it states. ""As a result of loopholes in United States immigration law, migrants claiming fear are often released into communities across the United States, where they often remain indefinitely.""

The memo also proposes regulations to require nearly all asylum applications to be decided in immigration court within 180 days of filing, not including appeals. U.S. immigration courts are notoriously backlogged, and it's not clear whether the proposed changes would also provide additional resources as they aim to speed up the courts' work.

Whatever the final language of the proposed regulations, they are likely to be challenged in court.

Crow says she sees an irony in the administration's latest moves to crack down on asylum-seekers, noting that the U.S. has recently cut off aid to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras — a move that's unlikely to improve the quality of life in countries that are among the biggest producers of people seeking asylum.

And when people in those countries seek a better life, Crow says, ""we're making it even more difficult for them to reach safety once they flee.""

Dem senator warns Trump’s Florida estate will soon be underwater: ‘It’s going to be Mar-a-Lagoon’,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-senator-warns-trumps-florida-estate-will-soon-be-underwater-its-going-to-be-mar-a-lagoon,"Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., in promoting his Green New Deal, warned Tuesday that President Trump’s Florida estate will be underwater within 15 years if the U.S. does not act to stop climate change.

“Within 15 years, Mar-a-Lago’s going to be underwater for over 100 days a year, it’s going to be Mar-a-Lagoon, not Mar-a-Lago,” Markey said in a discussion on the Green New Deal at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Markey, who has long focused on environmental issues, introduced a resolution on the Green New Deal in February along with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. While the legislation failed a Senate test vote last month, the Green New Deal has spread into the Democratic mainstream -- and Markey’s resolution was co-signed by a number of top 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls.

That push for a Green New Deal has been accompanied by increasingly apocalyptic language from Democratic lawmakers, who have seized on a U.N. report that concluded significant actions must be taken by 2030 to reduce climate change.

2020 hopeful Beto O’Rourke, after he unveiled a climate change initiative that would cost $5 trillion over 10 years to reach zero carbon emissions by 2050, said Monday that society has 10 years to “make the kind of bold change that we need.”

Ocasio-Cortez put it more bluntly in January: “Millennials and people, you know, Gen Z and all these folks that will come after us are looking up and we’re like: ‘The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don’t address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?'""

Republicans, including in the White House, have been skeptical about climate change and have opposed Democrats’ government-focused ideas to combat the threat. But Markey on Tuesday declared the question was not up for debate.

""It's no longer a debatable subject, regardless of how much money the Koch brothers throw at the phony science, no matter how much greenwashing the fossil fuel industry seeks to engage in,” he said. “That debate is over."""
"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez insists the Veterans Affairs administration isn't broken, but many veterans strongly disagree",https://www.businessinsider.com,['Eliza Relman'],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.businessinsider.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-va-veterans-affairs-isnt-broken-veterans-disagree-2019-4,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez again insisted that the Department of Veterans Affairs isn't broken and argued that the healthcare system should be fully funded and protected from privatization, despite years of dysfunction, long wait times, and substandard care.

""There is a myth that all VAs everywhere are broken,"" she said at a town hall in Corona, Queens on Saturday. ""Because if we can starve them of budgets and make sure that they can't do their job, then we can say the whole system should be thrown away.""

She went on, ""I'm not gonna back down from protecting the VA, I'm not gonna back down from saying we should fund it.""

Ocasio-Cortez's repeated claim that the department has 48,000 vacancies is higher than the number on record. VA officials reported last fall that the department has more than 45,000 vacant positions, about 11% of VA's total workforce. Almost 17% of management posts were unfilled last year.

Democratic lawmakers have argued that those positions should be filled before the department outsources healthcare services to private providers.

The VA has for years suffered from excessively long wait times, corruption scandals, and underfunding. In 2016, the former director of the VA's crisis hotline said one third of calls to the suicide-prevention hotline went unanswered. Between 2005 and 2015, an average of 20 veterans died by suicide every day — a rate that is 1.5 times higher than among adults who haven't served in the military, after adjusting for gender and age.

A September 2018 Military Times poll found just 20 percent of active duty troops hold a ""favorable"" view of the VA, with 40 percent saying their view of the administration is ""unfavorable.""

Lawmakers have long debated efforts to privatize the system, which proponents say would offer veterans higher quality and more easily accessible care and critics say would increase healthcare costs and funnel taxpayer dollars into private corporations.

A 2018 ProPublica and PolitiFact investigation found that wait times were longer and costs higher for veterans who received private healthcare during four years of the Veterans Choice program. In response to the report, VA Secretary Robert Wilkie agreed that the department was ""taken advantage of"" in paying $2 billion in fees to private companies tasked with booking veterans' appointments with private doctors.

This particular debate began when Ocasio-Cortez argued at another town hall earlier this month that Americans should resist efforts to privatize the VA's services.

""All I can think of is that classic refrain that my parents always taught me growing up, is that: 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it,'"" she said, arguing that Trump and his allies are ""trying to fix the VA for a for-profit healthcare industry that does not put people or veterans first.""

Congressional Republicans took issue with Ocasio-Cortez's remarks, calling her praise of the VA ""offensive."" Some Democrats, including Rep. Seth Moulton, a 2020 candidate and Marine veteran, have also criticized Ocasio-Cortez's stance.

Moulton argued that private insurance ""should be an option"" for veterans seeking care through the VA. Recent efforts to expand veterans' access to private care have received bipartisan support.

But last Wednesday, Trump tweeted that he agrees with Ocasio-Cortez that the VA ""is not broken,"" arguing that his administration had fixed it.

""Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is correct, the VA is not broken, it is doing great. But that is only because of the Trump Administration,"" the president wrote. ""We got Veterans Choice & Accountability passed.""

Paul Reickhoff, founder of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, tweeted in response to the exchange, ""Oh boy. Here we go. It was bound to happen sooner or later. @realDonaldTrump vs. @AOC on Twitter. With veterans, the VA, truth, and the real best interests of veterans stuck in the crossfire.""

He added, ""And no, the VA is not doing great. It does some things great. Others ok. Others badly. That's the complex truth most vets know and have experienced. Like with most issues in America, the truth is not on the ideological extremes.""

Last year, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which significantly increased the number of veterans eligible for private healthcare. More than a third — 36% — of veterans' healthcare is now provided by the private sector, up from 22% in 2014. But Trump declined to approve a bipartisan bill to fund the new law earlier this year."
State Department preparing for clash of civilizations with China,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/state-department-preparing-for-clash-of-civilizations-with-china,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s team is developing a strategy for China based on the idea of “a fight with a really different civilization” for the first time in American history.

“This is a fight with a really different civilization and a different ideology and the United States hasn't had that before,” Kiron Skinner, the director of policy planning at the State Department, said Monday evening at a security forum in Washington, D.C.

Skinner is leading an effort to develop a concept of U.S.-China relations on the scale of what she called “Letter X” — the unsigned essay by George Kennan, who assessed “the sources of Soviet conduct” in 1947 and outlined the containment strategy that guided American strategists for the rest of the Cold War. China poses a unique challenge, she said, because the regime in Beijing isn’t a child of Western philosophy and history.

“The Soviet Union and that competition, in a way it was a fight within the Western family,” Skinner said, noting Karl Marx’s indebtedness to Western political ideas. “It’s the first time that we will have a great power competitor that is not Caucasian.”

Skinner credited retired Army Gen. H.R. McMaster, who served as White House national security adviser from March 2017 to March 2018, with recognizing the need for a National Security Strategy organized around the return of great power competition with Russia and China. But those two rivals are not equivalent, she said, identifying Russia as a mere “global survivor” that pales in comparison to China.

[Related: Pompeo: China threatens 'our continued democracy']

“We see it as a more fundamental long-term threat,” Skinner told New America CEO Anne Marie Slaughter. “In China, we have an economic competitor, we have an ideological competitor, one that really does seek a global reach that many of us didn't expect a couple of decades ago.”

Slaughter, who served as the head of policy planning for the State Department from 2009 to 2011, suggested that Skinner was offering the U.S.-China relationship as the ""clash of civilizations"" outlined in another landmark essay that discussed how geopolitics would change after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Skinner concurred.

""Some of those tenets, but a little bit different,"" she answered. ""I think we have to take the rose-colored glasses off and get real about the nature of the threat. And, I think we also have to give a kind of respect for, I think, what the Chinese seek to accomplish.""

Trump has made a trade war with China one of the major undertakings of his administration, in pursuit of a trade deal to rebalance the relationship between the world’s two largest economies. U.S. officials have also rebranded the Asia Pacific region as the Indo-Pacific, partly as a nod to China’s surge in Africa and the potential for India to function as a counter-weight to the Communist power.

But Pompeo has sounded the alarm about China’s influence around the world, warning of security threats in Europe and the Arctic, as well as predatory lending in the Western Hemisphere.

“Trade is not the only problem and maybe not the biggest in the long run with China,” Skinner said. “But we're now looking more deeply and broadly at China. And, I think State is in the lead in that broader attempt to get something like a Letter X for China, what Kennan wrote. You can't have a policy without an argument underneath it.”

Pompeo’s team has rebuked China repeatedly for human rights abuses, especially the hostility to religious beliefs displayed by the regime’s mass detention of Uighur Muslims and the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities. But Skinner suggested that human rights arguments might not be as useful against China as they were against the Soviet Union, which was weakened by a 1975 agreement that allowed Soviet dissidents to cooperate indirectly with Western powers to advocate for “the rights of emigration and religious freedom,” according to the State Department.

“It was a really important Western concept that opened the door really to undermine the Soviet Union, a totalitarian state, on human rights principles,” she said. “That's not really possible with China.”"

Davis said approximately ""320 DoD personnel will be required to support the DHS request for assistance through September 30, 2019, at an estimated cost of $7.4M.""

CNN reported last week the DHS had requested 280 additional US troops and other logistical support for operations on the southern border.

The request comes after CBP released data showing there were more apprehensions on the US southern border in March than in any other month in more than a decade.

EPA reaffirms glyphosate safe for users as court cases grow,https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/epa-reaffirms-weed-killer-safe-users-court-cases-62736440,"The Environmental Protection Agency reaffirmed Tuesday that a popular weed killer is safe for people, as legal claims mount from Americans who blame the herbicide for their cancer.

The EPA's draft conclusion Tuesday came in a periodic review of glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup. The agency found that it posed ""no risks of concern"" for people exposed to it by any means — on farms, in yards and along roadsides, or as residue left on food crops.

The EPA's draft findings reaffirmed that glyphosate ""is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans.""

Two recent U.S. court verdicts have awarded multimillion-dollar claims to men who blame glyphosate for their lymphoma. Bayer, which acquired Roundup-maker Monsanto last year, advised investors in mid-April that it faced U.S. lawsuits from 13,400 people over alleged exposure to the weed killer.

Bayer spokesmen did not immediately respond Tuesday to an email seeking comment.

Nathan Donley, a scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity environmental group, said the agency is relying on industry-backed studies and ignoring research that points to higher risks of cancer.

In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, classified glyphosate as "" probably carcinogenic to humans."" The agency said it relied on ""limited"" evidence of cancer in people and ""sufficient"" evidence of cancer in study animals.

The EPA draft review says the agency found potential risk to mammals and birds that feed on leaves treated with glyphosate, and risk to plants. The agency is proposing adding restrictions to cut down on unintended drift of the weed killer, including not authorizing spraying it by air when winds are above 15 mph."
Rod Rosenstein Embodies the Republican Surrender to Trump,http://nymag.com,['Jonathan Chait'],04-30-2019,2019,4,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/rod-rosenstein-resigns-letter-trump-mueller-barr.html,"Photo: Win McNamee/Getty Images

The most bizarre passage in Rod Rosenstein’s letter to President Trump resigning his post as deputy attorney general is praise for “the courtesy and humor you often display in our personal conversations.” It is not standard practice for the president to have personal conversations with the deputy attorney general at all, certainly not when that person is supervising an investigation into the president himself. And while we cannot know the substance of those personal conversations, we do know that Rosenstein was once so alarmed by Trump’s behavior that he discussed invoking the 25th Amendment to have him removed on account of mental unfitness.

Maybe Trump’s private conversations somehow contain the humor that is completely lacking in his public persona, which consist of boasts, lies, and belittling attacks. Trump’s public treatment of Rosenstein included tweeting an image of him behind bars along with other alleged traitors. That Trump, what a jokester.

Rosenstein’s status as a target of Trump’s rage, and his background as a career official, raised broad hopes that he would check the president’s authoritarian impulses. By all indications, he failed to live up to this heroic destiny. Rosenstein ended his career as a dutiful functionary, allowing Trump to trash the rule of law while claiming he had upheld it.

Rosenstein deserves to be judged by the forgiving standards of a man placed in an untenable situation and having no good options. Trump’s worldview is inimical to the concept of the rule of law. The president believes the Department of Justice can and must be placed at his personal disposal, and used to harass his enemies while giving himself and his friends impunity. Trump can no more grasp a Department of Justice that holds his views at arm length than he could abide the doorman at his hotels subjecting him to strip searches.

Rosenstein’s answer to this dilemma was to bend, and bend, and bend. When Trump demanded personal loyalty from the FBI director and fired him for failing to quash a probe into Trump’s campaign, Rosenstein dutifully wrote a letter supplying Trump with a phony pretext. When Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the offense of following Department rules and recusing himself from an investigation into which he was massively conflicted, he remained loyal. When Trump installed a transparent hack in Matthew Whitaker, prompting more than 400 former DOJ officials to sign a public letter of protest, Rosenstein called the choice “superb.”

And then of course Rosenstein joined with Attorney General William Barr to impose their judgment that Robert Mueller’s investigation would not accuse the president of obstructing justice. One of Trump’s many acts of obstruction included instructing Corey Lewandowski, a private citizen, to order Sessions to violate Department procedure and take control of the investigation. As Ben Wittes notes, “If true and provable beyond a reasonable doubt, it is unlawful obstruction of justice.”

Barr, with Rosenstein’s imprimatur, deemed these and all of Trump’s other efforts to harm the investigation to be non-crimes. He did this despite the fact that Trump’s obstruction of justice successfully obstructed the probe – by dangling pardons to key witnesses, Roger Stone and Paul Manafort, thereby preventing Mueller from getting to the bottom of the campaign’s collusion with Russia. Barr and Rosenstein made the comically backward argument that because Trump prevented Mueller from proving criminal collusion, there was no underlying crime, therefore his efforts to halt the probe must go unpunished.

Before his firing, Comey confided his misgivings about Rosenstein. “Rod is a survivor,” he said. And you don’t get to survive that long across administrations without making compromises. “So I have concerns.” This turned out to be a perfect epitaph for Rosenstein’s tenure.

When Trump was poised to fire Rosenstein last fall, Rosenstein pleaded for his job. “I give the investigation credibility,” he said, according to the Washington Post, “I can land the plane.” Trump has a gift for homing in on this kind of weakness, and surrounding himself with morally compromised individuals who will do his bidding. Rosenstein’s desperation to avoid the ignominy of a firing and the torrent of abuse that always followed it – “I don’t want to go out with a tweet,” he said, according to the Post – made him suitably pathetic for Trump’s purposes.

In a farewell speech several days ago, Rosenstein sycophantically quoted his boss: “As President Trump pointed out, ‘we govern ourselves in accordance with the rule of law rather [than] … the whims of an elite few.’” It was perhaps his most overt gesture of submission. Here Rosenstein credited a man he knows perfectly well has contempt for the rule of law with cherishing the principle he has relentlessly undermined, a task at which Rosenstein ultimately aided him. He might as well have quoted Trump proclaiming the importance of truth, chastity and frugality.

We can extend Rosenstein enough credit to assume things did not follow his fondest hopes. He surely did not want the FBI Director and Attorney general to be fired for doing their jobs properly, nor to be publicly belittled by the president. Instead he seems to have convinced himself that the need for normalcy, or the appearance of it, transcended everything else. After principled resignation seemed unthinkable, every new compromise simply kept the plane on track for its landing.

It turns out most of the Republicans in the bureaucracy operate along the same principles as the ones running for office. Trump’s manifest unfitness for office and disdain for democratic norms begin as a shock. Gradually, though, they recede into the background, and take their place as fixed features of the landscape around which everything else must be arranged. That is how Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have worked around and ultimately for a figure they greeted with disgust. And that ultimately is how Rosenstein, too, served Trump."

"Labor Department: Gig Workers Are Contractors, Not Employees",https://reason.com,"['Eric Boehm', 'Brian Doherty', 'Christian Britschgi', 'C.J. Ciaramella', 'Jacob Sullum', 'Nick Gillespie', 'Matt Welch', 'Peter Suderman']",04-30-2019,2019,4,https://reason.com/2019/04/30/labor-department-gig-workers-are-contractors-not-employees/,"In a letter issued Monday to an unidentified sharing economy platform, the federal Department of Labor clarified that gig economy workers are independent contractors, not full-fledged employees.

That seems like a common sense reading of the relationship between those workers and the platforms—like Uber, TaskRabbit, and dozens of others—that connect them with potential clients. Someone who drives for Uber, for example, gets to set their own hours and is responsible for their own vehicle. That certainly doesn't look like a typical employer-employee relationship, but some activists have been trying to get courts and state governments to identify sharing economy workers as full-fledged employees.

Defining gig economy workers as employees would make the platforms responsible for providing health insurance and other benefits, and would force them to follow federal minimum wage laws. In all, employees can be 20 to 30 percent more expensive than contractors. It's a designation that would potentially jeopardize the business model that has allowed the gig economy to grow and prosper—and one that would likely limit workers' ability to exercise the independence that those jobs offer.

The Labor Department's letter only applies to a single company—an unnamed firm that ""connects service providers to end-market consumers to provide a wide variety of services, such as transportation, delivery, shopping, moving, cleaning, plumbing,

painting, and household services""—that had asked the department to determine whether workers using its platform were employees or contractors.

Still, the ruling is an important indication of where it stands on the broader question of how gig economy workers should be classified.

""Today, the U.S. Department of Labor offers further insight into the nexus of current labor law and innovations in the job market,"" Keith Sonderling, acting administrator of the department's Wage and Hour Division, said in a statement.

The ruling is also an important break with previous Labor Department guidance. Under the Obama administration, the department had issued official guidance advising that Uber and Lyft drivers would likely be classified as employees if the department was asked to make a determination about their status. Shortly after taking office, the Trump administration removed that guidance from the Department of Labor's website, prompting the unnamed company in the letter issued Monday to seek a specific ruling from the department.

In making its determination, the department considered six factors: the degree to which employers have control over workers, the permanency of the workers' relationship with the employer, the employer's level of investment in workers' equipment and facilities, the level of skill required for the work, the workers' potential to earn profit, and the integration of the workers' services into the employer's business.

While the latter four are more technical in nature, the first two categories are probably the most important. Gig economy platforms have very little control over their employees, who typically can log in or log out of the systems as they please.

""A business may have control where it, for example, requires a worker to work exclusively for the business; disavow working for or interacting with competitors during the working relationship,"" the Department of Labor letter states.

But that is not at all how gig economy platforms operate. Drivers can work for both Lyft and Uber—often switching between the two apps during a single shift—and completing other odd jobs on TaskRabbit does not mean a worker can't also deliver food on DoorDash.

Indeed, research from JP Morgan Chase, an investment bank, shows that most gig economy workers are active only a few months out of the year. Rather than being full-time jobs, the data indicate that workers are likely to use the gig economy to earn extra income when needed or when time allows.

Similarly, there is very little in the way of permanence to the employer-worker relationship within the gig economy. For an Uber driver, for example, ending that relationship is as easy as deleting an app.

Defining that relationship at all is ""inherently difficult,"" the Labor Department letter reads, in part, because ""as a matter of economic reality, [workers] are working for the consumer, not [the platform]."""
Migrant families and nowhere to put them: How the acting DHS chief plans to handle the southern border,https://www.cbsnews.com,[],04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/migrant-families-how-acting-dhs-chief-kevin-mcaleenan-plans-to-handle-southern-border-60-minutes-2019-04-28/,"Earlier this month, President Trump placed Kevin McAleenan in charge of the Department of Homeland Security. The president fired his previous DHS chief, Kirstjen Nielsen, because he said he wanted to go in a tougher direction. As the new acting secretary, McAleenan is facing the largest wave of illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border in a decade. 100,000 migrants were detained just last month. So we went to McAllen, Texas, one of the busiest sections on the border, to see for ourselves. We were surprised how many families were crossing, where they were detained and how quickly they were released. We asked Secretary McAleenan how he plans to manage the crisis and navigate what may be the most difficult job in Washington.

Sharyn Alfonsi: How do you keep happy-- a boss, who wants to go in a tougher direction, when it comes to immigration, but also work with a Congress that has absolutely no incentive to get anything done in this area before the election?



Kevin McAleenan: Well, first, I believe you can be tough and compassionate at the same time. I'm gonna do what I've always done –give good law enforcement operational, and policy advice to lawmakers and to policy makers. And that's my intent. I think the ground has shifted in this discussion over the past month.

Sharyn Alfonsi: How so?

Kevin McAleenan: I think the numbers from March, I think more members from Congress coming down and seeing what we are facing at the border. They're realizing that something different is happening with this crisis. It's not manufactured it's real. And we've gotta sit down at a table and talk about ways to solve it.

Acting DHS Secretary Keven McAleenan with correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi

Acting DHS Secretary Kevin McAleenan says migrants are crossing the border in record numbers because they know they will be released in the U.S.

Kevin McAleenan: If you come now, and if you come as a family or as an unaccompanied child, you will be allowed to stay. You will be released. Because our court system is so backlogged, and our laws prevent effective repatriation, even if there's no right to stay in the U.S.--

Sharyn Alfonsi: They know, if they come--

Kevin McAleenan: --even if you don't have a valid asylum claim.

Sharyn Alfonsi: --they're gonna be led out the backdoor.

Kevin McAleenan: That's exactly right. And smugglers are advertising that directly in their hometowns.

There is no shortage of people fleeing poverty and crime who want to take the often dangerous trip. We rode with the U.S. Border Patrol deep in Southeast Texas. We saw family after family walking into the U.S. Agent Marcelino Medina asks the migrants if they're okay and points them to where they can turn themselves in to other agents. Further along this dusty stretch of road, he spots a family hiding in the bushes. He asks them if they're okay too, and points the way to where they need to go. Watch their faces when he tells them they are in the United States.



Sharyn Alfonsi: He didn't know where he was, did he?



Agent Marcelino Medina: No. He-- he asked-- how far to the U.S., right? So we were letting him know he's already here. So that's kind of what brought him to tears. He just-- he said he just wanted help.



Last month, a record number of families crossed the border, 53,000 people. Most with only what they could carry. The groups we saw all had children. This woman, eight months pregnant, told us she fled violence in Honduras. She'd been traveling for 15 days.



Sharyn Alfonsi:: You're trying to get her a ride?



Agent Marcelino Medina: I wanted to get her a ride, yeah, but she's-- they're gonna have to walk it.



There are no border agents available to help her. This 277-mile stretch along the Rio Grande River separates the U.S. from Mexico and is one of the busiest sections for illegal crossings. Agents told us they are overwhelmed caring for so many families.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Is this a typical day?



Agent Marcelino Medina: Definitely. You're talking about a sector where recently we've been seeing over 1,000 people a day, and this McAllen Station, the mc-- you can see there's some more coming down that way right now.



Sharyn Alfonsi: It never ends.

Agent Marcelino Medina: You know, it doesn't.

Agent Medina takes us into the brush to show us why so many families cross at this particular area of the border.

Sharyn Alfonsi: So once they get here, they're in U.S. territory. This is U.S. territory right here, and that there--



Agent Marcelino Medina: Correct, this is the-- that's the Mexican riverbank, this is the U.S. riverbank.



In some spots, it takes less than 15 minutes for a smuggler to paddle an inflatable raft full of migrants across. Typically they pay between $3,000 and $9,000 a person.



Agent Marcelino Medina: You gotta keep in mind that all these bo-- everybody that comes across, no matter adult, child, they're paying thousands of dollars.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Is it the cartel running this?



Agent Marcelino Medina: It's-- this-- this is exactly what-- what it is. This is one of their ways they can make money.



We watched as hundreds of migrants walked from the river bank, about three miles, to a levee to turn themselves into Border Patrol. It is orderly and oddly quiet, except for the sounds of the wind and babies crying.

From Honduras to the U.S. border — in a wheelchair





Sharyn Alfonsi: Tell me about your trip here.



Julio Cesar: Muy deficil.



Very difficult, Julio Cesar told us about his 1,600-mile trip from Honduras. Failed crops and threats of violence led him to escape with his daughter. He said his daughter has some sort of chest infection. He hopes he can get her help. As we were talking, his name was called to get on the bus.

This is the beginning of their immigration process. Because they've reached U.S. soil, they are legally allowed to apply for asylum and most will. But first, they are taken to the McAllen Border Patrol Station to be processed. We were allowed to film inside, a first for the facility. They wanted us to see how busy they are. It looked like any other jail except that there were mothers with children peering back at us through the glass. Men are kept separately. Background checks are run and fingerprints are taken. Court dates are scheduled.



Sharyn Alfonsi: How many people-- would you say are in here right now?



Agent Rudy Karisch: How many people would you say?



MALE VOICE: We have 551 subjects here.



Agent Rudy Karisch: Five hundred--



Chief Patrol Agent Rudy Karisch says they are struggling to care for the increasing numbers of families.

Sharyn Alfonsi: What are the agents having to do to deal with this new population that's coming across?



Agent Rudy Karisch: Forty percent of my workforce right now is dedicated to the processing, to the care and feeding, to the hospital watch. So that takes that 40 percent away from their border security mission.



Sharyn Alfonsi: I mean, they're making--



Agent Rudy Karisch: But it is--



Sharyn Alfonsi: --they're making formula. They are bringing juice.



Agent Rudy Karisch: --but it is a strain.



Sharyn Alfonsi: Well there's a pile a diapers right there.



Agent Rudy Karisch: Yeah. And-- that's what we have to do.



The flood of families comes nearly a year after the White House ended its ""zero tolerance"" policy that led to the separation of thousands of children from their parents. Kevin McAleenan was responsible for enforcing that policy as the head of Customs and Border Protection.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Did you have any regrets about the way that was carried out?



Kevin McAleenan: Yeah. I-- I-- I think-- when you lose the public trust in a law enforcement initiative, and you have to c-- recalibrate at the presidential level-- that means that wasn't successful.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Looking back on it, did it work?

Kevin McAleenan: So the-- the enforcement of the law against parents who violated our border laws and brought children with them-- was effective. But it didn't work in the sense that we lost the public trust in the implementation of that initiative. And I agreed with the president's decision to stop it.



President Trump has said he is ""not looking"" to restart family separations. But he has threatened to completely shut down the border.

President Trump Soundbite: In many cases, they put their worst people in the caravan, they're not gonna put their best in.

According to the DHS, since October, less than one percent of the migrants who crossed the border had any criminal history. The families we saw were travelling from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, an area of Central America referred to as the northern triangle.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Why so many people from this northern triangle of countries?

Kevin McAleenan: Right. There's poverty. There's drought that's affected the crop yields. Certainly, there are issues with food insecurity. In other parts of Central America, there are still violence issues and gang-control issues.

President Trump Soundbite: We stopped payment to Honduras, to Guatemala and to El Salvador. We were paying them tremendous amounts of money.

An estimated $700 million in aid a year aimed at preventing violence and curbing extreme poverty and hunger in those countries.



Sharyn Alfonsi: He said, ""We're not paying them anymore, because they haven't done a thing for us."" You've testified in Congress, ""We need to continue to support those areas."" Do you still believe that?



Kevin McAleenan: So I think the president's right, that we need to have aid that has targeted impact. It needs to support American interests. It needs to support economic development. And it needs to help reduce the causes of migration—everything from insecurity on the food side, to security, in terms of the cities and gang issues.



Sharyn Alfonsi: But wouldn't it just push more people to the border, if there's no aid coming in?



Kevin McAleenan: Well-- aid that's not being used effectively-- by an accountable partner isn't helping.

Sister Norma Pimental: We must address the root causes of why these families are coming. I don't think that if they had given a choice, they would come.

Sister Norma Pimental runs the Catholic Charities Respite Center in McAllen. The Border Patrol has no where to take the families after they are released from custody. Luckily, Sister Norma welcomes them all. They are free to go wherever they like but most stay here for a few days. They are exhausted from weeks of travel and hungry. Volunteers hand out donated clothes and meals.



Sharyn Alfonsi: How many meals are you doing a day in here?



Sister Norma Pimental: Well, thousands of meals. Because we may have, like, 300, 400, sometimes up to 600, you know, people we feeding on that day.



Sister Norma took Secretary McAleenan through the respite center. It is noisy and crowded, with more people wanting to come in. Sister Norma says she doesn't turn anyone away.



Sharyn Alfonsi: If you weren't here, where would all these people go?



Sister Norma Pimental: They would be in the streets, begging and asking for help and-- and exposed to so many people taking advantage of them. You know, it's-- it's so sad that people are suffering like they are.

From Sister Norma's, the families go to the bus station. For some, it was just three days ago they crossed the border. They tell us they are headed to places where they have family or cities where they offer free legal help. Catholic charities gives the migrants signs that say, ""Please help me. I don't speak english. What bus do I need to take?""



Sharyn Alfonsi: We saw the migrants leaving Catholic Charities, getting on a bus-- and going off to different parts of the United States.

Kevin McAleenan: Those families are-- are given a court hearing. They're-- they're given a date for a court hearing. And that court hearing could be two years out, five years out, for an initial hearing. That's how overloaded the s-- the system is at this point.

Sharyn Alfonsi: I think a lot of people are gonna be surprised to see that, to see--

Kevin McAleenan: I agree.

Sharyn Alfonsi: -- them get to the bus station. And I think there's that moment when they leave. And you're either gonna think, ""That's great,"" or, ""This is horrifying.""

Kevin McAleenan: Yeah. The reality of the system today is r-- is very hard to understand.

There is a border wall in McAllen. But it's not on the river. At some points, it is miles inland from where we saw the migrants come ashore. Secretary McAleenan says it does slow down drug traffickers and the migrants who are trying to evade capture.

Kevin McAleenan: We don't need it everywhere but we need it in several key places. And the support we're getting to build the additional wall is essential.

Secretary McAleenan is also lobbying Congress to change the law so DHS can detain families while they await a decision on their asylum claims.

Kevin McAleenan: We've asked Congress to modify that law, to allow us to detain families together, through a fair, transparent and expeditious court proceeding. And if they have an asylum claim or a valid right to stay, under our laws they would receive that certainty. And if not, they would be repatriated to their home country.

Keeping families longer would require more facilities. Potentially costing billions of dollars.



Sharyn Alfonsi: What about tent cities? Is that on the table?



Kevin McAleenan: Tent cities, I think, is-- is a misnomer. For-- for us, right now, we are looking at DHS, at putting up some soft-sided facilities. In fact--



Sharyn Alfonsi: Isn't that a tent? (LAUGH)



Kevin McAleenan: It-- it is-- sure, it could be-- it could be a tent. But I wanna explain the purpose for it. We just had a bipartisan r-- report, from the Homeland Security Advisory Council, that looked at the situation we're facing on the border, and said, ""You need additional facilities. You need to be able to take families and children out of a border patrol station,"" which is a police station. It's built for single adults, who have violated laws. And you need 'em in a better setting.



One day after our interview, we learned DHS had already broken ground on two tent cities in Texas to hold migrants for short-term processing. But concerns linger about whether the Department of Homeland Security should be in the business of holding families in any setting. Last year, despite efforts to treat them, two children died in DHS custody.



Sharyn Alfonsi: Are you worried that another child's gonna die in custody?



Kevin McAleenan: So what I know is our agents and officers are doing everything they possibly can to take care of vulnerable people in our custody. When you're looking at people arriving, sometimes, more than 4,000 in a day, so with that level of volume, with children that young-- with-- with the weather getting hotter, I'm very concerned we could have another tragedy.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Is it a humanitarian crisis? Or is it a national-security crisis?



Kevin McAleenan: It's absolutely both.

EPA reaffirms finding that glyphosate does not cause cancer,https://www.desmoinesregister.com,"['Donnelle Eller', 'Published A.M.

USA TODAY

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday reaffirmed its finding that glyphosate, the world's most popular herbicide, is not a cancer risk to users.

""There’s no evidence that glyphosate causes cancer,"" said Alexandra Dunn, an EPA assistant administrator for chemical safety and pollution prevention. ""There's no risk to public health from the application of glyphosate.""

It's the next step in the EPA's process to re-register the herbicide, popular with farmers growing food and with families and businesses killing weeds.

The agency said its scientific findings on human health risk are consistent with the reviews by several other countries and federal agencies.

EPA's review comes as legal challenges mount against Monsanto, the maker of RoundUp, a popular herbicide whose active ingredient is glyphosate.

Two California juries have ruled in favor of men with lymphoma and blamed the herbicide for their disease.

Bayer AG, which bought Monsanto last year, said it would appeal the decisions.

""EPA does not comment on litigation ... but our available scientific data does not support a cause-and-effect relationship between exposure to glyphosate and Parkinson's disease or non-Hodgkin lymphoma,"" Dunn said.

The Environmental Working Group slammed the finding, saying it ignores ""a growing body of independent research showing a strong connection between glyphosate and cancer in humans.""

In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans.""

Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler and President Donald Trump ""completely ignore science in favor of polluters like Bayer.""

“This move by EPA should not come as a surprise. Under the control of Trump and Wheeler, the agency is virtually incapable of taking steps to protect people from dangerous chemicals like glyphosate,” Cook said.

Dunn said EPA's review was deeper than that of the cancer research agency, an arm of the World Health Organization.

""It's the only agency globally that has connected glyphosate to cancer,"" she said, calling it an outlier.

Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in U.S. agriculture, applied on more than 100 food crops, including glyphosate-resistant corn, soybeans and cotton.

“If we are going to feed 10 billion people by 2050, we are going to need all the tools at our disposal, which includes the use the glyphosate,” U.S. Ag Secretary Sonny Perdue said.

Amid concerns about traces of glyphosate showing up in food that children eat, Dunn said EPA found no risk to pregnant women and children.

""We also found no risk to children playing on residential lawn treated with glyphosate,"" Dunn said. ""Any family can purchase it to use on their yards.""

Environmental Work Group, among others, have questioned children's exposure to herbicides through breakfast cereal, granola and other food.

""We found no risks or concerns ... at the maximum allowed residue levels on cereals"" and other foods, Dunn said.

While EPA did not identify public health risks with glyphosate, it did find risks through its ecological assessment.

The agency proposes changes in use to protect nearby plants that pollinators, birds and other animals eat.

EPA said glyphosate drifting could eliminate food sources for animals, such as milkweed for monarch butterflies.

To address those risks, EPA is proposing management measures to help farmers target pesticide sprays on the intended pest, protect pollinators, and reduce the problem of weeds becoming resistant to glyphosate.

In a separate action, EPA is updating label language for pesticide products for herbicides, collaborating with federal, state and other stakeholders on conservation efforts and increasing outreach on spray drift management and integrated pest management.

Once the Federal Register notice publishes, the public will be able to submit comments on EPA’s proposed decision at www.regulations.gov in docket EPA-HQ-OPP-2009-0361.

Veteran commits suicide outside VA hospital in Ohio,https://www.aol.com,"['Aol Staff', 'David Boroff']",04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/04/29/veteran-commits-suicide-outside-va-hospital-in-ohio/23719039/,"A military veteran took his own life outside the Cleveland VA Medical Center early Monday, according to officials.

The VA Northeast Ohio Health Care System said in a statement that “our deepest condolences go out to the loved ones affected by this death.”

The suicide comes after three veterans took their lives in a five-day span in Georgia and Texas earlier this month.

Gary Pressley, 29, was found in the parking lot of a Georgia facility with a gunshot wound on April 5. Olen Hancock, 68, shot himself near Atlanta and was pronounced dead the following day, and another veteran shot himself in a VA waiting room and died on April 9.

“Every one of these is a gut-wrenching experience for our 24,000 mental health providers and all of us that work for VA,” Richard Stone of the Veterans Health Administration said at the time.

More than 6,000 veterans committed suicide in 2016, according to a report from the Department of Veterans Affairs. VA officials said in January that suicide prevention is the organization’s “top clinical priority.” More than 2 million veterans sought and received help for mental health issues through the VA in 2017.

Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie said earlier this month that ways must be found to combat homelessness, drug abuse and mental illness among veterans.

“The sad thing that we confront every day is that of the 20 veteran suicides that occur across the country 14 of those veterans are outside of our department,” Wilkie said.

Homeland Security Collected Intel on Arizona Family Separation Protests,https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com,"[""Meg O'Connor""]",04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/homeland-security-intelligence-arizona-family-separation-protests-11278067,"If you used Facebook to RSVP to one of 11 family separation protests across the state of Arizona last June, odds are your Facebook friends aren't the only ones who took note.

On Monday, The Intercept reported that a private intelligence company monitored social media ahead of nationwide protests against the Trump administration's family separation policy and shared that information with the Department of Homeland Security.

Documents obtained by The Intercept show the firm, LookingGlass Cyber Solutions, put together a list of more than 600 demonstrations across the country. Eleven of those protests took place in Arizona, in cities including Phoenix, Tucson, Nogales, and Flagstaff.

It appears LookingGlass used Facebook to gather information on protest times, locations, and attendance, then shared that information with DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis, who in turn disseminated it to staff and members of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. (A DHS official told The Intercept that LookingGlass's information was ""unsolicited."")

""I think it's frustrating, it's frightening, but it's not really surprising coming from this president and his administration,"" said Jalakoi Solomon, Arizona state director for NextGen America, a progressive advocacy organization that participated in the protests. ""We've seen this administration abuse its power time and time again. They've manufactured a crisis at the border; this is just another example.""

As NBC News reported in March, federal agencies created a database to track journalists and activists who had some connection to the migrant caravan. Documents obtained by NBC from the Department of Homeland Security show agents from ICE, DHS, Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Border Control, and the FBI all used the database, which listed 10 journalists, an attorney, and 48 others who were listed as organizers, instigators, or ""unknown."" Some of the individuals on the list were arrested, interviewed, or had visas revoked, NBC reported.

More locally, Phoenix New Times reported in March that the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center monitored responses to a controversial tweet about Colin Kaepernick shared by Arizona Department of Public Safety Director Frank Milstead.

I’m often amazed, but really surprised. I won’t mention your name, I refuse. If you’re in search of those who paid the Ultimate Sacrifice I would look to the men and women who wear a uniform and are killed/murdered keeping us safe & protecting those who can’t protect themselves. pic.twitter.com/fD5kYhMhmq — Col. Frank Milstead (@frank_milstead) September 6, 2018

The center examined replies to Milstead's tweet: a criminal intelligence analyst took screenshots of the replies and the images were shared with DPS employees via email.

Some of the Arizona protests noted in the LookingGlass list took place outside churches, city halls, child detention sites, and government buildings. Nearly 800 people attended the Phoenix demonstration against Trump's family separation policy, which took place outside the Arizona Senate building.

The rallies in Arizona followed Trump's announcement of a ""zero-tolerance"" policy separating children who crossed the border from the parents or guardians they crossed with, and jailing them separately.

More than 3,000 children were separated from their families under the Trump administration's family separation policy. The policy did not include a plan to reunite separated families; the true number of separated children is unknown due to poor record keeping. Federal officials have said it could take up to two years to reunite the imprisoned children with their families. Meanwhile, thousands of immigrant children have said they were sexually abused in U.S. detention centers, according to a February report from the Justice Department.

""I think it's really concerning,"" said Solomon from NextGen when asked about the list of protests acquired by DHS. ""It's pretty clear to see what they're trying to do: intimidate opponents who raise their voice and push back against this hateful ideology."""

WASHINGTON, April 30, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Microsoft Corp. announced a new collaboration to enhance opportunities for education, recreation and therapy for Veterans with mobility limitations by introducing the Xbox Adaptive Controller — a video game controller designed for people with limited mobility — in select VA rehabilitation centers around the country.

Microsoft company logo. (PRNewsFoto/Microsoft Corp.) (PRNewsfoto/Microsoft Corp.) More

The partnership, which was formalized April 18, will provide controllers and services to Veterans as part of therapeutic and rehabilitative activities aimed at challenging muscle activation and hand-eye coordination, and greater participation in social and recreational activities.

""This partnership is another step toward achieving VA's strategic goals of providing excellent customer experiences and business transformation,"" said VA Secretary Robert Wilkie. ""VA remains committed to offering solutions for Veterans' daily life challenges.""

Together, VA and Microsoft identified an opportunity to introduce or reintroduce gaming to Veterans with spinal cord injuries, amputations, and neurological or other injuries at 22 VA medical centers across the United States. Microsoft is donating its Xbox Adaptive Controller, game consoles, games and other adaptive gaming equipment as part of the collaboration.

Designated VA staff will engage with Veterans using the equipment and share feedback with Microsoft on therapeutic utility and the Veteran experience.

""We owe so much to the service and sacrifice of our Veterans, and as a company, we are committed to supporting them,"" said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. ""Our Xbox Adaptive Controller was designed to make gaming more accessible to millions of people worldwide, and we're partnering with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to bring the device to Veterans with limited mobility, connecting them to the games they love and the people they want to play with.""

Microsoft and VA have a long-standing strategic partnership, working together for more than 20 years to provide the best possible care and service to Veterans. Gaming is a popular pastime of military personnel, and access to the Xbox Adaptive Controller in VA rehabilitation centers provides the opportunity for Veterans to experience gaming's various benefits, including staying connected with friends and family across the world, building esprit de corps through competitive or cooperative gameplay, and providing stress relief.

Microsoft's initial contributions will be allocated across 22 VA facilities. In addition, the controllers and other equipment will be available for Veterans to use at events hosted by VA's Office of National Veterans Sports Programs and Special Events, such as the National Veterans Wheelchair Games.

The following 16 centers have confirmed participation to date, with at least six additional centers to come: Augusta VA Medical Center (VAMC), Central Alabama VA Health Care System (HCS), Central Texas Veterans HCS, Chillicothe VAMC, Dayton VAMC, Memphis VAMC, Minneapolis VA HCS, Richmond VAMC, VA St. Louis HCS, South Texas Veterans HCS (Audie L.

Kingston Awaits EPA Tests On Potential Public Health Risk From PFAS,https://www.nhpr.org,['Annie Ropeik'],,,,https://www.nhpr.org/post/kingston-awaits-epa-tests-potential-public-health-risk-pfas,"Officials in Kingston say they’ll wait for more data before taking action on potential water contamination around a long-dormant Superfund site.

The Ottati and Goss Superfund site, off Route 125 near the Newton town line, is surrounded by campgrounds, homes, businesses and a popular swimming and fishing area, Country Pond.

Between the 1950s and 1980s, the site housed a business that cleaned chemicals out of steel drums and sold the drums for reuse.

That process contaminated soil, sediment, groundwater and surface water at the site with a range of chemicals, including cyanide, pesticides and PCBs. Cleanup for the initial contaminants was extensive and ended years ago.

But in the past few years, the Environmental Protection Agency has begun testing Superfund sites for PFAS chemicals.

These industrial chemicals, used for decades in a plethora of consumer goods and commonly-used firefighting foams, have been linked to serious health effects, including some cancers.

In late 2018, during a routine review, the EPA says the chemicals turned up in monitoring wells at the Kingston site at levels up to 5,600 parts per trillion.

The state groundwater cleanup standard for PFAS is 70 parts per trillion. Some federal research suggests the chemicals may pose health risks at even lower levels.

At a selectmen’s meeting with a few concerned neighbors Monday night, EPA project manager Jim Brown said the contamination in the monitoring wells is “undeniably” coming from the Superfund site.

He also said the contaminated groundwater generally appears to be flowing in the direction of Country Pond, the swimming and fishing area. But he says, over the years of monitoring, the EPA has not found that other contaminants migrated from the site into drinking water wells.

However, the contamination that existed at the site before remediation did appear to migrate into Country Pond. The EPA's original 1987 Record of Decision for the site, dictating the terms and method of clean-up, says pollution in the 1970s appeared to lead to ""fish kills in Country Pond, dying vegetation along [adjacent] South Brook, and skin irritation of swimmers in Country Pond.”

Brown says the EPA doesn’t yet have the data to confirm whether PFAS from the site poses a public health risk, and he appeared to downplay the high levels of PFAS that were found.

“The PFAS levels that we’re talking about, in the PFAS world, are high,” Brown said. “But [5,000 parts per trillion] is 5 parts per billion. For most of our contaminants of concern at this site, 5 parts per billion is the goal.”

In the coming weeks, he says, state and federal officials will test adjacent drinking water wells – and surface waters in and near the swimming pond – to see if the PFAS does pose a threat. Results of those tests will be out in late May or early June.

“Depending on the results that we get back in June, we might have to expand the sampling effort to an even bigger area,” Brown said.

Brown called Country Pond a “bonafide swimming exposure scenario” and said the EPA would notify the town immediately if any “significant” contamination is found in the upcoming tests.

Selectmen say they’ll wait on that notification or for final test results before considering any new restrictions on swimming or fishing at the pond.

And state officials said they will immediately provide bottled water if any residents are found to have unsafe levels of PFAS in their drinking water wells.

The EPA is due to transfer control of the aging Superfund site to the state this fall. The businesses that contaminated the site settled their liabilities there years ago, and the state also now owns the property.

The town of Kingston declined to buy the site years ago – out of concern, selectmen said Monday, that new contamination would someday turn up.

“It just seems like what was a great success story seems to be a never-ending saga that we’re going to have to deal with,” said selectman Kevin St. James at Monday’s meeting.

Brown, with the EPA, said the site could still end up a “success story.”

He added that this is the first Superfund site he knows of where PFAS contamination has emerged in the midst of a transfer process to the state."
Kevin McAleenan says administration will ask Congress for more border funds this year,https://www.cnn.com,"['Priscilla Alvarez', 'Geneva Sands', 'Phil Mattingly']",04-30-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/30/politics/dhs-acting-secretary-kevin-mcaleenan-congress-testimony/index.html,"Washington (CNN) The Trump administration will be asking Congress for extra money to help pay for the influx of migrants coming across the border this year, acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan said Tuesday.

The supplemental request will seek funding for temporary and semi-permanent migrant processing facilities, additional personnel along the border, increased detention capacity and upgrades to ""overtaxed"" information technology systems, he told a House appropriations subcommittee.

""Given the scale of what we are facing, we will exhaust our resources before the end of this fiscal year,"" he said.

The request will be for less than less than $10 billion and will come as soon as this week, according to sources briefed on the proposal.

It isn't intended to create ""policies to be aggressive on immigration,"" but rather to address the increased flows of migrants, according to a DHS official.

It will include a request for additional bed space and transportation funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the official said. ICE is currently averaging around 50,000 people in custody, which is above the current detention funding levels. The official acknowledged that the request for additional beds is likely to get pushback from lawmakers.

The request is also expected to run into problems on Capitol Hill because of serious Democratic concerns over intent on immigration broadly, as well as the still-languishing disaster relief supplemental, which has imploded the last few weeks.

First test for acting homeland security secretary

McAleenan's appearance is his first congressional hearing since being thrust into the Cabinet-level post three weeks ago after a shake-up in the top ranks at the department, including the departure of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Appropriations chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-New York, acknowledged McAleenan's challenge.

""It seems like the car is driving off the cliff with no one to take the wheel, though I guess, Mr. Secretary, you are now the driver,"" she said.

Democratic Rep. David Price of North Carolina, told McAleenan he was ""grateful"" that he was available to ""steer this ship"" as the head of DHS at a time of ""maximum chaos and political turmoil orchestrated by a vindictive president.""

Immigration has been a critical issue for the department, which has seen a steep uptick in apprehensions along the southern border over recent months. President Donald Trump, who's grown increasingly frustrated by the situation along the border, issued a memo Monday evening calling for sweeping immigration revisions which are already receiving pushback from advocates and Democrats.

Since taking over at DHS, McAleenan, who had been serving as US Customs and Border Protection commissioner, has been on a mini-media blitz, most recently appearing on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday.

Lawmakers are ""realizing that something different is happening with this crisis. It's not manufactured -- it's real. And we've got to sit down at a table and talk about ways to solve it,"" he said on the broadcast.

Last week, McAleenan told NBC's Lester Holt that migrant family separations had resulted in the department ""losing public trust"" such that ""from an enforcement perspective, it's not worth it,"" and that reinstating them is not on the table.

McAleenan told lawmakers Tuesday that the metal chain-link cells used to separate groups inside CBP's McAllen, Texas, detention facility, which came under intense scrutiny last summer, are being taken down and replaced with ""partitions that are more appropriate in terms of appearance.""

""We are gonna take out the chain-link,"" he said. The interior chain-link fencing has been called ""cages"" by some, a characterization DHS has disputed.

The President has denied both accounts.

McAleenan said he will ask Congress for the authority to keep families in custody while they move through the immigration process.

""But in terms of your broader point, the way that we are actually achieving results is when we are able to detain somebody in custody through the pendency of their immigration proceedings,"" McAleenan said in response to Republican Rep. Kay Granger of Texas. ""That's what works with single adults right now, and that's an essential aspect of what we are going to ask from Congress for families -- being able to keep them together in an appropriate setting for a fair and expeditious process.""

The Flores Agreement currently places a limit on how long migrant children can be held in detention. McAleenan knocked down the idea that the department intends to hold children indefinitely, saying, ""The notion that we want to detain children for a long time is just not accurate.""

During the hearing, lawmakers asked a series of questions about the situation along the border and department enforcement actions. Following on a line of questioning by Democratic Rep. Grace Meng of New York on Immigration and Customs Enforcement courthouse arrests, California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard noted that the concern is not going after criminals, but all undocumented immigrants who may not be the target.

""That's where the concern is and that's where the objection is,"" she said.

On Monday, Massachusetts district attorneys and public defenders filed a lawsuit to stop ICE from patrolling state courthouses.

Tuesday's hearing comes as the number of migrant families arriving at the US-Mexico border has reached record highs and total monthly apprehensions are the highest they've been in over a decade. There were approximately 92,000 arrests of undocumented migrants for illegal entry on the southern border in March, up from 37,390 in March 2018.

Last month, McAleenan postponed a hearing with the House Appropriations Committee to visit the border in El Paso, Texas, amid the surge in migrant arrivals, which has overwhelmed US Border Patrol facilities and led to the direct release of families from custody.

""The only way to fundamentally address these flows is for Congress to act and to reinstate integrity into our immigration system. In the meantime, we need assistance and additional resources to manage the flow,"" McAleenan said during a news conference in El Paso.

McAleenan is pursuing three changes to the immigration system, according to a senior DHS official:

Amending the Flores agreement, which regulates the amount of time migrant children can spend in custody.

Pursuing moderate changes to credible fear determinations, so they better match asylum approval rates.

Seeking the ability to in some cases repatriate unaccompanied children who aren't from Mexico or Canada.

Department of Energy’s $2B cloud migration moves forward,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Dave Nyczepir'],04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.fedscoop.com/department-energy-2-billion-cboss-cloud-migration/,"Written by Dave Nyczepir

The Department of Energy awarded Accenture a contract valued at $2 billion to handle next steps in the agency’s cloud migration.

Known as the CIO Business Operations Support Services, or CBOSS, contract, the five-year blanket purchase order agreement also covers cybersecurity and customer-centric solutions.

DOE is in the “early stage” of its cloud migration, having moved applications and storage from one of its legacy data centers over in 2018 with plans to do so with two more by 2020, said Jake Brody, managing director and DOE client account lead at Accenture.

“The mission of DOE is so varied and diverse from core IT services to the National Nuclear Security Administration, to labs, to science offices,” Brody said. “All of those missions require that cybersecurity is embedded at the start.”

That DOE is making cloud-based services available to the entire department gives agencies more choice, Brody added.

Three months ago, Accenture Federal Services expanded its Washington, D.C.-based Federal Digital Studio with data scientists and other experts to improve its rapid prototyping capabilities. The studio focuses on human-centered design and accelerated IT modernization.

AFS formed a contractor teaming arrangement with Unisys, General Dynamics Information Technology and Red River to deliver on the contract. Red River is heading up hardware and software purchasing.

CBOSS was awarded to Accenture in October, but competitor ActioNet protested the decision in December on the grounds quotes were “unreasonably evaluated.” The Government Accountability Office denied the protest in March finding Accenture gave a “technically superior” quote and calling ActioNet’s pricing advantage “illusory” because its quote was “unrealistically low.”

DOE did not respond to a request for comment by publication.

“We’re going to have to move at the pace at which the program can move,” Brody said, when asked if Accenture planned to speed up its timeline after the delay. “And that’s a joint decision we will make with the government.”"

"Head of DOJ's antitrust division says he has not made up his mind on T-Mobile, Sprint deal",https://www.cnbc.com,['Kate Rooney'],04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/29/head-of-dojs-antitrust-division-says-he-has-not-made-up-his-mind-on-t-mobile-sprint-deal.html,"Makan Delrahim testifies before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary on his nomination to be an Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division of the US on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC on Wednesday, May 10, 2017.

Despite reports that it won't be approved, the chief of the Department of Justice antitrust division said he has yet to come to a decision on Sprint and T-Mobile's planned merger.

""I have not made up my mind,"" Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice antitrust division, told CNBC's David Faber during a ""Squawk on the Street "" interview Monday from the Milken Institute Global conference in Beverly Hills, California.

The Wall Street Journal earlier in April reported the $26 billion planned merger is unlikely to be approved in its current structure, citing people familiar with the matter. The report casts doubt on the fate of the mega-deal. The most immediate hurdle, according to the Journal, came from Delrahim's antitrust division, which is reportedly considering whether a deal would present an ""unacceptable threat to competition.""

Shares of Sprint fell as much as 12% after that Journal report, while T-Mobile dropped by 4%. Sprint shares were slightly positive after Monday's CNBC interview, while T-Mobile's stock was down more than 2%.

Delrahim said his department does have an eye on price competition and the potential for more consolidation in the industry to raise bills for the average consumer. The DOJ is looking into ""coordinated effects,"" meaning companies would not compete on prices anymore if it's no longer in their best interest.

""Those are the factors, and there are strict guidelines that we follow, based on case law handed to us; we are continuing to investigate that,"" he said. ""My job is to make sure the analysis is done properly and make sure the facts are there.""

The $26 billion deal would combine the third- and fourth-largest wireless providers in the U.S., a market with only two other participants: AT&T and Verizon. Sprint and T-Mobile have argued that the merger is necessary to compete with the two larger carriers, and would provide greater access to 5G. T-Mobile CEO John Legere defended the deal before Congress in February, arguing that the deal would create jobs and lower prices.

""With 5G and other technologies, you're going to be able to use that phone for more than just communicating with your best friend or texting,"" DOJ's Delrahim said. ""You're getting your media, you're getting video — we want to be sure to encourage that, but ultimately, is there going to be a price effect when those two combine?""

While more players in any market typically means more competition, Delrahim said there was no ideal number for the total amount of wireless companies.

""There is no magical number — it's what the facts and the economic evidence shows us,"" Delrahim said.

SANTA TERESA - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has issued waivers of environmental and other laws, expediting the construction of ""new bollard wall"" in New Mexico and Arizona.

The barriers are needed to help ""impede and deny illegal border crossings and the drug and human smuggling activities of transnational criminal organizations,"" according to a statement released Friday by Homeland Security.

The construction projects cover 53 miles, with most of the wall going up in New Mexico in Doña Ana and Luna counties. The new bollard wall would replace ""dilapidated and outdated designs, in addition to road construction and improvement and lighting installation,"" according to Homeland Security.

The new section of bollard wall will extend the existing structure 20 miles west of the Santa Teresa Port of Entry through the rest of Doña Ana County into Luna County and about four miles west past the Columbus Port of Entry.

The waivers published in the Federal Register on Wednesday clear the way for construction because the Department of Homeland Security does not have to comply with laws involving public lands, water and wildlife.

""It is going help maintain a secure border. It is going to establish the operational control that the president has mandated,"" El Paso Border Patrol Sector Chief Aaron Hull said when construction was officially announced. (Photo: RUBEN R.

""The waiving of these laws sends a clear message to our border communities that our rights and our voices do not matter,"" said Amanda Munro, field organizer for the Southwest Environmental Center.

The Las Cruces-based conservation organization said the waivers cover 27 laws ranging from those affecting endangered species to archaeological and historic preservation.

""These laws are intended to protect people from bad decisions that will negatively impact their environment, health and history, and yet we border residents are deemed unworthy of even the right to give our opinion on the construction happening in our own backyards,"" Munro said.

The Southwest Environmental Center is among 22 organizations that sent a letter Thursday asking Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan and Border Patrol Chief Carla Provost for a 30-day extension to the comment period in Doña Ana and Luna counties.

The letter points out that CBP issued a $789 million construction contract for the New Mexico project one day after the comment period began.

Others who submitted the letter include the Indivisible Tohono, a border tribal organization; the National Parks Conservation Association; and the Center for Biological Diversity.

""This wall will destroy New Mexico's incredible public lands and hurt the local economy, which relies on the outdoor industry. And it could deal a death blow to Mexican gray wolves in the U.S.,"" said Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity.

But some New Mexico farmers and ranchers on the border support building a wall in New Mexico and want it done quickly.

""We're pleased that the government recognizes the urgency of the situation,"" said Caren Cowan, executive director of New Mexico Cattle Growers and Wool Growers associations.

Cowan said she is not concerned about the waivers being used to expedite the building of the wall. ""Our members deserve protection, and this is a step in that right direction, and we greatly appreciate it,"" she said.

President Donald Trump declared a national emergency after Congress refused to approve the $5.7 billion he wanted to pay for his promised border wall. The president is diverting up to $1 billion in Department of Defense funds to add barriers in New Mexico and Arizona.

""It's bad enough that Trump's bulldozing the borderlands for a senseless wall, but now he's stealing money from the military to do it,"" Jordahl said.

Construction on the wall in New Mexico is expected to begin next month, despite multiple lawsuits.

""The only thing permanent about Trump's wall will be the destruction to wildlife and wild places,"" Jordahl said. ""It will do nothing to stop asylum seekers or illegal drug smugglers. Waiving these laws is an affront to borderland communities, and we'll continue to challenge this in court.""

DOD needs technical support for office in charge of $8B DEOS,https://www.fedscoop.com,['Billy Mitchell'],04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.fedscoop.com/deos-technical-engineering-support-contract-disa-sd3/,"Written by Billy Mitchell

The Pentagon office in charge of the military’s unified communication tools is looking to re-up a contract for technical and engineering support ahead of a big move to the cloud.

The Defense Information Systems Agency’s Enterprise Services Division issued a sources sought announcement last week for independent technical expertise to support its portfolio of classified and unclassified communication and collaboration tools, both on-premises and in the cloud.

“The contractor shall be a demonstrated expert on both traditional IT infrastructure as well as on Cloud Computing, with expert knowledge of DoD enterprise policies, guidance, and directives for emerging technologies and Unified Capability specific needs within the DoD enterprise,” the announcement says.

The Enterprise Services Division, referred to as SD3, manages the Department of Defense’s enterprisewide efforts around global video communications, collaboration services and, most recently, the acquisition of next-generation collaboration and communication tools as part of the $8 billion Defense Enterprise Office Solution (DEOS) cloud contract. The General Services Administration is leading the DEOS acquisition of cloud-based communication tools on DOD’s behalf through its IT Schedule 70 contract. GSA has yet to issue the final request for proposals for the contract but is expected to do so soon.

The announcement stresses the need for a contractor with expertise in cloud computing, particularly as the Pentagon anticipates launching DEOS sometime in the next year.

“Throughout the duration of this contract, it is anticipated that the Government will acquire cloud-based technologies elsewhere within the SD3 portfolio that will be supported by this contract,” it says. “As such, the SD3 Engineering Support contractor may be required to establish formal or informal business relationships with various cloud OEMs in order to have reach back capability and technical expertise.”

The proposed contract will have a five-year base period of performance. It is a follow-on to a previous contract awarded to Booz Allen Hamilton. Those interested have until May 17 to issue a response to DISA."

The message, which urged the voluntary departure of all U.S. citizens from the country, also ordered that all school-age family members of U.S. government employees leave Sri Lanka.

""Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Sri Lanka. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, hospitals, and other public areas,"" the State Department said on its website.

The guidance came the same day a Sri Lankan raid on a suspected militant hideout killed at least 15 people.

The raid on the country’s eastern coast followed a shootout nearby, after which authorities found explosives, detonators, “suicide kits,” military uniforms and ISIS flags.

ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, though local extremist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) has been blamed for Sunday's bombings.

Catholic leaders on Friday morning also announced that Sunday Masses across Sri Lanka would be canceled indefinitely as the country grapples with the ongoing security threat.

Former GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock considered congressional push for presidents' tax returns 'Nixonian',https://abcnews.go.com,['Abc News'],,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/gop-rep-barbara-comstock-considered-congressional-push-trumps/story?id=62708782,"Barbara Comstock made a name for herself during the Clinton administration as one of Washington's most dogged investigators scrutinizing the White House, but the former Republican representative said congressional Democrats examining President Donald Trump are crossing lines she never considered.

""We never went after tax returns because that was Nixonian. When you heard tax returns, all the red flags went up,"" Comstock told ABC News' podcast ""The Investigation"" about her time combing through the Clintons' financial records as chief investigative counsel and senior counsel on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.

Yuri Gripas/Reuters

""We had one prosecutor who briefly worked on the committee who mentioned tax returns, and it was a blow-up in the press,"" Comstock continued. ""We said we are not touching that.""

Trump broke with tradition as a presidential candidate in 2016 when he refused to release his tax returns, and he's continued to refuse while in office. While not legally required, most presidents since Richard Nixon have voluntarily released their returns.

Democrats on the current House Ways and Means Committee think differently, requesting six years of Trump's tax returns from the Internal Revenue Service earlier this month. Republicans have accused Democrats of weaponizing the tax code, and Trump attorney Jay Sekulow previously told ABC News Democrats have yet to establish a ""legitimate legislative purpose"" for their request.

While Comstock may not agree with the move politically, she argued that Congress did have the authority to request the documents.

""It is set up constitutionally,"" she said. ""You can go pretty far, but then the Justice Department and the executive branch, they can also push back.""

The fight to access the president's tax returns is expected to wind up in court. In the wake of the release of the redacted Mueller report, Comstock said Democrats must plan their next moves carefully to avoid needlessly rehashing the special counsel's investigation.

""A lot of what was in the report was what a lot of the things people kind of knew or had heard about sort of off the record before,"" Comstock said. ""These are things that people not only already knew about the president, but they knew about before he was elected president.""

Comstock said that while Democrats should pursue other avenues of investigation, ""I think what they really want to do is just have public theater.

""If the House, which is the only side that really can move forward, were to sit down and talk with their Senate Democrat counterparts, I would think they would tell them there's not a whole lot more here to go with. So if you want to impeach you have the votes, if you decide that's what you want to do politically.""

But Comstock said launching impeachment proceedings would likely be a misstep.

""We proved it in the '90s with Clinton,"" Comstock said. ""They can impeach him in the House -- they have the votes if they decided to engage on this -- but there will not be a conviction in the Senate. So then what would be the point?""

A more pressing matter for many Democrats in Congress may be reelection.

""If you're in a hard blue district, that's probably all they want you to do,"" Comstock said, referring to investigating Trump. ""But if you're in a swingier district and this is not your priority, and you've seen some Democrats already saying, 'Well, hey I had a town hall and nobody came in and talked about this.'""

But Comstock said the Democratic senators and representatives with their eye on the party's nomination for president in 2020 don't have the option to divert their focus away from the investigations surrounding the president.

""Leading up to 2000, George W. Bush was not part of this at all. Remember, he was coming from Texas as a governor and he wanted to turn the page,"" Comstock said. ""And it's different now because all of these candidates who are running are senators and House members--or the most viable ones -- and they are involved in it. So I think it is going to impact them more."""

(Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)

The main lobby of the State Department throbbed with music Friday. “Happy” by Pharrell boomed out of a loudspeaker on the wall of the cavernous space where coveys of suited diplomats scurry past rows of national flags, followed by the voice of Bruno Mars singing “Uptown Funk.”

Then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made his way through a small throng of employees and scaled a stairway to a lectern near a giant placard hanging from a wall covered by a blue cloth awaiting a theatrical reveal. It was an unusual event, marking Pompeo’s first anniversary at the agency, and seemed to reflect his vision of leadership instilled in him at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in N.Y.

But the splashy atmosphere surrounding the unveiling of Pompeo’s new “Professional Ethos” was more dramatic than the ethos itself, a nine-sentence statement that begins, “I am a champion of American diplomacy.”

[On the road to swagger: A year defending Trump’s worldview]

Many of the concepts in the ethos are already embedded in the State Department’s official mission statement, common human resources values or just the Golden Rule — professionalism, accountability, honesty and respect. Pompeo said they had been working on it since last fall, and the final product was preceded by more than 30 drafts.

“Never forget who it is that we work for,” he said, explaining what it means to protect the American people. “Their interests, not ours. Not yours.”

“It’s about disagreeing without being uncivil,” he said of professionalism.

Respect is about showing “unfailing respect for each other,” he said. “Simply because we are all human beings created by God.”

Pompeo acknowledged some of the people listening were probably wondering whether anything would change because of the short ethos statement.

“I think by highlighting the principles in this ethos, we can encourage each other and hold each responsible to these standards and take it to a new level,” he said.

He announced a new Ethos Award would be handed out later this year to the State Department employee who best incorporates the values. But it is impossible to know how many employees actually heard his remarks. The lobby was less than half full, but most would have listened on a closed circuit channel broadcast in the building.

After finishing his 15-minute speech, Pompeo lingered to shake hands with employees and pose for photos and selfies taken by some of the 75 members of the newest class of fledgling diplomats to complete classes at the Foreign Service Institute."
"Feds Surveilled South Florida Immigration Protests in 2018, Report Says",https://www.miaminewtimes.com,['Jerry Iannelli'],04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/homeland-security-monitored-miami-immigration-protest-intercept-reports-11159935,"June 30 of last year, activists in more than 600 cities planned demonstrations against President Donald Trump's policy of separating children and parents who'd arrived at the U.S. border seeking asylum. According to public records obtained today by the Intercept, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security monitored those protesters as if they were security threats.

Emails obtained by the news outlet show that a private contractor working with DHS, LookingGlass Cyber Solutions, monitored numerous locations in South Florida — including protests in Boca Raton, West Palm Beach, Hollywood, and Miami-Dade College's Wolfson Campus in downtown Miami. (The list includes locations in virtually every other major city in America as well.) Ultimately, LookingGlass advised DHS to closely monitor a few specific demonstrations, including one at a high school in Sebring, just north of Lake Okeechobee.

“LookingGlass has compiled a spreadsheet for State Fusion Centers detailing over 600 planned ‘Family Separation Day Protests’ across the US on June 30,” one email to DHS states. “These originated from Cyber Threat Center (CTC) and are broken out by City and State; they provide physical location and the Facebook event ID.”

In response, LookingGlass declined to speak to the Intercept, and DHS claimed the list provided by the company was ""unsolicited.""

The news is just the latest in a series of revelations showing how the federal government has been monitoring activists and journalists critical of U.S. immigration policy. In March, NBC San Diego obtained a cache of documents showing the federal government monitored activists, reporters, and social media influencers who were tied to or covering the movements of a migrant caravan approaching the U.S.-Mexico border. In some cases, the government placed alerts on the passports of journalists and U.S. citizens who were reporting critically on the government.

The station reported:



One photojournalist said she was pulled into secondary inspections three times and asked questions about who she saw and photographed in Tijuana shelters. Another photojournalist said she spent 13 hours detained by Mexican authorities when she tried to cross the border into Mexico City. Eventually, she was denied entry into Mexico and sent back to the U.S.

The El Paso Police Department recently issued an arrest warrant for Miami artist Alexandra Mondolfi after her protest group placed stickers honoring people killed by border agents at the U.S. Border Patrol Museum in Texas.

Videos show Miami's family-separation protest in June 2018 was well attended. The Miami Herald posted footage of hundreds of people blocking traffic by marching on Biscayne Boulevard. At the time, at least 2,300 children had been separated from their parents at the U.S. border in an all-but-certain violation of international law:

Actor Lin-Manuel Miranda led the main Families Belong Together protest in Washington, D.C., that day. Most of the Miami protest was led by Marleine Bastien, who heads the Family Action Network Movement, a group that fights for the rights of immigrants in Miami, especially those in the Haitian community.

""They are not criminals!"" Bastien was filmed shouting into a megaphone in front of Miami's Freedom Tower, a former immigration building that for decades was a gateway for Cuban refugees to enter America."

We’re not hearing enough from 2020 candidates about things they’d be able to do as president,https://www.vox.com,['Apr'],04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/26/18512479/2020-primary-campaign-policy-ideas,"This week’s presidential town halls displayed the full range of Democratic Party thinking on the role of policy in a presidential campaign.

Elizabeth Warren has a vast stack of detailed specifics. Pete Buttigieg had an explicit defense of not having detailed policies. And Bernie Sanders elevated every specific discussion to the realm of abstract morality. It all revealed that Democrats not only have a range of ideas but a range of different ideas about the nature and value of ideas.

What we didn’t get much of, unfortunately, was discussion of the kind of policy ideas that really matter — an understanding of what potential presidents would do with the actual powers of office that the president possesses. The American constitutional system is, after all, a rather complicated and nuanced web of interlocking and partially overlapping spheres of authority.

The president’s powers, while vast and larger than those of any other single actor in the system, are in their way fairly limited. And in particular, the president’s powers don’t include the ability to unilaterally enact the kind of sweeping legislative change that often dominates what passes for policy discussion in the 2020 campaign.

Presidents influence legislation, of course, and hearing their opinions about legislative ideals can be an informative exercise about priorities and values. But we shouldn’t let this kind of discussion completely crowd out the basic reality that a president has specific powers — executive branch appointments, foreign policy, judicial appointments, and regulatory discretion — and it would be good to hear how wannabe presidents plan to use them.

Kamala Harris talks about policy the right way

The partial exception to this trend is Kamala Harris, who repeatedly got asked the same kinds of questions as everyone else but who answered with replies that are more attentive to the actual modalities of political authority.

Asked by a student whether we should legalize sex work, for example, Harris offered an answer about what she’d actually done as a district attorney.

My background, as you know, I was a prosecutor. When I was district attorney of San Francisco I instituted a number of policies that were focused on women and children and how they were treated frankly with bias in the criminal justice system where they were criminalized without really looking at the real offender and so often that case was the pimps and johns, so women were arrested as being prostitutes. I created policies saying we need to focus on the other folks and not just on the women. I was responsible for an initiative in San Francisco that was about recognizing that girls who are being trafficked were being called teenage prostitutes when, in fact, they were the victims of an incredible amount of abuse and had been trafficked. And so I created a whole policy in San Francisco that was, one, intended to stop calling them teenage prostitutes, but instead to call them sexually exploited youth. And because of the work that we did we then created a safe house for these young women so that instead of them being arrested and put in juvenile hall they would be in a safe house. And then we were responsible for actually getting legislation passed that said that when those johns and pimps are prosecuted they should be prosecuted in connection with the sale of a child, again looking at what we need to do to figure out who’s doing what.

Harris simply declines to say what she thinks an optimal legislative framework for regulating (or not) sex work would be. The district attorney of San Francisco has an important role in the operation of law enforcement in the city, but the role does not include the ability to unilaterally rewrite criminal statutes. She instead talks about what policy changes she made that were in the scope of her authority as DA and explicates at least some of her larger perspective on the issue — namely that the burden of enforcement should not fall on the sex workers themselves.

I don’t know anything about this issue and don’t really know if that’s a smart perspective, but it’s a smart kind of answer, because Harris is talking about how the practice of policymaking works. Specific people with specific authority do specific things. And while the president certainly has some ability to shape legislation and set the congressional agenda, fundamentally the main powers of office are elsewhere. The president vetoes bills, appoints judges, and runs the executive branch.

Later, asked a fairly vague question about gun control, she responded in a similar spirit, saying she favored new legislation but then detailing a specific course of action that she would take as president.

Upon being elected I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws. And if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action. And specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns. I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law the ATF take their license. And by the way, ATF — Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms — they’ve been doing a lot of “A” and “T,” but not much of the “F.” We need to fix that. And then on the third piece, because none of us have been sleeping the last two years, part of what’s happened under the current administration is they take fugitives off the list of prohibited people. I put them back on the list, meaning that fugitives from justice should not be able to purchase a handgun or any kind of weapon. So that’s what I’d do.

There are some questions about whether a Harris administration could, in fact, really put this kind of regulatory mandate in place. But evidently Harris and her team think she could — or, at a minimum, they’d like to try it and see what happens in court. Either way, this was one of the most informative answers anyone has given at any 2020 town hall because it referred to something Harris could actually do if she became president.

We get too many irrelevant questions

Across the five-candidate event, however, almost no questions were directed at those areas actually under the president’s control. Instead, CNN hosts asked a variety of contenders whether they think felons currently serving jail time should be allowed to vote. Sanders said yes, Buttigieg said no, Harris initially seemed open to it and then backtracked.

This is a moderately interesting question of abstract political philosophy, but it’s a state-level issue that the president has no control over.

Meanwhile, essentially every candidate appearance these days ends up spending a fair amount of time on candidates’ utopian visions for health care policy. Sanders, famously, supports moving to a Canadian-style system in which everyone would have a government insurance plan and competing private offerings would be barred. Most other Democrats seem less sure.

This is a fine topic to talk about, but realistically the odds of a Sanders-style bill (or anything like it) passing are minimal. It might be more interesting to hear whether Sanders (or any other candidate) is so hard-line that he’d actually refuse to sign some more incremental legislation. Presidents, after all, have a fair amount of agenda-setting power, but they don’t actually write bills on health care or anything else. What they do is veto bills.

But the vast majority of questions completely ignore these institutional realities. Buttigieg even veered off into talking about constitutional amendments at one point, a process over which the president has no authority whatsoever.

Citizens interested in trying to understand how an Elizabeth Warren presidency might differ from an Amy Klobuchar presidency can get at least some sense from the fact that Warren has put her name behind a huge number of ambitious legislative proposals and Klobuchar hasn’t. But in concrete terms, it might be more informative to ask them about the things the president specifically does.

Presidents have a lot of specific powers

Donald Trump has done a lot of things as president.

Some of that has been signing legislation (a tax cut, a couple of appropriations deals, a bipartisan criminal justice reform overhaul). But legislation really only emerges in one of two ways. You have partisan bills like the Trump tax cut that leadership in Congress crafts and then negotiates with the most moderate members to pass, and you have bipartisan bills that are written by groups in Congress working across the aisle.

The White House can and does alter the course of this process around the margins — and certainly the White House can blow up a potential compromise by coming out in opposition — but the president simply can’t define the frontiers of the possible.

What Trump has done instead is appoint a lot of pro-business people to head regulatory agencies, and made it clear to them that he wants them to proceed in a maximally aggressive way with regard to how much deregulation it is legally possible to get away with.

Any Democrat will tilt in the opposite direction, but the parties are not mirror images of each other, and it would be unusual for a Democratic administration to choose a program of maximum regulatory aggression on every front. So the question of what particular areas a given president thinks it’s wise to regulate harshly on is very interesting and significant.

The next president almost certainly won’t rewrite antitrust law. But she will appoint a head of the Justice Department’s antitrust division and a head of the Federal Trade Commission. Those agencies’ activities will be bounded by the courts, but she’ll appoint judges too.

On immigration, too, almost everything Trump has done has been through the use of discretionary presidential power. President Obama also made use of discretionary authority, first to establish DACA and then later in a more sweeping effort that ended up in court. Continuing the pursuit of some kind of comprehensive legislative deal is a no-brainer, but from day one the next president will face a series of urgent questions about how to use executive discretion over immigration policy.

Beyond appointments and regulatory policy, the other really big thing the president does is foreign policy. Some of that involves military deployments, some of it is more diplomatic in nature, and, as Trump has dramatized a fair amount, some of it involves the president’s discretionary authority over various aspects of tariff policy. The foreign and national security domain is where the president faces the fewest institutional constraints, but it’s been almost entirely absent from the 2020 primary thus far.

Policy is important, but we should focus on the important part

At the end of the day, the kind of policy proposals that Warren has been making — or the vaguer ones from Sanders — don’t actually amount to anything that’s very different from Buttigieg’s statements of values or Beto standing on tables. And values, to be clear, are important. Sanders’s decades-long support for implementing a Canadian-style health care system in the United States tells us something important about him.

What it doesn’t tell us, however, is what is likely to actually happen with health policy under a Sanders administration. And that’s a topic people have good reason to be interested in.

To get at that, you’d need to ask presidential candidates about the things that are actually under the White House’s control: appointments at the Department of Health and Human Services and the FDA, the regulatory process, Medicaid waivers, and so on. That’s all a little bit less exciting than sweeping visions of human betterment.

But the whole reason politics matters is because the political process drives policy outcomes. And the specific way in which presidential politics drives policy outcomes is that presidents exercise their constitutional powers of office. The American people deserve to hear more about how the candidates plan to do that."
Treasury hits Venezuelan foreign minister with sanctions,https://www.politico.com,['Zachary Warmbrodt'],04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/26/treasury-hits-venezuelan-foreign-minister-with-sanctions-1290784,"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump Administration will continue targeting corrupt members of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images White House Treasury hits Venezuelan foreign minister with sanctions

The Trump administration is slapping economic sanctions on Venezuela's foreign minister as it ratchets up pressure on the government of President Nicolás Maduro.

The Treasury Department Friday announced the penalties against Minister of Foreign Affairs Jorge Alberto Arreaza Montserrat and Carol Bealexis Padilla de Arretureta, a judge.

Story Continued Below

The sanctions are part of an effort to punish Maduro's administration, which Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said was illegitimate and starving the Venezuelan people ""of their wealth, humanity, and right to democracy."" Last week, Treasury announced sanctions against Venezuela's central bank.

“Treasury will continue to target corrupt Maduro insiders, including those tasked with conducting diplomacy and carrying out justice on behalf of this illegitimate regime,"" Mnuchin said. ""This Administration stands with the Venezuelan people, and alongside an international coalition committed to holding accountable those who are responsible for Venezuela’s tragic decline.”

"China able to grab ‘entire digital identity’ of Western citizens, State Department says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-26-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/china-able-to-grab-entire-digital-identity-of-western-citizens-state-department-says,"Chinese surveillance tactics “pose an existential threat"" to the nations of the Western Hemisphere, a senior State Department official warned Friday.

“Citizens living in democracies in the Western Hemisphere could potentially have their entire digital identity under the control and surveillance of an authoritarian government,” Kimberly Breier, the State Department’s top diplomat for the region, told the Council of the Americas.

Breier was chiefly addressing Latin America, with a focus on how China distributes surveillance technology and wireless internet services that leave Westerners exposed to Beijing’s prying eyes. China has been selling its high-tech authoritarianism to dictators such as Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, and even countries friendlier to the United States have been opening their telecommunications networks to Chinese tech companies.

FBI Director Christopher Wray, speaking separately at the Council on Foreign Relations, emphasized the same day that the Communist power is targeting the United States as aggressively as any regional neighbor.

“China has pioneered a societal approach to stealing innovation any way it can, from a wide array of businesses, universities, and organizations,” Wray said. “They’re doing this through Chinese intelligence services, through state-owned enterprises, through ostensibly private companies, through graduate students and researchers, and through a variety of actors working on behalf of China.”

Breier and Wray made their warnings as China is trying to allay international worries about the Belt and Road Initiative, an overseas investment plan that U.S. officials regard as a “predatory” lending scheme to purchase influence over impoverished nations. China is hosting an international summit in Beijing on Friday, convening Russia and other partner nations to tout the initiative.

“Naturally, it is important for China to successfully promote this large-scale project,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said in advance of Friday’s second Belt and Road Forum. ""And all Eurasian states should stand to gain from participation in it.”

Breier countered that China uses “bags of cash” to induce corrupt government officials to strike agreements that harm their countries. Those deals threaten long-term consequences beyond financial trouble. She stressed that the Chinese companies pioneering the next generation of wireless technology are under the thumb of Chinese spy agencies, meaning that partnerships with the tech giants could “have a generational impact on national security, on our economies, and on our societies.”

And she raised similar worries about simpler surveillance technologies, such as the security cameras that some Latin American governments have purchased from the Communist power, which has built a high-tech surveillance state to control its own population.

Governments, she said, ""need to rethink whether they want Chinese firms and indeed the Chinese government to replicate some of those same practices and, in so doing, erode protection of human rights in the hemisphere and cede national sovereignty."""

Smart will no longer sell cars in the U.S. Faraday Future announced two new investments that could keep it afloat long enough to build its long-awaited FF91. And the EPA is warning others to prepare for climate change—as it maintains it's not really an issue yet. All this and more on Green Car Reports.

Just a year after converting Smart into an all-electric brand, parent company Daimler announced it would quit selling the tiny two-seaters in the U.S. Smart will focus instead on sales in China and other parts of the world.

Faraday may have a Future after all. The startup electric automaker announced that it received enough new funding to allow it to continue on the road to producing its FF91 luxury electric car as well as continue developing its more affordable FF81. Now if only it can get some of the automotive engineering talent back that it lost in its last financial meltdown.

Statements from its administrator to the contrary, the EPA said in a new report that communities need to prepare for the effects of global warming by budgeting to dispose of debris from more natural disasters.

Ron Chernow delivers a history of presidents and the press — and takes down Trump at correspondents’ dinner.,https://www.washingtonpost.com,"['Gillian Brockell', 'Staff Writer For Retropolis']",04-28-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/04/28/museum-presidential-decorum-chernow-touts-presidents-respect-press-correspondents-dinner/,"If President Trump was hoping he would be roasted less at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner because comedians had been axed from the program, well, he may need to delete the recording from his TiVo without watching it.

Historian Ron Chernow, whose book on Alexander Hamilton became the basis of a musical you may have seen, was the keynote speaker, and he dinged the president over and over in his 28-minute speech, referring to the Trump administration as “a topsy-turvy moment” and a “surreal interlude in American life.”

[Ron Chernow is a historian. Now he’s taking a comedian’s job. Huh?]

Chernow opened with a yarn from George Washington’s first term, during which the founding father was relentlessly pounded by an opposition press, which even “charged that he’d been a secret British agent throughout the Revolutionary War.”

“Obviously, the British had gotten a very poor return on their investment,” he quipped.

At one point, a State Department official named Philip Freneau — who, under a pseudonym, was running a newspaper that repeatedly and mercilessly attacked Washington — printed a cartoon showing Washington being beheaded “a la Louis XVI,” Chernow said.

“But despite this extreme provocation, Washington always honored the First Amendment,” he said. Like every future president, Washington felt maligned and misunderstood by the press. But he never generalized that into a vendetta against the institution.”

Chernow then zipped through what he called “a museum of presidential decorum,” recounting other presidents’ relationships with the press.

“Our best presidents have handled the press with wit, grace, charm, candor and even humor,” he said.

Here are some highlights:

Teddy Roosevelt: The Bull Moose had a “natural affinity” for the press, Chernow said.

Roosevelt “devised a midday ritual called ‘the barber’s hour’ in which reporters would cluster around him as he was being shaved. The babbling president would spout a never-ending stream of opinion while his poor barber, bobbing and weaving with his razor, gamely tried to shave [him] without slitting the presidential throat.”

Calvin Coolidge: Coolidge started the first regularly scheduled news conferences, Chernow said.

“Reporters had to submit their questions in advance, and ‘Silent Cal’ sat stiffly behind his desk, working his way through a tiny stack of index cards.”

Franklin D. Roosevelt: FDR treated reporters “like grown-ups,” Chernow said. He got rid of written questions and held more than a thousand news conferences and 30 “fireside chats” in his 12 years as commander in chief.

“Even [first lady] Eleanor Roosevelt held her own news conferences, where she invited only female reporters,” Chernow said. “This proved a tremendous boon to women journalists across the country, because even the most hidebound publishers realized they were now forced to hire women journalists.”

John F. Kennedy: Chernow noted Kennedy’s charm and self-deprecating sense of humor. In January of 1961, Kennedy held the first televised news conference, and 60 million people tuned in, “a record only eclipsed by the 70 million who watched the Beatles debut on ‘The Ed Sullivan Show’ three years later in 1964.”

Ronald Reagan: Reagan had been scheduled to attend the 1981 White House correspondents’ dinner, Chernow said, but had to cancel after he was shot on March 28, 1981. So he called into the dinner instead, joking to the audience: “If I could give you just one little bit of advice, when someone tells you to get into a car quick, do it.”

“That was a touch of class that has been sorely missing in our political culture in recent years,” Chernow said. “It was a subtle reminder that, whether Republicans or Democrats, we are all bona fide members of Team USA and not members of enemy camps.”

From the audience, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the one of the myriad House committees investigating Trump, applauded.

[Video: Ron Chernow's entire White House correspondents’ dinner speech]

It wasn’t all nostalgia and reminiscences, however. Chernow also recounted President Richard M. Nixon’s frosty relationship with the media. In 1971, Nixon followed his press secretary’s advice and attended the White House correspondents’ dinner, Chernow said.

“After his next press conference,” Chernow said, “Nixon grumbled privately, ‘The reporters were considerably more bad-mannered and vicious than usual. This bears out my theory that treating them with considerably more contempt is a more productive policy.’”

Homeland Security Used Private Security Firm to Monitor Family Separation Protests: Report,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Victoria Albert'],04-29-2019,2019,4,https://www.thedailybeast.com/homeland-security-used-private-security-firm-to-monitor-family-separation-protests-report,"The Department of Homeland Security used a private security firm to monitor more than 600 planned protests against the Trump administration’s family separation policy last summer, according to a Monday report from The Intercept. Documents shared with the outlet reportedly show that LookingGlass Cyber Solutions, a Virginia-based firm, compiled a list of the hundreds of protests and associated Facebook accounts, and shared that list with DHS and state-level law enforcement. DHS did not deny that the information was shared with the department, but called the data “unsolicited.”

Immigration attorneys told The Intercept that they were furious that government resources were being used to keep tabs on activists. “The public rightly expressed outrage when they learned of the Trump administration’s shocking policy of ripping children away from their parents,” the deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project told The Intercept. “They’ll again be outraged to learn that, rather than focusing resources on reuniting these families, the administration was instead spying on them for expressing themselves.”"
Veterans slam Ocasio-Cortez for her fierce defense of the VA,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],04-25-2019,2019,4,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/veterans-slam-ocasio-cortez-for-her-fierce-defense-of-the-va,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's fierce defense of the Department of Veteran Affairs, saying, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" has earned her flak from the very people who are served by the scandal-ridden agency: veterans.

During the same town hall, she said VA would be a blueprint if ""Medicare for all"" were to pass: “If you ask me, I would like VA for all.""

Eli Crane, a former Navy SEAL who now runs the company he started from his garage while on active duty, told the Washington Examiner that the New York Democrat's comments about not fixing the VA were ironic, given that Ocasio-Cortez, who identifies as a democratic socialist, ""is trying to fix the world's greatest economy of all time.""

""I would love to see her tell that to the family members of veterans who died waiting for treatment from the VA. As veterans, we deserve the same rights that private citizens have to shop around and find healthcare options, doctors and providers that fit our medical needs,"" said Crane.

Afghanistan veteran Adam Maneen, a small business owner who identifies as a conservative, but also agrees with the idea of universal healthcare, told the Washington Examiner he believes Ocasio-Cortez's strong belief in democratic socialism leads her to fight the wrong battles.

""Ocasio-Cortez is upset with the notion of VA reform and ... is so fixated on socialism that she has developed a reflexive nature against anything that says ‘privatized' and really misses the point about reform,"" Maneen said. ""She is fighting the wrong fight. If she wants support to model universal healthcare after the VA, then she needs to honestly acknowledge the VA’s subpar care, inept leadership, and bureaucratic processes.""

Veterans also expressed their frustration on social media with Ocasio-Cortez's defense of the VA.

.@AOC & every politician should have to get their healthcare from the #VA. All the healthcare issues that veterans face today...calcified bureaucracy, secret wait lists, minimal continuity of care...would be fixed in a week if they did.

Veteran and social media personality Joe Briggs asked if the VA provides the highest quality healthcare to veterans, why there are so many suicides on VA property.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported 22 military veterans have killed themselves at VA centers in the last 18 months.

""But what they do is drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug, drug,"" he said. ""They never get to the root of the problem. And then most of us don't even live near one of these major facilities. Some of us only live near a very small clinic that's only able to do certain things and you have to travel hours on end.""

Dan Caldwell, executive director of Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group that promotes allowing veterans to pursue private medical care, told Fox News that reformers really just want to let veterans have more choice outside of VA hospitals to get treatment for their issues.

Ocasio-Cortez followed up her comments last week, saying part of the problem with the VA is the department not being fully funded.

If Congress wants to #ProtectTheVA, we shouldn’t starve it + then sell it off for parts, forcing vets into for-profit emergency rooms + to providers who aren’t used to working w/their unique medical needs.



We should fight to fully fund the VA + hire to fill its 49,000 vacancies. https://t.co/v25R2UNanW — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) April 18, 2019

The VA's budget is about $200 billion. The department is now requesting a total of $220.2 billion for the 2020 fiscal year, a 9.6% increase from the previous fiscal year. The VA's large budget was pointed out by Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., who is also a Green Beret.

He said despite the large budget, the VA is still failing veterans.

FYI @AOC the VA budget doubled from $90B to $200B over the last 10 yrs. When my Green Berets are not receiving the care they deserve, they should not have to drive past dozens of qualified providers to a govt run facility.
