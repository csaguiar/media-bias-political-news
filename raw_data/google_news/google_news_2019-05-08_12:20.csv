5 Takeaways From 10 Years of Trump Tax Figures,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Susanne Craig', 'Russ Buettner']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/us/trump-tax-figures.html,"Since the 2016 presidential campaign, journalists at The New York Times and elsewhere have been trying to piece together Donald J. Trump’s complex and concealed finances. Now The Times has obtained 10 years of previously unrevealed figures from the president’s federal income tax returns. The tax numbers, for the years 1985 through 1994, paint a far bleaker picture of Mr. Trump’s deal-making abilities and financial condition than the one he has long put forth.

[Read The Times’s investigation here.]

Mr. Trump became an unprecedented president — a businessman and reality television star with no government experience — and he broke with decades-old presidential tradition by refusing to release his income tax returns. Questions about what secrets they may hold — about his recent business dealings and the sources of his financing — only intensified with the Russia inquiry, and the Trump administration is now locked in a battle with House Democrats demanding the last six years of the president’s returns. On Monday, the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said he would not give a House committee access to the returns.

The newly revealed tax information covers an earlier period of Mr. Trump’s business career. And The Times did not obtain Mr. Trump’s actual tax returns. But it obtained printouts from his official Internal Revenue Service tax transcripts, with the figures from his federal tax form, the 1040, from someone who had legal access to them. They represent the fullest and most detailed look to date at the president’s taxes. And they show that during a tumultuous decade of fevered acquisition and spectacular collapse, Mr. Trump’s core businesses — largely casinos, hotels and retail space in apartment buildings — ran up $1.17 billion in losses.

The White House’s response to the findings has shifted over time.

Several weeks ago, a senior official issued a statement saying: “The president got massive depreciation and tax shelter because of large-scale construction and subsidized developments. That is why the president has always scoffed at the tax system and said you need to change the tax laws. You can make a large income and not have to pay large amount of taxes.”"
Exclusive: Trump fixer Cohen says he helped Falwell handle racy photos,https://www.reuters.com,"['Aram Roston', 'Min Read']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-falwell-exclusive/exclusive-trump-fixer-cohen-says-he-helped-falwell-handle-racy-photos-idUSKCN1SD2JG,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Months before evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr.’s game-changing presidential endorsement of Donald Trump in 2016, Falwell asked Trump fixer Michael Cohen for a personal favor, Cohen said in a recorded conversation reviewed by Reuters.

Falwell, president of Liberty University, one of the world’s largest Christian universities, said someone had come into possession of what Cohen described as racy “personal” photographs — the sort that would typically be kept “between husband and wife,” Cohen said in the taped conversation.

According to a source familiar with Cohen’s thinking, the person who possessed the photos destroyed them after Cohen intervened on the Falwells’ behalf.

The Falwells, through a lawyer, declined to comment for this article.

Cohen, who began a three-year prison sentence this week for federal campaign violations and lying to Congress, recounted his involvement in the matter in a recording made surreptitiously by comedian Tom Arnold on March 25. Portions of the recording — in which Cohen appeared to disavow parts of his guilty plea — were first reported April 24 by The Wall Street Journal.

The Falwells enlisted Cohen’s help in 2015, according to the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking, the year Trump announced his presidential candidacy. At the time, Cohen was Trump’s confidant and personal lawyer, and he worked for the Trump Organization.

The Falwells wanted to keep “a bunch of photographs, personal photographs” from becoming public, Cohen told Arnold. “I actually have one of the photos,” he said, without going into specifics. “It’s terrible.”

Cohen would later prove successful in another matter involving Falwell, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Cohen helped persuade Falwell to issue his endorsement of Trump’s presidential candidacy at a critical moment, they said: just before the Iowa caucuses. Falwell subsequently barnstormed with Trump and vouched for the candidate’s Christian virtues.

Reuters has no evidence that Falwell’s endorsement of Trump was related to Cohen’s involvement in the photo matter. The source familiar with Cohen’s thinking insisted the endorsement and the help with the photographs were separate issues.

Cohen’s connection to the Falwells sheds light on the formidable alliance between Trump and a man who, through his university, is one of the most influential evangelical figures in America. Falwell’s backing helped galvanize evangelicals and persuaded many Christians concerned about Trump’s past behavior to embrace him as a repentant sinner.

Falwell’s support for Trump has not wavered throughout the New York celebrity-politician’s own tribulations, including the Access Hollywood recording of Trump talking about grabbing women’s genitals and payoffs made by Cohen to hide Trump’s extramarital affairs. This past weekend, Falwell tweeted that “Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term” to make up for the two years of the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

BLOCKBUSTER ENDORSEMENT

Falwell’s endorsement of Trump, however, did surprise some students and staff at Liberty University, the school in Lynchburg, Virginia, founded by Falwell’s father, Jerry. It was at Liberty where fellow Republican presidential candidate and major Trump rival Ted Cruz had chosen to launch his campaign the previous year. Cruz’s father was an evangelical preacher, much like Falwell’s father; Trump has been married three times and divorced twice. For years, prior to running for president, Trump boasted of his sexual exploits and supported a host of social positions, such as abortion rights, that run counter to beliefs espoused by Falwell.

Although Falwell declined interview requests for this story, he has said repeatedly that he endorsed Trump because Trump was the strongest candidate, had significant experience running a business, and had the right vision for the country.

The connection between Trump and Falwell goes back years. In 2012, Trump gave the convocation at Liberty University. One link between Trump and the couple appears to have been Cohen, a now-disbarred New York lawyer who formed a close bond with the Falwells.

During the campaign, Cohen worked closely with Liberty University to help promote Trump’s candidacy. It was around that time that Cohen heard from the Falwells about the photographs, said the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking.

The Falwells told Cohen that someone had obtained photographs that were embarrassing to them, and was demanding money, the source said. Reuters was unable to determine who made the demand. The source said Cohen flew to Florida and soon met with an attorney for the person with the photographs. Cohen spoke with the attorney, telling the lawyer that his client was committing a crime, and that law enforcement authorities would be called if the demands didn’t stop, the source said.

The matter was soon resolved, the source said, and the lawyer told Cohen that all of the photographs were destroyed.

Months later, in early 2016, Trump faced what seemed like an enormous challenge. The Iowa caucus was coming up, and Cohen — then deeply loyal to Trump — was concerned about how Trump would fare, the source said. Cohen felt Trump “was being slaughtered in that community,” and “didn’t want to see him embarrassed or, you know, without support,” said the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking. Cohen repeatedly reached out to Jerry Falwell, and pleaded with him to back Trump, the source said.

Soon after, according to this account, Falwell made his historic announcement. “I am proud to offer my endorsement of Donald J. Trump for President of the United States,” Falwell was quoted saying in a statement issued by the Trump campaign. “He is a successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.”"
"As Hurricane Relief Stalls In D.C., Trump To Rally Base In Florida Panhandle",https://www.npr.org,['Domenico Montanaro'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.npr.org/2019/05/08/720803270/as-hurricane-relief-stalls-in-d-c-trump-to-rally-base-in-florida-panhandle,"As Hurricane Relief Stalls In D.C., Trump To Rally Base In Florida Panhandle

President Trump will hold his first 2020 Florida political rally since the 2018 elections on Wednesday, and he's doing it in the Panhandle, the heart of his base in the state.

But the region is facing setbacks because of a federal funding shortfall after Hurricane Michael last fall that threatens to dampen enthusiasm.

""As much as Bay County votes Republican, we don't need a political rally right now,"" said Bay County Commissioner Philip Griffitts, a Republican. Trump's rally will be in Panama City, which is in Bay County. ""We need some good news from the federal government,"" he said.

Florida is crucial to Trump's reelection chances in 2020. Without Florida, there is virtually no path for his victory. Trump's campaign and Republicans in the state are feeling good about their chances. After all, in a wave year for Democrats in 2018, Republicans were able to win the governorship with a candidate who ran as unapologetically pro-Trump.

In that campaign, Republican Ron DeSantis defeated Andrew Gillum, a Democrat endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist. That campaign is expected to serve as an example for the president's messaging strategy to win the state, trying to paint any Democrat who runs against him as a ""socialist.""

That anti-socialist message, the campaign believes, will appeal in South Florida to those with roots in Venezuela and Cuba. Trump has backed that up as president with hard-line policy stances toward the governments of those countries.

Still, this is Florida. On average, it has been the closest state in the last five presidential elections on average, and Trump only won the state by a little over a percentage point in 2016.

While many of his supporters don't blame him for the lack of funding for Michael recovery, he can't afford to lose any support in a state this close, especially in the Panhandle, where he got about 10% of his total statewide vote out of the 18 counties in that area.

And rallies like Wednesday's are key to organizing and drumming up support.

Lack of funding

Several Florida lawmakers are saying they feel as if Michael has become the ""forgotten"" storm.

That's despite Trump declaring after Michael hit, ""We're doing a lot, more than anybody would have ever done.""

The Federal Emergency Management Agency last month touted that it had provided $1.1 billion in funding to the Panhandle with almost $1 billion going directly to survivors. Officials on the ground, however, are frustrated with the agency's denial of claims and the slowness of aid. Bay County has seen 33,000 denials, for example.

""The bureaucracy of FEMA is very impressive, and that's not meant to be a compliment,"" Griffitts said. ""The processes and bureaucracy of the federal government has been painful at times.""

Bay County has not been reimbursed for some $250 million in debris clearance. That total may be small by Washington standards, but it accounts for about three-quarters of the county's annual budget.

Many of the businesses in the tourism-heavy area haven't come back, with just weeks before Memorial Day, the unofficial kickoff of the summer season.

Tyndall Air Force Base, a major economic force in Bay County, was also hit hard by the storm. Housing on the base was damaged as were more than a dozen F-22 fighter jets. Construction at the base halted last week because of a lack of funding. Trump is expected to get a briefing at the base.

Congress has yet to pass supplemental disaster-relief funding that would get the president's blessing.

A relief package for areas affected by Michael, the California wildfires and other disasters passed the House, but the bill stalled in the Senate. The Senate had a deal on funding, but Trump balked at increased funding for Puerto Rico, whose leaders have been hotly critical of the president after Hurricane Maria. The president sees the government there as inept and untrustworthy stewards of the funds.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has tabled any measure until he's certain the White House will sign off.

""I don't know who to blame,"" Griffitts said, adding that he doesn't necessarily blame Trump, but there's ""no excuse. Quit playing politics.""

Griffitts also noted that one in seven kids did not return to school, a number he said he uses as a proxy for a population drop of about 15 percent. That translates to about 27,000 people no longer living in Bay County — and not enough people for jobs available.

That could certainly have an electoral effect if those voters moved out of state, or if they choose not to vote.

The importance of Florida and the Panhandle to Trump

The president's path to reelection remains a narrow one, and he needs Florida's 29 electoral votes. Trump won the state by just 1.2 percentage points, or about 113,000 votes.

Florida has been decided by an average of less than 2 percentage points on average since 2000, and Democrat Barack Obama won it twice. But Republicans see it trending their direction after the 2018 midterm wins. Not only did they win the governorship, but they also flipped a U.S. Senate seat.

The Panhandle is very important to Trump's chances. Remember that Trump went there to rally the base during a tough political time – four days after the release of the Access Hollywood tape, in which he was heard bragging about assaulting women.

In 2016, Trump wound up running up the score in the 18 counties in the region, getting 22,604 more votes, or about a 5% increase, out of them than GOP nominee Mitt Romney had in 2012.

Looked at another way: Those votes were about one-fifth of Trump's total statewide margin over Hillary Clinton.

Bay County went for Trump with 71% of the vote. That was one of the highest percentages of any large county in the state. Bay also saw the second-largest increase in Republican votes in the Panhandle from 2012 to 2016. Trump got about 5,300 more votes than Romney four years earlier in Bay, a 9% increase. Across Florida, only Santa Rosa County saw a bigger GOP vote increase.

Facing a reelection bid with Democrats fired up to run against him, Trump is going to need to persuade virtually every one of those voters to come out to support him again.

""The president knows the importance of northwest Florida,"" Griffitts said. ""We are a red voting district, and I would hope that he could deliver some good news."""
China backtracked on nearly all aspects of US trade deal: Sources,https://www.cnbc.com,['Huileng Tan'],05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/08/china-backtracked-on-nearly-all-aspects-of-us-trade-deal-sources.html,"The diplomatic cable from Beijing arrived in Washington late on Friday night, with systematic edits to a nearly 150-page draft trade agreement that would blow up months of negotiations between the world's two largest economies, according to three U.S. government sources and three private sector sources briefed on the talks. The document was riddled with reversals by China that undermined core U.S. demands, the sources told Reuters. In each of the seven chapters of the draft trade deal, China had deleted its commitments to change laws to resolve core complaints that caused the United States to launch a trade war: theft of U.S. intellectual property and trade secrets; forced technology transfers; competition policy; access to financial services; and currency manipulation.

U.S. President Donald Trump responded in a tweet on Sunday vowing to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on Friday – timed to land in the middle of a scheduled visit by China's Vice Premier Liu He to Washington to continue trade talks. The stripping of binding legal language from the draft struck directly at the highest priority of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer - who views changes to Chinese laws as essential to verifying compliance after years of what U.S. officials have called empty reform promises. Lighthizer has pushed hard for an enforcement regime more like those used for punitive economic sanctions – such as those imposed on North Korea or Iran – than a typical trade deal. ""This undermines the core architecture of the deal,"" said a Washington-based source with knowledge of the talks.

'Process of negotiation'

Spokespeople for the White House, the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Treasury Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a briefing on Wednesday that working out disagreements over trade was a ""process of negotiation"" and that China was not ""avoiding problems."" Geng referred specific questions on the trade talks to the Commerce Ministry, which did not respond immediately to faxed questions from Reuters. Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were taken aback at the extent of the changes in the draft. The two cabinet officials on Monday told reporters that Chinese backtracking had prompted Trump's tariff order but did not provide details on the depth and breadth of the revisions. Liu last week told Lighthizer and Mnuchin that they needed to trust China to fulfill its pledges through administrative and regulatory changes, two of the sources said. Both Mnuchin and Lighthizer considered that unacceptable, given China's history of failing to fulfil reform pledges.

One private-sector source briefed on the talks said the last round of negotiations had gone very poorly because ""China got greedy"". ""China reneged on a dozen things, if not more ... The talks were so bad that the real surprise is that it took Trump until Sunday to blow up,"" the source said. ""After 20 years of having their way with the U.S., China still appears to be miscalculating with this administration.""

Further talks this week

The rapid deterioration of negotiations rattled global stock markets, bonds and commodities this week. Until Sunday, markets had priced in the expectation that officials from the two countries were close to striking a deal. Investors and analysts questioned whether Trump's tweet was a negotiating ploy to wring more concessions from China. The sources told Reuters the extent of the setbacks in the revised text were serious and that Trump's response was not merely a negotiating strategy. Chinese negotiators said they couldn't touch the laws, said one of the government sources, calling the changes ""major."" Changing any law in China requires a unique set of processes that can't be navigated quickly, said a Chinese official familiar with the talks. The official disputed the assertion that China was backtracking on its promises, adding that U.S. demands were becoming more ""harsh"" and the path to a deal more ""narrow"" as the negotiations drag on."

In a news release, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said he advised the Department of the Interior in writing that ""any official at the Department who 'prohibits or prevents' or 'attempts or threatens to prohibit or prevent' any officer or employee of the Federal Government from speaking with the Committee could have his or her salary withheld pursuant to section 713 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act.""

Barr’s top aide has seen the Russia probe like few in Trump’s world,https://www.politico.com,"['Darren Samuelsohn', 'Jordyn Hermani', 'Marianne Levine', 'Eliana Johnson']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/08/brian-rabbitt-william-barr-1309751,"Brian Rabbitt (right) has managed to largely stay out of the public eye as he handled the Russia investigation from multiple sides. | Alex Wong/Getty Images Legal Barr’s top aide has seen the Russia probe like few in Trump’s world Brian Rabbitt’s role reveals the carousel nature of the Russia probe, which has seen key players switching positions over the last two years.

Brian Rabbitt has seen the Russia investigations through from start to finish — from several sides.

At the beginning, Rabbitt was in the White House, helping the new administration navigate congressional probes into Moscow interference in the 2016 presidential election. At the end, Rabbitt was at the Justice Department as chief of staff to Robert Mueller’s boss, Attorney General William Barr, as Barr determined how to describe the special counsel’s investigation to the public. In between, Rabbitt prepped Barr for Mueller questions during his Senate confirmation.

Rabbitt’s behind-the-scenes role reveals the carousel nature of the Russia probe, which has featured a number of players switching positions over the last two years. And it highlights the ethical challenge numerous DOJ and White House officials have had to grapple with as a result — whether to recuse themselves from working on the investigation at all.

Barr rejected calls to step back because of a 19-page memo he wrote before joining the administration contesting the legal grounds for Mueller’s obstruction-of-justice investigation. His predecessor, acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, also fended off recusal calls over his full-throated cable news denunciations of Mueller’s probe. And Trump’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, actually did recuse himself and the rest of his personal office because of the prominent surrogate role he played during the Trump campaign.

At the White House, counsel Don McGahn in mid-2017 chose to have his entire office stop working on Russia-related matters because staffers had been privy to some of the incidents under investigation.

So when Rabbitt became Barr’s chief of staff in February, he sought out the agency’s ethics officials to determine whether he could advise on Russia matters, given his prior work in the White House counsel’s office. The officials cleared Rabbitt, and within weeks he was assisting on what would become some of the most consequential decisions to date of Donald Trump’s presidency.

“Yes, in an abundance of caution, I requested guidance from career ethics officials and was cleared to advise and work with the attorney general on these issues,” Rabbitt told POLITICO in an email exchange.

Now, three months into his DOJ job, Rabbitt has played several key roles during the culmination of the Mueller investigation.

The 36-year-old conservative attorney called the White House on a March Friday afternoon to inform Emmet Flood, a former colleague and friend then serving as the president’s lead Mueller-response lawyer, that the special counsel’s work was officially over.

Two days later, Rabbitt made another call to Flood, this time to read aloud Barr’s four-page letter summarizing the special counsel’s top-line conclusions on collusion and obstruction of justice. (That Sunday morning, Rabbitt also delivered three boxes of donuts to reporters staked out for weekend duty at DOJ headquarters awaiting the release of Mueller’s findings.)

Rabbitt declined to comment about what specific role he played in helping Barr handle the nuances of the Mueller report, decisions that have since become a lightning rod of controversy and even drew a rare complaint from the special counsel that the attorney general “did not fully capture the context, nature and substance” of his work on the Russia probe over that mid-March weekend.

During Barr’s Senate hearing last week into the Mueller investigation, Rabbitt also whispered repeatedly into the attorney general’s ear as he looked to his staff for help on some questions.

“People should jump me if I’m wrong,” Barr said on more than one occasion, a reference that seemed aimed at his chief of staff and the other aides sitting nearby.

Rabbitt joined the Trump administration in March 2017 from the Washington, D.C., offices of Williams & Connolly, a law firm well known for its partners’ representation of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Rabbitt said in an email he wanted to start out in the Trump Justice Department, but his resume made its way to McGahn, who offered him a job.

While working for McGahn, Rabbitt had a first-floor desk in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. His main portfolio involved legal issues surrounding the deregulation of the financial services industry, as well as helping the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau make its first transition into a GOP administration. He also worked on the confirmations for Supreme Court Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch and SEC Chairman Jay Clayton.

As one of the few White House lawyers with experience in trial litigation, Rabbitt was also tapped to help in the early stages of the Russia probe, as several House and Senate investigations were just getting started and FBI Director James Comey would publicly confirm a federal probe into possible links between the Trump campaign and Moscow’s election meddling efforts.

“He did a few simple things,” said one former White House colleague who declined to elaborate.

“Let’s just leave it with what you have,” added a second former colleague, who also declined further comment.

In an email exchange with POLITICO, Rabbitt said he was “involved as a lower-level junior lawyer in some of the early congressional inquiries on Russia-related matters.”

Former Trump White House attorney Ty Cobb was more fulsome with his praise.

“We worked closely on complex matters and I admired the judgment he displayed — judgment mature beyond his years!” he said in an email.

From the start, Rabbitt’s work has been almost entirely out of the public eye. And in the end, the Northern Virginia native managed to stay out of the legal fire himself. While several of his former White House colleagues’ names, notes and testimony are cited in the Mueller report, Rabbitt is nowhere to be found.

By the summer of 2017, Rabbitt and the rest of the White House counsel’s office were recused from working on the Russia probe, which by that point had morphed from the FBI investigation Comey had confirmed into the special counsel’s probe. McGahn made the recusal decision, Cobb explained last year, because many of his own attorneys “had been significant participants” surrounding key episodes at the center of the Russia probe, including the firings of Comey and national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Rabbitt left the White House that November to work for the SEC, starting out as a senior lawyer on enforcement and then moving into Clayton’s office as a senior policy adviser. Former colleagues say Rabbitt’s tenure at the White House during the Russia probe was wearing.

“A year in the White House counsel’s office is like 10 years in a normal job,” one of them said.

Rabbitt said he made the change for a “great opportunity to work for a great team and fantastic chairman at the SEC on issues related [to] what I had done in private practice.”

Rabbitt then leapt at the chance to work for Barr. He has known the attorney general since the mid-2000s, when he became close friends with Barr’s middle daughter, Patricia, while the two worked together at the U.S. attorney’s office in Alexandria, Va.

“Bill Barr eventually became a mentor to me,” Rabbitt said in an email about his current boss, who previously served as attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration.

His Justice Department job actually started before Barr had been sworn in as attorney general. Rabbitt served as the sherpa for Barr’s Senate confirmation, helping the nominee prepare for a hearing loaded with questions about his allegiance to Trump and how he’d handle the release of a final Mueller report.

“He was always super prepared and thoughtful in his comments and was kind of issues-fodder extraordinaire,” said Reginald Brown, a former senior George W. Bush White House aide who also helped Barr in his Senate confirmation. “You can see why Bill liked him on the substance and it was just clear the relationship between them was one of complete trust.”

“That confirmation could have been a controversial one,” Brown added. “It wasn’t. That was in significant part to the quality of [Rabbitt’s] thinking and approach.”

People who know both men say it was a natural fit, offering the attorney general who had been out of government for more than 25 years a window onto Capitol Hill and inside the Trump White House.

“He has a set of relationships across the Trump administration that Bill might not have. He has the ability to be his eyes and ears across town,” said Brown.

Serving as Barr’s right-hand-man has meant a lot of Mueller — it’s the issue that has dominated the attorney general’s first three months on the job.

“There’s obviously been a lot of Mueller. He’s involved in everything the attorney general is involved in,” said one of his former White House colleagues.

Rabbitt, however, never became part of the probe itself. While other former White House colleagues had sat for questioning in the Mueller investigation — McGahn himself spent more than 30 hours with investigators — Rabbitt said the special counsel team didn’t interview him as a witness and he didn’t need to get his own personal lawyer.

Still, Rabbitt nonetheless considered whether another recusal was necessary when Barr became Mueller’s main supervisor, taking over from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.

Rabbitt is actually one of several original McGahn hires now serving in the Barr Justice Department. The attorney general’s senior staff also includes deputy chief of staff John Moran and senior adviser Claire McCusker Murray — both worked in the White House counsel’s office with Rabbitt. And former Trump White House associate counsel James Burnham also now has a lead role on DOJ’s civil side representing the administration in trial courts around the country.

The Barr-Rabbitt relationship marks a big change from the first team at DOJ, which started out with Sessions and chief of staff Jody Hunt. Sessions recused all of his staff in the attorney general’s office from working on the Russia probe, which opened the door for Rosenstein to take the lead appointing and then supervising Mueller. Whitaker, a former federal prosecutor from Iowa and frequent conservative TV commentator, replaced Hunt in September 2017 and later became the acting attorney general after Trump ousted Sessions the day after the November 2018 midterms.

“Could I have seen him be Jeff Sessions’ chief of staff? No. Because that’d be weird,” said one of Rabbitt’s former White House colleagues. “Given the fact Bill Barr is the attorney general, it makes all the sense in the world.”"

The chairman also slammed the DOJ for their threat, stating that executive privilege does not apply in this instance because the White House waived these privileges.

“The White House waived these privileges long ago, and the Department seemed open to sharing these materials with us earlier today. The Department’s legal arguments are without credibility, merit, or legal or factual basis,"" Nadler said in a statement.



“Worse, this kind of obstruction is dangerous. The Department’s decision reflects President Trump’s blanket defiance of Congress’s constitutionally mandated duties. In the coming days, I expect that Congress will have no choice but to confront the behavior of this lawless Administration. The Committee will also take a hard look at the officials who are enabling this cover up,” he continued.

The letter and the contempt vote are both moves that will further escalate the battle between Capitol Hill and the DOJ over access to redacted information that intensified after special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE released his long-awaited report on Russia's election interference last month.

Negotiations between the two parties failed on Tuesday. Despite representatives of the committee staff and the DOJ meeting on Capitol Hill to discuss the possibility of additional access to the Mueller report, the two sides were not able to reach an agreement — instead, any progress appears to be lost.

""The Department offered to expand the number of staff members who may review the minimally redacted report; to allow Members of Congress who have reviewed the minimally redacted report to discuss the material freely among themselves; and to allow Members to take and retain their notes following their review,"" Boyd wrote to Nadler.

Boyd also expressed disappointment that Democrats still refused to review a less redacted version of the report, an offer Democrats rejected because they said it was too rigid in allowing only a dozen to review such information and not allowing them to discuss it.

According to the committee aide, Democrats counteroffered. They asked Barr to work with the committee to obtain grand jury material by either going to court with them or not opposing their efforts to go to court — information Barr has maintained he will not give to Congress.

They also requested that all members on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees have access to this less redacted version rather than just House and committee leadership; they requested three staffers from each side rather than two, as the DOJ proposed; and they requested that the DOJ agree to a meeting as early as this week to provide members with access to underlying evidence in the report.

Republicans blasted Democrats for rejected Barr's accommodations and thereby thwarting their own chances to gain access to redacted information.

""It appears that the more access to information Democrats receive, the less interested they are in actually examining those facts,"" Rep. Doug Collins Douglas (Doug) Allen CollinsDOJ threatens executive privilege over Mueller report if Dems carry out contempt vote Trump, Dems escalate battles over investigations White House orders McGahn to defy House subpoena MORE (R-Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, said in a statement.

""Chairman Nadler, however, rebuffed the olive branch and plowed ahead with his plan to hold Attorney General Barr in contempt for upholding the law. I can’t imagine a more illogical hill for a legislator to die on,"" he continued."

Congress Has a Right to See Trump’s Tax Returns.",https://www.nytimes.com,['The Editorial Board'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/opinion/trump-tax-returns-congress.html,"As to whether Congress may obtain a president’s tax returns, there is no ambiguity : Federal law empowers the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee to submit a written request to the Treasury Department , which oversees the Internal Revenue Service, for “any return or return information.” The Treasury secretary then “shall furnish” the requested information to the committee so that it may conduct its legislative functions.

Perhaps that statute is not clear enough for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The secretary on Monday rebuffed just such a request from Representative Richard Neal, the Democratic chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. In April, Mr. Neal requested six years’ worth of federal tax returns for President Trump and several of his companies.

The purpose of the request was not “harassment” of the president, as Mr. Trump and his defenders have branded efforts by Democratic House members to perform legitimate oversight functions. Rather, as Mr. Neal told the I.R.S., the committee “is considering legislative proposals and conducting oversight related to our federal tax laws, including, but not limited to, the extent to which the I.R.S. audits and enforces the federal tax laws against a president.”

In a letter responding to Mr. Neal on Monday, Mr. Mnuchin said he consulted with the Justice Department and determined that the chairman’s request “lacks a legitimate legislative purpose” and that the Treasury Department “may not lawfully fulfill the committee’s request.”"
State Department Continues Fight to Strip Gay Couple’s Two-Year-Old Son of Birthright Citizenship,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-continues-fight-to-strip-gay-couples-two-year-old-son-of-birthright-citizenship,"Ever since twins Aiden and Ethan Dvash-Banks were born in Toronto in September 2016, they have shared everything—the same button nose, the same swoopy haircut, the same pug/terrier mix London. But for years, the U.S. State Department has fought an escalating legal battle to ensure that they don’t share one important thing: American citizenship.

Although Aiden and Ethan’s fathers, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks, have been married since 2010, only Andrew is an American citizen. While that would be enough for children in a heterosexual marriage to qualify for U.S. citizenship while born abroad, the State Department has held the Dvash-Bankses to a different standard, requiring the family to undergo DNA testing to establish that Aiden—but not Ethan—was the biological son of a U.S. citizen.

The boys’ parents sued, arguing in federal court that proving a biological connection between a child and a U.S. citizen parent isn’t required to extend birthright citizenship from a married parent to a child, and in February, the judge ruled in their favor.

“The basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, U.S. District Judge John F. Walter wrote in a decision issued in February, dismissing the department’s attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples “unilateral.”

But on Monday, the State Department appealed that decision, continuing a years-long bid to strip Ethan of his citizenship.

“Once again, the State Department is refusing to recognize Andrew and Elad’s rights as a married couple. The government’s decision to try to strip Ethan of his citizenship is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and morally reprehensible,” said Aaron C. Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBT people in the immigration system. Morris successfully argued in federal court that a policy requiring genetic testing for the children of same-sex binational couples created a new double standard for citizenship: one for the children of gay couples and one for the children of straight couples.

After the Supreme Court struck down a ban on federal recognition of same-sex marriage in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security issued a guidance declaring that “just as [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] applies all relevant laws to determine the validity of an opposite-sex marriage, we will apply all relevant laws to determine the validity of a same-sex marriage.”

In response to a request for comment on the appeal, and on whether it plans to require DNA testing of all binational married couples in order to establish a biological relationship and thereby to establish birthright citizenship, a State Department spokesperson said that the department “does not comment on pending litigation.”

Morris also noted that in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the State Department has filed its appeal, the standard of using DNA testing to ensure a biological relationship between a child and a married U.S. citizen parent in order to confer citizenship has already been soundly rejected.

“This is settled law in the Ninth Circuit, which has already established that citizenship may pass from a married parent to a child regardless of whether or not they have a biological relationship,” Morris said.

Despite that precedent, Aiden and Ethan’s fathers are still deeply concerned with the State Department’s decision to appeal the case.

“We’re outraged that the State Department is so intent on harming our family and the LGBTQ community,” Andrew and Elad said in a statement. “The fight is not over, and we will not rest until our family is treated fairly and equally. Nothing can tear us apart. The four of us are unbreakable.”"

Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., initially requested ""all materials ... obtained or produced by the Special Counsel's Office in the course of the investigation"" in a March 27 letter to Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and FBI Director Christopher Wray. After receiving no response, Schiff and Nunes repeated their request in a second letter dated April 25, one week after Barr released a redacted version of the Mueller report to Congress and the public.

""[A]s the report makes clear, the Department of Justice and the FBI failed to keep the Committee 'fully and currently informed' of this important foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information, as required by law,"" Schiff and Nunes wrote in the April letter. ""The Department and the Bureau did not keep the Committee apprised of this information ... contrary to long-standing practice regarding significant counterintelligence matters.""

The second letter from Nunes and Schiff gave the Justice Department until May 2 to cooperate with their requests or ""the Committee will have no choice but to resort to compulsory process on Friday, May 3 to compel production of documents responsive to the Committee's request.""

A committee aide told Fox News on Tuesday that ""the [Justice] Department has not produced any documents responsive to our requests and has not agreed to schedule any testimony,"" even after Schiff and Nunes sent their second letter.

""An accommodations process must go both ways, and the Committee will soon start the compulsory process since the Department has not even begun to comply,"" the aide said.

The letters mark a rare showing of bipartisan agreement between Schiff and Nunes, who have repeatedly been at loggerheads over the Russia investigation. On March 28, the committee's nine Republican members -- including Nunes -- requested that Schiff step down as chairman over his repeated claims in the media that there was ""more than circumstantial evidence” of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Last week, Schiff called for Barr to resign as attorney general over his handling of the Mueller report, writing in a USA Today op-ed that Barr ""misled the country about an investigation implicating the president.

""Then he lied to Congress,"" Schiff wrote in the piece published last Friday. ""Then he did something worse: He effectively said that the president of the United States is above the law.""

Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Doug Palmer']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/agriculture-economists-leave-trump-1307146,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's moves to limit his agency's research arm have led to a string of departures from the Economic Research Service, whose reports detail how farmers have been hurt by President Donald Trump's trade feuds. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Agriculture Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump Reports showing farmers hurt by the president’s policies have drawn the ire of top officials.

Economists in the Agriculture Department's research branch say the Trump administration is retaliating against them for publishing reports that shed negative light on White House policies, spurring an exodus that included six of them quitting the department on a single day in late April.

The Economic Research Service — a source of closely read reports on farm income and other topics that can shape federal policy, planting decisions and commodity markets — has run afoul of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue with its findings on how farmers have been financially harmed by President Donald Trump's trade feuds, the Republican tax code rewrite and other sensitive issues, according to current and former agency employees.

Story Continued Below

The reports highlight the continued decline under Trump’s watch in farm income, which has dropped about 50 percent since 2013. Rural voters were a crucial source of support for Trump in 2016, and analysts say even a small retreat in 2020 could jeopardize the president’s standing in several battleground states.

“The administration didn’t appreciate some of our findings, so this is retaliation to harm the agency and send a message,” said one current ERS employee, who asked not to be named to avoid retribution.

For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper at an economic conference in early 2018 that indicated the GOP tax overhaul would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers — generating negative press coverage that staff members said irked senior officials at USDA.

Then, in August, Perdue stunned members of the roughly 300-member research service by announcing plans to bring ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, who reports more directly to the secretary. Equally significant, he said the USDA would move the agency out of Washington to a location closer to the U.S. heartland.

Members of the agency were also caught off-guard last summer when Perdue’s office issued an internal memo directing ERS and other research branches to include disclaimers in their peer-reviewed publications stating that the findings were “preliminary” and “should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy” — seen as a way of watering down any unflattering data from the department’s own experts.

The move to uproot the agency has led to a brain-drain of experienced researchers. So far in fiscal 2019, non-retirement departures from the agency have more than doubled on an annualized basis compared to the previous three-year average, according to data collected by employees.

Six of the economists — made up of specialists in the agricultural economy, farm taxation and food programs with more than 50 years of combined experience at ERS — left the agency at the end of April, out of frustration with the relocation process or in some cases suspicion about Perdue’s efforts to reshape USDA’s research wing, according to coworkers. More are planning to leave in the coming months.

For his part, Perdue has said the relocation was motivated by his desire to save taxpayer dollars, bring the research service closer to major farming regions, and help attract economists who could be deterred by Washington’s high cost of living.

“I really have been a little surprised with the naysayers on this,” he said last month at a Senate Appropriations hearing, touting the move as a common-sense, cost-cutting measure.

Perdue’s office declined to provide information on the numbers of employees who’ve quit or respond to allegations of political interference in the research service.

But the secretary alluded to frustrations with the quality of USDA research in comments to POLITICO on April 30, saying that all decision-making in the department must be “fact-based.”

“In USDA, we want good scientific discovery,” Perdue said, when asked about the mandated research-disclosure language. “We want peer-based evidence there. We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers. That relies on sound, replicatable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

Perdue and Trump made clear in their budget request in March that they wanted to reduce the scope of the ERS, eliminating “low priority research” into such politically sensitive areas as food stamps and environmental issues.

The White House blueprint called for slashing ERS staff levels by more than 50 percent, cutting the total number of positions from about 329 to 160.

The budget is unlikely to be approved by Congress, but members of the service say they’ve already seen the effects of Trump’s and Perdue’s preferences.

“Things like conservation, rural development, food assistance, have just been de-emphasized” in favor of the administration’s preferred topics, said one economist who left ERS because of the relocation plan.

Former ERS Administrator Susan Offutt, who oversaw the service under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the agency’s studies showing how USDA’s farm-subsidy programs disproportionately benefit wealthier farmers have been a “perennial irritant” to influential lobbying groups, but an “over-the-top reaction” to clamp down on such reports would be unprecedented.

“Of course, this is not the story the farm lobby wants to tell about struggling farmers,” said Offutt. “Controlling ERS would stop unflattering news about federal farm subsidies favoring high-income, high-wealth farm households from reaching the public.”

Lawmakers have complained that USDA has yet to provide a full cost-benefit analysis of its plan to move the office closer to the heartland. Republicans have increasingly supported the relocation plan, while House Democrats have filed legislation to block the move.

On Friday, the USDA announced three finalists for the new headquarters of the service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which is also being moved out of Washington. The finalists are Kansas City, the North Carolina research triangle region and multiple locations in Indiana.

Perdue’s office has promised to release further data justifying the move when he announces a final site recommendation this month.

Within the service, skeptical employees view the secretary’s rationale for the move and the months-long site selection process carried out by accounting firm Ernst & Young as a smokescreen.

“The message we’ve been getting is, ‘The cost-benefit analysis doesn’t matter. Being close to stakeholders doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters for you is the fact that the secretary wants you to move, thinks it’s in your best interest, and that’s what we’re doing,’” said another senior ERS economist who declined to use his name for fear of retaliation.

Brian Stacy, a former ERS economist who left in February, said he thinks the move is a way for the administration to force out staff members and reduce the size of the ERS without congressional approval.

“Part of me wonders whether this relocation is just a way to get at that staff reduction,” Stacy said, referring to the president’s budget request. “I don’t know how else to read some of the moves being made.”

ERS employees are planning to vote on unionization on Thursday.

USDA intends to keep 76 ERS employees in Washington and relocate 253 positions to the new location, USDA senior adviser Kristi Boswell told a House Appropriations panel in March.

“This is the spiraling down of the fantastic work that the ERS has done for years,” said Sonny Ramaswamy, who headed the National Institute of Food and Agriculture under the Obama and early Trump administrations. “It’s one way to drain the swamp, as it were.”

Pompeo Makes Unscheduled Trip to Iraq to Press U.S. Concerns About Iran,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Falih Hassan', 'Megan Specia', 'Rick Gladstone']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/world/europe/pompeo-cancels-berlin.html,"Mr. Pompeo’s visit, shrouded in secrecy until after it was over, came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Mr. Trump’s repudiation of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and the reimposition of American sanctions, which have been increasingly squeezing Iran’s economy. Iran said Monday it would no longer comply with parts of the agreement, alarming European officials who have hoped to preserve the accord, meant to ensure Iran’s peaceful use of nuclear energy.

The choreography of Mr. Pompeo’s Iraq stopover also appeared designed to send a message to Iran. Before he flew to Baghdad, the State Department said Mr. Pompeo, who had been in Finland, had abandoned a scheduled meeting in Berlin with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany because of unidentified “pressing issues.”

The Trump administration has not provided specific details about what it has called the new threat from Iran, which has drawn some skepticism, given the history of faulty intelligence that led to the Iraq war. But officials have told The New York Times that new intelligence has raised concerns about Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and its connections to some of Iraq’s Shiite Arab militias.

Asked by reporters to elaborate, Mr. Pompeo said, “I just don’t want to go into the details of that anymore.” But he also reiterated his contention that the Revolutionary Guards is a terrorist organization. “This was just calling out the truth,” he said.

It was Mr. Pompeo who last month placed the Revolutionary Guards on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations, against the advice of American intelligence and Pentagon officials, who warned that Iran’s clerical government could reciprocate and put United States personnel at risk in the Middle East.

Last week, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran declared all American forces in the Middle East terrorists and labeled the United States government a state sponsor of terrorism.

To counter what the Trump administration has described as the new threat, the Pentagon has expedited an already-scheduled deployment of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Persian Gulf."

ALBANY — As the standoff over President Trump’s federal tax returns deepens in Washington, New York State lawmakers say they intend to advance a bill on Wednesday to allow congressional committees to see Mr. Trump’s New York State returns.

State Senator Brad Hoylman, a Manhattan Democrat, confirmed on Tuesday that the State Senate had enough votes to ensure passage of a bill allowing the commissioner of the New York Department of Taxation and Finance to release any state tax return requested by a leader of one of three congressional committees for any “specified and legitimate legislative purpose.”

A tax return from New York — the headquarters of the president’s business empire and his home state — could contain much of the same financial information as a federal return, which Mr. Trump has steadfastly refused to release. On Monday, the Treasury Department denied a request from House Democrats for six years of the president’s federal returns, setting up a likely court battle that could reach the Supreme Court.

“The news of yesterday makes New York’s role even more crucial,” Mr. Hoylman said. He has described his bill as “assisting Congress in its oversight role.”"

In January 2018, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks sued the department after it informed them that one of their twin sons, Ethan, born through a surrogate like his brother, Aiden, had been denied citizenship because he only carried DNA from Elad, who is an Israeli citizen.

Six economists in the Agriculture Department's (USDA) research branch quit the Trump administration in a single day late last month and more are reportedly planning to leave. The exodus comes after the Economic Research Service (ERS) published findings that painted the new Republican tax law, Trump's trade disputes and other policy decisions as hurting American farmers financially.

A recent report shows a drop in farmers' income by about 50 percent since 2013, and says slightly more than half of farm households have faced negative farm income in recent years, forcing them to rely on other sources of income to support their families.

Economists have also complained about an internal department memo directing researchers to add disclaimers to their peer-reviewed publications to call them ""preliminary."" Officials argue this addition to reports weakens the legitimacy of the research and makes negative data look less unfavorable.

These complaints, economists told Politico, are why staffers departed in late April and more plan to leave in the near future.

Perdue’s office declined to offer Politico information on employees who have quit.

The news comes as ERS employees are expected to vote on unionization this week, and as Trump has again announced increased tariffs on China.

Trump's top trade negotiator said Monday that the White House will raise tariffs from 10 percent to 25 percent on $200 billion in Chinese goods after a setback in trade talks between the U.S. and Beijing.

The president announced Sunday on Twitter that he planned to go through with the tariff hike, which had been indefinitely delayed amid negotiations between the two countries."

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday threatened to withhold the salaries of Interior Department officials who have blocked lawmakers from interviewing agency employees about whether Secretary David Bernhardt was complying with recordkeeping laws.

The committee’s threat ratchets up the pressure on Interior in the latest skirmish between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the lawmakers' complaints that agencies are withholding documents and ignoring requests to send senior officials to testify before Congress.

“Please be advised that any official at the Department who ‘prohibits or prevents’ or ‘attempts or threatens to prohibit or prevent’ any officer or employee of the Federal Government from speaking with the Committee could have his or her salary withheld pursuant to section 713 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act,” Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a prepared statement.

Cummings also complained in the letter to Cole Rojewski, Interior's director of congressional and legislative affairs, that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations.

Oversight has sought interviews with Interior’s administrative assistant to the deputy secretary, scheduling and advance director, executive assistant to the office of the deputy secretary and acting chief of staff and associate deputy secretary. The committee asked Interior to respond to the interview requests by Friday.

Cummings is also using the the threat of withholding salaries to force Commerce Department officials to appear before it for interviews relating plans to add citizenship questions to the 2020 Census.

In his statement, Cummings pointed to a 2016 GAO report that said a department’s budget “appropriation was not available to pay the salary of a federal officer or employee who prevents another federal officer or employee from communicating directly with any member, committee, or subcommittee of Congress.”

Oversight and the National Archives and Records Administration are investigating allegations that Bernhardt was keeping meetings off his official calendars and not supplying information about meetings to the public.

Interior refused the committee’s previous requests to interview several staffers, telling Oversight that the interviews “are unnecessary at this time,” according to a letter the committee sent to Interior today.

At a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the Interior Department budget on Tuesday, Bernhardt defended preventing the employees from talking to the committee, saying ""it’s not the appropriate time"" for those interviews, and that his decision was designed to protect career employees.

“You’re talking about individual employees who have long standing in the department,” he said in response to questioning from Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). “We have wonderful career employees here ... they’ve never had this happen to them in their careers.”

Lawrence shot back that Congress was responsible for oversight of the agency.

""You have been requested to comply. With all due to respect, you are required to comply,“ she said.

Besides refusing interviews, Interior has declined to provide documents the Oversight and House Natural Resources committees requested on March 13, according Cummings‘ letter. The department instead offered tens of thousands of pages of documents unrelated to the committee's request, the letter states.

President Trump told Fox News in a recent interview that McGahn should not testify: ""They've testified for many hours, all of them. I would say, it's done,"" he told chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge.

WHITE HOUSE BLOCKS MCGAHN FROM PRODUCING DOCUMENTS SUBPOENAED BY HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

Dupree said that in regard to McGahn's testifying, if he ""follows White House's instructions ... the Democrats are not going away.""

""They have made clear that they want to put as many people in jail as they can. They want to just take them to the mat on this,"" Dupree said, adding that he foresees a possible legal battle between White House claims of executive privilege and Democrats' demand for disclosure.

""That ultimately will get propelled into a federal court for resolution,"" he said.

Host Julie Banderas asked Dupree whether Democrats may pursue contempt charges against McGahn if he does not comply with their demands.

""If McGahn refuses to appear and answer their questions, I suspect that would be the next card they will play,"" Dupree said.

""Clearly, the Democrats are zeroing in on 'Volume II' of the Mueller report,"" he added, referring to the section detailing the investigation into whether obstruction of justice occurred."
VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas,https://www.politico.com,['Lorraine Woellert'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/va-mortgage-lenders-federal-subpoenas-1414318,"Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. | Charles Dharapak, File/AP Photo defense VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas

Federal investigators have issued subpoenas to several mortgage lenders that make loans to military veterans, seeking information on delinquencies and payments.

The investigation is being led by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General in cooperation with the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, according to four people with knowledge of the subpoenas.

Story Continued Below

At least eight lenders, and likely more, have been asked to turn over hundreds of files on VA home loans made between 2013 and 2017, according to two people with knowledge of the request.

The requests include questions about quality control and loan audits.

Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. One VA program in particular — the Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan, or IRRRL — allows lenders to put existing VA borrowers into new loans without an appraisal or underwriting and was ripe for abuse.

Michael Nacincik, a spokesperson for the Department of Veterans Affairs OIG, and John Marzulli, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, declined to comment. Both said they could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation.

Jeffrey London, executive director of the VA’s Loan Guaranty Service, did not respond to requests for comment.

On Friday, Ginnie Mae said it was weighing whether to exclude some of those VA loans from its pooled securities in an effort to tackle a wave of rapid-fire mortgage refinancings that have left some military service members deeper in debt.

In a 14-page request for input, the government mortgage agency called the practice, known as churning, “unhealthy” for the agency.

The loan documents requested by investigators weren’t limited to IRRRLs, according to one person with knowledge of the subpoenas.

The VA subpoenas are landing as HUD is taking steps to rein in the prosecution of lenders who sell mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration.

Many of the nation’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, stopped offering FHA loans after the government, under former President Barack Obama, used the False Claims Act to extract billions of dollars in settlements from dozens of big lenders.

FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery, an appointee of President Donald Trump, has said those cases went too far and that the Trump administration is working with the DOJ to change how the False Claims Act is used against lenders."

“What is everyone afraid of?” Conway quipped during an appearance on ""Fox and Friends."" “What do you have to hide? How did this all start? Bill Barr, the attorney general, made clear that perhaps there is an investigation into at least eight of these leaks.”

The “leaks” Conway are referring to are alleged communications between top Obama-era intelligence officials and members of the press during the 2016 presidential election and first year of Trump’s presidency.

In 2017, Trump famously fired former FBI Director James Comey — today a prominent anti-Trump figure who the president has dismissed as a “liar” and a “leaker.”

The same year, former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was forced to resign from the department after it was discovered he leaked information to the press about former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

When it comes to possible investigations into spying on Trump in 2016, @KellyannePolls asks: ""What is everyone afraid of?"" pic.twitter.com/fUG0oOfNg2 — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) May 7, 2019



During a congressional testimony last week, Attorney General William Barr sent Republicans into a frenzy by citing spying on Trump’s 2016 campaign.

Barr’s statement gave fuel to an already red-hot narrative spun by the White House and leading Republicans who have railed against an anti-Trump bias at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and criminal intelligence agencies.

After Mueller found no collusion between the president and Russia, Trump encouraged his allies on Capitol Hill and Barr to “investigate the investigators.”

“Mueller, and the A.G. based on Mueller findings (and great intelligence), have already ruled No Collusion, No Obstruction,” Trump tweeted last month. “These were crimes committed by Crooked Hillary, the DNC, Dirty Cops and others! INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS!”

Now that scrutiny has shifted in part to how the Mueller probe began, Conway smirked at the thought of anti-Trump figures shaking in their boots.

“I, for one, as a citizen of this country, want to know if intelligence officers were leaking information to the press,” Conway said. “I think a few of them look a little nervous these days.”"

No specific reason was given for the cancellation. The press pool traveling with Pompeo has not been told where they are going next, and have been warned they may not be able to report from the country they are going to until after their departure.

""Unfortunately, we must reschedule the Berlin meetings due to pressing issues. We look forward to rescheduling this important set of meetings. The Secretary looks forward to being in Berlin soon,"" State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said, according to the press pool traveling with Pompeo.

The sudden schedule change comes two days after the Pentagon deployed a carrier and a bomber task force to the Middle East, in response to ""specific and credible"" intelligence that suggested Iranian forces and proxies were planning to target US forces in Syria, Iraq and at sea.

The carrier group has been ordered to Strait of Hormuz in order to send a deterrent message to Iran, US officials said Sunday. The move is likely to heighten tensions as Tehran explicitly warned the US in April against any moves to block or interfere with the Strait. The 21-mile-wide waterway separates Iran from other Gulf countries and is a crucial conduit for the global economy, with 30% of the world's crude oil passing through it.

Imprisoning Bill Barr is left’s new rallying cry: ‘Have him locked up’,https://www.foxnews.com,"['Brooke Singman', 'Brooke Singman Is A Politics Reporter For Fox News. Follow Her On Twitter At']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/imprisoning-bill-barr-is-lefts-new-rallying-cry-have-him-locked-up,"The battle between congressional Democrats and the Justice Department over Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report has reached new levels of vitriol, as some on the left call for Attorney General Bill Barr to be physically dragged in to testify or even locked up for defying congressional subpoenas.

The demands have escalated after the attorney general refused to appear before the House Judiciary Committee last week amid disagreements over the format of the hearing.

PELOSI SAYS BARR 'LIED TO CONGRESS' AND COMMITTED A CRIME, AS DOJ BLASTS 'RECKLESS' COMMENTS

Though he testified a day earlier on the Senate side, Democrats on the committee still want to bring in the DOJ leader to answer questions on the conclusion of Mueller's investigation. Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., also imposed a Monday morning deadline for Barr to turn over the full, unredacted Mueller report and additional files -- a deadline the DOJ apparently missed, prompting Nadler to schedule a Wednesday vote on contempt proceedings against Barr.

Committee member Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., over the weekend urged the panel to specifically pursue “inherent contempt,” calling for Barr to be arrested by the Sergeant at Arms and be physically brought before the committee to testify—a tactic reportedly not employed since the 1930s.

“I think they will stonewall at all costs,” Cohen told CNN’s Anderson Cooper, adding that the situation “leaves us no other alternative than to have our Sergeant at Arms bring him in. He is being utterly contemptuous of Congress. He lied to the Congress.”

Inherent contempt, which allows a person to be held until they provide testimony, is one of three contempt options available, along with criminal contempt (under which an individual is charged with a crime) and civil judgment (leading to a civil court process)

Cohen added: “You have to have him sit for a hearing and you have to have him locked up until he agrees to participate and come to the hearing.”

Cohen said that he did not know what the committee would do but argued that without pursuing that avenue, a congressional contempt citation would be “meaningless.”

The DOJ has not publicly responded to Cohen's warning, though a spokeswoman fired back last week when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Barr of committing a crime by allegedly lying in prior testimony. The DOJ called the attack ""reckless, irresponsible and false.""

Still, the scenario Cohen suggested has thus far not been entertained by higher-ranking Democrats. Cohen -- who drew mockery last week for bringing a KFC bucket to the no-show hearing, eating fried chicken in full view of press cameras and placing a toy chicken by Barr's empty seat in order to suggest Barr is, himself, like a chicken -- even suggested the contempt scenarios might not produce much action.

“It shows we want to hold him in contempt, but that fact is, he won’t be held in contempt because the Justice Department is not going to enforce a contempt citation against their boss,” Cohen explained. “It’s just not going to happen. Trump and Barr would fire whoever tried to do it.”

But Cohen isn’t the only one on the left calling for such a drastic measure.

Former Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich penned an op-ed last week titled ""Congress should be ready to arrest Bill Barr if he defies subpoena.""

“[T]he House can order its own sergeant-at-arms to arrest the offender, subject him to a trial before the full House, and, if judged to be in contempt, jail that person until he appears before the House and brings whatever documentation the House has subpoenaed,” Reich wrote in the op-ed for Salon. “Congress hasn’t actually carried through on the threat since 1935 — but it could. Would America really be subject to the wild spectacle of the sergeant-at-arms of the House arresting an Attorney General and possibly placing him in jail?”

NADLER LIKENS TRUMP TO 'DICTATOR,' THREATENS BARR WITH CONTEMPT AFTER HEARING BOYCOTT

“Probably not,” he wrote. “Before that ever occurred, the Trump administration would take the matter to the Supreme Court on an expedited basis.”

Reich also said that Trump’s alleged “contempt for the inherent power of Congress” is “the most dictatorial move he has initiated since becoming president.”

Another column in The Week, titled ""William Barr is in contempt. Congress should send him to jail,"" discussed a similar scenario.

“And there's a simple solution for the House to enact if Barr really doesn't show up: Formally hold him in contempt of Congress, then send him to jail,” Joel Mathis wrote. “That's a radical suggestion, but this is a radical moment.”

Meanwhile, most prominent Democrats have argued instead that Barr should resign amid the controversy.

“He lied to Congress. And if anybody else did that, it would be considered a crime,” Pelosi told reporters. “Nobody is above the law. Not the president of the United States. Not the attorney general.”

Pelosi’s public comments came after she, according to Politico, told Rep. Charlie Crist, D-Fla., during a private caucus meeting Thursday: “We saw [Barr] commit a crime when he answered your question.”

She was referring to an April 9 hearing, where Crist had asked whether Barr knew what prompted reports that prosecutors on the special counsel team were frustrated with his initial summary. Barr said he did not.

But last week, The Washington Post first reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller contacted Barr, both in a letter and in a phone call, to express concerns after Barr released his four-page summary of Mueller’s findings in March. Mueller pushed Barr to release the executive summaries written by the special counsel’s office.

However, according to both the Post and the Justice Department, Mueller made clear that he did not feel that Barr’s summary was inaccurate. Instead, Mueller told Barr that media coverage of the letter had “misinterpreted” the results of the probe concerning obstruction of justice.

Pelosi, last week, was asked if Barr should go to jail for the alleged crime.

“There is a process involved here and as I said, I’ll say it again, the committee will have to come to how we will proceed,” Pelosi said."

The list includes the exotic -- Romania gold coin, a dozen small gold-covered Zodiac figurines -- as well as the more quotidian -- an assortment of books, 24 avocados, a box of dates, some pens and bath soaps.

Ross, who has been caught napping during the president's speeches and during meetings, also received three bottles of instant coffee. And he's been presented with a ""giant-print"" reference Bible. Another gift giver settled on the classic choice of champagne - a 2006 bottle of Dom Perignon (which can be found online for about $130 to $150).

The gift list reveals hints of who, at home and abroad, may be trying to curry favor with Ross, who took office in February 2017.

The Commerce Department provided few details about who sent the gifts and their value, but some descriptions point to foreign governments in China, Thailand, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Ghana, Uzbekistan, Japan, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates.

Other gifts include an AmCham (American Chamber of Commerce) crystal business card holder, and a ""thumb drive with Secretary Ross speech and some other ceremony highlights from Tenaris Day."" Tenaris is a pipe supplier for oil and gas companies.

As Commerce Secretary, Ross plays a key role in crafting U.S. trade policy and amplifying American products and industries.

""Any of the gifts that indicate that they are made of gold or silver--that would suggest that they have some significant and intrinsic value,"" said Virginia Cantor, chief ethics counsel for the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""You definitely need transparency in order to be able to determine whether it would present a potential conflict of interest.""

A Commerce Department spokesperson tells CBS News high-value gifts are appraised and sold, according to federal regulations on gifting limits.

Ross has previously faced criticism for financial disclosure inaccuracies and concerns about his compliance with conflict of interest laws.

The 81-year-old investor, known as the ""king of bankruptcy"" for his predilection for buying bankrupt companies, has also been lampooned as financially out-of-touch with most Americans, after suggesting in January furloughed federal workers should take out bank loans to pay their bills.

Though Ross has claimed he's a billionaire, Forbes removed him in 2017 from its list of billionaires after it said financial disclosure forms showed he had less than $700 million in assets."

A Bible on display at the Manchester Veterans Affairs Medical Center is now the subject of a federal lawsuit. The Bible was carried by a prisoner of war in World War II and then made part of a memorial in the Manchester VA, near the entrance. >> Download the FREE WMUR appA patient, James Chamberlain, filed a lawsuit Tuesday to have the Bible removed from the Missing Man Table, where it is displayed inside a secure case.The Bible had been removed in February after a plea from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, whose leaders said 14 patients complained to them about the Bible's placement. The organization asked the VA to remove the Bible, calling its presence intolerable and unconstitutional.""Right now, the VA is a train wreck of unconstitutionality as they elevate Christianity to the supreme position of dominance in direct violation of our U.S. Constitution,"" said Michael Weinstein of MRFF. ""It's shameful. It's disgraceful.""VA officials moved the Bible to a nearby display case, sparking opposing efforts to get the Bible moved back to its original spot.After a few weeks, VA officials moved the Bible back, leading to the lawsuit from Chamberlain, the 15th patient to file a complaint with the foundation, according to the lawsuit.Veteran Paul Martin's group, the Northeast POW-MIA Network, obtained the WWII-era bible for the display in September last year.""Everybody's entitled to their opinion, but I think it's a shame,"" Martin said. ""It would be a shame that that Bible be taken from that table.""In the lawsuit, Chamberlain said he is a devout Christian, but he ""believes that our Constitution prohibits the establishment by the government of any specific religious belief and prohibits discrimination against any person because of their religious beliefs or lack thereof. Despite his strong personal religious beliefs, he believes that the Christian Bible has no place being displayed on the POW/MIA table at the entrance way to the MVAMC, where he gets his care."" Curt Cashour, press secretary for the Department of Veterans Affairs, released a statement about the lawsuit:""This lawsuit – backed by a group known for questionable practices and unsuccessful lawsuits – is nothing more than an attempt to force VA into censoring a show of respect for America’s POW/MIA community. Make no mistake: VA will not be bullied on this issue. After receiving a complaint in late January about a Bible included in a Northeast POW/MIA Network-sponsored POW/MIA table, Manchester VAMC officials temporarily removed the Bible from the display out of an abundance of caution. Following that removal, Manchester VAMC received an outpouring of complaints from Veterans and other stakeholders – many of whom dropped off Bibles at the facility – in protest of this action. After consulting with legal counsel, Manchester VAMC has again placed the Bible on display, where it will remain indefinitely as part of the POW/MIA table, a secular tribute to America’s POW/MIA community. We apologize to the Veterans, families and other stakeholders who were offended by the facility’s incorrect removal of this Bible.""Mike Berry, chief of staff and director of military affairs for First Liberty Institute, which represents the veterans group who donated the memorial table, has also released a statement:“POW/MIA Remembrance displays have a long, cherished history in our nation. Veterans organizations like the Northeast POW/MIA Network should be able to honor and remember those killed, captured or missing with a display that includes a Bible donated by a WWII veteran that represents the strength through faith necessary for American service members to survive.”Many veterans visiting the display had strong feelings on the issue.""It's a spiritual item that many of us veterans look to for support,"" Marine Guy Emerson said.

WASHINGTON — Senior officials at the Environmental Protection Agency disregarded the advice of their own scientists and lawyers in April when the agency issued a rule that restricted but did not ban asbestos, according to two internal memos.

Because of its fiber strength and resistance to heat, asbestos has long been used in insulation and construction materials. It is also is a known carcinogen. Last month’s rule kept open a way for manufacturers to adopt new uses for asbestos, or return to certain older uses, but only with E.P.A. approval.

Andrew Wheeler, the E.P.A. administrator, said when the rule was issued that it would significantly strengthen public health protections. But in the memos, dated Aug. 10, more than a dozen of E.P.A.’s own experts urged the agency to ban asbestos outright, as do most other industrialized nations.

“Rather than allow for (even with restrictions) any new uses for asbestos, E.P.A. should seek to ban all new uses of asbestos because the extreme harm from this chemical substance outweighs any benefit — and because there are adequate alternatives to asbestos,” staff members wrote."

"State Department pushed 'false connection' for Trump-Russia investigation, Andrew McCarthy says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/state-department-pushed-false-connection-for-trump-russia-investigation-andrew-mccarthy-says,"The State Department helped push a false narrative that led to the opening of the Trump-Russia investigation, according to former U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy.

In an opinion piece for National Review, McCarthy said a key takeaway from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation relates to a conversation Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos had with an Australian diplomat that led to the FBI launching its counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign.

Mueller found Papadopoulos told the diplomat, Alexander Downer, the Russians had damaging information on Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election. But it wasn't until two months later, in July 2016 when WikiLeaks published stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, that Downer decided to reach out to the U.S. embassy in London about the conversation. This prompted the FBI's counterintelligence investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane, in July 2016.

But, as McCarthy noted, Papadopoulos never told Downer about emails, and Mueller's 448-page report ""provides no basis"" to show Papadopoulos knew the Russians planned to released damaging information about Clinton to boost Trump.

[Related: FBI may have used confidential sources prematurely: ex-official]

This resulted in the ""unfounded inference that the hacked emails must have been what Papadopoulos was talking about"" when they met in London in early May, McCarthy said. Despite it being a ""flawed assumption,"" McCarthy said it was all too eagerly accepted by the Trump-opposed Obama administration, which had been toying around with a theory, thanks to unverified reports from British ex-spy and dossier author Christopher Steele, that the Kremlin was in the tank for Trump.

""Downer’s flawed assumption that Papadopoulos must have been referring to the hacked DNC emails was then inflated into a Trump–Russia conspiracy theory by Clinton partisans in the Obama administration — first at the State Department, and then in the Justice Department, the FBI, and the broader intelligence community — all agencies in which animus against Donald Trump ran deep,"" McCarthy wrote.

The man who informed Papadopoulos of this ""dirt"" was Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, who has long been suspected of deep ties to Russian intelligence. Although Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, told investigators Mifsud talked to him about the Russians having ""thousands"" on Clinton emails, Mifsud denied to the FBI he knew or mentioned anything about emails and Mueller did not allege he had been untruthful.

[Also read: Devin Nunes: Clinton 'dirt' tipster Joseph Mifsud has ties to State Department]

McCarthy noted that Mueller never quoted Downer, instead ""disingenuously"" stressing the “suggestion” that Papadopoulos was referring to stolen emails. Furthermore, the emails to which Papadopoulos alluded were not the ones stolen from the DNC but rather emails that Clinton had stored on a unauthorized, private server during her time as secretary of state.

Thus, the State Department and FBI sought to ""distort"" what Papadopoulos told Downer.

""The State Department’s report to the FBI claiming that Papadopoulos had 'suggested' these things to Downer was manufactured to portray a false connection between (a) what Papadopoulos told Downer and (b) the hacking and publication of the DNC emails,"" McCarthy concluded. ""That false connection then became the rationale for formally opening the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation — paper cover for an investigation of the Trump campaign that was already under way."""
"New York attorney general sues Treasury Department, IRS over secrecy rules",https://www.salon.com,[],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.salon.com/2019/05/06/new-york-attorney-general-sues-treasury-department-irs-over-secrecy-rules/,"New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Monday that her office has filed a lawsuit against President Trump's Treasury Department and its subsidiary bureau, the Internal Revenue Service, for failing to respond to information requests.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, attempts to find out why the Trump administration eliminated an IRS rule that required some nonprofit organizations to disclose their donors.

Advertisement:

The revised reporting standard, announced in July 2018, scraps from federal and state filings a category of information the states rely on to ""identify potential control risks, self-dealing transactions, private inurement, and criminal conduct within the New York non-profit sector,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James said Monday in a statement.

James, alongside New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, sued the IRS and the Treasury for failing to respond to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed last October. Through the FOIA, James and Grewal sought to learn about the decision to implement the policy, which James claimed was made without public notice or comment. James said the Treasury and IRS failed to respond to the request within the prescribed time limit, adding that the revised reporting standard hinders the attorney general's ability to ""effectively regulate affected organizations operating in New York.""

""My office depends on these critical donor disclosure forms to be able to adequately oversee non-profit organizations in New York,"" James said Monday in a statement. ""Not only was this policy change made without notice, the Treasury and the IRS are now refusing to comply with the law to release information about the rationale for these changes. No one is above the law — not even the federal government — and we will use every tool to ensure they comply with these regulations to provide transparency and accountability.""

The change does not apply to 501(c)(3) tax-exempt groups, such as public charities and private foundations, James said, but does apply to thousands of 501(c)(4) groups, including social welfare organizations, labor unions and business groups.

James' office has a lawsuit pending against Trump's now-defunct personal charity over alleged self-dealing. She is also investigating the nonprofit status of the National Rifle Association. Monday’s lawsuit appears to have no direct relationship to those cases, although it signals another front in the feud between Democratic elected officials and the Trump administration."
Judge rules EPA must enforce Obama-era landfill pollution regs,https://thehill.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/442444-judge-rules-epa-must-enforce-obama-era-landfill-pollution-regs,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must begin enforcing pollution regulations that were set for landfills under the Obama administration.

Haywood Gilliam Jr., a U.S. district judge in Northern California, sided with California and seven other states late Monday, ordering the EPA to begin reviewing state plans for reducing pollution from landfills.

Landfills are the third largest source of methane pollution in the U.S., releasing the highly heat-trapping gas into the air as landfill contents decompose.

"Administration announces additional 30,000 seasonal worker visas",https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/06/politics/seasonal-worker-visas/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration is making an additional 30,000 seasonal worker visas available for 2019, according to a joint rule published Monday by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Labor.

The additional visas come on top of the visas already made available for the year.

The work visas, which allow employers to hire foreign workers for temporary, non-agricultural jobs, will only be available to workers who already received H-2B status in the past three fiscal years. Availability is also restricted to businesses who would ""suffer irreparable harm"" without the additional workers, US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced on Monday.

The increase was expected, as USCIS alerted Capitol Hill in April that it intended to make this decision and the rule would be forthcoming.

In March, a group of senators asked Homeland Security to raise the number of available visas above the 66,000 statutory annual cap. The demand for seasonal workers was ""so extreme"" this year that the Labor Department's website almost crashed, according to a letter sent to then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Here's what the 2020 Democratic race looks like after Joe Biden's post-announcement surge,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/heres-what-the-2020-democratic-race-looks-like-after-joe-bidens-post-announcement-surge,"A few months ago, I argued that it was pretty pointless to try and handicap the Democratic field without knowing Joe Biden's intentions. Now that the former vice president has entered the race and surged in the polls, what can we say about the state of the race?

One way to approach this is to look at what's happened to the leading rival campaigns following the Biden announcement. To do this I looked at the RealClearPolitics polling average for the top six Democratic candidates, directly before Biden's announcement and today. Once you go beyond those candidates and get into the low single digits, it's difficult to detect any sort of movement.

In a 20-plus candidate field, Joe Biden's 39% average is higher than Donald Trump's was until the GOP field had winnowed to three candidates in 2016. Biden has now polled at over 40 points in several recent polls, meaning his average is poised to rise as newer polls get cycled. But even as it stands now, it's impressive in a field of over 20 candidates. By comparison, Trump ran in a 17-person GOP field and surged to the lead in the polls in July 2015 within a few weeks of entering the race. But it took a long time for him to get to where Biden is currently polling. In fact, it wasn't until March 20 that he reached an average of 40% after winning 21 contests, including Florida, which drove Sen. Marco Rubio out of the race. By that point, it was just Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz, and John Kasich. Now that Biden has created distance, his rivals have to consider whether to all join together and aim fire at him, or whether they attack each other to arise as the leading alternative to Biden. It's quite early, but Biden is starting from a strong position and has proved himself resilient in the face of attacks on his ideology and history of inappropriate touching.

Bernie Sanders is crashing. The most clearly observable effect of Biden's entry into the race is that it's been accompanied by a precipitous fall in Sanders' support, from an average of 23% (about 6 points away from Biden) to an average of 15.5% (or nearly 24 points behind). A few weeks ago, he was being described as almost a co-leader, and now he's a distant second and closer to the rest of the pack than he is to Biden. He faces a difficult road, trapped between Biden and a pack of rivals who have also staked a claim to many of the policies that made him famous.

Elizabeth Warren may be edging out Kamala Harris. It's hard to know how much to attribute this to Biden or to other factors, such as Warren rolling out a number of policy proposals that have gotten good reviews from liberals, or Beto O'Rourke's fall (more on that later). But recent polls have indicated that Warren, while not exactly surging, seems to have closed the gap and inched ahead of Harris. Harris at one point had been as high as 12.3% after a successful launch. But Warren has managed to mainly hold steady and seems to be recovering from a short decline in the wake of O'Rourke's entry into the race. Right now, Warren is at 7.7% and Harris is at 7.2%, a barely discernible difference, but one that seems notable given that for awhile Harris was being treated in media coverage as the clearly stronger candidate. And maybe she will ultimately justify that coverage. But for now, it's Warren that seemingly is more on the upswing.

Beto O'Rourke is bombing, and Pete Buttigieg may be plateauing. After he set what had to be a record for adoring national profiles of a losing Senate candidate in 2018, O'Rourke immediately disrupted the Democratic race when he entered it. But he hasn't withstood his first round of tougher scrutiny. After having peaked at 9.5% last month, he's now down to 4.3%. With his initial sheen having worn off, it's difficult to see how he recaptures it. We'll need to see more polling before declaring the Buttigieg boomlet over, but it's at least safe to say he has hit a level of resistance. After the South Bend mayor came out of nowhere in polling to soar to 8.4%, he's started to come back to Earth, and lower numbers in recent polls have dragged his average down to 6.8%.

To be clear, this is an assessment of the race at this point in time, not a prediction of how things will look a year from now."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department threatened on Tuesday to completely withhold Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s unredacted report from Congress if House Democrats decide to move ahead with plans to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt.

The department said in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler any move by Democrats to hold Barr in contempt would compel Barr to “request that the President invoke executive privilege” over the unredacted materials in Mueller’s report that the Democrats previously subpoenaed."

In his first hearing since being sworn in as secretary, the Trump administration official frequently put the onus on lawmakers for responding to global warming. He said that while he believes in climate change, Congress has not directed him to respond to it.

“Isn’t this your job?” Bernhardt asked Rep.

Bernhardt told the committee that there are more than 600 instances in current laws where the secretary is directed that he or she “shall” do something. ADVERTISEMENT

“You know what there’s not – is a ‘shall’ for ‘I shall manage the land to stop climate change’ or something similar to that,” he said.

Bernhardt also discussed development of fossil fuels on public lands, saying he would not stop oil and gas development – including offshore drilling – without direction from Congress.

The Trump Cabinet official also clarified that his department will finish its five-year drilling plan, despite reports that it was indefinitely sidelined.

Bernhardt repeatedly emphasized that concerns from states would be paramount in making a determination at the federal level.

“I’m not aware of a single lease that was ever developed over the opposition of a state,” he said.

But Rep.

“We shouldn’t be afraid of information. If we can do it properly and it can be done responsibly, the data itself is not something we should be afraid of,” he said.

Some of the hearings most heated exchanges came in response to questions over Bernhardt’s ethics records.

Quigley repeatedly accused Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist who was confirmed to the administration last month, of acting in the interests of his former lobbying clients. Bernhardt responded that he was working for American interests.

Legislators have long questioned Bernhardt's industry ties given his background as a lobbyist, and Democrats have pushed for more details about how top staff keeps track of Bernhardt's calendar and meetings with industry representatives.

Bernhardt appeared Tuesday to discuss the Trump administration's budget for the Department of the Interior, which calls for a 14 percent cut to the agency – roughly $2 billion less than last year.

Mapping of public data shows PFAS-contaminated sites exist across the country

Jon Hurdle Bio Recent Stories Jon is an experienced journalist who has covered a wide range of general and business-news stories for national and local media in the U.S. and his native U.K. As a former Reuters reporter, he spent several years covering the early stages of Pennsylvania’s natural gas fracking boom and was one of the first national reporters to write about the effects of gas development on rural communities. Jon trained as a general news reporter with a British newspaper chain and later worked for several business-news organizations including Bloomberg News and Market News International, covering topics including economics, bonds, currencies and monetary policy. Since 2011, he has been a freelance writer, contributing Philadelphia-area news to The New York Times; covering economics for Market News, and writing stories on the environment and other subjects for a number of local outlets including StateImpact. He has written two travel guidebooks to the European Alps; lived in Australia, Switzerland, Israel, and Saudi Arabia, and visited many countries including Ethiopia, Peru, Taiwan, and New Zealand. Outside of work hours, Jon can be found running, birding, cooking, and, when weather permits, gardening in the back yard of a Philadelphia row home where he lives with his partner, Kate.

Seventeen sites in Pennsylvania have been contaminated by PFAS chemicals in recent years, and are still likely to contain at least some of the toxic material even if water supplies there have been treated by local authorities, according to data released by a national advocacy group on Monday.

Environmental Working Group compiled PFAS reports from local utilities, the Department of Defense, and researchers at Northeastern University, and presented the information in a national map showing public water systems, military bases, civilian airports, industrial plants and dumps where contamination has been found at various times since 2013.

The utilities include one in the eastern Pennsylvania town of Horsham where five PFAS chemicals, including PFOA and PFOS, were detected at more than 44 million parts per trillion (ppt) in 2014, thousands of times higher than a level recommended — but not required — by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as being protective of human health.

Environmental Working Group

Horsham officials say they have since cut PFAS levels to below the recommended health limit by installing carbon filters. Public and private water wells in the Horsham area have been contaminated with high PFAS levels because the chemicals were a component of firefighting foam used by the military on two nearby bases.

Aqua, an investor-owned utility that also serves Horsham Township, said on May 3 that the combined PFOA/PFOS level there was 10.8 ppt, well within the EPA limit of 70 ppt for those two chemicals. Aqua spokeswoman Donna Alston said all the company’s water systems in Bucks, Montgomery and Chester counties showed PFAS levels below the EPA’s threshold in the latest tests in March.

Although many utilities use the EPA’s PFOA and PFOS level as a benchmark, advocates say it’s too high to protect public health. For that reason, state scientists in New Jersey have recommended – and environmental officials are in the process of adopting – levels that are some five times lower than the federal standard.

In the EWG data, one of the bases, the former Willow Grove Naval Air Station at Horsham, had combined PFOA and PFAS contamination as high as 86,000 ppt, affecting 108 out of 161 wells on-base in testing during 2017, DoD data show. Public wells near the base had contamination of up to 1,000 ppt.

Other utility data show contamination well above the EPA’s health limit at Warminster and Warrington, two communities that have also been affected by PFAS chemicals from the military bases.

While utilities such as Horsham’s have largely removed PFAS from their systems since the samples were taken, the chemicals will still be present at some level because they don’t break down in the environment, said Bill Walker, vice president of EWG.

“When a water system is contaminated with PFAS, treatment will lower the concentration but not completely remove it. So the contamination is still there, just being treated at a cost to the water district and its customers,” Walker said.

U.S. House members tour site, urge action

In Fort Washington, Montgomery County on Monday, a panel of federal lawmakers and representatives of the EPA and the DEP faced questions from local officials and community activists demanding urgent action to clean up existing PFAS contamination.

U.S. Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania’s 4th District said the group visited the nearby Willow Grove base, where officials are storing some 4,500 tons of PFAS-contaminated soil that had been due for delivery to a landfill in New Jersey. But the contract was canceled by the landfill early this year after media reported that the shipment was planned.

Dean, a Democrat, said the Navy, which is trying to clean up PFAS from the base, has been unable to find anywhere else to take the soil, which is continuing to leak the chemicals into nearby waterways during heavy rains.

“There’s an enormous pile of polluted dirert covered with a tarp with really no plan to get rid of it,” she said.

Rep. Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat who co-chairs a Congressional task force on PFAS, said the federal government has been dragging its feet on protecting public health from the chemicals.

“There needs to be more urgency. It shouldn’t take years and years,” he said. “Especially the Defense Department has a unique responsibility as a polluter to clean up the mess they created.”

Rep. Paul Tonko, a Democrat from New York State who chairs the House Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee, accused the EPA of “punting” on the PFAS issue, and promised Congressional hearings this summer in the context of a number of bills that would regulate the chemicals in the absence of EPA action.

“We need targeted policy that will set goals and standards,” he said.

But in Pennsylvania, there appears to be little prospect of any bills becoming law in the Republican-controlled legislature, said State Rep. Ben Sanchez, a Democrat from nearby Abington.

“Frankly, I’m not optimistic about these things making much progress,” Sanchez said. “It’s a rejection of science in favor of business. It’s the priority of some in Harrisburg and it’s sickening.”

Group: Map shows scope, not severity, of contamination

EWG combined data from the three sources and presented it on the national map to show the widespread nature of the contamination rather than the severity of it, Walker said.

Nationally, there are now 610 sites in 43 states with PFAS contamination, the map shows. The last time the map was updated, in July 2018, there were 172 contaminated sites in 40 states. The two maps are not directly comparable because new data sources were added this time, but they show growing knowledge about a widespread national problem, EWG said.

EWG isn’t saying that every site on the map has water that’s unsafe to drink, but it does endorse research showing that PFOA and PFOS can harm human health at levels as low as 1 ppt, Walker said.

The chemicals, once used in consumer products like nonstick cookware and flame-retardant fabrics, are being increasingly regulated by states as more becomes known about their links to cancer and other health conditions including thyroid problems, low birth weights and elevated cholesterol.

In Pennsylvania, the Wolf administration said in February that it would begin to set its own health limits for PFOA and PFOS after the EPA declined to commit to doing so despite publishing an “Action Plan” that month to curb the chemicals.

Last September, Gov. Tom Wolf set up a panel of state officials to study the chemicals and recommend ways of curbing them. In April, the Department of Environmental Protection said it will begin sampling some 300 water systems around the state for six PFAS chemicals in a program that’s expected to take about a year.

In New Jersey, the state last year became the first in the country to adopt a tough standard for PFNA, a type of PFAS chemical, and is in the process of adopting low limits for PFOA and PFOS.

Kamala Harris asks DOJ IG to probe whether Trump asked Barr to investigate political opponents,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-doj-ig-bar-trump-political-opponents,"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Friday sent a letter to the Department of Justice’s inspector general demanding he investigates whether the White House had urged Attorney General William Barr to investigate President Trump’s political opponents.

“In response to my questions during the [Senate Judiciary] hearing, Attorney General Barr proved unable or unwilling to state whether he had been directed to open investigations at the request or suggestion of the President or other White House officials -- an alarming response that strikes at the very heart of the rule of law and threatens to undermine the longstanding independence of the Justice Department,” she said in a letter to Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

“I request that the Office of the Inspector General investigate whether the Attorney General has received or acted upon such improper requests,” she said.

The letter comes days after Harris questioned Barr Tuesday at the Senate hearing over details in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report that noted instances where Trump had either suggested or called for the Department of Justice to investigate Hillary Clinton.

Harris quizzed Barr whether Trump or anyone at the White House had asked him to investigate anyone -- an exchange it detailed in its letter to Horowitz.

In that exchange, Harris asked: “Has the President or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?”

“I’m trying to grapple with the word ‘suggest.’ I mean, there have been discussions of, of matters out there that, uh—they have not asked me to open an investigation,” Barr said.

When Harris asked if anyone had hinted, suggested or inferred, Barr said he didn’t know. Harris’ letter describes Barr as “unable or unwilling to answer the question.”

“There must be no doubt that the Department of Justice and its leadership stand apart from partisan politics, and resist improper attempts to use the power of federal law enforcement to settle personal scores,” she wrote.

The letter is the latest pushback from Democrats against Barr since the release of the Mueller report. In particular, they have zeroed in on Barr’s handling of the report’s release, alleging that he is biased toward the president in his presentation of the report in his initial four-page summary of its conclusions.

Harris criticized Barr’s decision not to personally review the underlying evidence before concluding that there was not enough evidence to establish that the president had committed obstruction of justice. She joined a number of Democrats saying that Barr should resign.

""This Attorney General lacks all credibility and has I think compromised the American public's ability to believe that he is a purveyor of justice,"" she told reporters after the hearing.

Former U.S. attorney in Cleveland among hundreds of former DOJ employees who say Trump would face felonies if he wasn’t president,https://www.cleveland.com,"['Eric Heisig', 'Eheisig Cleveland.Com']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.cleveland.com/open/2019/05/former-us-attorney-in-cleveland-among-hundreds-of-former-doj-employees-who-say-trump-would-face-felonies-if-he-wasnt-president.html,"CLEVELAND, Ohio — The former U.S. attorney in Cleveland joined hundreds of former Justice Department employees who signed a letter declaring that President Donald Trump would face criminal charges based on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report if he wasn’t in office.

Steve Dettelbach is one of several people with Ohio ties to sign the letter published Monday on Medium.

Also among those who signed on is Ann Rowland, a former federal prosecutor who worked on a corruption probe into Cuyahoga County government that lasted years.

The pair joined more than 730 former Justice Department employees who had signed the letter as of Wednesday evening. It reads as a rebuttal to statements made by Attorney General William Barr, who said there was “not sufficient” evidence to establish that Trump committed a crime.

“Each of us believes that the conduct of President Trump described in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report would, in the case of any other person not covered by the Office of Legal Counsel policy against indicting a sitting President, result in multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice,” the letter says.

Of the Ohio attorneys who signed on, Dettelbach is perhaps the most high profile. He served as U.S. attorney between 2009 and 2016 and was appointed by Barack Obama. Prior to his appointment, he worked as a prosecutor on white-collar and corruption cases, most notably securing convictions against former Cleveland mayoral aide Nate Gray and East Cleveland Mayor Emmanuel Onunwor.

The former U.S. attorney, a Democrat, ran for Ohio attorney general in 2018 and lost to Republican Dave Yost. Dettelbach is now a partner at the BakerHostetler law firm.

Rowland was an assistant U.S. attorney in Cleveland for 37 years. She worked on corruption cases for decades and was a lead prosecutor in the county corruption probe that led to convictions against former Commissioner Jimmy Dimora, Auditor Frank Russo and dozens of other government employees and contractors.

Other former federal prosecutors with Ohio ties who signed the letter include:

- Nathaniel Jones, who was an assistant U.S. attorney in Cleveland under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. He later worked as general counsel for the NAACP and served as a judge on the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for more than two decades. He is now of counsel at the Blank Rome law firm in Cincinnati.

- James Moroney, who was in U.S. Attorney’s Office in Cleveland for 30 years. During his time in the office, he did a stint as section chief of the national security unit. He now does some defense work.

- Subodh Chandra, who worked as a federal prosecutor from 1999 to 2002. He now runs The Chandra Law Firm in Cleveland, which has taken on several high-profile civil rights and criminal matters in recent years.

- Linda Barr, a federal prosecutor in Northeast Ohio who retired last year.

- Ann Marie Tracey, who worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Ohio. She later served as a judge in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court and was on Xavier University’s faculty.

- Kathleen Brinkman, who worked as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of Ohio for 24 years. She is now of counsel at the Porter Wright Morris & Arthur law firm in Cincinnati."

DOJ releases second redacted version of Mueller report over FOIA lawsuits,https://thehill.com,[],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/442400-doj-releases-second-redacted-version-of-mueller-report-over-foia,"The Department of Justice on Monday released a second redacted version of the Mueller report, but the document doesn’t appear to make public new details about the special counsel’s investigation and findings.

This redacted version of the report was released in response to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits filed by the privacy group Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) and BuzzFeed News reporter Jason Leopold.

Leopold noted on Twitter that while the lengthy report itself doesn’t seem to provide new public information, it does shed more light on why certain information was withheld.

It appears the version of the report is identical but clearly identifies what info was withheld in response to ongoing investigations, etc. — Jason Leopold (@JasonLeopold) May 6, 2019

While the initial version of the Mueller report released last month labeled redactions in categories such as “harm to an ongoing matter” and “grand jury information,” redactions in this version of the document are aligned with certain FOIA regulations.

Leopold also tweeted out a letter the Justice Department sent him that explains the redactions made to the report under FOIA.

The letter points to FOIA exemptions pertaining to national security, grand jury proceedings and ongoing law enforcement actions. It also cites exemptions that would reveal law enforcement tactics as well as information that could violate individuals’ right to privacy and right to a fair trial or other legal processes.

Attorneys for EPIC and Leopold said in court last week that they intended to challenge each redaction made under the FOIA law.

Justice Department attorneys argued that both parties should wait until they see this newly released version of the report, suggesting that they believed it was unreasonable for each redaction to be challenged, as some would not be overturned.

District Judge Reggie Walton, who is overseeing the case, has set a series of deadlines in the lawsuits that stretch into the summer, indicating that the case will not be fully resolved for several more months.

Walton, who was nominated by former President George W. Bush, said during last week's hearing that both parties have to make challenges to the redactions ""in good faith,"" noting that the government has the right to withhold information such as grand jury matters.

He has also said that he understands the desire to quickly move forward with the case.

EPIC is also suing under FOIA for the Justice Department to release the underlying evidence used to draft the Mueller report.

The privacy group reiterated in a blog post after the second version of the report was released on Monday that it still plans to challenge each redaction made to the document.

The EPA is meant to protect us. The Monsanto trials proves it isn't | Nathan Donley and Carey Gillam,https://www.theguardian.com,"['Nathan Donley', 'Carey Gillam']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/07/epa-monsanto-round-up-trial,"Ever since Monsanto introduced its line of Roundup weedkillers to the world in 1974, the products have been touted by the company and regulators as extremely safe. The EPA reiterated that stance last week.

But the emergence of long-held corporate secrets in three public trials has revealed a covert campaign to cover-up the pesticide’s risks and raised troubling questions about lax oversight of all pesticides by the Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory agencies that are supposed to be protecting public health.

Two recently concluded Roundup product liability trials in California have resulted in large damage awards against Monsanto, after juries found the company’s herbicides contributed to cancer and that it failed to warn of the risks. Closing arguments in a third trial under way now in Oakland, California, are expected this week. Revelations that have emerged from the trial testimony include:

* Monsanto never conducted epidemiology studies for Roundup and its other formulations made with the active ingredient glyphosate, to see if the products could lead to cancer in people who used them.

* At the same time as Monsanto was refusing to conduct long-term product safety studies, the company was spending millions of dollars on secretive PR campaigns – including $17m budgeted in a single year – to finance ghostwritten studies and op-eds aimed at discrediting independent scientists whose work found dangers with Monsanto’s herbicides.

* Several Monsanto scientists spent years putting together a sweeping paper that was published in a scientific journal in 2000, concluding Roundup posed no health risk to people. Internal emails show the team was applauded by corporate leaders for their hard work on the paper. But when the work was published in a scientific journal, no Monsanto employees were listed as authors. A company scientist referred to the paper internally as one the company had “ghost” written. Monsanto has denied that characterization. Regulators, including the EPA, have cited that paper as a reference in assuring consumers that Roundup is safe.

* Numerous other examples of Monsanto employee ghostwriting have surfaced. In one from 2013, a company scientist emailed co-workers about a manuscript he wrote that he hoped he could make appear to be authored from someone other than himself by finding a willing academic, then “turn it over to them and just be a ghost-writer”. The scientist said it would be best if the paper did not appear to have come from Monsanto. But he was concerned that faculty members “may not want to just take something they did not produce and slap their names on it”.

* When the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry sought to evaluate glyphosate toxicity in 2015, Monsanto expressed concern about what the agency might find and engaged the assistance of EPA officials to delay that review. The efforts delayed the release of the public draft of the review – originally to be issued three years ago – until earlier this month. Just as Monsanto had feared, the agency’s review found links between cancer and glyphosate.

* Although Monsanto was aware of tests showing how easily the chemicals in Roundup are absorbed into human skin, neither the company nor the EPA have warned consumers of a need to wear protective clothing.

* In the 1980s EPA scientists saw that mice dosed with glyphosate developed rare kidney tumors, which they said demonstrated cancer risks for people. But after protests from Monsanto, the EPA’s top brass overruled its own scientists and assured Americans that glyphosate poses no cancer risk.

Precisely because the chemical has been treated as so much safer than other pesticides, over the past 45 years glyphosate has become virtually ubiquitous: residues of the chemical have been documented in food, air, water and soil samples, as well as within the bodies of people who have never used the pesticide. The chemical has even been detected in raindrops.

It all raises this troubling question: if what has been touted as perhaps our “safest” widely used pesticide actually causes cancer, what assurance do we have about the hundreds of other pesticides that the EPA has assured us are safe?

For years the EPA has been called upon to fully ban the brain-damaging pesticide chlorpyrifos but has refused to do so, saying it is still evaluating the science. A federal appeals court recently ordered the EPA to make a final decision, noting the weighty scientific evidence showing the harm the insecticide does to children. The EPA has thus far refused to act but some states are not waiting. Hawaii passed a ban on chlorpyrifos last year. Now New York, Oregon and California are moving to do the same, trying to protect their residents if the EPA won’t.

Many European countries prohibit regulators from approving pesticides that are considered mutagens, carcinogens, reproductive toxicants or endocrine disruptors. But these same products in the US face little to no resistance from regulators.

Monsanto – which was purchased last year by Bayer AG – continues to assert glyphosate’s safety. But with more than 13,000 plaintiffs awaiting their own day in court, a California judge has ordered Monsanto/Bayer to enter into talks to consider settling the cases.

Meanwhile, the evidence revealed within the courtrooms has been resonating across the country as several cities, schools and neighborhoods are limiting or banning glyphosate and other pesticides. New York City council members have introduced legislation that would ban city agencies from spraying glyphosate-based herbicides and other toxic pesticides in parks and other public spaces. City commissioners in Miami voted in favor of a ban on glyphosate herbicides in February, and in March the Los Angeles county board of supervisors issued a moratorium on glyphosate applications on county property.

Harrell’s, a Florida-based turf, golf course and agricultural product supplier, stopped offering glyphosate products as of 1 March. And just as the spring planting season is getting under way, consumers are discovering that Roundup is no longer available at Costco, the retail giant that routinely ranks among the nation’s five largest.

It is heartening to see consumers and some cities and businesses stepping up to try to protect themselves from pesticides known to be harmful.

But until our elected leaders in Congress require the EPA to adopt more transparent, science-based practices that prioritize the health of Americans over industry profits, consumers should assume they’re on their own when it comes to protecting themselves and their families."
"WV MetroNews Manchin, Collins urge DOJ to drop support of Obamacare lawsuit",http://wvmetronews.com,['Alex Thomas'],05-07-2019,2019,5,http://wvmetronews.com/2019/05/07/manchin-collins-urge-doj-to-drop-support-of-obamacare-lawsuit/,"By Alex Thomas in News | May 07, 2019 at 9:52PM

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Two U.S. senators on Tuesday asked Attorney General William Barr for the Justice Department to drop its support of a ruling on the constitutionality of the federal health care law.

West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin and Maine Republican Susan Collins sent a letter to Barr as former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law faces a challenge from a coalition of states and the Trump administration that could mean the end of the Affordable Care Act.

“Overturning the ACA will put millions of Americans and hundreds of thousands of West Virginians and Mainers at risk of losing their health insurance, including thousands of our constituents who gained health insurance through the Medicaid expansion, and thousands more who gained insurance through the ACA exchanges,” the senators said.

“With so much at stake, we urge you and the administration to reconsider this position and to defend the consumer protections for seniors, young adults, women, children, and working families.”

Judge Reed O’Connor of the District Court for the Northern District of Texas ruled in December against “Obamacare” because of its individual mandate, which required people to purchase health insurance. O’Connor said the provision, which Congress eliminated in the 2017 tax law, was essential to the healthcare law.

A coalition of states including West Virginia is arguing against the law’s legal standing. Then-Maine Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, signed onto the lawsuit last year, yet then-state Attorney General Janet Mills declined further involvement. Mills, a Democrat, became governor in January.

The Justice Department in March came out in support of affirming O’Connor’s ruling.

Manchin and Collins told Barr millions of Americans would be at risk of losing their insurance coverage if the law is struck down, including people with pre-existing conditions and individuals who gained insurance coverage through state Medicaid expansion programs.

“It is also alarming that in the midst of the devastating opioid epidemic, millions of Americans suffering from substance use disorders would lose access to the treatment that they need to recover. It is no exaggeration to say that this is a matter of life and death to many of these Americans,” the senators wrote.

According to Manchin, around 800,000 West Virginians have a pre-existing condition. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources tweeted Monday less than 156,000 West Virginians are enrolled in the state’s Medicaid expansion program.

Other individuals who would be at risk of losing their insurance coverage includes young people still on their parents’ insurance plans.

“Congress can work together to fix legislatively the parts of the law that aren’t working, but we must not let this flawed court decision stand and devastate millions of seniors, young adults, women, children, and working families,” Manchin and Collins added. “We urge the administration and the Department of Justice to reconsider the decision not to defend the critical consumer protections that have provided healthcare to millions of Americans around the country.”

Over the last year, Manchin has led multiple Democratic attempts to get the Senate Legal Counsel to intervene in the lawsuit. Manchin and Collins in 2017 opposed attempts to repeal and replace the health care law, but Collins backed a proposal giving states the option to operate under the statute.

Collins voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, while Manchin opposed the legislation.

Both senators voted in February to confirm Barr as attorney general.

Manchin told MetroNews last month he plans to introduce with Collins a bill funding a reinsurance program for high-cost individuals. Collins previously backed a similar proposal with Florida Democrat Bill Nelson, who lost his reelection bid in the 2018 election cycle.

The state coalition and the Trump administration last week submitted briefs to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans supporting O’Connor’s ruling."

Copyright 2019 CNN U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin

(CNN) - After two missed deadlines, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is again due to tell House Democrats on Monday whether he plans to hand over President Donald Trump's personal tax returns.

A person familiar with Mnuchin's thinking told CNN to expect Trump's top finance chief, a close ally of the President, to ultimately reject the initial April 3 request from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to release six years of Trump's personal returns. It's unclear whether that denial would come on Monday or at a later point, the person said.

The fight is escalating as Trump has made increasingly clear that he expects his administration officials to fight requests from the opposing party.

Attorney General William Barr declined a Democratic request to testify last week in the House about special counsel Robert Mueller's report, a day after appearing in the Republican-controlled Senate.

Mnuchin has already told members of Congress that he's consulting with Justice Department lawyers about the returns.

Trump has refused to release his tax information, first as a candidate and now as president, breaking a precedent going back to Watergate.

Democrats initially directed their request to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, the only person with the legal authority to turn over the returns, but Mnuchin has interceded twice in the matter, citing his role overseeing the federal tax collector.

Mnuchin said in April he would deliver a response by May 6.

The Justice Department has declined to comment on the matter.

A decision by Treasury to deny the Democratic congressional request is widely anticipated to lead to a court fight -- which would be a rare example of Congress suing the executive branch for information.

A denial would come amid other maneuvers by the Trump administration to stonewall other Democratic committee chairman on everything from the Mueller report to interviews with former White House Counsel Don McGahn.

Neal made his initial request for Trump's tax information on April 3 after a months-long deliberation with staff, committee members and House lawyers. He also sent a follow-up letter demanding that Treasury comply with the request no later than April 23.

But Treasury missed the deadlines, a strategy Democrats have argued was an effort to delay the process.

Democrats on the tax-writing committee have argued that they have the ability to request Trump's personal tax information under an obscure statute that permits three people to request personal tax information of any individual: the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, the Senate Finance Committee chairman and the chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation.

The statute says that the secretary of the Treasury ""shall furnish"" it.

The statute has been used by Congress before, including in the Republican investigation under President Barack Obama into whether the IRS was discriminating against conservative groups applying for non-profit status. Requests for information using the law are also made on a regular basis for research purposes.

Neal has argued that he needs Trump's taxes in order to conduct oversight of the IRS's presidential audit program to both understand how the IRS is using the program and to see if the program needs to be codified into law.

But Mnuchin has asserted the ""unprecedented"" request raises ""serious constitutional issues"" that could have dire consequences for taxpayer privacy and has consulted with the Justice Department on the matter.

The Treasury secretary has also raised concerns that setting such a precedent could be ""potentially weaponizing"" the IRS.

The Massachusetts Democrat has previously indicated that defying his request would be interpreted as noncompliance and lead to an escalation of a standoff between the Trump administration and House Democrats.

""It is not the proper function of the IRS, Treasury or Justice to question or second guess the motivations of the committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns and return information,"" Neal wrote to Rettig in response to the missed deadline on April 23. ""Please know that if you fail to comply, your failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request.""

House Democrats haven't decided on their next move yet if Treasury denies their request. The committee chairman could issue a subpoena on top of his request. If the subpoena is denied they could then move ahead with a lawsuit.

They could also move to hold the Treasury Secretary or IRS Commissioner for whom the original request was addressed to in contempt of Congress.

In interviews last month, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News that there was no world in which Democrats would get the President's tax returns.

Democrats are up against a barrage of denied requests from the administration, forcing leadership into tough decisions about what oversight priorities are worth pursuing in court.

House Democrats are lodged in an all-out-battle with the Department of Justice after the agency refused to hand over an unredacted Mueller report by Wednesday's deadline. That was despite a subpoena from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler. Nadler has said he plans to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress if the report is not turned over in upcoming days.

Trump's personal lawyers also sued last week to block banks and an accounting firm from turning over Trump's financial records to the House Financial Services, House Intelligence and House Oversight Committees, a move that has led some Democratic chairs to question what the President has to hide.

""Whether it is refusing to sit down in an interview with Mueller or whether it is constantly obstructing justice by trying to stop testimonies and stop people from cooperating, whether it is filing a lawsuit, he obviously has something to hide,"" House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters said last week.

Waters's committee has subpoenaed at least 9 financial institutions with ties to the President.

""He's obviously afraid that we are going to learn more about his relationships with Deutsche Bank, more about his bank records, perhaps, more about whether or not there is money laundering that has been involved in some ways. We have enough information and we have enough to help us to guide us moving forward to help us with these subpoenas,"" Waters said."

Et May']",05-04-2019,2019,5,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/05/04/veteran-death-after-traumatic-injury-in-va-nursing-home/3402591002/,"CLOSE Surveillance video captured the deadly blow to the head of 91-year-old James “Milt” Ferguson Sr. Specialists say it could have been prevented. USA TODAY

Jim Ferguson wanted answers.

How was his 91-year-old father, who served in the U.S. Navy in World War II, fatally injured in a Veterans Affairs nursing home, the institution Ferguson had entrusted to care for him?

Huddled around a computer monitor with managers at the VA in Des Moines, Iowa, Ferguson watched a hallway surveillance video that depicted a chilling blow to his father's head.

“I lost it,” Ferguson told USA TODAY. “I broke down.”

In the video, James “Milt” Ferguson Sr., who had dementia and was legally blind, appears confused. He opens a hallway door, rolls his wheelchair into another resident’s room, then wheels back out. No staff members are visible. He circles around and heads back into the room.

Halfway through the door, his chair flips over backward. Milt Ferguson crashes to the floor, landing on the back of his head. Ferguson said he was told the chair was pushed over by the resident in the room, who can't be seen in the video. As staff members rush to assist him, Ferguson is able to turn over and sit up, but the impact causes a massive brain bleed that will kill him within days.

What later would turn the son’s despair into outrage was what he learned about events leading up to his father wheeling around unsupervised last December, and what happened after he smashed into the floor.

“It’s like my dad died at their hands,” Ferguson said.

Serious problems with resident care have occurred in many VA nursing homes across the nation, including the one where Ferguson was being cared for.

USA TODAY reported in March that inspections by a private contractor hired by the VA found deficiencies that caused ""actual harm"" to veterans at more than half of the 99 VA nursing homes reviewed. The inspections found inadequate supervision or hazardous conditions at 53 of them.

In Des Moines – which received the lowest one star out of five in the VA's own ratings, based on surprise inspections – inspectors found managers did not ensure staff treated residents with dignity or followed basic infection-control and prevention measures.

The story of what happened to James Ferguson in Des Moines provides a deeper picture of the care one elderly veteran received. Medical records provided to USA TODAY by his son and legal guardian outline what specialists say was a concerning series of decisions by VA staff, before and after his deadly head injury.

Nine days before, VA caregivers determined Ferguson was a danger to himself and others because his dementia caused him to wander around, agitated. They had him on continuous one-on-one observation with an aide, but took him off the strict monitoring when he entered the VA nursing home. There, staff didn't reinstate the heightened observation, despite his repeatedly straying dangerously into other residents' rooms.

After his injury, staff put him back in his wheelchair but did not report the incident to a supervisor for 40 minutes, the records and surveillance video indicate. Ferguson wasn't transported to an emergency room for two hours after that. Then, it took 2½ hours more to send him to a trauma hospital. The time stamp on the video showed the fall occurred at 3:49 p.m. and it wasn't until just before 9 p.m. that Ferguson was transported to the trauma facility.

'A disaster waiting to happen'

Specialists who reviewed Ferguson's medical records at the request of USA TODAY expressed concern about the quality of his care.

""It was definitely a disaster waiting to happen, and it did,"" said Robyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a Washington-based nonprofit advocacy organization.

""I just am really struck by the predictability with his repeated episodes of going into other people's rooms,"" she said. ""They should have had some intervention so they could provide him with adequate supervision and address the wandering.""

Grant said the length of time it took afterward to adequately evaluate and diagnose the severity of his injury and get him to a trauma facility also raises questions. ""What was happening there, in terms of those delays?"" she said.

VA nursing homes: Feds find 'blatant disregard' for veteran safety

Richard Mollot, executive director since 2005 of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a New York City-based nonprofit advocate of nursing home care improvement, said the shortfalls indicate there was ""very likely"" a lack of skilled or adequately trained staff to meet his needs.

""The point of being in that environment is that you have skilled nursing care and monitoring,"" he said.

Mollot said the reporting delay is particularly concerning. ""How often does this happen that no one's looking at? That's what is so upsetting.""

'All staff acted properly'

A spokesman for the Des Moines VA, Timothy Hippen, said in a statement that a review after the ""untimely death"" concluded ""all staff acted properly.""

""Any time an unexpected death occurs, VA Central Iowa Health Care System reviews its policies and procedures to see if changes are warranted,"" he said. ""We did that here, finding that all staff acted properly.""

In response to questions about the case, national VA spokesman Curt Cashour accused USA TODAY of focusing on ""isolated complaints"" and ""cherry-picking the experiences of a handful of veterans to create the impression of a broad problem.""

Cashour maintained that, overall, VA nursing homes ""compare closely"" with non-VA facilities. More than 40,000 veterans rely on care at the agency’s 134 nursing facilities each year.

USA TODAY reported last year that about 70% of VA nursing homes scored worse than non-VA nursing homes on a majority of quality indicators tracked by the agency, which include rates of infection, serious pain and bed sores.

Hippen declined to respond to detailed questions about Ferguson's case.

""We will not be addressing the specifics of this case publicly, but we have been in direct contact with the veteran’s family to discuss their concerns,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson said he remains upset even though VA officials shared the surveillance video with him and said they were sorry about what happened to his father.

He wants VA staff held accountable. He wants to make sure policies are in place so it doesn't happen to anyone else.

“No one should live their life like that and have what happened to him in the end,” he said. “I want this to be the last person this happens to.”

A gambler called ‘booger’

Even as his dementia worsened, Milt Ferguson flashed glimmers of his younger self.

The former deckhand on the heavy cruiser U.S.S. Pensacola was affectionately known as “booger” at the Des Moines Register, where he worked bundling newspapers for 23 years before retiring in 1995. He loved to play the slots and the horses.

On a note in his medical record, a nurse practitioner wrote: “Patient laughs when his nickname is mentioned.” Jim Ferguson had come for a visit that day, as he did most days. “He was smiling and appeared to be enjoying his son’s company,” the medical record said.

The decision to place him in a nursing home had been a gut-wrenching one, Ferguson said. He had moved in with his parents and cared for them for three years. But in April 2018 his mother died. He said a VA social worker told him his father needed more intensive, round-the-clock care and supervision.

“They made it sound like, well, if he got hurt, I could be charged with a crime,” Ferguson said. “So that’s when I decided to place him in a nursing home.”

‘His dementia was acting up’

Ferguson moved his father to Bishop Drumm Retirement Center, a private facility just outside Des Moines, where his mother worked as a nursing assistant in the Alzheimer’s unit for more than 20 years before retiring.

The center took in Milt Ferguson last August. But three months later, his condition worsened.

""The day before Thanksgiving, I got a call from Bishop Drumm – his dementia was acting up,"" his son said.

He hit two staff members, was “agitated all day” and was “wandering into other residents room(s), causing distress,” a nurse later noted in his medical record. “He is generally ‘sweet’ so this is a departure from his usual behavior.”

Ferguson was taken by ambulance to the Des Moines VA Medical Center, where he was admitted to the acute psychiatry ward. He was put on one-on-one observation with a sitter – an aide tasked with intervening if he lashed out or tried to stray into other patients’ rooms.

They adjusted his medications, and, after a few aggressive outbursts, he appeared calm enough after three weeks to transfer into the VA nursing home on the medical center’s campus.

But there was a catch, a psychiatric nurse wrote in his record: ""Veterans are not put on sitter status over there.""

‘Help me, help me’

After a 22-hour trial period without a sitter, Milt Ferguson moved in to the VA nursing home.

Problems began within hours.

He hardly slept, he hallucinated, he called out ""help me, help me"" over and over again. He was agitated and again, he ""wandered into and out of peers rooms"" day after day, nursing staff wrote in his record.

They gave him medication. Sometimes he calmed down. Sometimes he didn’t.

A psychiatrist was managing his case remotely. According to public records, the doctor worked at a VA facility a few hours away in Lincoln, Nebraska. Through virtual appointments, the psychiatrist advised changes to Ferguson's medication.

On December 19, a week after Ferguson moved in, nursing home staff noted he was still restless and anxious, pacing and screaming and yelling. His care team – psychiatrist, primary care doctor, nursing staff and social workers – met to discuss the case.

The psychiatrist said a review of his records showed ""increased confusion with wandering"" during the past week. The doctor prescribed higher dosages of a mood-stabilizing drug and a sedative. There was no discussion of closer supervision or reinstatement of one-on-one observation, the records show.

“Will ask RN to contact this MD in one week with update,” the psychiatrist wrote.

By then, Ferguson would be dead.

‘A golf ball-sized lump’

On December 20, when two aides rushed to help Milt Ferguson, his head on the floor and legs crumpled to the side, the time stamp on the hallway surveillance video reads 3:49 p.m. But in a report filled out an hour later, a nurse recorded the time of the accident as 4:30 p.m.

His records do not indicate what the staff did with Ferguson during the 41 minutes in between, aside from putting him back in his wheelchair.

By that time, he had a “golf ball-sized lump on the back of his head.” The nurse notified the manager on duty, a nurse practitioner, who wrote at 5:06 p.m. that he had ordered an immediate CT scan of his head.

That didn’t happen until about 6:30 p.m., when Ferguson arrived in the emergency department of the medical center on the Des Moines VA campus, on a bed wheeled by a nursing home aide. The aide said Ferguson had earlier been taken for a CT scan but was uncooperative.

An emergency room doctor quickly had a sedative administered and the scan was completed. By that point, the World War II veteran had a “large bleed” in the back right side of his brain that was so acute, the CT report says his brain had shifted to the left inside his skull.

Sent 'to scanning’

The doctor notified MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center, a trauma hospital, at 7 p.m. For nearly two hours, the doctor tried to keep Ferguson comfortable and his blood pressure under control until an ambulance arrived and took Ferguson to Mercy at 8:55 p.m.

The doctor also kept calling Ferguson’s son, leaving voicemails.

But Jim Ferguson had himself been admitted to a hospital and had provided the VA nursing home with a consent form authorizing staff to contact a close friend if anything happened to his father. That form had been sent ""to scanning” that morning.

When Jim Ferguson retrieved all the voicemails, he rushed to Mercy the next morning.

""He was not responsive. He was laying on his bed, making this horrible noise as they sucked saliva out of his mouth,"" he said. ""I never even got to say any last words to my dad.""

He died the next day.

Specialists who reviewed the case at the request of USA TODAY singled out multiple shortfalls in his care at the VA that may have affected the outcome.

Grant, the policy director at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, said the 22-hour trial of having no sitter was ""not enough time to establish how he was doing.""

When he then acted out day after day, in agitation and confusion, they should not have allowed him to wander into other residents' rooms, she said. Such situations can cause the other residents to lash out in fear or distress and ""lead to an altercation or violence or striking out.""

""One would argue that could have been prevented,"" she said. ""There should have been somebody, somewhere who could have seen that this happened and – particularly when he wheeled himself – to have gone in and intervened, 'Let me help you, let's go to your room.'""

Mollot, the executive director at the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said meeting the standards of care means staff identifies risks and needs and ways to meet them and mitigate them and then does so consistently.

""This is exactly the kind of thing that happens when those standards are not followed,"" he said.

'A safe place'

The spokesman for the Des Moines VA, while declining to answer detailed questions about what happened, said that in general, ""caring for nursing home residents involves balancing patients’ independence with the need for supervision, as appropriate.""

""While tight scrutiny and strict limits on residents’ activities and freedom of movement could possibly lower the risk for adverse events, it would also severely degrade patients’ quality of life, which is precisely what we are trying to preserve for as long as possible,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson still has his father’s wheelchair in the garage. He keeps the sweatshirt his father was wearing when he last used the chair. Ferguson has retained a lawyer, Brad Biren, to help him figure out next steps and how to hold the VA accountable.

“Somebody didn’t watch my dad and let him die,” he said. “It’s supposed to be a safe place.”

Energy Secretary Rick Perry: It is time for America to boost its dominance in artificial intelligence,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Rick Perry', 'Matthew J. Belvedere']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/07/rick-perry-it-is-time-for-america-to-boost-its-dominance-in-artificial-intelligence.html,"When America agreed to stop underground testing of nuclear weapons, supercomputers from the U.S. Department of Energy provided the precise and sophisticated simulations necessary to ensure the arsenal's ongoing effectiveness.

When scientists sought to model the universe's evolution, they brought their data to the experts and supercomputers at DOE.

When studying cancer, interpreting mammograms, and improving vaccination campaigns and diagnoses for Americans from children to veterans, DOE computers have been crucial to success of researchers seeking to deliver precision care to patients.

The quiet contributions of these incredible machines have solved some of the world's toughest problems and kept the U.S. at the forefront of high-performance computing for decades. They are developed and operated by some of the most gifted scientists in the world. These computers will also fuel America's efforts to maintain the Nation's global leadership in artificial intelligence.

While the United States leads the world in AI capabilities today, China is gaining ground. The government in Beijing has invested in and backed AI efforts in China with one goal in mind: to overtake the United States and dominate the AI world.

Thankfully, we have a president who is committed to ensuring that doesn't happen. That is why he recently issued an executive order creating the government-wide American AI Initiative. The president wants to ensure this innovation occurs in the United States.

The executive order calls for increased access to federal data, models and high performance computing resources for America's AI researchers.

I am proud that some of those resources and computers live at our DOE National Labs, where we currently possess five of the 10 fastest supercomputers in the world, including the top two fastest and the world's top AI supercomputer.

Through this executive order, the president has given DOE and other agencies a mandate to further utilize our world-class high performance computing infrastructure to build upon and accelerate America's existing AI research. We are ready for the challenge.

DOE computing capabilities will be critical to securing America's dominance in artificial intelligence. That is why we must take these already high-performance capabilities to the next level.

I am excited to announce today that along with Cray and AMD, DOE will be building Frontier, a new exascale system at Oak Ridge National Lab, or ORNL.

Exascale systems are capable of at least a billion-billion calculations per second, which means they are at least 10 to 20 times faster than today's fastest supercomputers, and 50 to 100 times more powerful – the equivalent of going from a flip phone to a smart phone or from a dialup to a 4G internet connection.

DOE has committed to building not just one, but three exascale machines at its National Labs: Frontier at Oak Ridge in Tennessee, Aurora at Argonne in Illinois, and El Capitan at Lawrence Livermore in California, all of which we expect to deploy around 2021-22.

With exascale capability, researchers will be able to look deeper and see further than they ever have before. They will develop better answers to more complex questions and meet more complex challenges with greater precision and speed.

Expected applications include identifying next-generation materials like exotic alloys for the defense, aerospace and energy sectors; determining optimal cancer treatments based on a patient's unique genetics; refining earth system models to more reliably assess water cycles and agricultural impacts; deciphering high-energy physics data; and accelerating industrial product design.

DOE-fueled AI work is already being used to optimize grid security and increase energy efficiency – among a host of other energy-related applications. It is also being used to reduce traffic jams, strengthen cybersecurity, predict extreme weather, improve emergency response and even develop better treatments for cancer and traumatic brain injury.

DOE's systems have used machine learning to search through a billion combinations of drugs to find those predicted to maximally inhibit a given tumor, to search through a billion hypothetical compounds to identify those with potential as new drug development candidates, to design new materials, to develop new algorithms to manage electric grid operations.

We must use our supercomputing capabilities to fully develop the potential of AI. That's why we are coordinating those efforts across our National Labs, and have stood up an AI program at DOE.

Those are the stakes in AI and exascale computing.

The competition from China is great, but America is the world's leader, and has never shied away from a challenge … and it always thrived when exploring new frontiers.

DOJ sues West Virginia governor's coal companies for $4.8 million,https://www.wdbj7.com,"['Siobhan Mcgirl', 'Eddie Callahan']",,,,https://www.wdbj7.com/content/news/US-sues-coal-companies-in-Virginia-and-other-states-for-47-mill-in-penalties-for-violating-Federal-Mine-Safety-and-Health-Act-509598671.html,"The Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, and his family are under fire with the federal government. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) filed a civil suit Tuesday for nearly $4.8 million dollars in unpaid fines.

The Department of Justice is alleging that 23 companies, either associated with or owned by Justice or his children, have racked up thousands of safety violations over the course of the last five years.

According to a press release from the DOJ, between May 3, 2014 and May 3, 2019, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has filed 2,297 or more citations against the coal companies in Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, and Kentucky.

“As alleged in the complaint, the defendants racked up over 2,000 safety violations over a five-year period and have, to date, refused to comply with their legal obligations to pay the resulting financial penalties,"" said U.S. Attorney Thomas T. Cullen in a press release Tuesday. ""This is unacceptable, and, as indicated by this suit, we will hold them accountable.”

According to the DOJ, the civil penalties were referred to their office in Sept. 2018 after the Department of Treasury made several failed attempts to collect the money. A representative for the DOJ says the companies still failed to pay the debts and continue not to pay both the old and newly assessed penalties.

The US is seeking judgment against the companies for $3.9 million and an additional $821,386.03 in administrative costs and interest, according to the release.

An attorney for James C. Justice Companies told WDBJ7 that his office has been trying to resolve the matter for several months and claimed that many of the penalties were incurred previously when the operations were owned by a Russian company.

""The Justice companies are disappointed that the US Attorneys office has decided to follow this route at this time,"" said Mike Carey, a lawyer representing the James C. Justice Companies.

The Assistant Secretary of Labor for the MSHA said they stand with the DOJ in seeking to hold mine operators responsible.

“In the Mine Act, Congress was extremely clear on enforcement matters: Federal inspectors issue citations for safety and health violations, which carry a monetary fine,"" said Assistant Secretary Zatezalo in a press release Tuesday. ""Failure to pay penalties is unfair to miners who deserve safe workplaces, and to mine operators who play by the rules.”

Carey said that the Justice Companies intend to vigorously defend this case.
