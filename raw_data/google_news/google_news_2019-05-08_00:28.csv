Exclusive: Trump fixer Cohen says he helped Falwell handle racy photos,https://www.reuters.com,"['Aram Roston', 'Min Read']",05-08-2019,2019,5,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-falwell-exclusive/exclusive-trump-fixer-cohen-says-he-helped-falwell-handle-racy-photos-idUSKCN1SD2JG,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Months before evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr.’s game-changing presidential endorsement of Donald Trump in 2016, Falwell asked Trump fixer Michael Cohen for a personal favor, Cohen said in a recorded conversation reviewed by Reuters.

Falwell, president of Liberty University, one of the world’s largest Christian universities, said someone had come into possession of what Cohen described as racy “personal” photographs — the sort that would typically be kept “between husband and wife,” Cohen said in the taped conversation.

According to a source familiar with Cohen’s thinking, the person who possessed the photos destroyed them after Cohen intervened on the Falwells’ behalf.

The Falwells, through a lawyer, declined to comment for this article.

Cohen, who began a three-year prison sentence this week for federal campaign violations and lying to Congress, recounted his involvement in the matter in a recording made surreptitiously by comedian Tom Arnold on March 25. Portions of the recording — in which Cohen appeared to disavow parts of his guilty plea — were first reported April 24 by The Wall Street Journal.

The Falwells enlisted Cohen’s help in 2015, according to the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking, the year Trump announced his presidential candidacy. At the time, Cohen was Trump’s confidant and personal lawyer, and he worked for the Trump Organization.

The Falwells wanted to keep “a bunch of photographs, personal photographs” from becoming public, Cohen told Arnold. “I actually have one of the photos,” he said, without going into specifics. “It’s terrible.”

Cohen would later prove successful in another matter involving Falwell, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Cohen helped persuade Falwell to issue his endorsement of Trump’s presidential candidacy at a critical moment, they said: just before the Iowa caucuses. Falwell subsequently barnstormed with Trump and vouched for the candidate’s Christian virtues.

Reuters has no evidence that Falwell’s endorsement of Trump was related to Cohen’s involvement in the photo matter. The source familiar with Cohen’s thinking insisted the endorsement and the help with the photographs were separate issues.

Cohen’s connection to the Falwells sheds light on the formidable alliance between Trump and a man who, through his university, is one of the most influential evangelical figures in America. Falwell’s backing helped galvanize evangelicals and persuaded many Christians concerned about Trump’s past behavior to embrace him as a repentant sinner.

Falwell’s support for Trump has not wavered throughout the New York celebrity-politician’s own tribulations, including the Access Hollywood recording of Trump talking about grabbing women’s genitals and payoffs made by Cohen to hide Trump’s extramarital affairs. This past weekend, Falwell tweeted that “Trump should have 2 yrs added to his 1st term” to make up for the two years of the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

BLOCKBUSTER ENDORSEMENT

Falwell’s endorsement of Trump, however, did surprise some students and staff at Liberty University, the school in Lynchburg, Virginia, founded by Falwell’s father, Jerry. It was at Liberty where fellow Republican presidential candidate and major Trump rival Ted Cruz had chosen to launch his campaign the previous year. Cruz’s father was an evangelical preacher, much like Falwell’s father; Trump has been married three times and divorced twice. For years, prior to running for president, Trump boasted of his sexual exploits and supported a host of social positions, such as abortion rights, that run counter to beliefs espoused by Falwell.

Although Falwell declined interview requests for this story, he has said repeatedly that he endorsed Trump because Trump was the strongest candidate, had significant experience running a business, and had the right vision for the country.

The connection between Trump and Falwell goes back years. In 2012, Trump gave the convocation at Liberty University. One link between Trump and the couple appears to have been Cohen, a now-disbarred New York lawyer who formed a close bond with the Falwells.

During the campaign, Cohen worked closely with Liberty University to help promote Trump’s candidacy. It was around that time that Cohen heard from the Falwells about the photographs, said the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking.

The Falwells told Cohen that someone had obtained photographs that were embarrassing to them, and was demanding money, the source said. Reuters was unable to determine who made the demand. The source said Cohen flew to Florida and soon met with an attorney for the person with the photographs. Cohen spoke with the attorney, telling the lawyer that his client was committing a crime, and that law enforcement authorities would be called if the demands didn’t stop, the source said.

The matter was soon resolved, the source said, and the lawyer told Cohen that all of the photographs were destroyed.

Months later, in early 2016, Trump faced what seemed like an enormous challenge. The Iowa caucus was coming up, and Cohen — then deeply loyal to Trump — was concerned about how Trump would fare, the source said. Cohen felt Trump “was being slaughtered in that community,” and “didn’t want to see him embarrassed or, you know, without support,” said the source familiar with Cohen’s thinking. Cohen repeatedly reached out to Jerry Falwell, and pleaded with him to back Trump, the source said.

Soon after, according to this account, Falwell made his historic announcement. “I am proud to offer my endorsement of Donald J. Trump for President of the United States,” Falwell was quoted saying in a statement issued by the Trump campaign. “He is a successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.”"

Follow Her On Twitter']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-campaign-accuses-pelosi-of-warrantless-fear-mongering-with-2020-election-warning,"President Trump’s re-election campaign on Tuesday accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of “fear mongering” by suggesting Trump could try to remain in office if he loses in 2020.

“That’s ridiculous and nothing more than warrantless fear mongering to rile up her fringe base and the media,” Tim Murtaugh, Trump’s 2020 communications director, said in a statement.

PELOSI: TRUMP NEEDS TO LOSE SO DECISIVELY IN 2020 THAT HE WON'T CHALLENGE THE RESULTS

Murtaugh said Pelosi “might want to check in with Hillary Clinton and other Democrats who actually did lose, but still won’t accept the will of the voters in the presidential election of 2016 and governors races in Florida and Georgia in 2018.”

“There’s where the real denial is,” he said.

In a story published over the weekend by The New York Times, Pelosi expressed concern that Trump might not step down if defeated in 2020 by a slim margin, saying, “We have to inoculate against that, we have to be prepared for that.”

Pelosi urged Democrats to win big, so Trump can’t challenge the results.

But Republicans have pointed to comments from Democrats, including from 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who suggested she had the 2016 election “stolen” from her.

HILLARY CLINTON SUGGESTS ELECTION 'STOLEN' FROM HER, OTHER DEMS COULD SUFFER SAME FATE

“I think it’s also critical to understand that, as I’ve been telling candidates who have come to see me, you can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you,” the former secretary of state said during a speech in Los Angeles.

Clinton’s hardly the only prominent Democrat claiming to have been wrongly kept out of office. On Friday, Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams again claimed she won the state's 2018 gubernatorial race, despite losing to now-Gov. Brian Kemp.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Vanessa Gera/AP Vanessa Gera/AP

President Trump has granted a full pardon to former Army 1st Lt. Michael Behenna, who was convicted by a military court in 2009 for killing an Iraqi prisoner suspected of being part of al-Qaida. Behenna was initially sentenced to 25 years; he was released on parole in 2014.

Behenna, 35, was found guilty of unpremeditated murder in a combat zone for shooting Ali Mansur Mohamed in 2008. He said he acted in self-defense, and as the White House announced his pardon, it also said a U.S. Army appellate court had ""noted concern about how the trial court had handled Mr. Behenna's claim of self-defense.""

Mansur was killed during questioning about a roadside explosion that had killed members of a platoon under Behenna's command. In military court and in an interview last year, Behenna acknowledged that he had decided to question Mansur on his own, weeks after the Iraqi was initially released because of a lack of direct evidence that could tie him to the explosion.

Mansur was naked when he was shot; Behenna said the prisoner had tried to take his weapon. In his legal appeal, he also said that during the trial, prosecutors had withheld evidence from his defense attorneys.

The push to pardon Behenna, an Oklahoma native, was taken up by the most powerful politicians in his home state. Members of Congress offered their support, as did former Gov. Mary Fallin and state Attorney General Mike Hunter — who repeatedly asked Trump to pardon Behenna.

Hunter welcomed news of the pardon, issuing a statement that read, ""Behenna served his country with distinction, honor and sacrifice. He has admitted to his mistakes, has learned from them and deserves to move on from this incident without living under its cloud for the rest of his life.""

Behenna's family has worked vigorously on his behalf — and they are well-positioned to do so, with deep ties to law enforcement and the legal system. His father, Scott Behenna, has worked for both the FBI and Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. His mother, Vicki Behenna, is an attorney and former longtime federal prosecutor in Oklahoma City who has led the charge to help her son — first to win parole and then to gain a presidential pardon.

When that pardon finally came, Michael Behenna missed the White House's initial call to him because he was speaking to his father on the phone, according to The Oklahoman. Then he called the White House to speak to the president.

""My heart was beating fast,"" he told the newspaper. ""I had big ol' tears in my eyes. He said he'd heard about my case, and 'you have a lot of support behind you. Your case came highly recommended.' I'm choked up and I'm trying to say, 'Thank you very much.' ""

With his record cleared, Behenna no longer faces the restrictions that would have come with being on parole through 2024.

In addition to support within Oklahoma, the White House statement about Behenna's pardon mentioned other factors, from the Army Clemency and Parole Board reducing his sentence and granting him parole to some 37 military officers and others signing a brief supporting his claims.

The White House statement about his pardon added, ""Further, while serving his sentence, Mr. Behenna was a model prisoner. In light of these facts, Mr. Behenna is entirely deserving of this Grant of Executive Clemency."""

Former White House counsel Don McGahn is refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena for documents related to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, deferring to a last-minute instruction from the White House to disregard House Democrats' demands.

William Burck, McGahn’s attorney, said his client would defy the House Judiciary Committee’s subpoena for documents that were due Tuesday as part of the panel’s investigation into allegations that President Donald Trump obstructed justice.

“The committee seeks to compel Mr. McGahn to produce White House documents the executive branch has directed that he not produce,” Burck wrote in a letter, obtained by POLITICO, to House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.).

“Where co-equal branches of government are making contradictory demands on Mr. McGahn concerning the same set of documents, the appropriate response for Mr. McGahn is to maintain the status quo unless and until the committee and the executive branch can reach an accommodation,” Burck added.

The committee’s subpoena to McGahn also demanded that he testify publicly on May 21. A source involved in the negotiations said the White House’s request only applies to documents and is silent on whether McGahn would be permitted to testify in public later this month.

Nadler’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Democrats have argued that because McGahn already provided voluminous testimony and documents to Mueller — much of which has already been made public — executive privilege no longer applies.

But McGahn’s successor as White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, indicated to Burck earlier Tuesday that the White House considers documents in McGahn’s possession to be subject to executive privilege and that any discussion about sharing them with Congress should be between lawmakers and the White House.

“The White House records remain legally protected from disclosure under longstanding constitutional principles, because they implicate significant executive branch confidentiality interests and executive privilege,” Cipollone wrote to Burck on Tuesday. “For these reasons, the Acting Chief of Staff to the President, Mick Mulvaney, directs Mr. McGahn not to produce these White House records in response to the committee's April 22 subpoena.”

The White House intervention in McGahn’s testimony is the latest skirmish in a broader effort to defy Democratic investigators’ demands for documents and testimony that the president and his Republican allies have said amounts to a political witch hunt.

McGahn delivered some of the most damning testimony in Mueller’s investigation of whether Trump attempted to obstruct the probe of his 2016 campaign’s links to the Russian government.

His testimony, combined with notes from his deputy Annie Donaldson, portrayed a White House in chaos, a president fuming at the special counsel investigation and repeatedly attempting to disrupt the probe.

House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said on Tuesday that his committee is “still scheduled” to vote to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress on Wednesday, amid negotiations with the Justice Department over a subpoena for all of special counsel Robert Mueller’s findings and evidence.

Nadler’s pronouncement to reporters came after talks with DOJ appeared to be falling short of resolving the dispute. Another committee member, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), said “all systems go” when asked whether the panel still plans to vote on a contempt citation for Barr.

During a Democratic leadership meeting Tuesday afternoon, Nadler said he would move forward with the contempt vote unless he strikes a deal with DOJ, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Nadler also said during the meeting that the two sides were still exchanging offers, one of the sources said.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi was supportive of Nadler’s approach, saying “I think they’re trying to make an accommodation; we'll see.""

In an attempt to head off the contempt vote, the Justice Department offered some concessions to allow more congressional aides access to a less-redacted version of Mueller’s report. The department also offered to allow a select number of senior lawmakers to keep their handwritten notes on the report; just 12 members of Congress have been allowed access to the less-redacted version.

But the offer did not include allowing additional lawmakers to view the document, and those who would be able to see it would still be forbidden from discussing it or sharing their notes with colleagues — leaving a key demand from Democrats unresolved.

According to two sources familiar with Tuesday’s negotiating session, the Justice Department offered to allow each of the lawmakers to bring two staffers — instead of one — to view the less-redacted version.

Initially, the department said it would only allow top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary and Intelligence committees, in addition to House and Senate leaders of both parties, to view the less-redacted version.

The Justice Department also intends to continue shielding grand jury information. Democrats have urged Barr to join them in seeking a court order to release that information so that the committee can use it for its ongoing obstruction of justice investigation into President Donald Trump.

Meanwhile, the committee is still seeking testimony from Mueller himself and from former White House counsel Don McGahn, who is emerging as a central witness in the obstruction probe. McGahn earlier Tuesday refused to comply with the committee’s subpoena for documents related to that investigation after the White House instructed him to disregard House Democrats’ demands.

Nadler teed up the contempt vote on Monday after Barr signaled he would defy the panel’s subpoena for full, unredacted report and underlying evidence. Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd criticized Nadler last week in a letter indicating that the Justice Department would not comply with the subpoena, arguing that it amounts to an abuse of congressional authority. Democrats have accused the Justice Department of stonewalling their document requests and blasted Barr for what they said was an effort to spin Mueller’s findings.

But Judiciary Committee Republicans have defended Barr and argued that he made significant disclosures surrounding Mueller’s report that he was not legally obligated to make. They include releasing a public version of the report, offering the less-redacted report to senior lawmakers and offering to testify to Congress on it.

Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said Democrats’ posture toward talks with the Justice Department — by leaving contempt hanging over the negotiations — suggests they’re not interested in working with Barr.

“If you’re willing to have the conversation, then have the conversation. This is premature,” Collins said of the Democrats. “They’re trying to discredit [Barr] because they don’t want to have anybody believe what he says.”

The sources said two Justice Department officials attended the meeting, along with two Democratic Judiciary Committee staffers: Aaron Hiller and Norm Eisen. Three lawyers from the GOP side of the committee attended, too.

While the fight for access to the unredacted report has centered on the Judiciary panel, the House Intelligence Committee has also demanded the full report in addition to the foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information gathered throughout the investigation.

On Tuesday, a committee aide revealed that the Justice Department “has not produced any documents responsive to our requests and has not agreed to schedule any testimony, even after Chairman [Adam] Schiff and ranking member [Devin] Nunes sent a follow-up letter in late April, almost a month after the DOJ did not respond to their first letter.”

In that follow-up letter, Schiff and Nunes said that absent “meaningful compliance” by Thursday of this week, the committee would “have no choice but to resort to compulsory process” beginning on Friday.

State Department Continues Fight to Strip Gay Couple’s Two-Year-Old Son of Birthright Citizenship,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Scott Bixby'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/state-department-continues-fight-to-strip-gay-couples-two-year-old-son-of-birthright-citizenship,"Ever since twins Aiden and Ethan Dvash-Banks were born in Toronto in September 2016, they have shared everything—the same button nose, the same swoopy haircut, the same pug/terrier mix London. But for years, the U.S. State Department has fought an escalating legal battle to ensure that they don’t share one important thing: American citizenship.

Although Aiden and Ethan’s fathers, Andrew and Elad Dvash-Banks, have been married since 2010, only Andrew is an American citizen. While that would be enough for children in a heterosexual marriage to qualify for U.S. citizenship while born abroad, the State Department has held the Dvash-Bankses to a different standard, requiring the family to undergo DNA testing to establish that Aiden—but not Ethan—was the biological son of a U.S. citizen.

The boys’ parents sued, arguing in federal court that proving a biological connection between a child and a U.S. citizen parent isn’t required to extend birthright citizenship from a married parent to a child, and in February, the judge ruled in their favor.

“The basis for the State Department’s imposition of a biological requirement is its strained interpretation” of existing immigration law, U.S. District Judge John F. Walter wrote in a decision issued in February, dismissing the department’s attempts to institute a biological testing standard for the children of binational married couples “unilateral.”

But on Monday, the State Department appealed that decision, continuing a years-long bid to strip Ethan of his citizenship.

“Once again, the State Department is refusing to recognize Andrew and Elad’s rights as a married couple. The government’s decision to try to strip Ethan of his citizenship is unconstitutional, discriminatory, and morally reprehensible,” said Aaron C. Morris, executive director of Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBT people in the immigration system. Morris successfully argued in federal court that a policy requiring genetic testing for the children of same-sex binational couples created a new double standard for citizenship: one for the children of gay couples and one for the children of straight couples.

After the Supreme Court struck down a ban on federal recognition of same-sex marriage in 2013, the Department of Homeland Security issued a guidance declaring that “just as [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] applies all relevant laws to determine the validity of an opposite-sex marriage, we will apply all relevant laws to determine the validity of a same-sex marriage.”

In response to a request for comment on the appeal, and on whether it plans to require DNA testing of all binational married couples in order to establish a biological relationship and thereby to establish birthright citizenship, a State Department spokesperson said that the department “does not comment on pending litigation.”

Morris also noted that in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where the State Department has filed its appeal, the standard of using DNA testing to ensure a biological relationship between a child and a married U.S. citizen parent in order to confer citizenship has already been soundly rejected.

“This is settled law in the Ninth Circuit, which has already established that citizenship may pass from a married parent to a child regardless of whether or not they have a biological relationship,” Morris said.

Despite that precedent, Aiden and Ethan’s fathers are still deeply concerned with the State Department’s decision to appeal the case.

“We’re outraged that the State Department is so intent on harming our family and the LGBTQ community,” Andrew and Elad said in a statement. “The fight is not over, and we will not rest until our family is treated fairly and equally. Nothing can tear us apart. The four of us are unbreakable.”"
Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump,https://www.politico.com,"['Ryan Mccrimmon', 'Doug Palmer']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/agriculture-economists-leave-trump-1307146,"Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue's moves to limit his agency's research arm have led to a string of departures from the Economic Research Service, whose reports detail how farmers have been hurt by President Donald Trump's trade feuds. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Agriculture Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump Reports showing farmers hurt by the president’s policies have drawn the ire of top officials.

Economists in the Agriculture Department's research branch say the Trump administration is retaliating against them for publishing reports that shed negative light on White House policies, spurring an exodus that included six of them quitting the department on a single day in late April.

The Economic Research Service — a source of closely read reports on farm income and other topics that can shape federal policy, planting decisions and commodity markets — has run afoul of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue with its findings on how farmers have been financially harmed by President Donald Trump's trade feuds, the Republican tax code rewrite and other sensitive issues, according to current and former agency employees.

Story Continued Below

The reports highlight the continued decline under Trump’s watch in farm income, which has dropped about 50 percent since 2013. Rural voters were a crucial source of support for Trump in 2016, and analysts say even a small retreat in 2020 could jeopardize the president’s standing in several battleground states.

“The administration didn’t appreciate some of our findings, so this is retaliation to harm the agency and send a message,” said one current ERS employee, who asked not to be named to avoid retribution.

For example, two ERS researchers presented a paper at an economic conference in early 2018 that indicated the GOP tax overhaul would largely benefit the wealthiest farmers — generating negative press coverage that staff members said irked senior officials at USDA.

Then, in August, Perdue stunned members of the roughly 300-member research service by announcing plans to bring ERS under the control of USDA’s chief economist, who reports more directly to the secretary. Equally significant, he said the USDA would move the agency out of Washington to a location closer to the U.S. heartland.

Members of the agency were also caught off-guard last summer when Perdue’s office issued an internal memo directing ERS and other research branches to include disclaimers in their peer-reviewed publications stating that the findings were “preliminary” and “should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy” — seen as a way of watering down any unflattering data from the department’s own experts.

The move to uproot the agency has led to a brain-drain of experienced researchers. So far in fiscal 2019, non-retirement departures from the agency have more than doubled on an annualized basis compared to the previous three-year average, according to data collected by employees.

Six of the economists — made up of specialists in the agricultural economy, farm taxation and food programs with more than 50 years of combined experience at ERS — left the agency at the end of April, out of frustration with the relocation process or in some cases suspicion about Perdue’s efforts to reshape USDA’s research wing, according to coworkers. More are planning to leave in the coming months.

For his part, Perdue has said the relocation was motivated by his desire to save taxpayer dollars, bring the research service closer to major farming regions, and help attract economists who could be deterred by Washington’s high cost of living.

“I really have been a little surprised with the naysayers on this,” he said last month at a Senate Appropriations hearing, touting the move as a common-sense, cost-cutting measure.

Perdue’s office declined to provide information on the numbers of employees who’ve quit or respond to allegations of political interference in the research service.

But the secretary alluded to frustrations with the quality of USDA research in comments to POLITICO on April 30, saying that all decision-making in the department must be “fact-based.”

“In USDA, we want good scientific discovery,” Perdue said, when asked about the mandated research-disclosure language. “We want peer-based evidence there. We know that research, some has been found in the past to not have been adequately peer-reviewed in a way that created wrong information, and we’re very serious when we say we’re fact-based, data-driven decision makers. That relies on sound, replicatable science rather than opinion. What I see unfortunately happening many times is that we tried to make policy decisions based on political science rather than on sound science.”

Perdue and Trump made clear in their budget request in March that they wanted to reduce the scope of the ERS, eliminating “low priority research” into such politically sensitive areas as food stamps and environmental issues.

The White House blueprint called for slashing ERS staff levels by more than 50 percent, cutting the total number of positions from about 329 to 160.

The budget is unlikely to be approved by Congress, but members of the service say they’ve already seen the effects of Trump’s and Perdue’s preferences.

“Things like conservation, rural development, food assistance, have just been de-emphasized” in favor of the administration’s preferred topics, said one economist who left ERS because of the relocation plan.

Former ERS Administrator Susan Offutt, who oversaw the service under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, said the agency’s studies showing how USDA’s farm-subsidy programs disproportionately benefit wealthier farmers have been a “perennial irritant” to influential lobbying groups, but an “over-the-top reaction” to clamp down on such reports would be unprecedented.

“Of course, this is not the story the farm lobby wants to tell about struggling farmers,” said Offutt. “Controlling ERS would stop unflattering news about federal farm subsidies favoring high-income, high-wealth farm households from reaching the public.”

Lawmakers have complained that USDA has yet to provide a full cost-benefit analysis of its plan to move the office closer to the heartland. Republicans have increasingly supported the relocation plan, while House Democrats have filed legislation to block the move.

On Friday, the USDA announced three finalists for the new headquarters of the service and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which is also being moved out of Washington. The finalists are Kansas City, the North Carolina research triangle region and multiple locations in Indiana.

Perdue’s office has promised to release further data justifying the move when he announces a final site recommendation this month.

Within the service, skeptical employees view the secretary’s rationale for the move and the months-long site selection process carried out by accounting firm Ernst & Young as a smokescreen.

“The message we’ve been getting is, ‘The cost-benefit analysis doesn’t matter. Being close to stakeholders doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters for you is the fact that the secretary wants you to move, thinks it’s in your best interest, and that’s what we’re doing,’” said another senior ERS economist who declined to use his name for fear of retaliation.

Brian Stacy, a former ERS economist who left in February, said he thinks the move is a way for the administration to force out staff members and reduce the size of the ERS without congressional approval.

“Part of me wonders whether this relocation is just a way to get at that staff reduction,” Stacy said, referring to the president’s budget request. “I don’t know how else to read some of the moves being made.”

ERS employees are planning to vote on unionization on Thursday.

USDA intends to keep 76 ERS employees in Washington and relocate 253 positions to the new location, USDA senior adviser Kristi Boswell told a House Appropriations panel in March.

“This is the spiraling down of the fantastic work that the ERS has done for years,” said Sonny Ramaswamy, who headed the National Institute of Food and Agriculture under the Obama and early Trump administrations. “It’s one way to drain the swamp, as it were.”

Former Bush DOJ official on Mueller report fight: Dems 'want to put as many people in jail as they can',https://www.foxnews.com,['Charles Creitz'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mueller-report-democrats-want-trump-team-punished-tom-dupree-says,"Former deputy attorney general Tom Dupree said Tuesday that the Democrats plan to go ""to the mat"" in the aftermath of the Mueller report's release, and some in the party ""want to put as many people in jail as they can.""

Dupree, who served in the George W. Bush administration, said on ""America's Newsroom"" that Democrats are waiting to see how former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn will respond to an April 22 House Judiciary Committee subpoena to testify before Congress.

Earlier Tuesday, in a letter to Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the White House said it would block McGahn from producing documents demanded by the committee.

President Trump told Fox News in a recent interview that McGahn should not testify: ""They've testified for many hours, all of them. I would say, it's done,"" he told chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge.

WHITE HOUSE BLOCKS MCGAHN FROM PRODUCING DOCUMENTS SUBPOENAED BY HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

Dupree said that in regard to McGahn's testifying, if he ""follows White House's instructions ... the Democrats are not going away.""

""They have made clear that they want to put as many people in jail as they can. They want to just take them to the mat on this,"" Dupree said, adding that he foresees a possible legal battle between White House claims of executive privilege and Democrats' demand for disclosure.

""That ultimately will get propelled into a federal court for resolution,"" he said.

Host Julie Banderas asked Dupree whether Democrats may pursue contempt charges against McGahn if he does not comply with their demands.

""If McGahn refuses to appear and answer their questions, I suspect that will be the next card they will play,"" Dupree said.

""Clearly, the Democrats are zeroing in on 'Volume II' of the Mueller report,"" he added, referring to the section detailing the investigation into whether obstruction of justice occurred."
Pompeo Makes Unscheduled Trip to Iraq to Press U.S. Concerns About Iran,https://www.nytimes.com,"['Falih Hassan', 'Megan Specia', 'Rick Gladstone']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/world/europe/pompeo-cancels-berlin.html,"Mr. Pompeo’s visit, shrouded in secrecy until after it was over, came on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Mr. Trump’s repudiation of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran and the reimposition of American sanctions, which have been increasingly squeezing Iran’s economy. Iran said Monday it would no longer comply with parts of the agreement, alarming European officials who have hoped to preserve the accord, meant to ensure Iran’s peaceful use of nuclear energy.

The choreography of Mr. Pompeo’s Iraq stopover also appeared designed to send a message to Iran. Before he flew to Baghdad, the State Department said Mr. Pompeo, who had been in Finland, had abandoned a scheduled meeting in Berlin with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany because of unidentified “pressing issues.”

The Trump administration has not provided specific details about what it has called the new threat from Iran, which has drawn some skepticism, given the history of faulty intelligence that led to the Iraq war. But officials have told The New York Times that new intelligence has raised concerns about Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and its connections to some of Iraq’s Shiite Arab militias.

Asked by reporters to elaborate, Mr. Pompeo said, “I just don’t want to go into the details of that anymore.” But he also reiterated his contention that the Revolutionary Guards is a terrorist organization. “This was just calling out the truth,” he said.

It was Mr. Pompeo who last month placed the Revolutionary Guards on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations, against the advice of American intelligence and Pentagon officials, who warned that Iran’s clerical government could reciprocate and put United States personnel at risk in the Middle East.

Last week, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran declared all American forces in the Middle East terrorists and labeled the United States government a state sponsor of terrorism.

To counter what the Trump administration has described as the new threat, the Pentagon has expedited an already-scheduled deployment of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Persian Gulf."
US Dept. of Energy Announces Frontier Supercomputer: Cray and AMD to Build 1.5 Exaflop Machine,https://www.anandtech.com,['Ryan Smith'],,,,https://www.anandtech.com/show/14302/us-dept-of-energy-announces-frontier-supercomputer-cray-and-amd-1-5-exaflops,"The history of the computing industry is one of constant progress. Processors get faster, storage gets cheaper, and memory gets denser. We see the repercussions of this advancement through all aspects of society, and that extends to the top as well, where national governments continue to invest in bigger and better supercomputers. One part technological necessity and one part technological race, the exascale era of supercomputers is about to begin, as orders for the first exaFLOP-capable are now going out. It’s only fitting then that this morning the United States Department of Energy is announcing the contract for their fastest supercomputer yet, the Frontier system, which will be built by Cray and AMD.

Frontier is planned for delivery in 2021, and when it’s activated it will become the second and most powerful of the US DOE’s two planned 2021 exascale systems, with performance expected to reach 1.5 exaFLOPS. The ambitious system won’t come cheaply, however; with a price tag of over 500 million dollars for the system alone – and another 100 million dollars for R&D – Frontier is among the most expensive supercomputers ever ordered by the US Department of Energy.

The new supercomputer is being built as part of the US DOE’s CORAL-2 program for supercomputers, with Frontier scheduled to replace Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s current Summit supercomputer. Summit is the current reigning champion in the supercomputer world, with 200 petaFLOPS of performance, and accordingly the US DOE and Oak Ridge are aiming to significantly improve on its performance for the new computer. All told, Frontier should be able to deliver over 7x the performance of Summit, and is expected to be the fastest supercomputer in the world once it’s activated.

Like Summit (and Titan before it), Frontier is an open science system, meaning that it’s available to academic researchers to run simulations and experiments on. Accordingly, the lab is expecting the supercomputer to be used for a wide range of projects across numerous disciplines, including not only traditional modeling and simulation tasks, but also more data-driven techniques for artificial intelligence and data analytics. In fact the latter is a bit of new ground for the lab and the system’s eventual users; just as we’ve seen in the enterprise space over the past few years, neural network-based AI is becoming an increasingly popular technique to solve problems and extract analysis from large datasets, and now researchers are looking at how to refine those techniques from the current-generation systems and apply them to exascale-level projects.

US Department of Energy Supercomputers Frontier Aurora Summit CPU Architecture AMD EPYC

(Future Zen) Intel Xeon Scalable IBM POWER9 GPU Architecture Radeon Instinct Intel Xe NVIDIA Volta Performance (RPEAK) 1.5 EFLOPS 1 EFLOPS 200 PFLOPS Power Consumption ~30MW N/A 13MW Nodes 100 Cabinets N/A 3,400 Laboratory Oak Ridge Argonne Oak Ridge Vendor Cray Intel IBM Year 2021 2021 2018

Frontier: Powered by Cray & AMD

Officially, the prime contractor for Frontier will be Cray. But looking at the specifications, you could be excused for thinking it was AMD. Cray for its part is partnering with the chipmaker for the system, and as a result AMD is providing most of the core hardware for the new supercomputer. Designed as a next-generation CPU + accelerator system, with a mix of CPUs and GPUs doing the heavy compute work, AMD will be supplying both the CPUs and GPUs for Frontier. And as the principle processor provider, AMD will also be taking on a lot of the responsibility for developing the software stack as well, with the company working with Cray to develop an enhanced version of their ROCm environment to best extract performance from the massive cluster of CPUs and GPUs.

On the CPU side of matters, AMD will be supplying a customized next-generation EPYC CPU. AMD has confirmed that it’s going to be using a future generation of their Zen CPU cores, and given the timing of the project, we’re almost certainly looking at a Zen 3 or Zen 4 design here. Just how custom AMD’s CPU is remains to be seen, but their announcement has revealed that Frontier’s CPUs will include new instructions for the optimization of AI and supercomputing workloads.

Meanwhile on the GPU side of matters, AMD and Cray are holding their cards a little closer. Rather than naming any architecture or architectural generation, AMD is only saying that the GPUs are “based on the Radeon Instinct family” and have “yet to be announced.” AMD’s current public roadmap goes out to “Next Gen” in 2020, and with GPU development cycles averaging 2 years, this may be the architecture we see. But with the particular needs for a supercomputer, AMD may have something slightly more bespoke.

What the company is confirming for now is that they aren’t holding back on features. The HPC-focused GPU is being designed with Frontier in mind and will incorporate mixed precision compute support. Feeding the beast will be HBM memory, and AMD will be tapping a version of Infinity Fabric to connect the CPUs and GPUs.

In fact while AMD has kept the details on the technology light, it sounds like this version of IF will be the most advanced version yet. AMD is specifically noting that it’s an “incredibly” coherent fabric, calling it the first fully optimized CPU + GPU design for supercomputing. AMD’s GPUs and CPUs will be arranged in a 4-to-1 ratio, with 4 GPUs for each EPYC CPU. It’s worth noting that AMD’s slide shows a mesh with every GPU connected to the CPU and two other GPUs, but I’m not reading too much into this quite yet, as AMD hasn’t disclosed any other details on the IF setup.

With AMD going up to the blade level, tying together all of these nodes will be Cray’s job. For Frontier the supercomputer vendor is launching their new Slingshot interconnect, an equally ambitious interconnect that will support adaptive routing, congestion management, and quality-of-service features. Slingshot is capable of 200Gb/sec per port, with individual blades incorporating a port for each GPU in the blade so that other nodes can directly read and write data to a GPU’s memory. As a result Frontier will have a significant amount of interconnect bandwidth, which is all but necessary in order to allow the system to scale to exaFLOP levels.

Overall, Frontier will be organized into over 100 Cray Shasta cabinets. And while Cray has not announced a specific power consumption figure for Frontier, with each cabinet rated for 300KW, this would put the complete system at over 30MW. Which to put things in context, this is over twice the power consumption of the 13MW Summit. So while Frontier is a significantly faster system than the supercomputer it replaces, Cray, AMD, and the US DOE are all feeling the pinch of Dennard scaling slowing down, as power efficiency gains get harder to achieve. All told, in a passing comment made in the press briefing, it sounds like Oak Ridge will be installing a total of 40MW of capacity for Frontier, which is a significant amount of power to say the least.

Along with furthering the US’s own supercomputing leadership goals, securing the Frontier contract also represents big wins for Cray and AMD. Cray is now involved in both 2021 exascale systems, reinforcing their own place in the supercomputing world. Meanwhile for AMD, who is spending this current generation from the outside looking in, they have now secured a major and prestigious win for both their CPU and GPU divisions.

In fact it’s interesting to note that of the two 2021 exascale systems being ordered, both are coming from full-service processor vendors that supply both CPUs and GPUs. Current-generation systems like Summit use mixed vendors – e.g. IBM + NVIDIA – so the move to integrated vendors is a big shift for these CPU + accelerator systems. Clearly there are technological and procurement benefits to using a single vendor for all of the processors, which benefits both AMD and Intel. Though it’s worth noting that the CORAL-2 program requires the DOE to buy systems based on two different architectures, so if the future is integrated systems, then AMD and Intel are the logical choices.

At any rate, with the contract placed for Frontier, the job is only half-done. AMD and Cray will need to continue developing their hardware and software for the system, not to mention locking down the specific specifications for the finished supercomputer. So expect to continue to hear news about Frontier trickle out over the next couple of years, leading up to its installation in 2021."
VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas,https://www.politico.com,['Lorraine Woellert'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/va-mortgage-lenders-federal-subpoenas-1414318,"Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. | Charles Dharapak, File/AP Photo defense VA mortgage lenders hit with federal subpoenas

Federal investigators have issued subpoenas to several mortgage lenders that make loans to military veterans, seeking information on delinquencies and payments.

The investigation is being led by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General in cooperation with the U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, according to four people with knowledge of the subpoenas.

Story Continued Below

At least eight lenders, and likely more, have been asked to turn over hundreds of files on VA home loans made between 2013 and 2017, according to two people with knowledge of the request.

The requests include questions about quality control and loan audits.

Some VA lenders have drawn scrutiny from regulators after they sold short-term, adjustable-rate mortgages to military homeowners as interest rates climbed. One VA program in particular — the Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan, or IRRRL — allows lenders to put existing VA borrowers into new loans without an appraisal or underwriting and was ripe for abuse.

Michael Nacincik, a spokesperson for the Department of Veterans Affairs OIG, and John Marzulli, a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, declined to comment. Both said they could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation.

Jeffrey London, executive director of the VA’s Loan Guaranty Service, did not respond to requests for comment.

On Friday, Ginnie Mae said it was weighing whether to exclude some of those VA loans from its pooled securities in an effort to tackle a wave of rapid-fire mortgage refinancings that have left some military service members deeper in debt.

In a 14-page request for input, the government mortgage agency called the practice, known as churning, “unhealthy” for the agency.

The loan documents requested by investigators weren’t limited to IRRRLs, according to one person with knowledge of the subpoenas.

The VA subpoenas are landing as HUD is taking steps to rein in the prosecution of lenders who sell mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration.

Many of the nation’s largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, stopped offering FHA loans after the government, under former President Barack Obama, used the False Claims Act to extract billions of dollars in settlements from dozens of big lenders.

FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery, an appointee of President Donald Trump, has said those cases went too far and that the Trump administration is working with the DOJ to change how the False Claims Act is used against lenders."
William Barr Is Wrong: Robert Mueller Was Dead Right on Trump and Obstruction,https://www.thedailybeast.com,['Rebecca Roiphe'],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.thedailybeast.com/william-barr-is-wrong-robert-mueller-was-dead-right-on-trump-and-obstruction,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller is expected to testify before the House Judiciary Committee as early as next week. What will he answer when asked about perhaps his most controversial decision: to decline to reach a conclusion on whether President Trump criminally obstructed justice?

Attorney General Bill Barr and Special Counsel to the President Emmet Flood have made it clear that they consider this a fundamental failure on Mueller’s part. Mueller will likely explain that given the unique position of the president in the American constitutional system, his choice was not only defensible but also necessary.

In a newly revealed letter sent a day after the Mueller Report’s release, Flood argued to Barr that because the decision to charge is a fundamental aspect of a prosecutor’s job, Mueller’s failure to do so constituted a political act, dangerous and inappropriate for the Department of Justice, a body that is supposed to apply the law to fact in an even-handed and nonpartisan way. Barr echoed this argument in the hearing before the Senate last week, claiming that it fell to him to decide whether the evidence in the Mueller Report constituted criminal obstruction of justice. That, he explained, is the one role of prosecutors: to investigate and decide whether to prosecute. Because Mueller supposedly failed in this aspect of his mandate, Barr himself had to fill in.

Flood and Barr are wrong, because they, unlike Mueller, fail to understand that the special counsel’s job is different from that of ordinary prosecutors in a fundamental way. As Mueller explained in his report, the Office of Legal Counsel within DOJ has concluded that a sitting president is immune from criminal prosecution, stating “under our constitutional plan… only the Congress by the formal process of impeachment, and not a court by any process should be accorded the power to interrupt the Presidency or oust an incumbent.” Mueller took this seriously and adapted the normal prosecutorial function to facilitate this constitutional requirement.

“ Barr unnecessarily plunged the Department of Justice into a political firestorm by opining on the question of criminal obstruction. ”

The Constitution gives Congress the authority to hold the president accountable by impeaching him for treason, bribery, “high Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Historically, this term has not been limited to or even defined by the penal code. It is a term of art that most historians believe denotes a serious abuse of power. By declining to determine whether or not Trump committed criminal obstruction, Mueller left it to the constitutionally appropriate branch to decide whether the conduct outlined in his report amounted to such an abuse.

But Congress cannot impeach and the American public cannot judge the president’s conduct without an accounting of the facts. So, the question remains, how to ensure that Congress can draw on the service of professional prosecutors to determine the facts necessary to carry out its constitutional obligation?

Our system of government has struggled to answer this question. In 1978, shortly after the Watergate scandal, Congress enacted the Ethics in Government Act, which created a congressional independent counsel whose job it was to investigate crimes by top executive officials. This post was held by Ken Starr, among others. The Supreme Court upheld this law but Congress nonetheless let it sunset amid concerns that the independent counsel was unaccountable to the American people. The special counsel regulations, pursuant to which Mueller was appointed, were a compromise, an effort to enlist an independent prosecutor in uncovering improper acts by top executive officials while maintaining checks on his work through limited oversight by the attorney general.

The special counsel regulations thus provide that an attorney general or his deputy can appoint a special counsel when the department itself has a conflict of interest and when the public interest so requires. The regulations go on to state that the special counsel must comply with DOJ policy and in his judgment, report periodically to the attorney general. As such, a special counsel is insulated from political influence but not unmoored entirely from accountability.

The role of the special counsel is to uncover facts in a neutral way so that the country can have faith in the outcome of the investigation and, if appropriate, Congress can deliberate on whether the evidence constitutes an impeachable offense. Where evidence falls in a gray zone in which prosecutorial judgment must be called upon, a conclusion that the evidence supported criminal obstruction would not bear on Congress’s ultimate work, as the impeachment inquiry is independent of whether a prosecutor deems he has sufficient evidence to prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Nor would it be of any practical moment, as no actual charges could have been brought against the president by virtue of his office. And as Mueller explained, the facts did not allow him to exonerate Trump of obstruction charges. Despite all this, Barr felt the need to weigh in anyway.

No doubt if Mueller had engaged in what OLC called the “unavoidably political act” of rendering judgment on Trump’s criminal obstruction, the president and his allies would have accused Mueller of partisanship, by virtue of his drawing gratuitous conclusions. Pundits and politicians would have echoed Trump’s rhetoric and insisted that Mueller was engaged in a “witch hunt.” By declining to reach a conclusion on obstruction, Mueller managed to avoid such accusations and preserve the legitimacy of his investigation and the DOJ in general without depriving Congress of the information it needed to fulfill its constitutional duty.

Mueller’s understanding of the unique constitutional status of a president as the subject of prosecutorial investigation becomes obvious when we consider his report’s other major finding: the evidence did not establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russians. That aspect of the investigation looked at many members of the campaign other than the president. And there was no constitutional bar to Mueller’s deciding whether those persons should be prosecuted. But the obstruction question related to the president alone, mandating a different approach.

Instead of following Mueller’s lead in preserving the investigation’s constitutional role, Barr unnecessarily plunged the Department of Justice into a political firestorm by opining on the question of criminal obstruction.

To be sure, by handing over the lightly redacted results of Mueller’s investigation to Congress, Barr served the purpose of the Constitution and special counsel regulations. But, by making his own call on criminal obstruction, Barr made a serious error. These regulations were specifically designed to remove the investigation of high executive officials from political appointees who may have a conflict of interest. Any decision by such appointees would lack credibility. The public would assume they were politically motivated. Barr is precisely such a political actor. His proximity to Trump makes any decision regarding the facts or law of the investigation suspect. By weighing in on an irrelevant point of law, Barr has done much to undermine the purpose of the special counsel and reverse the careful work of Mueller to uphold his mandate and the Constitution itself."

The list includes the exotic -- Romania gold coin, a dozen small gold-covered Zodiac figurines -- as well as the more quotidian -- an assortment of books, 24 avocados, a box of dates, some pens and bath soaps.

Ross, who has been caught napping during the president's speeches and during meetings, also received three bottles of instant coffee. And he's been presented with a ""giant-print"" reference Bible. Another gift giver settled on the classic choice of champagne - a 2006 bottle of Dom Perignon (which can be found online for about $130 to $150).

The gift list reveals hints of who, at home and abroad, may be trying to curry favor with Ross, who took office in February 2017.

The Commerce Department provided few details about who sent the gifts and their value, but some descriptions point to foreign governments in China, Thailand, Mexico, Canada, South Korea, Ghana, Uzbekistan, Japan, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates.

Other gifts include an AmCham (American Chamber of Commerce) crystal business card holder, and a ""thumb drive with Secretary Ross speech and some other ceremony highlights from Tenaris Day."" Tenaris is a pipe supplier for oil and gas companies.

As Commerce Secretary, Ross plays a key role in crafting U.S. trade policy and amplifying American products and industries.

""Any of the gifts that indicate that they are made of gold or silver--that would suggest that they have some significant and intrinsic value,"" said Virginia Cantor, chief ethics counsel for the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""You definitely need transparency in order to be able to determine whether it would present a potential conflict of interest.""

A Commerce Department spokesperson tells CBS News high-value gifts are appraised and sold, according to federal regulations on gifting limits.

Ross has previously faced criticism for financial disclosure inaccuracies and concerns about his compliance with conflict of interest laws.

USA TODAY

WASHINGTON – A nonprofit group has tapped a veteran to sue the Department of Veterans Affairs over a Bible displayed at a VA facility in New Hampshire, arguing it violates the Constitution’s prohibition of government establishment of religion.

The Bible, carried by a prisoner of war in World War II, is part of a display in the lobby of the VA medical center in Manchester, New Hampshire, commemorating missing and imprisoned service members.

Mikey Weinstein, the founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, said the group is filing the suit on behalf of New Hampshire veteran James Chamberlain.

Weinstein, who declined to make Chamberlain available for an interview, said the VA is a federal agency and its display of the Bible is an “outrage.”

“That is stamping it with the approval of raising one faith over all the others,” he said. “From our perspective, it’s a repugnant example of fundamentalist Christian triumphalism, exceptionalism, superiority, and domination, and it cannot stand.”

His group has been successful in pushing for the removal of Bibles from similar displays at other VA and military facilities in recent years, including in Buffalo, New York; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and Denver, Colorado, according to correspondence on the foundation’s web site.

The foundation was initially successful at the Manchester VA Medical Center. The facility removed the Bible after receiving a complaint about it in January but then replaced it. The Bible is now in a plastic case on the display table.

VA: The Bible stays

“Manchester VAMC officials temporarily removed the Bible from the display out of an abundance of caution,” VA spokeswoman Kristin Pressly said in a statement provided to USA TODAY. “Following that removal, Manchester VAMC received an outpouring of complaints from Veterans and other stakeholders – many of whom dropped off Bibles at the facility – in protest of this action.”

Pressly said that after consulting with lawyers, the facility determined the Bible will stay and “remain indefinitely as part of the missing man display, a secular tribute to America’s POW/MIA community.”

“We apologize to the Veterans, families and other stakeholders who were offended by our incorrect removal of this Bible,” she said.

National VA spokesman Curt Cashour criticized the lawsuit as ""nothing more than an attempt to force VA into censoring a show of respect for America’s POW/MIA community.""

""Make no mistake: VA will not be bullied on this issue,"" he said.

Weinstein is not only pressing the matter in court. He said his group has hired a plane to fly a banner over the medical center Tuesday urging the facility to “Honor all POW/MIA – Remove Bible.”

The lawsuit says plaintiff Chamberlain is a former Air Force pilot and a “devout Christian” who believes the Bible should be removed.

“As a Christian, he respects and loves all his military brothers and sisters and does not want to be exclusionary by placement of the Christian Bible,” the complaint says.

Weinstein said 14 veterans contacted the Military Religious Freedom Foundation about the Bible, but they declined to be identified by name because they feared retaliation from the VA where veterans receive medical care.

The suit seeks a permanent injunction requiring the VA to remove the Bible and the payment of attorney fees for the plaintiff.

The display is part of a “missing man table,” a tradition of setting up an unoccupied table with several symbolic items to remember troops missing in action or prisoners of war, according to the National League of POW/MIA Families.

They include a lighted candle signifying continued concern for their return, and a Bible, which the National League says signifies “the strength gained through faith to sustain us and those lost from our country, founded as one nation under God.”

Ann Mills-Griffiths, chief executive and chairman of the league, called the foundation’s efforts to have Bibles removed from displays “absurd and stupid.” She said those who have removed them under pressure from the group are “politically correct cowards.”

“It’s not our freedom that would be taken away by them deciding what should be on a missing man table?” Mills-Griffiths said. “That is the way we do it regularly, and this group continues to try to undercut any mention of God or In God We Trust, or you know, rewrite American history. Revisionist history is not high in my estimation no matter where applied.”

House Oversight Committee threatens salaries of Interior staff who block interviews,https://www.politico.com,"['Ben Lefebvre', 'Ryan Mccrimmon']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/07/interior-department-salaries-threat-1414201,"Chairman Elijah Cummings also complained that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations. | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo Energy & Environment House Oversight Committee threatens salaries of Interior staff who block interviews

The House Oversight Committee on Tuesday threatened to withhold the salaries of Interior Department officials who have blocked lawmakers from interviewing agency employees about whether Secretary David Bernhardt was complying with recordkeeping laws.

The committee’s threat ratchets up the pressure on Interior in the latest skirmish between House Democrats and the Trump administration over the lawmakers' complaints that agencies are withholding documents and ignoring requests to send senior officials to testify before Congress.

“Please be advised that any official at the Department who ‘prohibits or prevents’ or ‘attempts or threatens to prohibit or prevent’ any officer or employee of the Federal Government from speaking with the Committee could have his or her salary withheld pursuant to section 713 of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act,” Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said in a prepared statement.

Cummings also complained in the letter to Cole Rojewski, Interior's director of congressional and legislative affairs, that the agency ""does not appear to recognize that Congress is an independent and co-equal branch of government"" that is empowered to conduct its own investigations.

Oversight has sought interviews with Interior’s administrative assistant to the deputy secretary, scheduling and advance director, executive assistant to the office of the deputy secretary and acting chief of staff and associate deputy secretary. The committee asked Interior to respond to the interview requests by Friday.

Cummings is also using the the threat of withholding salaries to force Commerce Department officials to appear before it for interviews relating plans to add citizenship questions to the 2020 Census.

In his statement, Cummings pointed to a 2016 GAO report that said a department’s budget “appropriation was not available to pay the salary of a federal officer or employee who prevents another federal officer or employee from communicating directly with any member, committee, or subcommittee of Congress.”

Oversight and the National Archives and Records Administration are investigating allegations that Bernhardt was keeping meetings off his official calendars and not supplying information about meetings to the public.

Interior refused the committee’s previous requests to interview several staffers, telling Oversight that the interviews “are unnecessary at this time,” according to a letter the committee sent to Interior today.

At a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the Interior Department budget on Tuesday, Bernhardt defended preventing the employees from talking to the committee, saying ""it’s not the appropriate time"" for those interviews, and that his decision was designed to protect career employees.

“You’re talking about individual employees who have long standing in the department,” he said in response to questioning from Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.). “We have wonderful career employees here ... they’ve never had this happen to them in their careers.”

Lawrence shot back that Congress was responsible for oversight of the agency.

""You have been requested to comply. With all due to respect, you are required to comply,“ she said.

Besides refusing interviews, Interior has declined to provide documents the Oversight and House Natural Resources committees requested on March 13, according Cummings‘ letter. The department instead offered tens of thousands of pages of documents unrelated to the committee's request, the letter states.

Judge rules EPA must enforce Obama-era landfill pollution regs,https://thehill.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/442444-judge-rules-epa-must-enforce-obama-era-landfill-pollution-regs,"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must begin enforcing pollution regulations that were set for landfills under the Obama administration.

Haywood Gilliam Jr., a U.S. district judge in Northern California, sided with California and seven other states late Monday, ordering the EPA to begin reviewing state plans for reducing pollution from landfills.

Landfills are the third largest source of methane pollution in the U.S., releasing the highly heat-trapping gas into the air as landfill contents decompose.

Gilliam said the EPA was long overdue in meeting its obligations and ordered the agency to review state proposals and begin promulgating regulations by fall.

“Once again, we’ve held the EPA accountable for its failure to perform its mandatory duties under the Clean Air Act, and for its unwillingness to protect public health,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra Xavier BecerraTrump administration creates new religious, moral protections for health workers Senators ramp up privacy bill work Inside California's fight against pollution MORE (D) said in a statement. “We celebrate this ruling requiring EPA to fulfill its long-overdue mandatory duties to control emissions from landfills.”

An EPA spokesman said they would review the decision.

In October of 2018, the agency again announced a delay, giving states until August of this year to submit their methane reduction plans.

Becerra argued the EPA had no legal basis for delaying implementation and enforcement of the regulation.

Gilliam, an Obama appointee, has sided against the Trump administration a number of times over the past two years, including Trump’s emergency declaration for the border wall and rollback of contraception requirements under the Affordable Care Act."
"State Department pushed 'false connection' for Trump-Russia investigation, Andrew McCarthy says",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/state-department-pushed-false-connection-for-trump-russia-investigation-andrew-mccarthy-says,"The State Department helped push a false narrative that led to the opening of the Trump-Russia investigation, according to former U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy.

In an opinion piece for National Review, McCarthy said a key takeaway from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation relates to a conversation Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos had with an Australian diplomat that led to the FBI launching its counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign.

Mueller found Papadopoulos told the diplomat, Alexander Downer, the Russians had damaging information on Hillary Clinton, Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election. But it wasn't until two months later, in July 2016 when WikiLeaks published stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee, that Downer decided to reach out to the U.S. embassy in London about the conversation. This prompted the FBI's counterintelligence investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane, in July 2016.

But, as McCarthy noted, Papadopoulos never told Downer about emails, and Mueller's 448-page report ""provides no basis"" to show Papadopoulos knew the Russians planned to released damaging information about Clinton to boost Trump.

[Related: FBI may have used confidential sources prematurely: ex-official]

This resulted in the ""unfounded inference that the hacked emails must have been what Papadopoulos was talking about"" when they met in London in early May, McCarthy said. Despite it being a ""flawed assumption,"" McCarthy said it was all too eagerly accepted by the Trump-opposed Obama administration, which had been toying around with a theory, thanks to unverified reports from British ex-spy and dossier author Christopher Steele, that the Kremlin was in the tank for Trump.

""Downer’s flawed assumption that Papadopoulos must have been referring to the hacked DNC emails was then inflated into a Trump–Russia conspiracy theory by Clinton partisans in the Obama administration — first at the State Department, and then in the Justice Department, the FBI, and the broader intelligence community — all agencies in which animus against Donald Trump ran deep,"" McCarthy wrote.

The man who informed Papadopoulos of this ""dirt"" was Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud, who has long been suspected of deep ties to Russian intelligence. Although Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, told investigators Mifsud talked to him about the Russians having ""thousands"" on Clinton emails, Mifsud denied to the FBI he knew or mentioned anything about emails and Mueller did not allege he had been untruthful.

[Also read: Devin Nunes: Clinton 'dirt' tipster Joseph Mifsud has ties to State Department]

McCarthy noted that Mueller never quoted Downer, instead ""disingenuously"" stressing the “suggestion” that Papadopoulos was referring to stolen emails. Furthermore, the emails to which Papadopoulos alluded were not the ones stolen from the DNC but rather emails that Clinton had stored on a unauthorized, private server during her time as secretary of state.

Thus, the State Department and FBI sought to ""distort"" what Papadopoulos told Downer.

""The State Department’s report to the FBI claiming that Papadopoulos had 'suggested' these things to Downer was manufactured to portray a false connection between (a) what Papadopoulos told Downer and (b) the hacking and publication of the DNC emails,"" McCarthy concluded. ""That false connection then became the rationale for formally opening the FBI’s Trump-Russia investigation — paper cover for an investigation of the Trump campaign that was already under way."""

"As EPA stalls, 43 states have water sites contaminated with toxic chemicals",https://thinkprogress.org,[],,,,https://thinkprogress.org/water-toxic-chemicals-pfas-states-2f68b1c6b7f3/,"Toxic chemicals found in nonstick cooking pans and other household items have contaminated more than 600 water sources across at least 43 states, according to a new report, with Michigan by far the most impacted.

The findings underscore the wider water crisis facing the United States and are likely to increase pressure on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to enact stricter limits on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), toxic chemicals that can increase the risk of cancer and other severe health problems.

New analysis published Monday by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) and Northeastern University finds that 610 water sources across the country contain PFAS. The water systems include drinking water sources that serve upwards of 19 million people, along with military and industrial sites, dumps, and airports. PFAS itself is found in everything from firefighting foam to rain jackets.

Using data from sources including the federal Safe Drinking Water Information System and the Pentagon, the authors mapped the nationwide prevalence of PFAS. The version released Monday reflects an updated map — the last version was released in July 2018 and found 172 contaminated sites in 40 states. And it is likely that the new report still doesn’t account for many contaminated sites around the country.

“We believe the locations shown on our map may be only the tip of a toxic iceberg,” said Bill Walker, EWG vice president and editor in chief, in an email to ThinkProgress.

CREDIT: EWG

Michigan, a state grappling with ongoing water crises, stands out as the most severely impacted state. The updated map identifies 192 contaminated sites in Michigan alone, the vast majority of which are drinking water sources.

An ongoing lead contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan, is the state’s most well-known water problem. The city’s residents say that five years after their water first became contaminated, they are still experiencing health impacts associated with Flint’s water, like rashes and headaches. But PFAS has also become a problem in the state — last July, two communities in Kalamazoo County were given bottled water after their drinking source was found to contain dangerously high levels of the chemicals.

Under scrutiny over water issues in the aftermath of Flint, state officials have been hard at work testing the water for chemicals in an effort to identify the scope of the PFAS problem. That work has been critical; EWG credited a multi-agency effort overseen by the state as helping to identify impacted areas. Michigan environmental officials have said there may be as many as 11,000 PFAS-contaminated sites in the state.

According to the new report, California comes in second after Michigan with 47 known sites, while New Jersey is third with 43 sites. But Walker of EWG told ThinkProgress that without efforts like those underway in Michigan, gauging the full scale of the problem is a challenge.

“Most other states have not conducted the kind of comprehensive multi-agency detection effort that Michigan has,” he said.

For years, communities in states like West Virginia and Pennsylvania have struggled with staggering cancer rates and other health problems, trends residents now link to PFAS exposure. They have repeatedly lobbied for the EPA to act and several told ThinkProgress in March that they feel the agency is not doing enough — even as EPA officials argue the agency is taking the crisis seriously.

In February, then-Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler unveiled an “action plan” to tackle PFAS following more than two decades of alarm from impacted communities. But Wheeler’s announcement failed to establish a Maximum Containment Level (MCL) for PFAS in drinking water, something advocates say is critical to addressing the crisis. Currently, the agency has a non-enforceable health advisory level of 70 parts per trillion that applies to only two types of PFAS: PFOA and PFOS. Health experts have said that PFAS chemicals could pose a risk to humans at much lower levels.

Moreover, a draft of interim recommendations for PFAS cleanup released in April was panned by EWG and other groups as “woefully inadequate,” in no small part because it relies on the 70 parts per trillion guidance. The recommendations also do not legally require the Pentagon or the chemical industry to clean up contaminated sites. According to the Defense Department, at least 126 military bases have reported possibly harmful PFAS levels, and EWG identifies 117 military sites on its map. Chemical companies like DuPont are meanwhile associated with mass-PFAS contamination in areas like Parkersburg, West Virginia.

EPA testing has also historically set a level for detection that EWG says is too high. According to Walker, “more than 100 million Americans could have PFAS in their water supplies” if the detection level reflected the lower points at which studies have show averse health effects to occur.

It is unclear when or if the EPA will address such discrepancies. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-PA) last week introduced a bill that would require the agency to create a drinking water standard for all PFAS chemicals. But the bill would give the EPA two years to do so — a timeline unlikely to appease communities currently struggling with contamination."
"Administration announces additional 30,000 seasonal worker visas",https://www.cnn.com,['Geneva Sands'],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/06/politics/seasonal-worker-visas/index.html,"(CNN) The Trump administration is making an additional 30,000 seasonal worker visas available for 2019, according to a joint rule published Monday by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Labor.

The additional visas come on top of the visas already made available for the year.

The work visas, which allow employers to hire foreign workers for temporary, non-agricultural jobs, will only be available to workers who already received H-2B status in the past three fiscal years. Availability is also restricted to businesses who would ""suffer irreparable harm"" without the additional workers, US Citizenship and Immigration Services announced on Monday.

The increase was expected, as USCIS alerted Capitol Hill in April that it intended to make this decision and the rule would be forthcoming.

In March, a group of senators asked Homeland Security to raise the number of available visas above the 66,000 statutory annual cap. The demand for seasonal workers was ""so extreme"" this year that the Labor Department's website almost crashed, according to a letter sent to then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

"New York attorney general sues Treasury Department, IRS over secrecy rules",https://www.salon.com,[],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.salon.com/2019/05/06/new-york-attorney-general-sues-treasury-department-irs-over-secrecy-rules/,"New York Attorney General Letitia James announced Monday that her office has filed a lawsuit against President Trump's Treasury Department and its subsidiary bureau, the Internal Revenue Service, for failing to respond to information requests.

The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, attempts to find out why the Trump administration eliminated an IRS rule that required some nonprofit organizations to disclose their donors.

The revised reporting standard, announced in July 2018, scraps from federal and state filings a category of information the states rely on to ""identify potential control risks, self-dealing transactions, private inurement, and criminal conduct within the New York non-profit sector,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James said Monday in a statement.

James, alongside New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, sued the IRS and the Treasury for failing to respond to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request filed last October. Through the FOIA, James and Grewal sought to learn about the decision to implement the policy, which James claimed was made without public notice or comment. James said the Treasury and IRS failed to respond to the request within the prescribed time limit, adding that the revised reporting standard hinders the attorney general's ability to ""effectively regulate affected organizations operating in New York.""

""My office depends on these critical donor disclosure forms to be able to adequately oversee non-profit organizations in New York,"" James said Monday in a statement. ""Not only was this policy change made without notice, the Treasury and the IRS are now refusing to comply with the law to release information about the rationale for these changes. No one is above the law — not even the federal government — and we will use every tool to ensure they comply with these regulations to provide transparency and accountability.""

The change does not apply to 501(c)(3) tax-exempt groups, such as public charities and private foundations, James said, but does apply to thousands of 501(c)(4) groups, including social welfare organizations, labor unions and business groups.

James' office has a lawsuit pending against Trump's now-defunct personal charity over alleged self-dealing. She is also investigating the nonprofit status of the National Rifle Association. Monday’s lawsuit appears to have no direct relationship to those cases, although it signals another front in the feud between Democratic elected officials and the Trump administration."

Energy Secretary Rick Perry: It is time for America to boost its dominance in artificial intelligence,https://www.cnbc.com,"['Rick Perry', 'Matthew J. Belvedere']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/07/rick-perry-it-is-time-for-america-to-boost-its-dominance-in-artificial-intelligence.html,"When America agreed to stop underground testing of nuclear weapons, supercomputers from the U.S. Department of Energy provided the precise and sophisticated simulations necessary to ensure the arsenal's ongoing effectiveness.

When scientists sought to model the universe's evolution, they brought their data to the experts and supercomputers at DOE.

When studying cancer, interpreting mammograms, and improving vaccination campaigns and diagnoses for Americans from children to veterans, DOE computers have been crucial to success of researchers seeking to deliver precision care to patients.

The quiet contributions of these incredible machines have solved some of the world's toughest problems and kept the U.S. at the forefront of high-performance computing for decades. They are developed and operated by some of the most gifted scientists in the world. These computers will also fuel America's efforts to maintain the Nation's global leadership in artificial intelligence.

While the United States leads the world in AI capabilities today, China is gaining ground. The government in Beijing has invested in and backed AI efforts in China with one goal in mind: to overtake the United States and dominate the AI world.

Thankfully, we have a president who is committed to ensuring that doesn't happen. That is why he recently issued an executive order creating the government-wide American AI Initiative. The president wants to ensure this innovation occurs in the United States.

The executive order calls for increased access to federal data, models and high performance computing resources for America's AI researchers.

I am proud that some of those resources and computers live at our DOE National Labs, where we currently possess five of the 10 fastest supercomputers in the world, including the top two fastest and the world's top AI supercomputer.

Through this executive order, the president has given DOE and other agencies a mandate to further utilize our world-class high performance computing infrastructure to build upon and accelerate America's existing AI research. We are ready for the challenge.

DOE computing capabilities will be critical to securing America's dominance in artificial intelligence. That is why we must take these already high-performance capabilities to the next level.

I am excited to announce today that along with Cray and AMD, DOE will be building Frontier, a new exascale system at Oak Ridge National Lab, or ORNL.

Exascale systems are capable of at least a billion-billion calculations per second, which means they are at least 10 to 20 times faster than today's fastest supercomputers, and 50 to 100 times more powerful – the equivalent of going from a flip phone to a smart phone or from a dialup to a 4G internet connection.

DOE has committed to building not just one, but three exascale machines at its National Labs: Frontier at Oak Ridge in Tennessee, Aurora at Argonne in Illinois, and El Capitan at Lawrence Livermore in California, all of which we expect to deploy around 2021-22.

With exascale capability, researchers will be able to look deeper and see further than they ever have before. They will develop better answers to more complex questions and meet more complex challenges with greater precision and speed.

Expected applications include identifying next-generation materials like exotic alloys for the defense, aerospace and energy sectors; determining optimal cancer treatments based on a patient's unique genetics; refining earth system models to more reliably assess water cycles and agricultural impacts; deciphering high-energy physics data; and accelerating industrial product design.

DOE-fueled AI work is already being used to optimize grid security and increase energy efficiency – among a host of other energy-related applications. It is also being used to reduce traffic jams, strengthen cybersecurity, predict extreme weather, improve emergency response and even develop better treatments for cancer and traumatic brain injury.

DOE's systems have used machine learning to search through a billion combinations of drugs to find those predicted to maximally inhibit a given tumor, to search through a billion hypothetical compounds to identify those with potential as new drug development candidates, to design new materials, to develop new algorithms to manage electric grid operations.

We must use our supercomputing capabilities to fully develop the potential of AI. That's why we are coordinating those efforts across our National Labs, and have stood up an AI program at DOE.

Those are the stakes in AI and exascale computing.

The competition from China is great, but America is the world's leader, and has never shied away from a challenge … and it always thrived when exploring new frontiers.

The EPA is meant to protect us. The Monsanto trials proves it isn't | Nathan Donley and Carey Gillam,https://www.theguardian.com,"['Nathan Donley', 'Carey Gillam']",05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/07/epa-monsanto-round-up-trial,"Ever since Monsanto introduced its line of Roundup weedkillers to the world in 1974, the products have been touted by the company and regulators as extremely safe. The EPA reiterated that stance last week.

But the emergence of long-held corporate secrets in three public trials has revealed a covert campaign to cover-up the pesticide’s risks and raised troubling questions about lax oversight of all pesticides by the Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory agencies that are supposed to be protecting public health.

Two recently concluded Roundup product liability trials in California have resulted in large damage awards against Monsanto, after juries found the company’s herbicides contributed to cancer and that it failed to warn of the risks. Closing arguments in a third trial under way now in Oakland, California, are expected this week. Revelations that have emerged from the trial testimony include:

* Monsanto never conducted epidemiology studies for Roundup and its other formulations made with the active ingredient glyphosate, to see if the products could lead to cancer in people who used them.

* At the same time as Monsanto was refusing to conduct long-term product safety studies, the company was spending millions of dollars on secretive PR campaigns – including $17m budgeted in a single year – to finance ghostwritten studies and op-eds aimed at discrediting independent scientists whose work found dangers with Monsanto’s herbicides.

* Several Monsanto scientists spent years putting together a sweeping paper that was published in a scientific journal in 2000, concluding Roundup posed no health risk to people. Internal emails show the team was applauded by corporate leaders for their hard work on the paper. But when the work was published in a scientific journal, no Monsanto employees were listed as authors. A company scientist referred to the paper internally as one the company had “ghost” written. Monsanto has denied that characterization. Regulators, including the EPA, have cited that paper as a reference in assuring consumers that Roundup is safe.

* Numerous other examples of Monsanto employee ghostwriting have surfaced. In one from 2013, a company scientist emailed co-workers about a manuscript he wrote that he hoped he could make appear to be authored from someone other than himself by finding a willing academic, then “turn it over to them and just be a ghost-writer”. The scientist said it would be best if the paper did not appear to have come from Monsanto. But he was concerned that faculty members “may not want to just take something they did not produce and slap their names on it”.

* When the US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry sought to evaluate glyphosate toxicity in 2015, Monsanto expressed concern about what the agency might find and engaged the assistance of EPA officials to delay that review. The efforts delayed the release of the public draft of the review – originally to be issued three years ago – until earlier this month. Just as Monsanto had feared, the agency’s review found links between cancer and glyphosate.

* Although Monsanto was aware of tests showing how easily the chemicals in Roundup are absorbed into human skin, neither the company nor the EPA have warned consumers of a need to wear protective clothing.

* In the 1980s EPA scientists saw that mice dosed with glyphosate developed rare kidney tumors, which they said demonstrated cancer risks for people. But after protests from Monsanto, the EPA’s top brass overruled its own scientists and assured Americans that glyphosate poses no cancer risk.

Precisely because the chemical has been treated as so much safer than other pesticides, over the past 45 years glyphosate has become virtually ubiquitous: residues of the chemical have been documented in food, air, water and soil samples, as well as within the bodies of people who have never used the pesticide. The chemical has even been detected in raindrops.

It all raises this troubling question: if what has been touted as perhaps our “safest” widely used pesticide actually causes cancer, what assurance do we have about the hundreds of other pesticides that the EPA has assured us are safe?

For years the EPA has been called upon to fully ban the brain-damaging pesticide chlorpyrifos but has refused to do so, saying it is still evaluating the science. A federal appeals court recently ordered the EPA to make a final decision, noting the weighty scientific evidence showing the harm the insecticide does to children. The EPA has thus far refused to act but some states are not waiting. Hawaii passed a ban on chlorpyrifos last year. Now New York, Oregon and California are moving to do the same, trying to protect their residents if the EPA won’t.

Many European countries prohibit regulators from approving pesticides that are considered mutagens, carcinogens, reproductive toxicants or endocrine disruptors. But these same products in the US face little to no resistance from regulators.

Monsanto – which was purchased last year by Bayer AG – continues to assert glyphosate’s safety. But with more than 13,000 plaintiffs awaiting their own day in court, a California judge has ordered Monsanto/Bayer to enter into talks to consider settling the cases.

Meanwhile, the evidence revealed within the courtrooms has been resonating across the country as several cities, schools and neighborhoods are limiting or banning glyphosate and other pesticides. New York City council members have introduced legislation that would ban city agencies from spraying glyphosate-based herbicides and other toxic pesticides in parks and other public spaces. City commissioners in Miami voted in favor of a ban on glyphosate herbicides in February, and in March the Los Angeles county board of supervisors issued a moratorium on glyphosate applications on county property.

Harrell’s, a Florida-based turf, golf course and agricultural product supplier, stopped offering glyphosate products as of 1 March. And just as the spring planting season is getting under way, consumers are discovering that Roundup is no longer available at Costco, the retail giant that routinely ranks among the nation’s five largest.

It is heartening to see consumers and some cities and businesses stepping up to try to protect themselves from pesticides known to be harmful.

But until our elected leaders in Congress require the EPA to adopt more transparent, science-based practices that prioritize the health of Americans over industry profits, consumers should assume they’re on their own when it comes to protecting themselves and their families."

Justice Department releases redacted Mueller report — again,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-07-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice-department-releases-redacted-mueller-report-again,"The Justice Department released a second copy of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Monday evening, following a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by BuzzFeed and the Electronic Privacy and Information Center.

The lightly-redacted version of Mueller's report appears to be identical to the 448-page document that was released in April, except it sheds more light on the redactions by explaining why the blacked-out information is exempted from release under FOIA.

Democrats in Congress are threatening to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt for declining to provide them with an unredacted version of the report, and this successful move by BuzzFeed and EPIC may make it easier for their battle for the full report to move forward in federal court.

Along with the report itself, the Justice Department included a letter from senior counsel Vanessa Brinkman addressed to BuzzFeed reporter Jason Leopold, who had filed a FOIA request for the report back on March 21, 2019. Brinkman said the Office of Information Policy had processed the Mueller report under FOIA and had made it available on the Justice Department website. Brinkman also said she had “determined that the Report is appropriate for release with excisions” and listed the different reasons for redactions, including exemptions related to: protecting sources and methods, safeguarding law enforcement techniques, shielding ongoing law enforcement proceedings, keeping grand jury testimony confidential, ensuring deliberative process privilege, avoiding invasions of privacy, and ensuring a fair trial.

One example of how the latest version of Mueller's report adds a bit more clarity to the redaction process can be seen by comparing the short overview section on “Russian Hacking Operations” early in the document. In the originally released version, a few lines in the WikiLeaks section are said to be redacted due to “Harm to Ongoing Matter.” But in the version released Monday, DOJ explains those sentences are blacked out due to exemptions “(b)(6), (b)(7)(A), (b)(7)(B), (b)(7)(C)”, which are related to improper disclosures of information, interference with enforcement proceedings, deprivation of the right to fair trial, and invasion of privacy respectively.

Leopold tweeted earlier in the day: “We intend to challenge all of the redactions.”

Mueller wrapped up the Russia investigation in March and the DOJ released a redacted version of his report in mid-April. The report showed Mueller's team did not find sufficient evidence showing criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin during the 2016 election. Mueller did not, however, clear Trump of obstruction of justice. Barr says he determined there is insufficient evidence to prove an obstruction crime, but Democrats argue Mueller's report, which outlines 10 instances of possible obstruction, leaves it up to Congress to investigate and decide.

Just days before Mueller's report was released the first time, the judge in the FOIA case appeared to be sympathetic to the arguments being made by BuzzFeed, leveling critiques at what he seemed to see as the secrecy being practiced by the Justice Department. ”Obviously there is a real concern about whether there will be transparency … I hope that the government will be as transparent as it can be,"" said Judge Reggie Walton of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Taking aim at Barr directly, Walton said, “The Attorney General has created an environment that has caused a significant part of the American public to be concerned about whether there will be full transparency.” The release of the redacted report is just the beginning of this litigation, and the case will likely continue moving forward in federal court shortly.

The same night the Justice Department released this second version of the Mueller report, the Justice Department was also engaged in a high-profile back-and-forth with the Democrat-run House Judiciary Committee over the department's refusal to turn over an unredacted version of the report.

Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., released a statement late Monday evening saying, “I am pleased that the Department of Justice has agreed to meet with my staff tomorrow — and not Wednesday afternoon, as originally proposed by DOJ.”

“It remains vital that the Committee obtain access to the full, unredacted report and the underlying materials,” Nadler said. “At the moment, our plans to consider holding Attorney General Barr accountable for his failure to comply with our subpoena still stand.”

Earlier in the day, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said, “The Department remains willing to accommodate Congress’s legitimate needs, but must do so consistent with the law.”"

(CNN) - After two missed deadlines, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is again due to tell House Democrats on Monday whether he plans to hand over President Donald Trump's personal tax returns.

A person familiar with Mnuchin's thinking told CNN to expect Trump's top finance chief, a close ally of the President, to ultimately reject the initial April 3 request from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal to release six years of Trump's personal returns. It's unclear whether that denial would come on Monday or at a later point, the person said.

The fight is escalating as Trump has made increasingly clear that he expects his administration officials to fight requests from the opposing party.

Attorney General William Barr declined a Democratic request to testify last week in the House about special counsel Robert Mueller's report, a day after appearing in the Republican-controlled Senate.

Mnuchin has already told members of Congress that he's consulting with Justice Department lawyers about the returns.

Trump has refused to release his tax information, first as a candidate and now as president, breaking a precedent going back to Watergate.

Democrats initially directed their request to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, the only person with the legal authority to turn over the returns, but Mnuchin has interceded twice in the matter, citing his role overseeing the federal tax collector.

Mnuchin said in April he would deliver a response by May 6.

The Justice Department has declined to comment on the matter.

A decision by Treasury to deny the Democratic congressional request is widely anticipated to lead to a court fight -- which would be a rare example of Congress suing the executive branch for information.

A denial would come amid other maneuvers by the Trump administration to stonewall other Democratic committee chairman on everything from the Mueller report to interviews with former White House Counsel Don McGahn.

Neal made his initial request for Trump's tax information on April 3 after a months-long deliberation with staff, committee members and House lawyers. He also sent a follow-up letter demanding that Treasury comply with the request no later than April 23.

But Treasury missed the deadlines, a strategy Democrats have argued was an effort to delay the process.

Democrats on the tax-writing committee have argued that they have the ability to request Trump's personal tax information under an obscure statute that permits three people to request personal tax information of any individual: the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, the Senate Finance Committee chairman and the chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation.

The statute says that the secretary of the Treasury ""shall furnish"" it.

The statute has been used by Congress before, including in the Republican investigation under President Barack Obama into whether the IRS was discriminating against conservative groups applying for non-profit status. Requests for information using the law are also made on a regular basis for research purposes.

Neal has argued that he needs Trump's taxes in order to conduct oversight of the IRS's presidential audit program to both understand how the IRS is using the program and to see if the program needs to be codified into law.

But Mnuchin has asserted the ""unprecedented"" request raises ""serious constitutional issues"" that could have dire consequences for taxpayer privacy and has consulted with the Justice Department on the matter.

The Treasury secretary has also raised concerns that setting such a precedent could be ""potentially weaponizing"" the IRS.

The Massachusetts Democrat has previously indicated that defying his request would be interpreted as noncompliance and lead to an escalation of a standoff between the Trump administration and House Democrats.

""It is not the proper function of the IRS, Treasury or Justice to question or second guess the motivations of the committee or its reasonable determinations regarding its need for the requested tax returns and return information,"" Neal wrote to Rettig in response to the missed deadline on April 23. ""Please know that if you fail to comply, your failure will be interpreted as a denial of my request.""

House Democrats haven't decided on their next move yet if Treasury denies their request. The committee chairman could issue a subpoena on top of his request. If the subpoena is denied they could then move ahead with a lawsuit.

They could also move to hold the Treasury Secretary or IRS Commissioner for whom the original request was addressed to in contempt of Congress.

In interviews last month, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News that there was no world in which Democrats would get the President's tax returns.

Democrats are up against a barrage of denied requests from the administration, forcing leadership into tough decisions about what oversight priorities are worth pursuing in court.

House Democrats are lodged in an all-out-battle with the Department of Justice after the agency refused to hand over an unredacted Mueller report by Wednesday's deadline. That was despite a subpoena from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler. Nadler has said he plans to hold the Attorney General in contempt of Congress if the report is not turned over in upcoming days.

Trump's personal lawyers also sued last week to block banks and an accounting firm from turning over Trump's financial records to the House Financial Services, House Intelligence and House Oversight Committees, a move that has led some Democratic chairs to question what the President has to hide.

""Whether it is refusing to sit down in an interview with Mueller or whether it is constantly obstructing justice by trying to stop testimonies and stop people from cooperating, whether it is filing a lawsuit, he obviously has something to hide,"" House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters said last week.

Waters's committee has subpoenaed at least 9 financial institutions with ties to the President.

""He's obviously afraid that we are going to learn more about his relationships with Deutsche Bank, more about his bank records, perhaps, more about whether or not there is money laundering that has been involved in some ways. We have enough information and we have enough to help us to guide us moving forward to help us with these subpoenas,"" Waters said."

USA TODAY

Jim Ferguson wanted answers.

How was his 91-year-old father, who served in the U.S. Navy in World War II, fatally injured in a Veterans Affairs nursing home, the institution Ferguson had entrusted to care for him?

Huddled around a computer monitor with managers at the VA in Des Moines, Iowa, Ferguson watched a hallway surveillance video that depicted a chilling blow to his father's head.

“I lost it,” Ferguson told USA TODAY. “I broke down.”

In the video, James “Milt” Ferguson Sr., who had dementia and was legally blind, appears confused. He opens a hallway door, rolls his wheelchair into another resident’s room, then wheels back out. No staff members are visible. He circles around and heads back into the room.

Halfway through the door, his chair flips over backward. Milt Ferguson crashes to the floor, landing on the back of his head. Ferguson said he was told the chair was pushed over by the resident in the room, who can't be seen in the video. As staff members rush to assist him, Ferguson is able to turn over and sit up, but the impact causes a massive brain bleed that will kill him within days.

What later would turn the son’s despair into outrage was what he learned about events leading up to his father wheeling around unsupervised last December, and what happened after he smashed into the floor.

“It’s like my dad died at their hands,” Ferguson said.

Serious problems with resident care have occurred in many VA nursing homes across the nation, including the one where Ferguson was being cared for.

USA TODAY reported in March that inspections by a private contractor hired by the VA found deficiencies that caused ""actual harm"" to veterans at more than half of the 99 VA nursing homes reviewed. The inspections found inadequate supervision or hazardous conditions at 53 of them.

In Des Moines – which received the lowest one star out of five in the VA's own ratings, based on surprise inspections – inspectors found managers did not ensure staff treated residents with dignity or followed basic infection-control and prevention measures.

The story of what happened to James Ferguson in Des Moines provides a deeper picture of the care one elderly veteran received. Medical records provided to USA TODAY by his son and legal guardian outline what specialists say was a concerning series of decisions by VA staff, before and after his deadly head injury.

Nine days before, VA caregivers determined Ferguson was a danger to himself and others because his dementia caused him to wander around, agitated. They had him on continuous one-on-one observation with an aide, but took him off the strict monitoring when he entered the VA nursing home. There, staff didn't reinstate the heightened observation, despite his repeatedly straying dangerously into other residents' rooms.

After his injury, staff put him back in his wheelchair but did not report the incident to a supervisor for 40 minutes, the records and surveillance video indicate. Ferguson wasn't transported to an emergency room for two hours after that. Then, it took 2½ hours more to send him to a trauma hospital. The time stamp on the video showed the fall occurred at 3:49 p.m. and it wasn't until just before 9 p.m. that Ferguson was transported to the trauma facility.

'A disaster waiting to happen'

Specialists who reviewed Ferguson's medical records at the request of USA TODAY expressed concern about the quality of his care.

""It was definitely a disaster waiting to happen, and it did,"" said Robyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a Washington-based nonprofit advocacy organization.

""I just am really struck by the predictability with his repeated episodes of going into other people's rooms,"" she said. ""They should have had some intervention so they could provide him with adequate supervision and address the wandering.""

Grant said the length of time it took afterward to adequately evaluate and diagnose the severity of his injury and get him to a trauma facility also raises questions. ""What was happening there, in terms of those delays?"" she said.

VA nursing homes: Feds find 'blatant disregard' for veteran safety

Richard Mollot, executive director since 2005 of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a New York City-based nonprofit advocate of nursing home care improvement, said the shortfalls indicate there was ""very likely"" a lack of skilled or adequately trained staff to meet his needs.

""The point of being in that environment is that you have skilled nursing care and monitoring,"" he said.

Mollot said the reporting delay is particularly concerning. ""How often does this happen that no one's looking at? That's what is so upsetting.""

'All staff acted properly'

A spokesman for the Des Moines VA, Timothy Hippen, said in a statement that a review after the ""untimely death"" concluded ""all staff acted properly.""

""Any time an unexpected death occurs, VA Central Iowa Health Care System reviews its policies and procedures to see if changes are warranted,"" he said. ""We did that here, finding that all staff acted properly.""

In response to questions about the case, national VA spokesman Curt Cashour accused USA TODAY of focusing on ""isolated complaints"" and ""cherry-picking the experiences of a handful of veterans to create the impression of a broad problem.""

Cashour maintained that, overall, VA nursing homes ""compare closely"" with non-VA facilities. More than 40,000 veterans rely on care at the agency’s 134 nursing facilities each year.

USA TODAY reported last year that about 70% of VA nursing homes scored worse than non-VA nursing homes on a majority of quality indicators tracked by the agency, which include rates of infection, serious pain and bed sores.

Hippen declined to respond to detailed questions about Ferguson's case.

""We will not be addressing the specifics of this case publicly, but we have been in direct contact with the veteran’s family to discuss their concerns,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson said he remains upset even though VA officials shared the surveillance video with him and said they were sorry about what happened to his father.

He wants VA staff held accountable. He wants to make sure policies are in place so it doesn't happen to anyone else.

“No one should live their life like that and have what happened to him in the end,” he said. “I want this to be the last person this happens to.”

A gambler called ‘booger’

Even as his dementia worsened, Milt Ferguson flashed glimmers of his younger self.

The former deckhand on the heavy cruiser U.S.S. Pensacola was affectionately known as “booger” at the Des Moines Register, where he worked bundling newspapers for 23 years before retiring in 1995. He loved to play the slots and the horses.

On a note in his medical record, a nurse practitioner wrote: “Patient laughs when his nickname is mentioned.” Jim Ferguson had come for a visit that day, as he did most days. “He was smiling and appeared to be enjoying his son’s company,” the medical record said.

The decision to place him in a nursing home had been a gut-wrenching one, Ferguson said. He had moved in with his parents and cared for them for three years. But in April 2018 his mother died. He said a VA social worker told him his father needed more intensive, round-the-clock care and supervision.

“They made it sound like, well, if he got hurt, I could be charged with a crime,” Ferguson said. “So that’s when I decided to place him in a nursing home.”

‘His dementia was acting up’

Ferguson moved his father to Bishop Drumm Retirement Center, a private facility just outside Des Moines, where his mother worked as a nursing assistant in the Alzheimer’s unit for more than 20 years before retiring.

The center took in Milt Ferguson last August. But three months later, his condition worsened.

""The day before Thanksgiving, I got a call from Bishop Drumm – his dementia was acting up,"" his son said.

He hit two staff members, was “agitated all day” and was “wandering into other residents room(s), causing distress,” a nurse later noted in his medical record. “He is generally ‘sweet’ so this is a departure from his usual behavior.”

Ferguson was taken by ambulance to the Des Moines VA Medical Center, where he was admitted to the acute psychiatry ward. He was put on one-on-one observation with a sitter – an aide tasked with intervening if he lashed out or tried to stray into other patients’ rooms.

They adjusted his medications, and, after a few aggressive outbursts, he appeared calm enough after three weeks to transfer into the VA nursing home on the medical center’s campus.

But there was a catch, a psychiatric nurse wrote in his record: ""Veterans are not put on sitter status over there.""

‘Help me, help me’

After a 22-hour trial period without a sitter, Milt Ferguson moved in to the VA nursing home.

Problems began within hours.

He hardly slept, he hallucinated, he called out ""help me, help me"" over and over again. He was agitated and again, he ""wandered into and out of peers rooms"" day after day, nursing staff wrote in his record.

They gave him medication. Sometimes he calmed down. Sometimes he didn’t.

A psychiatrist was managing his case remotely. According to public records, the doctor worked at a VA facility a few hours away in Lincoln, Nebraska. Through virtual appointments, the psychiatrist advised changes to Ferguson's medication.

On December 19, a week after Ferguson moved in, nursing home staff noted he was still restless and anxious, pacing and screaming and yelling. His care team – psychiatrist, primary care doctor, nursing staff and social workers – met to discuss the case.

The psychiatrist said a review of his records showed ""increased confusion with wandering"" during the past week. The doctor prescribed higher dosages of a mood-stabilizing drug and a sedative. There was no discussion of closer supervision or reinstatement of one-on-one observation, the records show.

“Will ask RN to contact this MD in one week with update,” the psychiatrist wrote.

By then, Ferguson would be dead.

‘A golf ball-sized lump’

On December 20, when two aides rushed to help Milt Ferguson, his head on the floor and legs crumpled to the side, the time stamp on the hallway surveillance video reads 3:49 p.m. But in a report filled out an hour later, a nurse recorded the time of the accident as 4:30 p.m.

His records do not indicate what the staff did with Ferguson during the 41 minutes in between, aside from putting him back in his wheelchair.

By that time, he had a “golf ball-sized lump on the back of his head.” The nurse notified the manager on duty, a nurse practitioner, who wrote at 5:06 p.m. that he had ordered an immediate CT scan of his head.

That didn’t happen until about 6:30 p.m., when Ferguson arrived in the emergency department of the medical center on the Des Moines VA campus, on a bed wheeled by a nursing home aide. The aide said Ferguson had earlier been taken for a CT scan but was uncooperative.

An emergency room doctor quickly had a sedative administered and the scan was completed. By that point, the World War II veteran had a “large bleed” in the back right side of his brain that was so acute, the CT report says his brain had shifted to the left inside his skull.

Sent 'to scanning’

The doctor notified MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center, a trauma hospital, at 7 p.m. For nearly two hours, the doctor tried to keep Ferguson comfortable and his blood pressure under control until an ambulance arrived and took Ferguson to Mercy at 8:55 p.m.

The doctor also kept calling Ferguson’s son, leaving voicemails.

But Jim Ferguson had himself been admitted to a hospital and had provided the VA nursing home with a consent form authorizing staff to contact a close friend if anything happened to his father. That form had been sent ""to scanning” that morning.

When Jim Ferguson retrieved all the voicemails, he rushed to Mercy the next morning.

""He was not responsive. He was laying on his bed, making this horrible noise as they sucked saliva out of his mouth,"" he said. ""I never even got to say any last words to my dad.""

He died the next day.

Specialists who reviewed the case at the request of USA TODAY singled out multiple shortfalls in his care at the VA that may have affected the outcome.

Grant, the policy director at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, said the 22-hour trial of having no sitter was ""not enough time to establish how he was doing.""

When he then acted out day after day, in agitation and confusion, they should not have allowed him to wander into other residents' rooms, she said. Such situations can cause the other residents to lash out in fear or distress and ""lead to an altercation or violence or striking out.""

""One would argue that could have been prevented,"" she said. ""There should have been somebody, somewhere who could have seen that this happened and – particularly when he wheeled himself – to have gone in and intervened, 'Let me help you, let's go to your room.'""

Mollot, the executive director at the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said meeting the standards of care means staff identifies risks and needs and ways to meet them and mitigate them and then does so consistently.

""This is exactly the kind of thing that happens when those standards are not followed,"" he said.

'A safe place'

The spokesman for the Des Moines VA, while declining to answer detailed questions about what happened, said that in general, ""caring for nursing home residents involves balancing patients’ independence with the need for supervision, as appropriate.""

""While tight scrutiny and strict limits on residents’ activities and freedom of movement could possibly lower the risk for adverse events, it would also severely degrade patients’ quality of life, which is precisely what we are trying to preserve for as long as possible,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson still has his father’s wheelchair in the garage. He keeps the sweatshirt his father was wearing when he last used the chair. Ferguson has retained a lawyer, Brad Biren, to help him figure out next steps and how to hold the VA accountable.

“Somebody didn’t watch my dad and let him die,” he said. “It’s supposed to be a safe place.”

Columnist

Teenagers, known for their immaturity, need stable adult guidance. The Department of Homeland Security is no different.

But like children shuffled among a succession of foster parents, the department, still in its teens, has been hampered by a chronic lack of steady leadership. Currently, numerous top positions — including secretary, deputy secretary and three of four undersecretary slots — have no confirmed appointees.

Vacancies among the political appointees who set policy for the third-largest department is an old and continuing story. What a House hearing revealed is just how damaging the many openings can be for the department’s work and its employees.

Just 47 percent of key department slots are filled with confirmed appointees, according to the Political Appointee Tracker published by The Washington Post and the Partnership for Public Service. Only Interior is worse, at 41 percent, among Cabinet-level agencies.

The Department of Homeland Security started as a jumbled mess when it began operations in 2003, in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It was forged from 22 separate agencies “into a unified, integrated Department,” at least according to its website.

A more realistic view comes from John Roth, the department’s former inspector general. As the 2014-2017 independent watchdog within the agency, Roth had a prime perch to observe the department’s workings and inefficiencies.

“In the best of times, DHS is an unruly and difficult-to-manage organization,” Roth told the House Committee on Homeland Security on Wednesday. “We are not in the best of times. The nature and extent of senior leadership vacancies in the department is cause for concern, as such pervasive vacancies significantly hamper the department’s ability to carry out its all-important mission.”

Chairman Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.) called the session to examine the question in the hearing’s title: “Trouble at the Top: Are Vacancies at the Department of Homeland Security Undermining the Mission?”

Comments by Roth and others left no doubt that the answer is yes.

After examining the root causes of the department’s “persistent shortfalls,” Roth pointed to poor unity of effort.

“DHS has demonstrated an inability to mesh divergent components, with different histories, cultures, and missions, into a single agency with a unity of effort,” he said. “Too often, the components operated as stand-alone entities or, worse, in competition with each other. Knitting together a unified DHS with all components pulling together to protect our homeland security is a top challenge of the department and requires strong and committed leadership and oversight. This goal is thwarted by the pervasive senior leadership vacancies.”

The shortfalls are widespread, he said, touching “nearly every area of the department,” including:

· Personnel management and morale — Since inception, “DHS has suffered poor employee morale and a dysfunctional work environment.” While morale has improved, the department ranks last among large agencies in employment engagement scores calculated in the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government report.

· Acquisition management — “Most of DHS major acquisition programs continue to cost more than expected, take longer to deploy than planned, or deliver less capability than promised.”

· Grants management, particularly at the department’s Federal Emergency Management Agency, which “does a fairly poor job of ensuring that the money is not wasted. We believed the cause to be a failure of leadership within and oversight over FEMA, in addition to structural and systemic issues inherent in the program.”

These and other problems are exacerbated by “a lack of personnel within the departmental leadership offices to focus on and address overarching issues,” Roth said.

Despite a bevy of problems, Gene L. Dodaro, who directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) as comptroller general of the United States, said DHS “has made important progress in strengthening its management functions.” On April 19, however, he sent DHS a 19-page letter, including an enclosure, “detailing 26 open recommendations that GAO believes warrant the highest priority personal attention from the department and its components.”

But personal attention from whom? The letter was sent to Kevin K. McAleenan, the acting secretary, who is surrounded by other temporary actors.

“Current vacancies in top leadership positions could pose a challenge to addressing high-risk areas and priority recommendations that span DHS’s diverse missions,” Dodaro said, “which include preventing terrorism and enhancing security, managing our borders, administering immigration laws, securing cyberspace, and responding to disasters.”

Despite the claim of “a unified, integrated Department,” Roth said the department’s “vast law enforcement enterprise … does not work together as a unified organization … time and again we saw the law enforcement agencies operating independently without the necessary oversight and no real effort to compel coordination.”

In a well-functioning bureaucracy, officials in the secretary’s office and the deputy secretary’s office would corral problems like these. Unfortunately, Roth said those offices “are simply too thinly staffed to be able to even be aware of, much less effectively manage, the significant and varied issues that face DHS.”

Thompson blamed the White House for the current lack of department leadership, saying President Trump “has decimated the leadership ranks of his own Department of Homeland Security.""

“In recent weeks alone, President Trump has: dismissed Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen; circumvented the law by forcing Acting Deputy Secretary and Undersecretary for Management Claire Grady to resign so he could install Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan as acting secretary; asked Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator David Pekoske to serve as deputy secretary while also running TSA; and pulled the nomination of Ronald Vitiello for Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, prompting his resignation,” Thompson said in his opening statement.

“In addition to the secretary and deputy secretary vacancies, at least 12 other critical positions across the department’s key components and offices are operating without permanent leadership. The president has failed to nominate anyone to fill most of these vacancies, even though many have been held by acting officials for the entirety of the Trump administration. Moreover, there are another 50 senior leadership positions vacant throughout the department, including those tasked with overseeing the daily operations of DHS.

“This chaos appears to be by design,” Thompson added, “orchestrated by a president who wants to be able to remove the department’s leadership on a whim.”

The White House and DHS did not respond to requests for comments. Rep. Mike D. Rogers (Ala.), the committee’s ranking member, and other Republicans on the panel pointed out that the department also had vacancies during the Obama administration. The big difference, of course, is Obama’s Democrats did not run the Senate for most of his administration. Republicans now control the White House and the Senate, which confirms presidential nominees.

“Management vacancies, mismanagement and poor employee morale have plagued the Department of Homeland Security since it was created … ” Rogers said. “Every day, DHS employees do an exceptional job carrying out their critical missions. No one should blame the men and women of DHS for problems Congress has allowed to fester.”

Devin Nunes: Clinton 'dirt' tipster Joseph Mifsud has ties to State Department,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com,[],05-05-2019,2019,5,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/devin-nunes-clinton-dirt-tipster-joseph-mifsud-has-ties-to-state-department,"Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud — the man who told former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos the Russians had thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails — likely has links to ""U.S., British, and Italian intelligence services"" and the State Department where Clinton served as the country's top diplomat.

Mifsud, a London-based professor and former Maltese diplomat, has long been suspected of deep ties to Russian intelligence. He is an elusive figure who has stayed out of the spotlight and is the subject of a letter Nunes, the House Intelligence Committee ranking member, sent to U.S. intelligence agencies and the State Department on Friday seeking relevant documents.

Nunes told Fox News on Sunday there were many questions that arose from special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, which his letter said “omits any mention of a wide range of contacts Mifsud had with Western political institutions and individuals,"" that still need to be answered.

""They can't even tell us who Joseph Mifsud is,"" he told host Maria Bartiromo, adding, ""We believe he has ties to the State Department."" He noted how in 2017 Mifsud attended an event at the U.S. Capitol hosted by Global Ties U.S., a nonprofit group that partners with the State Department and featured ambassadors and U.S. congressmen at the event.

Nunes' letter also photographs of Mifsud in close proximity to Western officials at events hosted by Rome-based Link University Campus, where Mifsud taught.

Mueller's 448-page report, released last month with redactions, states that Mifsud traveled to Moscow in April 2016, after which he met Papadopoulos in London. It was at this meeting that Mifsud informed Papadopoulos that during his trip he learned that the Russians had “dirt” on Clinton, who served as secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and was President Trump's Democratic rival in the 2016 election. Papadopoulos later repeated this claim to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer, who informed the U.S. government and prompted the original counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign in July 2016.

Although Mueller's team portrayed Mifsud as a Russian asset with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Nunes said the team decided to""cherry pick"" information from news reports, leaving out that he was described as a Western intelligence asset. ""It seems like Mifsud has an awful lot of ties to U.S., British, and Italian intelligence services,"" Nunes said.

The FBI spoke with Mifsud in early February 2017, and believe he left the U.S. on Feb. 11. The FBI accused Papadopoulos of misleading the bureau about his communications with Mifsud in January 2017, which they alleged ""undermined investigators’ ability to challenge the Professor [Mifsud] or potentially detain or arrest him while he was still in the United States.""

As part of Mueller’s Russia investigation, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Russians and served 12 days in prison late last year.

Papadopoulos, who also was contacted by FBI assets during the 2016 campaign, including informant Stefan Halper, now feels he could have been the target of entrapment.

Appearing on Fox News before Nunes, he said he got caught in a ""perjury trap."" He also said he is ""pretty sure there are a lot of recordings and transcripts between myself and a lot of these assets and I'm very hopeful that these are going to get public soon.""

Nunes said his letter to U.S. intelligence agencies and the State Department seeks ""all of the underlying information,"" adding, ""so if the FBI does in fact have transcripts of Papadopoulos talking to anyone, whether it's Mifsud, or Downer, or whoever, I think Congress and the American people have the right to know this.""

In his letter, Nunes asks Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel, FBI Director Christopher Wray, National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to hand over all documents they have on Mifsud by May 10."

WASHINGTON – Puerto Rico voters upset at President Donald Trump for his long-running feud with the island over disaster aid don't have much recourse at the ballot box in 2020 – not unless they move to the mainland.

That's because the nearly 3.2 million American citizens who live in Puerto Rico play no direct role in electing U.S. presidents. Residents of the other four U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands) also do not have the right to vote in general elections.

The District of Columbia (a.k.a. Washington, D.C.) is the only jurisdiction outside the 50 states whose residents can vote for the president. It has three electoral votes.

Territories can help choose each party's nominee, however. The political parties have the ability to include them in the primary selection process.

In 2016, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio won Puerto Rico's GOP primary, trouncing Trump 71% to 13% and winning all 20 of the territory's Republican delegates. It was one of only three primaries Rubio won (along with Minnesota and the District of Columbia).

The larger risk for Trump is the relocation to the mainland of thousands of Puerto Ricans who fled the island after the devastation of Hurricane Maria in 2017.

Researchers say it's difficult to pinpoint exactly where those fleeing Maria's aftermath resettled, but a large percentage are believed to have moved to Florida, where more than 1 million Puerto Ricans reside.

That could be bad news for Trump, who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in Florida in 2016 by fewer than 113,000 votes out of nearly 9.5 million cast.

A poll conducted last year by the Steven J. Green School of International and Public Affairs at Florida International University found that more than 70% of Puerto Ricans who moved to the Sunshine State since 2017 have a negative view of the president.

Arizona Dems ask DHS to appoint 'crisis coordinator' at border,https://thehill.com,[],05-06-2019,2019,5,https://thehill.com/latino/442330-arizona-dems-ask-dhs-to-appoint-crisis-coordinator-at-border,"House Democrats in Arizona are asking acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan to appoint a ""federal crisis coordinator"" to aid coordination between federal, state and local agencies at the border.

In a letter to McAleenan, the five Democrats criticized the Trump administration's border security initiatives as setting up ""a range of other catastrophic issues"" related to border security and immigration.

“This humanitarian crisis requires a humanitarian response,"" they wrote. ""To that end, we believe that you should immediately increase communication and coordination among federal, state, local, and tribal governments as well as non-governmental stakeholders to promote the well-being and safety of migrant families, process asylum claims quicker, efficiently use federal and non-federal resources, and ensure that DHS [Department of Homeland Security] can meet its national security mission.""

He also serves as Customs and Border Protection commissioner, a post he held in an acting capacity between January 2017 until March 2018, when he was confirmed by the Senate.

Before her resignation, Nielsen had appointed Manuel Padilla as head of the ""Interagency Border Emergency Cell,"" which was supposed to improve interagency coordination.

The Arizona lawmakers called upon McAleenan to clarify Padilla's role, saying the border emergency cell appears ""insufficient to adequately coordinate the response to the humanitarian crisis.""

Border security agencies have been overwhelmed by increased migration of asylum-seekers from Central America's Northern Triangle — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — most of whom are traveling as family units in large migrant caravans.

The lawmakers say the crisis has been compounded by a lack of coordination among the many local, state and federal jurisdictions involved in processing asylum claims at the border.

""This is a complex, multi-jurisdictional problem that requires a centralized command and coordination structure,"" they wrote."
Kamala Harris asks DOJ IG to probe whether Trump asked Barr to investigate political opponents,https://www.foxnews.com,['Adam Shaw'],,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-doj-ig-bar-trump-political-opponents,"Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Friday sent a letter to the Department of Justice’s inspector general demanding he investigates whether the White House had urged Attorney General William Barr to investigate President Trump’s political opponents.

“In response to my questions during the [Senate Judiciary] hearing, Attorney General Barr proved unable or unwilling to state whether he had been directed to open investigations at the request or suggestion of the President or other White House officials -- an alarming response that strikes at the very heart of the rule of law and threatens to undermine the longstanding independence of the Justice Department,” she said in a letter to Inspector General Michael Horowitz.

“I request that the Office of the Inspector General investigate whether the Attorney General has received or acted upon such improper requests,” she said.

The letter comes days after Harris questioned Barr Tuesday at the Senate hearing over details in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia report that noted instances where Trump had either suggested or called for the Department of Justice to investigate Hillary Clinton.

Harris quizzed Barr whether Trump or anyone at the White House had asked him to investigate anyone -- an exchange it detailed in its letter to Horowitz.

In that exchange, Harris asked: “Has the President or anyone at the White House ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone?”

“I’m trying to grapple with the word ‘suggest.’ I mean, there have been discussions of, of matters out there that, uh—they have not asked me to open an investigation,” Barr said.

When Harris asked if anyone had hinted, suggested or inferred, Barr said he didn’t know. Harris’ letter describes Barr as “unable or unwilling to answer the question.”

“There must be no doubt that the Department of Justice and its leadership stand apart from partisan politics, and resist improper attempts to use the power of federal law enforcement to settle personal scores,” she wrote.

The letter is the latest pushback from Democrats against Barr since the release of the Mueller report. In particular, they have zeroed in on Barr’s handling of the report’s release, alleging that he is biased toward the president in his presentation of the report in his initial four-page summary of its conclusions.

Harris criticized Barr’s decision not to personally review the underlying evidence before concluding that there was not enough evidence to establish that the president had committed obstruction of justice. She joined a number of Democrats saying that Barr should resign.

""This Attorney General lacks all credibility and has I think compromised the American public's ability to believe that he is a purveyor of justice,"" she told reporters after the hearing.

The rules were enacted by then-President Barack Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency in August 2016 after 25 years of consideration, U.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam of Oakland said in his ruling. They required states to submit plans in May 2017 to regulate solid-waste landfills’ emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and nearly 30 other air pollutants.

The EPA was to approve or disapprove the state plans by Sept. 30, 2017, and to prepare its own solution two months later for states without an approved plan.

President Trump’s EPA has received plans so far from California, New Mexico, Arizona, Delaware and West Virginia, but has not acted on them or proposed its own plan, Gilliam said. He said the agency has not justified its inaction but has argued only that the states have no legal authority to sue and have not presented a practical timetable for compliance.

Gilliam cited the Supreme Court’s 2007 ruling that granted Massachusetts the legal standing to sue the EPA for refusing to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions that could cause sea levels to rise and coastal lands to disappear.

The Clean Air Act, which requires federal regulation of air pollution, gives states “the right to challenge EPA’s failure to perform its non-discretionary duties,” Gilliam said. He also said it was indisputable that emissions from 265 million tons of solid waste generated in the United States each year cause harmful air pollution.

The EPA contended it could not act quickly on the plans because it would be short-staffed, citing a proposal in Trump’s budget request to reduce the agency’s funding. Gilliam accepted some of EPA’s timetable but rejected proposals to add months to consideration of California’s plans. He said the agency was not entitled to extra consideration for its “self-inflicted inconvenience.”

Under the judge’s timetable, the EPA must act on the state plans by Sept. 6 and present its own plan by Nov. 6.

“We celebrate this ruling requiring EPA to fulfill its long-overdue mandatory duties to control emissions from landfills,” said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who filed suit along with representatives of seven other states. “Noxious landfill emissions affect everyone, but disproportionately hurt our most vulnerable communities.”

The EPA said it would review the decision.

Robert Daigle, the director of DOD’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) office, will leave after two years in the role.

The news was first reported by Foreign Policy and formally announced in a Friday statement from acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan Patrick Michael ShanahanOvernight Defense — Presented by Huntington Ingalls Industries — Iran tensions escalate with carrier deployment | Trump floats letting service academy athletes go pro quicker | Venezuela tests Trump, Bolton relationship Tensions with Iran escalate beyond war of words Acting Pentagon chief cites 'credible threat' from Iran over decision to deploy military assets to region MORE.

“On behalf of the entire Department of Defense, I thank Bob Daigle for his extraordinary service over the past two years,” Shanahan said.

He adds that Daigle and his team “have been key architects of the investment strategies that ensure our military is ready to compete, deter, and win in any high-end fight of the future. These investments have formed the foundation for our Department's FY19 and FY20 strategy-driven budgets, enabling DoD to field new technologies and weapons systems at the speed of relevance.

“We wish Bob and his family all the best in his future endeavors. His strong leadership will be missed across the Department.”

Defense News reported that Daigle is leaving in mid-May to rejoin the private sector.

Daigle had led CAPE since August 2017, overseeing several major decisions, including the move to shutter the USS Truman aircraft carrier — a plan overturned by the Trump administration earlier this week. He also was behind the requirement that the Air Force buy more F-15X fighter aircraft, though service leaders had not asked for them.

His departure adds to the growing number of top positions left empty or filled by individuals in an acting basis, including the secretary and deputy secretary of defense, the Pentagon's chief management officer, the office of the undersecretary of personnel and readiness and the Air Force secretary."

"White House rips Mueller in letter to DOJ, says team ‘failed in their duty to act as prosecutors’",https://www.foxnews.com,"['John Roberts', 'John Roberts Currently Serves As The Chief White House Correspondent For Fox News Channel', 'Fnc . He Joined The Network As A Senior National Correspondent In January', 'Based In The Atlanta Bureau.']",,,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-rips-mueller-in-letter-to-doj-says-his-team-failed-in-their-duty-to-act-as-prosecutors,"The White House tore into Robert Mueller and his investigators in a recent letter to Attorney General Bill Barr that argued the special counsel's team included ""political statements"" in their Russia report and ""failed"" to act as traditional prosecutors -- while stating President Trump reserves his right to invoke executive privilege on matters related to the report.

In the April 19 letter to the Justice Department obtained Thursday by Fox News, White House Counsel Emmet Flood laid out a series of concerns with the Mueller report, specifically on the team's handling of the investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice.

TRUMP: 'NO REASON' TO HONOR DEMS' 'VERY PARTISAN' SUBPOENAS

“The Special Counsel and his staff failed in their duty to act as prosecutors and only as prosecutors,” Flood wrote, complaining that the report ""suffers from an extraordinary legal defect"" by failing to comply with the ""requirements of governing law.""

Flood raised concerns that the team did not reach a determination on the obstruction question while still going into great detail about the probe's findings and including a pointed passage that stated the probe did not exonerate the president. That passage read: “The evidence we obtained about the President’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.”

Flood noted prosecutors “simply are not in the business of establishing innocence” and described these as ""political statements.""

The letter was sent a day after the redacted version of the Mueller report was made public. But the points in the letter aligned with testimony from Barr himself this week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he said he did not understand why Mueller did not reach a conclusion on the obstruction question.

Flood, in his letter, said ""the one thing the SCO (Special Counsel's Office} was obligated to do is the very thing the SCO -- intentionally and unapologetically -- refused to do. The SCO made neither a prosecution decision nor a declination decision on the obstruction question."" Flood complained that the report was instead “laden with factual information that has never been subjected to adversarial testing or independent analysis.”

He also said Mueller ""produced a prosecutorial curiosity,"" describing the report as ""part 'truth commission' report and part law school exam paper.""

Despite Trump himself claiming the report exonerated him, the document only said Mueller did not find evidence of collusion with Russia while leaving the obstruction question open. Barr determined the obstruction evidence did not constitute a crime, but the report's section on that issue included extensive and damaging details about the president's actions, including the allegation that he told his former White House counsel to have Mueller removed.

Flood took issue with the analysis that Mueller intentionally didn’t issue a conclusion on obstruction, but rather decided to provide information about his investigation so Congress could decide whether to take action, like impeachment.

WHITE HOUSE DENIES DEMS INFO ON SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESS

“By way of justifying this departure, it has been suggested that the report was written with the intent of providing Congress some kind of ‘road map’ for congressional action,” Flood wrote, adding if that’s the case, “it too serves as additional evidence of the [Special Counsel Office’s] refusal to follow applicable law.”

Flood, meanwhile, asserted that Trump waiving executive privilege on the report does not constitute a blanket waiver, as senior aides face subpoenas on Capitol Hill related to the Russia investigation.

The letter comes as the White House has signaled it intends to vigorously oppose subpoenas that might run up against executive privilege, a power sanctioned by the Supreme Court that allows the president and members of the executive branch to shield certain internal communications from disclosure, absent a compelling overriding justification.

“We're fighting all the subpoenas,"" Trump told reporters at the White House last week.

Trump has argued that he has been “transparent” as president and had already turned over documents to Mueller’s team – suggesting it’s not necessary to cooperate with the Democratic probes.

The White House has signaled plans to fight House Democrats' subpoena of testimony and documents from ex-White House counsel Don McGahn. The brewing fight over the McGahn subpoena was poised to set up a series of other contentious legal showdowns as Democrats seek to publicly question more current and former Trump aides who featured prominently Mueller's report on the Russia investigation.

Most of Ford's remaining pollution to stay in Ringwood under cheaper cleanup deal with EPA,https://www.northjersey.com,"['Scott Fallon', 'Published P.M. Et May']",05-06-2019,2019,5,https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/environment/2019/05/06/nj-superfund-site-epa-reaches-21-m-deal-ford-and-ringwood/1122272001/,"CLOSE Drone footage of five Superfund sites in North Jersey, including Edgewater, Garfield, Maywood, Passaic and Hudson Rivers. Tariq Zehawi and Danielle Parhizkaran and Scott Fallon, North Jersey Record

Federal environmental officials reached a $21 million settlement late Monday with Ford Motor Co. and Ringwood on a controversial cleanup of the borough's sprawling Superfund site that will leave tons of polluted soil in place under a barrier.

The agreement filed in U.S. District Court is another step toward affirming a plan that would keep 166,000 tons of contaminated soil at the O'Connor Disposal Area despite the objections of residents who live nearby, including many members of the Ramapough Lenape tribe.

""The fight is not over,"" Vincent Mann, chief of the Ramapough's Turtle Clan, said of the settlement. ""We are going to try everything we can to stop this, because that pollution is going to sit there forever and affect our people, the land, the plants and the animals.""

The pollution dates back a half-century to when contractors for Ford Motor Co. began taking toxic paint sludge from its Mahwah factory and dumping it in the forests and old iron mines of Upper Ringwood next to a low-income neighborhood. At the time, Ringwood officials gave permission to Ford, which is why the borough is also on the hook for the cleanup.

The site has been mismanaged in the past. The EPA declared it clean and removed it from the Superfund list only to reinstate it after a series last decade by The Record showed paint sludge was still strewn across the forested mountains of Ringwood.

Tons of contaminated material has since been excavated from the site.

But the EPA had originally planned to have Ford and the borough pay $32.6 million to remove the contamination at O'Connor, off Peters Mine Road. But at the last minute, Ringwood officials introduced plans to build a new recycling center — paid for by Ford — on an asphalt barrier atop O'Connor.

The move lowered the cleanup's cost by $27.2 million to $5.4 million, drawing both outrage from many who want the pollution removed and support from some residents who fear that a costly cleanup would significantly raise their property taxes. Story continues below gallery

EPA officials have said they have no control over local land use and have little choice but to allow the recycling center to be built despite originally calling for excavation. They said the barrier would be protective of human health.

The $21 million settlement would also pay to cap Cannon Mine and Peters Mine at the site where Ford contractors dumped waste. In addition, contaminated soil and other material will be removed from around the opening of the pit near Peters Mine.

Although high levels of lead, benzene and arsenic have long contaminated the 500-acre site, it wasn't until spring 2015 that scientists found a new chemical that made them pause in their plans to cap. It was 1,4-dioxane, a colorless solvent that health officials believe causes cancer.

Subsequent tests over the next 18 months found high amounts of 1,4-dioxane in the groundwater and brooks that run from the Ringwood Superfund site to the northern reaches of the Wanaque Reservoir. The chemical has not been detected in the reservoir.

The chemical's discovery prompted some residents to push for a question on the 2016 municipal ballot about the cleanup, in an attempt to overturn the borough's decision on the recycling center. But a state judge ruled against supporters of the measure.

In a news release issued late Monday, EPA officials said they expect to propose a long-term plan to address groundwater contamination, including 1,4-dioxane, later this year.

Under the terms of Monday's settlement, Ford and the borough will pay an estimated $17.6 million for site work and $3.6 million to reimburse the EPA for ""past costs at the site.""

“This important agreement ensures that the responsible parties will perform the work needed to address contamination at Ringwood Mines,” EPA Regional Administrator Pete Lopez said in a statement.

Lopez also said the EPA ""appreciates the dedication and passion of the community members and the members of the Community Advisory Group, whose active engagement on this site has greatly informed our work.”

Mann said the concerns of his people and many others in the community have fallen on deaf ears.

Mann said he has tried twice to request a meeting this year with the state Attorney General's Office because Gov. Phil Murphy has spoken passionately about supporting environmental justice initiatives.

No meeting has been scheduled, Mann said Monday.

""I don't expect there will be one after this,"" he said.

A man, 35-year-old Andrew R. Poppe, was also found dead. The DOJ confirmed Friday he died of a self-inflicted wound.

Documents obtained by Action 2 News earlier this week said all three had wounds consistent with stabbing.

The mother is not a suspect in the investigation, the statement from the DOJ says.

Police had responded to the home to execute a search warrant based on a domestic violence incident the day before, on April 18. The victim victim of the domestic violence said Poppe threatened to kill her and her children if she called police.

On April 19, at 6:59 a.m., Seymour Police attempted to make contact with Poppe by telephone but he did not answer.

About one hour later, the emergency response team forced entry into the home and found the girls and Poppe dead in an upstairs room. An affidavit states that they ""showed no signs of life and each had wounds consistent with that of a stabbing.""

The affidavit states that Poppe had a history of domestic violence. Police records show an arrest in June 2015 for battery/domestic violence.

Police also executed a search warrant after the deaths and seized a cell phone, electronic devices, clothing and documents.

Mattie and Hailey were laid to rest on April 25. Donations are being collected through the Muehl-Boettcher Funeral Home website. CLICK HERE for information on making a donation to the family.

USA TODAY

Jim Ferguson wanted answers.

How was his 91-year-old father, who served in the U.S. Navy in World War II, fatally injured in a Veterans Affairs nursing home, the institution Ferguson had entrusted to care for him?

Huddled around a computer monitor with managers at the VA in Des Moines, Ferguson watched a hallway surveillance video that depicted a chilling blow to his father's head.

“I lost it,” Ferguson told USA TODAY. “I broke down.”

In the video, James “Milt” Ferguson Sr., who had dementia and was legally blind, appears confused. He opens a hallway door, rolls his wheelchair into another resident’s room, then wheels back out. No staff members are visible. He circles around and heads back into the room.

Halfway through the door, his chair flips over backward. Milt Ferguson crashes to the floor, landing on the back of his head. Ferguson said he was told the chair was pushed over by the resident in the room, who can't be seen in the video. As staff members rush to assist him, Ferguson is able to turn over and sit up, but the impact causes massive brain bleeding that will kill him within days.

What later would turn the son’s despair into outrage was what he learned about events leading up to his father wheeling around unsupervised last December, and what happened after he smashed into the floor.

“It’s like my dad died at their hands,” Ferguson said.

Serious problems with resident care have occurred in many VA nursing homes across the nation, including the one where Ferguson was being cared for.

USA TODAY reported in March that inspections by a private contractor hired by the VA found deficiencies that caused ""actual harm"" to veterans at more than half of the 99 VA nursing homes reviewed. The inspections found inadequate supervision or hazardous conditions at 53 of them.

In Des Moines — which received the lowest one star out of five in the VA's own ratings, based on surprise inspections — inspectors found managers did not ensure staff treated residents with dignity or followed basic infection control and prevention measures.

The story of what happened to James Ferguson in Des Moines provides a deeper picture of the care one elderly veteran received. Medical records provided to USA TODAY by his son and legal guardian outline what specialists say was a concerning series of decisions by VA staff, before and after his head injury.

Nine days before, VA caregivers determined Ferguson was a danger to himself and others because his dementia caused him to wander around, agitated. They had him on continuous one-on-one observation with an aide but took him off the strict monitoring when he entered the VA nursing home. There, staff didn't reinstate the heightened observation, despite his repeatedly straying dangerously into other residents' rooms.

After his injury, staff put him back in his wheelchair but did not report the incident to a supervisor for 40 minutes, the records and surveillance video indicate. Ferguson wasn't taken to an emergency room for two hours after that. Then, it took 2½ hours more to send him to a trauma hospital. The time stamp on the video showed the fall occurred at 3:49 p.m., and it wasn't until just before 9 p.m. that Ferguson was taken to the trauma facility.

'A disaster waiting to happen'

Specialists who reviewed Ferguson's medical records at the request of USA TODAY expressed concern about the quality of his care.

""It was definitely a disaster waiting to happen, and it did,"" said Robyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a Washington-based nonprofit advocacy organization.

""I just am really struck by the predictability with his repeated episodes of going into other people's rooms,"" she said. ""They should have had some intervention so they could provide him with adequate supervision and address the wandering.""

Grant said the length of time it took afterward to evaluate and diagnose the severity of his injury and get him to a trauma facility also raises questions. ""What was happening there, in terms of those delays?"" she said.

VA nursing homes: Feds find 'blatant disregard' for veteran safety

Richard Mollot, executive director since 2005 of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a New York City-based nonprofit advocate of nursing home care improvement, said the shortfalls indicate there was ""very likely"" a lack of skilled or adequately trained staff to meet his needs.

""The point of being in that environment is that you have skilled nursing care and monitoring,"" he said.

Mollot said the reporting delay is particularly concerning. ""How often does this happen that no one's looking at?That's what is so upsetting.""

'All staff acted properly'

A spokesman for the Des Moines VA, Timothy Hippen, said in a statement that a review after the ""untimely death"" concluded ""all staff acted properly.""

""Any time an unexpected death occurs, VA Central Iowa Health Care System reviews its policies and procedures to see if changes are warranted,"" he said. ""We did that here, finding that all staff acted properly.""

In response to questions about the case, national VA spokesman Curt Cashour accused USA TODAY of focusing on ""isolated complaints"" and ""cherry-picking the experiences of a handful of veterans to create the impression of a broad problem.""

Cashour maintained that, overall, VA nursing homes ""compare closely"" with non-VA facilities. More than 40,000 veterans rely on care at the agency’s 134 nursing facilities each year.

USA TODAY reported last year that about 70% of VA nursing homes scored worse than non-VA nursing homes on a majority of quality indicators tracked by the agency, which include rates of infection, serious pain and bed sores.

Hippen declined to respond to detailed questions about Ferguson's case.

""We will not be addressing the specifics of this case publicly, but we have been in direct contact with the veteran’s family to discuss their concerns,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson said he remains upset even though VA officials shared the surveillance video with him and said they were sorry about what happened to his father. He wants VA staff held accountable. He wants to make sure policies are in place so it doesn't happen to anyone else.

“No one should live their life like that and have what happened to him in the end,” he said. “I want this to be the last person this happens to.”

A gambler called ‘booger’

Even as his dementia worsened, Milt Ferguson flashed glimmers of his younger self.

The former deckhand on the heavy cruiser USS Pensacola was affectionately known as “booger” at The Des Moines Register, where he worked bundling newspapers for 23 years before retiring in 1995. He loved to play the slots and the horses.

On a note in his medical record, a nurse practitioner wrote: “Patient laughs when his nickname is mentioned.” Jim Ferguson had come for a visit that day, as he did most days. “He was smiling and appeared to be enjoying his son’s company,” the medical record said.

The decision to place him in a nursing home had been a gut-wrenching one, Ferguson said. He had moved in with his parents and cared for them for three years. But in April 2018 his mother died. He said a VA social worker told him his father needed more intensive, round-the-clock care and supervision.

“They made it sound like, well, if he got hurt, I could be charged with a crime,” Ferguson said. “So that’s when I decided to place him in a nursing home.”

‘His dementia was acting up’

Ferguson moved his father to Bishop Drumm Retirement Center, a private facility in Johnston, where his mother was a nursing assistant in the Alzheimer’s unit for more than 20 years before retiring.

The center took in Milt Ferguson last August. But three months later, his condition worsened.

""The day before Thanksgiving, I got a call from Bishop Drumm — his dementia was acting up,"" his son said.

He hit two staff members, was “agitated all day” and was “wandering into other residents' room(s), causing distress,” a nurse later noted in his medical record. “He is generally ‘sweet’ so this is a departure from his usual behavior.”

Ferguson was taken by ambulance to the Des Moines VA Medical Center, where he was admitted to the acute psychiatry ward. He was put on one-on-one observation with a sitter — an aide tasked with intervening if he lashed out or tried to stray into other patients’ rooms.

They adjusted his medications, and, after a few outbursts, he appeared calm enough after three weeks to transfer into the VA nursing home on the medical center’s campus.

But there was a catch, a psychiatric nurse wrote in his record: ""Veterans are not put on sitter status over there.""

‘Help me, help me’

After a 22-hour trial period without a sitter, Milt Ferguson moved in to the VA nursing home.

Problems began within hours.

He hardly slept, he hallucinated, he called out ""help me, help me"" over and over. He was agitated, and again he ""wandered into and out of peers' rooms"" day after day, nursing staff wrote in his record.

They gave him medication. Sometimes he calmed down. Sometimes he didn’t.

A psychiatrist was managing his case remotely. According to public records, the doctor worked at a VA facility a few hours away in Lincoln, Nebraska. Through virtual appointments, the psychiatrist advised changes to Ferguson's medication.

On December 19, a week after Ferguson moved in, nursing home staff noted he was still restless and anxious, pacing and screaming and yelling. His care team — psychiatrist, primary care doctor, nursing staff and social workers — met to discuss the case.

The psychiatrist said a review of his records showed ""increased confusion with wandering"" in the past week. The doctor prescribed higher dosages of a mood-stabilizing drug and a sedative. There was no discussion of closer supervision or reinstatement of one-on-one observation, the records show.

“Will ask RN to contact this MD in one week with update,” the psychiatrist wrote.

By then, Ferguson would be dead.

‘A golf ball-sized lump’

On December 20, when two aides rushed to help Milt Ferguson, his head on the floor and legs crumpled to the side, the time stamp on the hallway surveillance video reads 3:49 p.m. But in a report filled out an hour later, a nurse recorded the time of the accident as 4:30 p.m.

His records do not indicate what the staff did with Ferguson during the 41 minutes in between, aside from putting him back in his wheelchair.

By that time, he had a “golf ball-sized lump on the back of his head.” The nurse notified the manager on duty, a nurse practitioner, who wrote at 5:06 p.m. that he had ordered an immediate CT scan of his head.

That didn’t happen until about 6:30 p.m., when Ferguson arrived in the emergency department of the medical center on the Des Moines VA campus, on a bed wheeled by a nursing home aide. The aide said Ferguson had earlier been taken for a CT scan but was uncooperative.

An emergency room doctor had a sedative administered, and the scan was completed. By that point, the World War II veteran had a “large bleed” in the back right side of his brain that was so acute, the CT report says, his brain had shifted to the left inside his skull.

Sent 'to scanning’

The doctor notified MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center, a trauma hospital, at 7 p.m. For nearly two hours, the doctor tried to keep Ferguson comfortable and his blood pressure under control until an ambulance arrived and took Ferguson to Mercy at 8:55 p.m.

The doctor also kept calling Ferguson’s son, leaving voicemails.

But Jim Ferguson had himself been admitted to a hospital and had provided the VA nursing home with a consent form authorizing staff to contact a close friend if anything happened to his father. That form had been sent ""to scanning” that morning.

When Jim Ferguson retrieved all the voicemails, he rushed to Mercy the next morning.

""He was not responsive. He was laying on his bed, making this horrible noise as they sucked saliva out of his mouth,"" he said. ""I never even got to say any last words to my dad.""

He died the next day.

Specialists who reviewed the case at the request of USA TODAY singled out multiple shortfalls in his care at the VA that may have affected the outcome.

Grant, policy director at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, said the 22-hour trial of having no sitter was ""not enough time to establish how he was doing.""

When he then acted out day after day in agitation and confusion, caregivers should not have allowed him to wander into other residents' rooms, she said. Such incidents can cause the other residents to lash out in fear or distress and ""lead to an altercation or violence or striking out.""

""One would argue that could have been prevented,"" she said. ""There should have been somebody somewhere who could have seen that this happened and — particularly when he wheeled himself — to have gone in and intervened: 'Let me help you. Let's go to your room.'""

Mollot, executive director at the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said meeting the standards of care means staff identifies risks and needs and ways to meet them and mitigate them and does so consistently.

""This is exactly the kind of thing that happens when those standards are not followed,"" he said.

'A safe place'

The spokesman for the Des Moines VA, while declining to answer detailed questions about what happened, said that in general, ""caring for nursing home residents involves balancing patients’ independence with the need for supervision, as appropriate.""

""While tight scrutiny and strict limits on residents’ activities and freedom of movement could possibly lower the risk for adverse events, it would also severely degrade patients’ quality of life, which is precisely what we are trying to preserve for as long as possible,"" he said.

Jim Ferguson still has his father’s wheelchair in the garage. He keeps the sweatshirt his father was wearing when he last used the chair. Ferguson has retained a lawyer, Brad Biren, to help him figure out next steps and how to hold the VA accountable.

“Somebody didn’t watch my dad and let him die,” he said. “It’s supposed to be a safe place.”
