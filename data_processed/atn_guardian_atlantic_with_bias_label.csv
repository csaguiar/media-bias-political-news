2017-04-03,0,tony blair has accused labour of failing the british people by not being an effective opposition as he slammed the ultra left takeover of the party ask yourself one simple question he said in the prime minister s office in tory high command how much of their time do they spend worrying about the prospect of a labour victory at the present time i would guess zero we have got to make them wake up every morning and fear us the former leader s comments were made in an interview with the labour mps ruth smeeth and wes streeting for progress magazine blair said that the current incarnation of the party under jeremy corbyn s leadership was putting principle before power and that labour has only won when it has been at the cutting edge of modernity a lurch to the left between 1979 and 1983 had cratered the labour party the former prime minister said i do not want to depress you but there is a big difference between the 80s and now in the 1980s the ultra left never took control they tried but they failed the moment when denis healey beat tony benn was the moment when the labour party was saved asked how labour could remain relevant blair replied urgency because politics moves faster today and brexit it is the defining moment in british history we have to say the government s got a mandate to negotiate brexit but we are going to hold them to account that it is not going to damage jobs that it is not going to damage the economy his latest comments follow an attack on labour in february in which he accused a debilitated party of allowing brexit to happen i hate to say that but it is true he said what this means is that we have to build a movement which stretches across party lines and devise new ways of communication in his first major intervention since the referendum blair declared in february that it was his mission to persuade the uk to stay in the eu calling for remain supporters to rise up in defence of what we believe the people voted without knowledge of the true terms of brexit he said as these terms become clear it is their right to change their mind our mission is to persuade them to do so while he was forming an institute to make the case against brexit at any cost blair denied he was considering creating a new centrist political party it was necessary to raise the alarm about the jumble of contradictions in theresa may s arguments for brexit according to blair they are not driving this bus they are being driven he said we will trigger article 50 not because we now know our destination but because the politics of not doing so would alienate those driving the bus the surreal nature of the exercise is enhanced by the curious absence of a big argument as to why this continues to be a good idea blair s position contrasts sharply with that of corbyn who took the decision to order his mps to vote in favour of the government s brexit bill in february four shadow cabinet ministers resigned so they could be among the 47 labour mps to vote against brexit the liberal democrat leader tim farron and nick clegg the former deputy prime minister and now his party s brexit spokesman have welcomed blair s intervention in the debate farron said in february blair s speech shows how badly corbyn s labour has failed as an opposition labour have waved the white flag and given theresa may a blank cheque for a divisive hard brexit
2017-06-25,0,here is our main story about the debate and here is john crace s sketch that is all from me for tonight thanks for the comments nigel farage the former ukip leader is claiming the audience was biased against ukip he also says bbc executives should be sacked because of this although if you watch the video of him saying this on his lbc show instead of just listening you might detect a smile on his face as he is saying this that suggests at least it did to me that he knows he is not really being serious at this point and ukip has put out a press notice headed powerful and courageous performance by ukip leader it quotes the ukip deputy leader peter whittle saying it is clear that paul nuttall showed a resolve courage and leadership that has been lacking from the rest of the westminster establishment paul spoke to people in britain who are living in the real world unlike the others he was honest direct and confident about the future of britain despite a blanket of denial from the other speakers he was prepared to talk about the real threats faced by our society he was prepared to call out islamic extremism for what it is rather than simply restate the platitudes we are so used to he was realistic about the impact of immigration on jobs and our public services the lib dem press statement about the debate is causing much merriment in the wood panelled spin room of the cambridge union the first drama of the night came when labour s emily thornberry burst into an interview with tory cabinet minister damian green live on bbc news the work and pensions secretary was among several high profile tories including brexit secretary david davis and culture secretary karen bradley who paced the room speaking to broadcasters about amber rudd s performance but labour sources said thornberry had been scheduled to be on channel 4 news with green until conservatives had told labour they did not want a two way debate stood down thornberry decided to take matters into her own hands and join green s post debate interview live on air lib dem campaign chiefs declared themselves chuffed with tim farron s performance particularly the audience gleeful reception of his final joke that viewers should switch off for rudd s statement and watch bake off instead he smashed it one source said lib dem president sal brinton said farron had needed to make an impact given how little he was recognised by the wider public however if cheers from the crowd were anything to go by it was corbyn who won labour sources said the labour leader had deliberately held back from criticising the prime minister too incessantly for not turning up intending instead to focus on the message of the party s manifesto while smaller parties tore into rudd he is the only person in that room who could be prime minister and so he behaved like one a source said tory sources pointed out however that the labour leader had not mentioned brexit in his opening or closing statements or in his answer about leadership how can you start the negotiations in 11 days time and not mention the biggest issue facing this country one said labour admitted corbyn had not mentioned the issue but said that was a deliberate attempt to have broad resonance he said we are fighting for the many not the few we want a brexit for the many not the few the source said this is from the bbc s esther webber if you are reading this you are a guardian reader and that means you featured in tonight s debate tim farron the lib dem leader said climate change was not just a matter for hair shirt muesli eating guardian readers he said if it is simply for hair shirt muesli eating guardian readers to solve climate change it ain t going to solve the problem we are all stuffed we can make ourselves energy self sufficient in renewable energy the bbc s jeremy vine says he found this puzzling crikey this is just out this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the debate there is no real consensus and even those who are naming a winner seem to concede it was not clear cut on this one it is a case of you pays your money or not in the case of the guardian online although please do sign up to become a member if you have not already from sky s faisal islam from the sunday times tim shipman from itv s robert peston from sky s adam boulton from the mirror s ben glaze from the spectator s james forsyth from the guardian columnist paul mason from buzzfeed s marie le conte from reaction s iain martin from the independent s john rentoul from rosa prince author of biographies of may and corbyn from the ft s jim pickard from the mail on sunday s dan hodges here is the labour party s statement about the debate this is from a spokesperson for jeremy corbyn tonight s debate highlighted the clear choice at this election between a labour party that will invest in and transform our society to build a britain for the many and a conservative party that has held people back and stand only for the few only jeremy corbyn or theresa may will be prime minister after june 8 but tonight in what was effectively a job interview for number 10 only one of the two candidates bothered to turn up theresa may will not even debate her opponents here in the uk in an election she called how on earth can she be trusted to negotiate in europe and get the best deal for the british people jeremy corbyn clearly won the debate he showed himself as a leader who wants to change the country for the better to make it work for the many not just a few by contrast theresa may s refusal to take part showed her weakness it is a sign of a tory campaign which is treating the public with contempt trying to hide from scrutiny they showed tonight they have no answers to the challenges facing britain and that they would make pensioners and working people worse off tonight proved that jeremy corbyn and labour are the only party that will build a britain for the many not the few like any content rich political event a party conference speech a budget a manifesto a debate offers numerous potential lines and it can be hard to work out immediately which ones if any have any lasting significance and a seven way debate to use a technical term employed by the sunday times tim shipman see 8 44pm is a clusterfuck there were not any stand out winners but most attention was focused on jeremy corbyn and he did well his attack on paul nuttall over food banks was one of the highlights of the debate he was authentic and passionate and increasingly the cchq charge that he is an implausible pm seems to look less convincing the other main figure on the stage tonight was amber rudd in a six against one scenario she seemed to hold up quite credibly and she wins the message discipline prize of the night one derided by the media but important nonetheless for her constant jibes about labour s money tree as for the others tim farron had some of the best soundbites of the evening and his final line about not giving theresa may your time because she is not giving hers to you was one of the best lines of the evening caroline lucas predictably and leanne wood a bit less predictably had some outstanding moments their two pronged attack on rudd over the tories being in coalition with ukip see 8 09pm was particularly effective and wood came out with the best put down of the whole evening when she depicted nuttall as someone who would try to divorce his wife without paying we all know about blokes like you see 8 49am angus robertson was particularly effective when it came to challenging nuttall on migration and even paul nuttall was better than he was in last week s debate although as the only leave voter on the panel it is hard to credit how he ended up representing over 50 of the country there may not have been a winner but there was a loser may herself long after we have all forgotten anything that was said last night we will remember that may did not show up earlier i wrote that it seemed to make sense for a pm with a lead in the polls to avoid a debate like this see 2 57pm now i am not so sure david cameron managed to wriggle out of one of the debates in 2015 but it went ahead without a conservative and they called it a challengers debate as if that was an established constitutional norm no one particularly noticed that cameron had stayed at home but when rudd tried to answer the question about leadership by praising the abilities of someone who was not even there see 8 51pm may s absence was transparent and not particularly explicable perhaps voters will decide they do not mind very much but if may s ratings continue to slide even further this will inevitably be seen as a contributing factor nuttall says tonight was like groundhog day ukip will always be the outsider but it has been proven right on brexit on immigration on grammar schools and on protecting services lucas says the country stands at at crossroads one more mp from the other parties but more green mps would be transformative corbyn says the real choice is between a labour government and a conservative one vote labour for the many not the few robertson says this is about the kind of country we should be the snp will always work with others to make the country better wood says plaid is the only party putting wales on the agenda but plaid mps will stand up for the whole of the uk she urges people to give them the mandate to allow them to stand up for wales farron says rudd is coming up next the pm could not be bothered to turn up bake off is coming up next make yourself a brew you are not worth her time so do not give her yours rudd says the government needs to be at its strongest to take the uk through brexit only may can do that and thats it verdicts reaction and a summary coming up next this is from the sun s matt dathan robertson says may is the u turn queen that is not the leadership we require he says the snp are the third party at westminster and provide the real opposition he says farron says may should have turned up for the debate he says he grew up in preston he saw what it meant when people were brought up in poverty
2017-06-25,0,the russian government is suspected of being behind a cyber attack on parliament that breached dozens of email accounts belonging to mps and peers although the investigation is at an early stage and the identity of those responsible may prove impossible to establish with absolute certainty moscow is deemed the most likely culprit the disclosure follows the release of the first details of the sustained cyber attack that began on friday fewer than 90 email accounts belonging to parliamentarians are believed to have been hacked a parliamentary spokesman said amid fears that the breach could lead to blackmail attempts officials were forced to lock mps out of their own email accounts as they scrambled to minimise the damage from the incident the network affected is used by every mp including theresa may the prime minister and her cabinet ministers for dealing with constituents the british security services believe that responsibility for the attack is more likely to lie with another state rather than a small group of individual hackers the number of states who might mount such an attack on the uk is limited and in addition to russia includes north korea china and iran a security source said it was a brute force attack it appears to have been state sponsored the nature of cyber attacks means it is notoriously difficult to attribute an incident to a specific actor mps contacted by the guardian said the immediate suspicion had fallen upon foreign governments such as russia and north korea both of which have been accused of being behind hacking attempts in the uk before in may russia was linked to the hacking of france s computer systems during the presidential campaign taking data from emmanuel macron s campaign and leaking it to the public us officials have previously said they were seeking to share their experience of the 2016 presidential election where us intelligence agencies concluded that russia hacked and leaked democratic party communications and disseminated fake news with the aim of getting donald trump elected the attack on the houses of parliament sought to gain access to accounts protected by weak passwords the estate s digital services team said they had made changes to accounts to block out the hackers and that the changes could mean staff were unable to access their emails a parliamentary spokesman said those whose emails were compromised had used weak passwords despite advice to the contrary investigations are ongoing but it has become clear that significantly fewer than 1 of the 9 000 accounts on the parliamentary network have been compromised as a result of the use of weak passwords that did not conform to guidance issued by the parliamentary digital service as they are identified the individuals whose accounts have been compromised have been contacted and investigations to determine whether any data has been lost are under way he said it comes just over a month after 48 of england s nhs trusts were hit by a cyber attack britain s national cyber security centre ncsc is understood to have played a leading role in investigating the wannacry malware that affected the nhs and other organisations in may and concluded that a north korean hacking team had been responsible an ncsc spokesperson said the ncsc is aware of the incident and is working around the clock with the uk parliamentary digital security team to understand what has happened and advise on the necessary mitigating actions the ncsc which started its operations in october last year is the public face of the uk s secret surveillance agency gchq which works closely with the us national security agency both are engaged in hacking targets in russia china north korea and elsewhere around the world conservative mp andrew bridgen said such an attack absolutely could leave some people open to blackmail constituents want to know the information they send to us is completely secure he said liam fox the international trade secretary connected the news to reports that cabinet ministers passwords were for sale online we know that our public services are attacked so it is not at all surprising that there should be an attempt to hack into parliamentary emails he said and it is a warning to everybody whether they are in parliament or elsewhere that they need to do everything possible to maintain their own cybersecurity an email sent to all those affected seen by the guardian said earlier this morning we discovered unusual activity and evidence of an attempted cyber attack on our computer network closer investigation by our team confirmed that hackers were carrying out a sustained and determined attack on all parliamentary user accounts in an attempt to identify weak passwords these attempts specifically were trying to gain access to our emails we have been working closely with the national cyber security centre to identify the method of the attack and have made changes to prevent the attackers gaining access however our investigation continues the changes are believed to have stopped mps and their offices from accessing emails on mobile phones and tablets outside westminster access to systems from the westminster estate has not been affected the email said before adding that further disruption was likely the latest attack was publicly revealed by liberal democrat peer lord rennard on twitter as he asked his followers to send any urgent messages to him by text angela rayner labour s shadow education secretary also tweeted if you try and contact me by my parliamentary email address then l will not be able to respond currently this is due to a cyber attack henry smith the tory mp said sorry no parliamentary email access today we are under cyber attack from kim jong un putin or a kid in his mom s basement or something the government s national security strategy said in 2015 that the threat from cyber attacks from both organised crime and foreign intelligence agencies was one of the most significant risks to uk interests the national crime agency said it was working with the ncsc but the centre was leading the operational response
2017-06-10,0,on thursday it will be exactly two years since jeremy corbyn with only minutes to spare secured the backing of the 35 mps required to launch his labour leadership bid so unsure was his small team that he would be able to muster enough parliamentary signatures that they drafted two press releases one in the event that he made the ballot the other that he did not the latter denouncing mps for preventing a proper debate was jettisoned amid much relief a curious mix of old style rallies and online activism by a small team of digital savvy supporters caused his humble campaign to flourish into a political uprising that floored the labour establishment his team were repeatedly told that their plans to win over young voters at a general election with the same mix of town hall campaigning and online activism would deliver only humiliation and a tory landslide while the debate over may s failings and the importance of strong campaigns by labour mps will rage for weeks many of corbyn s fiercest critics are happily admitting he proved them wrong labour did not win the election despite all the doubts however it appears that corbyn s vow to go after the traditionally unreliable electoral support of the young paid off in many areas it was helped by the underestimated skills of a group of aides and supporters who had been battle hardened by almost two years of perpetual campaigning those involved in the campaign who spoke to the observer said young voters were reached with new campaigning techniques both online and on the ground deployed by both labour hq and a merry band of corbyn supporting groups they also all said however that there was one factor that made the whole thing work corbyn s unspun personality and his willingness to be upfront about his beliefs the spirit of that last minute leadership bid is still in the minds of some of those he has energised said one young activist who gave up a day of work to turn out voters in westminster north a marginal seat that labour held he clearly did not want to get into power he spoke about things he cared about because he had nothing to lose he just wanted to broaden the debate and suddenly people felt like someone was being honest for the first time while there is no hard data yet on the turnout of 18 to 24 year olds only 43 of whom voted in 2015 there is already a clear pattern of turnouts increasing significantly in areas with many young voters labour also did best where turnout increased the most they came out for corbyn it is believed that the young had a hand in key victories including in sheffield leeds and canterbury so how was corbyn s unspun outsider appeal to young voters turned into hard votes against all the odds insiders insist there was no magic bullet but two pieces of obscure software developed by labour hq are widely acknowledged to have played a significant role the first helped turn a swollen base of activists into proper campaigners called chatter it allowed labour s growing base of activists to have proper text exchanges with people they canvassed rather than dispatching them blunt campaigning messages it armed campaigners with the ability to actually make people feel like they were being listened to on a local level said a senior labour figure the second was the closest thing labour had to a secret weapon over the last year the party developed a tool called promote its effect was to unleash the power of facebook advertising to local parties across every constituency the tool combined facebook information with labour s voter data but allowed senior activists and candidates to use it to send locally based messages to the right sections of their electorates labour is said to have spent heavily through the tool people were seeing stories about their school and hospital not just national messaging like the tories were doing said a campaign source it has played in to the fact that people felt labour s message was authentic and speaking to them and their lives you see that in things like the polling on what policies people recall they recalled positive offers from the labour party and negative things about the conservatives there was also a successful voter suppression drive a tactic designed to stop supporters of rival parties from turning out labour had been gifted such an issue with the so called tory dementia tax on care costs attack ads on the issue were dispatched far and wide to 200 seats crucial to the online campaign most labour insiders now say was the leaking of the labour manifesto days before it was due to be released in contrast to the dull negativity of the tories it had a packed programme of promises when the manifesto leaked people were talking about the policies and they had wall to wall coverage said matt zarb cousin corbyn s former spokesman and a leading advocate online it was brilliant he was much more recognised as an opposition leader than ed miliband people were interested in the manifesto and it was costed while labour insiders said the leak did not come from the top the communications director seumas milne was seen in a serious panic when news of the leak broke its release was a moment when the campaign switched away from brexit and on to austerity but corbyn s unusual appeal and status as an outsider meant that there was suddenly a huge amount of online coverage the party did not have to pay for it secured a coveted prize of organic sharing online users deciding to pass on campaign material to their friends and family voluntarily the tories spent vast amounts on digital advertising and local newspaper ads but it was so negative that they got hardly any organic sharing no one wanted to be associated with those messages said a senior campaign figure a video of corbyn interjecting during theresa may s facebook live chat on itv received 4 million views corbyn challenging may to a debate reached 1 4 million people a video on may s security record reached 2 3 million people as for the old school rallies corbyn addressed 100 000 voters at 90 events during the campaign it was the symbolism and energy of the events however that gave them significance just before the election there were the six simultaneous rallies very traditional in style said a senior figure clearly that is a few thousand people who are highly committed and go to rallies but then the video of the events reached over 2 million people and then there were the unofficial helpers from momentum the campaign set up out of corbyn s leadership bid during the campaign they were boosted by support given by figures from bernie sanders us presidential bid grayson lookner jeremy parkin kim mcmurray and erika uyterhoeven were sanders staffers who offered advice in activist training sessions focusing on sending activists to the right places and ensuring people turned out training sessions took place in london sheffield hull and elsewhere its mynearestmarginal com site was used by more than 100 000 people we reached out way beyond our own bubble we have 24 000 members said adam klug one of the central momentum team they revamped the phone canvassing app they had used for corbyn s leadership campaign to get people out on the doorstep there was also a volunteer army of film makers and video editors making viral social media content one edgy film daddy why do you hate me received 7m views we are a smaller bureaucracy so we can get things signed off but we ran a clean positive empowering campaign klug said the dual attack of labour s official campaign and corbyn s personal activists was mirrored in labour s london hq on election night while staffers were toiling away on the eighth floor on a diet of tea and pizza more raucous corbyn supporters were already partying on the second floor the get out the vote effort was clearly effective in some areas volunteers signed up online to help and were dispatched to a nearby marginal seat sometimes via the momentum mynearestmarginal com and electiondaypledge com sites it was like clockwork said one volunteer directed to the westminster north marginal she went to the front room of someone who knew she was coming and told her the exact door numbers to knock on and what time to knock several sources said so many volunteers flooded the constituency that some had to be sent elsewhere tariq persaud parkes is an activist and branch secretary in hastings and rye where the home secretary amber rudd s majority dropped from almost 5 000 to 346 we had 10 times more activists than in 2015 he said momentum activists were at the college and the university signing people up left right and centre they got about 2 000 people registered to vote the whole corbyn gamble had been facilitated by a huge voter registration drive while many of the attempts to sign up the young were non partisan the connection between the enthusiasm to sign up and support for corbyn is clear to many of those involved a flurry of interest from leading artists in the grime music scene gave the movement new impetus and a viral outsider appeal that complemented corbyn s non mainstream political message his online interview with the rapper jme was widely shared backing from stormzy and rapper akala followed it led on to endorsements from other parts of the music world nme and kerrang magazine stormzy s endorsement was more of a side effect although it probably did help with turnout said fraser watt a campaigns officer for london young labour structural factors are more important labour appealed to a generation that came of age during the financial crisis josh cole from the non partisan rizeup voter registration campaign said the political landscape has changed a lot and a lot of people probably looked at the result of the eu referendum and wished they had been a part of it we are not falling for that again we are getting involved the choices are also clear an extreme right wing and an extreme left wing the choice on the table was simple to understand simon woolley director and one of the founders of operation black vote said that independent endorsements for corbyn had helped to empower the young and black and ethnic minority communities what we did with some significant success was work on voter registration he said in croydon there was a fantastic turnout an area with a bme voter base of 32 000 in that seat a minister was ousted klug added the word apathy is thrown at young people when really they feel they are not represented jeremy and this manifesto really cut through young people saw tuition fees investment in social care housing education a vision for society that they believed in and that they would benefit from
2017-03-29,0,this letter sets out the deep and special partnership we hope to enjoy as your closest friend and neighbour with the european union once we leave the dear donald letter begins warmly almost lovingly as the prime minister makes clear she does not want to weaken europe by leaving it the use of the word special usually reserved for trips to washington suggests she wants to emulate the transatlantic alliance but at more of an arm s length distance than before we want to make sure that europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values leading in the world and defending itself from security threats we therefore believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the european union though the language remains constructive this is a much more controversial veiled threat in eliding britain s security responsibilities with its desire for economic gain so explicitly may will be accused of holding a fearful continent to ransom give us your markets or we will leave you at the mercy of terrorists and russians we will of course continue to fulfil our responsibilities as a member state while we remain a member of the european union and the legislation we propose will not come into effect until we leave there is an unspoken climbdown here earlier talk of restricting the residency rights of new eu immigrants as soon as article 50 was invoked has been quietly dropped by postponing any changes to their legal status until march 2019 at the earliest may has avoided inflaming tensions further it is the expectation of the government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision making power of each devolved administration there are not many carrots offered to scotland in the letter but this is one of them a reminder that when powers return from brussels many of them will go to holyrood as well as westminster whether the opportunity to make fisheries and forestry policy for example will compensate for losing the single market is another matter if however we leave the european union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on world trade organisation terms may was careful not to repeat her threat of walking away without a deal in her speech to the house of commons but here it is towards the top of the letter as a negotiating gambit it is perhaps essential to show britain has other options but it will raise fears again at home that the government really believes it can walk away with nothing from the talks in security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened just in case the earlier veiled threat was not explicit enough may rams home the point that europe needs britain s spooks and soldiers there are echoes of trump in the hint that the western military and security alliance comes at an economic price less so the founding principles of nato we also know that uk companies will as they trade within the eu have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part just as uk companies do in other overseas markets there were hints of wriggle room here from may on the vexed question on whether the european court of justice has ultimate jurisdiction over free trade within europe the brits seem to be suggesting this can stop at the border in her speech may promised to put an end to the jurisdiction of the european court of justice in britain perhaps this means it can kick in at dover and govern international trade without touching the domestic third rail we will need to discuss how we determine a fair settlement of the uk s rights and obligations as a departing member state in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the united kingdom s continuing partnership with the eu another more emollient sounding message here on the question of the divorce bill with the threat of haggling over the cd collection still contained within we will pay something but not anything the brits seem to be saying do not get clever with the lawyers the point is we are leaving is the kicker the free trade agreement between the united kingdom and the european union should be of greater scope and ambition than any such agreement before it so that it covers sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries may again helps herself to a big slice of cake here with little sign of how she intends to reconcile it with eu priorities the real haggling over trade is still to come but the prime minister again insists she can strike one of the deepest free trade deals in history in one of the shortest time frames imaginable and still have room for cherries and icing on top perhaps now more than ever the world needs the liberal democratic values of europe we want to play our part to ensure that europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world projecting its values and defending itself from security threats i can help you deal with donald trump europe s security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the cold war but you also need me to keep vladimir putin at bay the united kingdom s objectives for our future partnership remain those set out in my lancaster house speech of 17 january and the subsequent white paper published on 2 february i really meant that bit about walking way without a deal
2017-06-09,0,jeremy corbyn said the face of british politics had changed and called on theresa may to resign after her snap general election left britain with a hung parliament 11 days before brexit talks begin speaking as he was returned as mp for islington north the labour leader declared politics has changed politics is not going back into the box where it was before what is happened is people have said they have had quite enough of austerity politics corbyn said may had called the election to assert her authority she wanted a mandate well the mandate she is got is lost conservative seats lost votes lost support and lost confidence i would have thought that is enough for her to go the conservative leader appeared crushed as she accepted her victory in the constituency of maidenhead with a shaky speech in which she repeated her resolve to provide the stability the country needed before brexit talks if the conservative party has won the most seats and most votes then it will be incumbent that we will have that period of stability and that is what we will do she said but her long term future remained uncertain by the early hours of friday morning pressure was mounting on the prime minister as tory mp anna soubry broke ranks to say may should consider her position it is bad she is in a very difficult place it was a dreadful night i ve lost some excellent and remarkable friends she said this is a very bad moment for the conservative party and we need to take stock and our leader needs to take stock senior conservative sources said recriminations were already beginning among cabinet ministers with david davis singled out by some of his colleagues for pressing may to gamble on holding the snap poll there are a lot of very very pissed off people in the cabinet and with him in particular said one the former chancellor george osborne described it as a catastrophic result while another conservative mp said she needs to go the tight result first indicated in a shock exit poll on thursday night that showed the conservatives likely to be the largest party in a hung parliament represented a disastrous night for may shortly before 6am on friday labour held two key seats in southampton to bring its total to 258 so far and deny the conservatives the possibility of securing a majority it was projected the tories would end up with fewer than 320 seats the failure of the prime minister s election gamble taken when the party was more than 20 points ahead in the polls triggered uncertainty on the eve of brexit talks causing a drop in the value of sterling speaking from his home in islington north london shortly after midnight the labour leader said whatever the final result we have already changed the face of british politics labour secured a first ever win in the previously safe conservative seat of canterbury and also took control of peterborough which was one of the brexit capitals of the country there were also gains for corbyn s party in battersea stockton south bury north and vale of clwyd a difficult night for the snp delivered one of the biggest scalps with the party s westminster leader angus robertson losing his seat in moray the former lib dem leader and deputy prime minister nick clegg spoke out about the need for the government to be sensitive about huge societal divisions as he was defeated by labour in sheffield hallam the party s leader tim farron hung on to his seat in cumbria while vince cable regained the twickenham seat he lost in 2015 the conservative minister ben gummer a close ally of the prime minister and a key author of the party s manifesto lost in ipswich while the financial secretary to the treasury jane ellison was defeated in battersea south west london the home secretary amber rudd faced a recount in a tight race in hastings but just held on it was a bad night for ukip in which the party s leader paul nuttall came third in boston and skegness and it was crushed in its former seat of clacton the foreign secretary boris johnson said the conservatives had to listen to constituents as his own majority fell but bookies also slashed the odds of him becoming the next tory leader the shock result came after a gruelling seven week battle in which supporters of corbyn flocked to almost 100 rallies across the country in a vibrant and energetic campaign the labour leader ended a tour of several seats starting in glasgow on the final day of campaigning with a speech on the edge of his constituency in islington where he said that labour s anti austerity message represented the new centre ground of british politics corbyn sustained a string of attacks from conservatives and also parts of the media with a number of newspapers calling on their readers to reject him in thursday s poll john mcdonnell the shadow chancellor hit out at the negative and nasty tactics of his opponents insisting labour had stuck to upbeat arguments i think it does change the nature of political discourse i think people have got fed up with the yah boo politics and some of the nasty tactics that have gone on recently earlier he told the guardian that may s general election campaign in which he and corbyn were accused of being terrorist sympathisers was an exact reflection of zac goldsmith s conservative bid to become london mayor which triggered anger and accusations of dog whistle politics may s effort was seen as more turbulent given her u turn over social care plans and the decision to base the entire thrust of the campaign on her character appearing to backfire recriminations focused on the party s manifesto which caused division at the top of the party holding on to his seat with a big majority the labour deputy leader tom watson said it looks likely to be a very bad result for theresa may she said it is a fact that if we lose just six seats we will lose our majority and jeremy corbyn will become prime minister we do not yet know the final result but we intend to hold her to that fears that hung parliament projected would delay brexit negotiations sent the pound plunging in the minutes following the exit poll publication the pound fell as much as 2 to 1 27 the lowest level in six weeks but then stabilised while dealers awaited the first actual results jeremy cook the chief economist at world first said that if the exit poll proved to be correct it could drive sterling to 1 24 although not as low as the levels it plunged to following the brexit vote almost a year ago one insider in labour hq known as south side said an entire floor had been converted into several war rooms scattered with whiteboards television screens and lists of seats gathered there were key figures such as labour s general secretary iain mcnicol and key corbyn advisers including seumas milne his deputy steve howell and the author of the manifesto andrew fisher conservative advisers had appeared relatively confident about winning a majority as they headed into the final 24 hours privately they were discussing the potential for a reshuffle of may s team on friday rather than mulling over the possibility of her exiting downing street may would not be drawn on what scale of majority she would consider a success but said on tuesday that she was feeling good about the campaign the senior election team gathered at party headquarters in matthew parker street in westminster claiming at first that it was early days but later failing to speak out at all the prime minister s election campaign was dominated by visits to labour held seats in areas considered to be the party s heartlands such as the west midlands yorkshire and the north east while david cameron spent much of the 2015 battle in liberal democrat tory marginals may s tour included the ultra safe labour seat of birmingham ladywood launching a battlebus in north shields and unveiling her manifesto in halifax which last turned conservative in 1983 earlier one labour candidate said colleagues were feeling downbeat with fears of a 100 plus majority for may but they later admitted they had been wrong the campaign was heavily affected by the two devastating terror attacks in manchester and london bridge which moved security questions up the agenda with accusations being thrown in all directions the lib dems acknowledged they had faced a difficult campaign in which an expected fightback failed to come to fruition the party s hardline anti brexit position had cut through less than was hoped as domestic issues such as the nhs and schooling and the fallout of two terror attacks dominated however there were some pleasing gains for the party during polling day there were reports of students from keele university being turned away at polling stations in the ultra marginal newcastle under lyme constituency the labour candidate there paul farrelly who was under pressure after ukip stepped aside to help the conservatives defeat him reacted angrily to reports that hundreds could have been affected by a failure to update the registration data the electoral services department here in newcastle is a shambles and there is chaos which is denying people votes on a scale unprecedented in my 30 years fighting and organising elections said farrelly who is defending a majority of just 650 in a seat where ukip won more than 7 000 votes in 2015
2017-01-12,0,fresh legal challenges aimed at preventing a hard brexit will be launched this month as mps craft parliamentary amendments in the hope of securing a second vote on any final deal with the european union ireland s courts will host an ambitious crowdfunded attempt to refer an appeal to the eu s highest tribunal about whether the process of brexit is reversible a letter before action is being sent to the irish government on friday and it is intended that the application will go before judges in dublin in the spring meanwhile the high court in london will hear a claim brought by two sets of claimants arguing that the uk should remain in the european economic area after brexit the challenge is likely to be heard during the week after next no date has yet been confirmed for the supreme court s verdict on the article 50 challenge which the government is widely expected to lose the 11 justices will rule on whether ministers can use their powers under the royal prerogative to inform brussels officially that the uk intends to leave the eu or whether parliamentary sovereignty means that an act is required ministers are understood to be preparing legislation so that parliament can approve triggering brexit it is expected to pass despite europhile opposition in both houses the main claimant before the dublin courts will be jolyon maugham qc a london tax specialist who is coordinating efforts to argue that article 50 of the lisbon treaty which formally begins a country s exit from the eu can be reversed if a country changes its mind and decides not to leave maugham who has rights of audience in dublin said the uk must retain sovereignty over the shape of its future relationship with the eu if we change our minds we must be able to withdraw the notice without needing the consent of the other 27 member states i want to establish clarity for british voters and deliver sovereignty to the british parliament over the question of its future relationship with its biggest trading partner he said elected politicians may join him in the case as plaintiffs in the space of a few days his crowdfunding campaign raised 70 000 largely in donations of 50 or less british judges and claimants have so far been reluctant to refer questions about brexit to eu judges in luxembourg maugham s challenge nominally against the irish government will try to persuade irish judges to refer the question of article 50 s revocability to the european court of justice ecj if the ecj were to rule that article 50 is revocable it would enable the uk to reject the outcome of brexit negotiations should they not prove acceptable to parliament or voters and remain in the eu the high court case in london about staying in the european economic area was initiated by peter wilding and adrian yalland wilding runs the pro single market organisation british influence a group of four anonymous claimants a mix of overseas eu eea and uk nationals have joined the judicial review challenge claiming that separate parliamentary approval is needed to quit the eea article 127 of the eea agreement requires contracting parties which include the uk to give at least 12 months notice before leaving the claimants point out they say that implies a separate departure process from the one set out in article 50 of the eu treaty that has been disputed in the supreme court opponents of hard brexit hope to use defeat for the government in the supreme court as an opportunity to build momentum even if most accept that the invocation of article 50 is inevitable in the house of commons the labour party is confident of tabling a procedural amendment that might attach conditions such as an agreement for parliament to review whatever exit deal is achieved towards the end of the two year process the liberal democrats and scottish nationalist party are expected to attempt more radical amendments a labour source said its aim was to find something that would garner tory support and pass rather than making what it viewed as more symbolic gestures similar discussions are under way in the house of lords where cross benchers and pro european tories have held meetings in recent weeks to discuss whether they would seek amendments of their own these are complicated however by a concern among many peers that any unilateral action in the upper chamber would be branded anti democratic instead the hope is that pressure for another vote among mps before march 2019 will be irresistible particularly if the court has already ruled that they have a right to be consulted at the outset of the process given that the european parliament has demanded that it have a chance to review the deal in good time it would be very hard for the british government to argue that mps should have less say especially since this is all meant to be about returning sovereignty to westminster said hugo young a campaigner for greater transparency in the brexit process

not be the last but our values will prevail shinzo abe the japanese prime minister has offered his condolences a terrorist attack has occurred in the united kingdom i offer my deepest condolences to the victims and extend my sympathy to all those who were wounded terrorism is absolutely intolerable japan stands in solidarity with prime minister may of the united kingdom as well as with its people during this difficult time prime minister may has conveyed the message that the united kingdom is firm in the fight against terrorism japan offers its full support to prime minister may and will combat terrorism in cooperation with the international community the attack outside the houses of parliament in london is the latest in a series of terrorist atrocities involving a vehicle being driven at speed into pedestrians a tactic actively promoted by islamic state in december a man whose asylum claim had been rejected by germany drove a truck into a market in berlin killing 12 last july a stolen truck driven through a bastille day parade in nice killed 86 the strikes appear inspired if not actively commissioned by isis in iraq and syria in november a student used a vehicle and knives to injure 13 on a campus in ohio in the us his motives and allegiance are less clear such attacks are not unprecedented but have become much more numerous in recent years in 2014 the chief spokesman of the group mohammed al adnani issued a call for sympathisers in the west to strike unbelievers especially police officers or soldiers where they were rather than travel to the middle east to fight there if you are not able to find a bomb or a bullet then smash his head with a rock or slaughter him with a knife or run him over with your car or throw him down from a high place or choke him or poison him he said though al adnani who was killed in 2016 pointed a finger specifically at france where there were two vehicle attacks in 2014 he also cited the uk among preferred targets this section of the live blog was amended on 23 march 2017 to clarify a reference to the berlin truck attacker the brother of a british aid worker murdered by isis in syria has appealed for calm in the wake of the westminster attack press association reports david haines was beheaded in syria three years ago by the group after being held prisoner for 18 months his elder brother mike who works with groups to combat extremist indoctrination of young people in the uk said it was vital that communities remain calm and united regardless of the motive mike haines said my thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of the victims of this tragic attack in the heart of our nation s capital in the midst of the hurt and heartache that we are all feeling in this moment it is vital that we as a society remain calm and united no matter who or what was behind this attack terrorism in all its guises seeks to spread fear and divide us in confronting this evil we must stand shoulder to shoulder with confidence that we are all stronger when we stand together the reports of kindness and solidarity amongst those on the scene proves our togetherness whatever the motivations they will not succeed in sewing distrust amongst us i have seen first hand that we are stronger than that it is still early in london but pre dawn travellers are still being advised to avoid the westminster area bbc newsnight reported late on wednesday evening that the car used in the attack could have been rented in birmingham has not been able to verify this report west midlands police according to a statement cited by the telegraph the daily mail and others has said of the raid that saw a road in southwest birmingham closed for around two hours overnight there is an ongoing police operation no further details are being given at this stage wmp referred media enquiries to the metropolitan police in london which said it would not be commenting for operational reasons londoners have expressed defiance after the terrorist attack at westminster sharing messages of solidarity on social media wearenotafraid was trending in london as users reacted to the deaths of five people including the attacker on wednesday and expressed gratitude and support for the work of emergency services comedian and actor margaret cabourn smith characterised this tenor of the response tweeting wearenotafraid or rather i am but i m damned if i m going to let that stop me doing anything differently i m a bladdy londoner a police raid has taken place in the early hours of thursday morning in birmingham where hagley road in the southwest of the city was cordoned off for a while at this point it is not clear whether this is in any way related to the attack in london i ll have more details here if they emerge the lights of the landmark in paris were turned off at midnight as a mark of respect for the victims of wednesday s terror attack in westminster abc s leigh sales reports that the australian permanent resident caught up in the westminster attack is being treated for injuries sustained when the attacker s car ran over her foot she is originally from germany but now lives in south australia malcolm turnbull and australian labor leader bill shorten are offering condolences to the uk in the canberra parliament now with the british high commissioner menna rawlings looking on turnbull said as prime minister theresa may said earlier this morning the values of the british parliament command the admiration and respect of free people everywhere and so they do because they are our values too we stand all of us with the uk comforted that we share those values they are ours freedom of speech democracy the rule of law we will never give in to terror he said of british mp tobias ellwood who assisted attempts to resuscitate the police officer pc keith palmer who was fatally stabbed this act of heroism is just one of the extraordinary stories that are emerging from this tragedy shorten paid tribute to palmer the murder of the metropolitan police officer reminds us of the risks our security agencies take on our behalf to keep us safe and on behalf of all honourable members i want to acknowledge and thank our australian federal police and the parliamentary security officers for whom this news must strike a particular chord thanks to my colleague gabrielle chan on the australian politics live blog for the quotes australia s attorney general george brandis has said an australian permanent resident was injured in the attack in westminster and is in hospital consular staff in london are offering the woman assistance he said he added we stand in solidarity with the people of the united kingdom australian prime minister malcolm turnbull says the injured person lives in south australia thursday s guardian editorial calls for solidarity in the wake of the terror attack on westminster and pays tribute to the officers who intervened the security forces and police have planned for what they call a marauding attack for years the awful choreography of the response to terror was fast and well rehearsed the police officer who later died of his injuries stopped the attacker at the gates off parliament square before the man had gone a pace or two further he himself was shot by an armed officer these two courageous interventions almost certainly saved scores of lives in a busy area thronged with politicians visitors and some of the hundreds of staff who work in the palace there will be many questions to ask in the coming days about what was known of the attacker and his associates but for now there can only be a wholehearted appreciation of the professionalism with which the police did their job
2017-06-08,0,it may be premature but hoo boy that exit poll if accurate it suggests the uk is heading for a hung parliament there is still a long way to go yet but if accurate the snap election looked like it could have backfired spectacularly on theresa may which made people on twitter laugh quite a lot those who had decided to head to bed by now for an early start on friday morning were jolted awake by the shock result and the wheat field jokes just kept on rolling in george osborne seemed pleased some pundits were suggesting there could be another election on our horizon we are all so very very tired but perhaps no one would be more irritated than brenda from bristol
2017-03-22,0,eu chiefs have warned airlines including easyjet and ryanair that they will need to relocate their headquarters or sell off shares to european nationals if they want to continue flying routes within continental europe after brexit executives at major carriers have been reminded during recent private meetings with officials that to continue to operate on routes across the continent for instance from milan to paris they must have a significant base on eu territory and that a majority of their capital shares must be eu owned the development coming days before the triggering of article 50 potentially makes it more likely that the carriers will act to restructure with economic consequences for the uk including a loss of jobs the tough line from the eu may encourage the uk to reciprocate with its own nationality rules which would leave eu owned airlines facing equally difficult choices potentially dampening their investment in the uk in the short term although some may seek in time to establish their own british subsidiaries the ability of companies such as easyjet to operate on routes across the eu has been a major part of their business models and there may be a renewed willingness among airlines to invest outside the uk to maintain market share british airways does not fly intra europe but its parent company iag is likely to need to disinvest shareholders in order to be majority eu owned and allow its other eu registered carriers to continue to operate across europe an iag spokesman said we will continue to comply with the relevant ownership and control regulations some airlines have already started to seek alternative headquarters and to examine how they might ensure that their shareholding is majority eu owned possibly through the forced disinvesting of british shareholders but others have appeared until now to hold out hope that the european commission would be flexible on the rules in the current aviation agreement eu officials in the meetings were clear however about the rigidity of the rules amid concerns at a senior eu level that too many in the aviation industry are in denial about the consequences of the uk s decision to leave the bloc representatives from easyjet along with the british airways owner iag ryanair and the tui group whose portfolio of airlines includes thomson met the eu s brexit taskforce last week that followed a meeting the previous week between the taskforce and executives from air france klm finnair lufthansa and sas as part of the eu s efforts to engage with stakeholders thomas van der wijngaart an aviation expert at the legal firm clyde amp co told the guardian there could be significant economic consequences for the uk with airlines changing their financial and operating structures and building a stronger presence on the continent it might be that carriers choose to have domestic flights on the continent operated by their new european operating licence which would probably mean a reduction in staff in the uk he warned britain is a member of an aviation agreement based on 35 shared pieces of eu legislation a common regulator in the european aviation safety agency and a court acting as a referee on the shared rules the european court of justice ecj however asked during a select committee hearing last week whether the uk would continue to be part of the open skies agreement after brexit the secretary of state for exiting the eu david davis said not that agreement one would presume that would not apply to us does not say anything about whether there would be a successor the industry holds out hope that the uk and the eu will be able to seal an early deal during article 50 negotiations that ensures that damage to the industry is limited however a hurdle on progress on a new agreement is theresa may s intention to remove the uk from the ecj s jurisdiction which currently has the key role in adjudicating over conflicts between parties to the agreement a number of member states may also have interests in standing in the way of britain s attempts to strike a new deal spanish diplomats for example say they will not sign any international aviation agreement that recognises the airport on gibraltar the uk could react to the imposition of eu ownership rules on airlines by developing ownership rules of its own which could prevent carriers such as the ireland based ryanair from flying uk domestic routes as it does today easyjet is establishing an eu operating company on which an announcement is expected within weeks so that it can obtain an eu air operating certificate the company insists however it will continue to be headquartered in the uk it is currently 84 owned by eu nationals but this will drop to 49 after brexit provided the shares of founder stelios haji ioannou who has dual uk and cypriot nationality are classed as eu owned the financial times has reported that haji ioannou s shares are now classed as uk owned to meet the airline s own restrictions on ownership an easyjet spokesman said like other european airlines easyjet regularly engages with the uk and the eu on a wide range of issues which include the impact of brexit on aviation as this was a private meeting we would not comment further on what was discussed ryanair is headquartered in ireland and will not have to relocate but it has been reported that 60 of the dublin registered airline s capital shares are owned by eu nationals this will be reduced to 40 once uk shareholders are excluded making it vital to increase its eu ownership to comply with regulations a spokesman for the airline said the company would adapt however the airline s chief executive officer michael o leary has already warned of the huge dangers to the industry of a cliff edge brexit and criticised the mildly lunatic optimism of the british government a ryanair spokesman said while it appears that we are heading for a hard brexit there is still significant uncertainty in relation to what exactly this will entail this uncertainty will continue to represent a challenge for our business for the remainder of financial year 17 and financial year 18 a british government spokesperson said it will clearly be in the interests of both sides in the brexit negotiation to maintain closely integrated aviation markets the uk aviation industry is the largest in europe handling over 250m passengers and 2 3m tonnes of cargo last year benefiting both consumers and business in the eu and the uk we have engaged extensively with the aviation industry already and will continue to work closely with it to better understand the risks and opportunities ahead to ensure it continues to be a major success story for the british economy
2017-06-21,0,one year ago today we knew so little a yougov poll on referendum day last year predicted a 52 to 48 remain victory and even arch brexiter nigel farage for a moment lost his insufferably oleaginous smirk as he conceded that it looked like remain will edge it in the end leave won by 51 9 to 48 1 on a turnout of 71 8 with more than 30 million people voting and nigel farage got his unacceptable grin back what have we learned in the ensuing year cameron quit as pm the morning after the referendum when it became clear britain had voted to leave the eu and who can blame him his reassuringly expensive 25 000 shed has a wood burning stove dimmer switches sofa bed sheep s wool insulation and is painted in muted shades called clunch mouse s back and old white by contrast the eu negotiating team are semi housetrained polecats even now spitting in french about gnawing their opposite numbers genitals in some hellishly overheated conference room somewhere just awful like brussels probably the slogan on the leave battlebus claimed that brexit would yield 350m a week for the nhs shortly after the referendum one prominent leave campaigner iain duncan smith said i never said that during the course of the election the 350m was an extrapolation of the 19 1bn that is the total amount of money we gave across the european union what we actually said was a significant amount of it would go to the nhs not really leave campaign director matthew elliott tweeted during the referendum campaign let us give our nhs the 350m the eu takes each week and that was not true britain had negotiated a discount paying only 285m a week nor was it clear that all eu fees could be channelled straight into health services the leading claim of the leave campaign then was based on a false prospectus and may have led to the british people voting for something they might well have opposed if they had the facts just saying the eu negotiating team has put all our stuff on the lawn and is yelling from an upstairs window that we were never that good in bed anyway what is i faked all those orgasms in french or polish we had better find out because we are going to be hearing that a lot in the next few months as our menage with the eu comes to a bitter end according to the european commission s president jean claude juncker the exit bill for the uk will be at least 60bn 52 7bn while according to reports in the financial times eu negotiators have since upped the bill to 100bn to cover post brexit farm payments and payments and admin fees in 2019 and 2020 when if you will allow me some caps lock outrage we will not even be members of the eu any more how bitterly ironic did not we choose brexit in part so we did not have to subsidise economically unviable probably drunk off their asses french farmers and faceless brussels bureaucrats you know what we probably did in the spring the trade minister liam fox gave an indication of how britain would emerge post brexit stronger fairer more united and more outward looking nation when he visited the philippines to negotiate a trade deal with rodrigo duerte the filipino president duerte has publicly encouraged civilians to kill drug addicts and lives the career dream i ve been secretly nurturing since primary school namely that of becoming an international pariah at the same time theresa may was in saudi arabia as part of a wider government effort to shore up the uk s trading position after brexit and while there declined to condemn the saudi led bombing in yemen even though it is estimated to have killed more than 10 000 civilians and displaced more than 3 million people there is a real danger that in our desperation to conclude trade deals respect for human rights which is in every eu contract will just go out of the window said senior labour mp harriet harman yes but with respect harriet it is only remoaners like you who give a monkey s about foreigners human rights or lives when britain s trade deficit needs correcting not really yes she did say during the conservative party leadership campaign i was described by one of my colleagues as a bloody difficult woman and i said at the time the next person to find that out will be jean claude juncker but just as the first rule of fight club is that you do not talk about fight club the first rule of being difficult is not to go on about it just do it talking about it ain t gonna make it happen girlfriend remember when everyone s favourite music and movement interpreter of emily brontë s oeuvre kate bush announced that may is wonderful and the best thing that is happened to us in a long time this was during the heady hiatus before may s catastrophic election victory after which she was obliged to ritually crawl up the mall in leather trousers bloodying her hands and knees as passers by hissed who is strong and stable now eh to beg the queen to allow her to form the next government at least that is how i remember it by means of that hubristic electoral disaster may surrendered a parliamentary majority in favour of being obliged to suck up to a bunch of cheerless ulster homophobes no offence to keep her and her cold hearted good ideas free crew in office again no offence all the while proving herself with every breaking news story to be weak and unstable and temperamentally unfit to negotiate brexit how much side eye am i giving kate bush right now so much read michel barnier s following remarks in a sinister accent while stroking an imaginary cat if you like walking in the mountains you have to learn a certain number of rules he said shortly after may had returned from a walking tour of snowdonia to announce a stupid snap election you have to learn to put one foot in front of the other you also have to look at what accidents might befall you you have to have stamina because it could be a long route is it just me or did that sound like moriarty obliquely issuing a death threat to sherlock at the reichenbach falls is barnier planning to kill our prime minister with an ice pick as she trolls around the alps singing happy wanderer with her woody allen clone of a spouse because that is how it sounded to me how scary is the eu s chief negotiator in the olden days the sun would have mercilessly satirised his surname remember when they stuck it to a former eu commission president with their up yours delors splash but have they dared to call him barmy barnier in 72 point capitals no because he will probably put a hit out on them as well if they did he is just that intimidating slowly but surely english is losing its importance in europe said juncker during a speech in italy last month and he said the rest of his speech in french just to clinch the point indeed juncker can probably say i faked all those orgasms in each of the many eu languages what a guy sympathy for jean claude if juncker has any animus to this island nation it is in part because during the referendum campaign our tabloids reported the slur that his father was a nazi it was unjust and disgusting he told the ft just possibly britain is reaping what its post truth hatemongers sowed thanks for that tabloids this is the only good thing that has happened in politics in the past year lord it was hard to write that last sentence was not the happiest thing about may s first administration that she had been able to bin him off but months later he is back as environment secretary proving if nothing else that may cannot hold on to anything for long not a policy not a parliamentary majority not even a grudge just to review she ditched two manifesto pledges in the queen s speech legalising fox hunting and creating more grammar schools but brought her old enemy back into the cabinet what a dithering disappointment she is although i ll say this for her at least she is not gove was it just me who nearly lost their dinner watching footage of gove jogging down the street with a smug grin on his face when it was repeated on have i got news for you last friday of course it was not if may is toppled this summer either on a crevasse above klosters by some of barmy barnier s ski masked lackeys or more likely by the conservatives 1922 committee then amber rudd is tipped replace her even though the home secretary is about as fit for purpose as joey barton is for becoming a galáctico still at least she would be better than the evident clown that is boris johnson better britain is helmed by pm bad murder than this gaffe prone berk johnson lost his wedding ring within an hour of getting married inventor of quotations for which he was fired from the times witless calumniser of scousers witless calumniser of papua new guineans and most inept foreign secretary since lord halifax there is good news we never need use the phrase strewth paul nuttall is on the radio talking cobblers again thanks to ukip s dismal electoral performance plus farage his predecessor has realised his true vocation not making the post truth case for brexit but getting on his knees and smooching when in the vicinity of the 45th us president s probably unspeakable derriere he has called trump amazing and superb and claimed that the president had some good people behind him such as kellyanne conway you remember conway the aide who used the term alternative facts to justify colleague sean spicer s lies fine judge of character reflecting on her party s election loss of 21 westminster seats nicola sturgeon the snp leader looked pleasingly glum as she conceded that her plans for the world s worst neologism indyref2 were undoubtedly a factor in the disappointing results sturgeon had hoped for a second independence referendum in 2019 so scotland could elude the hard brexit she feared may s government would inflict like a sissy sneaky sassenach trick on her proud braveheart like people but when she makes a statement next tuesday on the question she is likely to step back from that fanciful timetable ever since the referendum result the pound has been buying fewer euros or dollars and currency experts believe its value will remain in the long term at least 10 below what it was this time last year which means apart from anything else and totally unacceptably i m paying more for my italian truffle oil than ever it is also why marmite costs more although given that marmite tastes like a sweaty crotch mixed with beef extract i can live with that one obvious corollary is that we must forget florida the côte d azur or umbria this summer and instead embrace the staycation rediscovering our churchillian bulldog spirit for fighting gulls for the last of our chips on windswept north wales beaches as unstoppable gales howl in from the irish sea a hard brexit would be likely to see the uk give up full access to the single market and the customs union with the bonus that we could submit european johnny foreigners to cavity searches at stansted before returning them on the next flight to düsseldorf by contrast soft brexit would entail us getting unlimited quilted toilet rolls and cute puppies in exchange for admitting more immigrants than you can shake a stick at only kidding soft brexit means we might follow a similar path to norway which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result which of these we get hard or soft is unclear but given that the eu negotiating team seems akin to a ruthless spirited and enviably united jamaican 4x100 relay team and their british counterparts resemble a fractious red faced bumbling pta tug of war team called into action after spending too much time in the school fete pimm s tent i would not be anticipating good news that said let me ask this you have read karl ove knausgård s unstoppably self indulgent multi volume memoirs does not that put you off aspiring to emulate norwegians me too may says she is committed to a frictionless seamless border between the republic of ireland and northern ireland this like other maybot tropes such as brexit means brexit or strong and stable or i m absolutely clear about this means less and less at the longer you think about it if there remain no passport checks at the irish border post brexit ireland could become a back door for eu immigrants wishing to come to the uk that would make a mockery of may s aim of getting immigration down to a sustainable level which she defines as being below 100 000 a year this is an aspiration she says she wants to fulfil since it is one lesson she took from the brexit vote if passport checks are instituted at the irish border that would serve to undermine the good friday agreement which ended the troubles almost 20 years ago since then the border has become marvellously invisible rather than dotted with nervous tooled up squaddies in watchtowers which was no way to carry on it is quite the jolly old pickle is not it there is an irish story that is useful here a driver asks a passerby how to get to dublin if i wished to go to dublin comes the reply i would not start from here
2017-03-29,0,like aeneas fleeing from troy on the shore of italy or cortés on the coast of mexico it was a moment for the burning of the boats on wednesday theresa may burned hers but they were our boats too that she burned britain s boats boats in which for half a century postwar britain has tried to reconcile its history and its future in europe and failed for good or ill on both sides of the channel britain will not be returning to the european union it does not get more serious than that for this country yet it ended as it began with more of a whimper than a bang as 1973 dawned the guardian reported that britain had embarked on its membership of europe without fireworks it was difficult to tell that anything of importance had occurred records the paper s front page and a date which will be entered in the history books as long as histories of britain are written was taken by most people as a matter of course forty four years later as britain began packing its bags to leave there was perhaps more excitement among the political and journalistic classes the most predictable front page of the year was the daily mail s single word headline on wednesday freedom but the guardian surely got the wider national mood more accurately britain steps into the unknown politically it was momentous a version of the same resistance to continental encroachment that fired henry viii s break with rome 500 years ago has triumphed again out in the country much as in 1973 or even 1534 people got on with life as usual if they were delighted or anxious they mostly did not show it there were no crowds in the streets this time and no celebrations or protests to speak of either people kept their feelings quiet trains ran the stock market was unmoved rain came in from the west as usual a million people went to the doctor nevertheless it was the most important and the most carefully choreographed day of theresa may s prime ministership and she did her best to rise to the occasion her speech to the commons was consensual and without a single triumphalist note only sir bill cash on the leave side and the snp s angus robertson on remain s managed to raise the emotional temperature in the chamber none of it affected the prime minister however in her letter to donald tusk there was a not so veiled threat to take uk defence and security commitments to europe off the table if the eu forces too hard a bargain on single market access if nothing else that was proof of how badly may wants a deal in her own prescribed timeframe of two years what a gambler the vicar s daughter has turned out to be but in the commons there was no thatcher style warrior talk about days of destiny or independence instead may s chosen tone was soothing and respectful both to the eu and to british voters who support it her audience was in the capitals of europe not the commons chamber she sought a deep and special partnership with europe her peroration contained the word together no fewer than six times at times it was hard to realise that britain is walking away so often did may praise the eu wish it well and invoke its values there was very practical domestic political reason for this emollience too despite her wish for the country to come together on the issue britain is still deeply divided over europe nine months ago 17 4 million britons voted to leave while 16 1 million voted to remain a yougov opinion poll this week suggested that views have not changed much neither side of the arguments regrets the stance it took last year remainers are beginning to accept that there is no way back but may unlike the newspapers that urge her forward and constantly try to make her into a second thatcher does not choose to grind the faces of the 48 who voted remain into the dust leaving the eu is this generation s chance to shape a brighter future for our country said may it offers a chance to step back and ask ourselves what kind of country we want to be that sounds very benign and consensual as it is supposed to until you realise that this generation is in fact not a fixed thing britain is divided not united across its generations including europe in the yougov poll this week 65 of young people aged 18 24 say it was wrong to vote leave against just 12 who think it was right at the other end of the age spectrum the over 65s say the opposite with 62 saying it was right to leave and 31 saying it was wrong so this is not really this generation s chance in fact it is the older generation s chance to break a relationship with europe that the younger generation wants to keep looking backwards has defeated looking forwards or has until the leave voters die out and perhaps leave the new majority more pro european at the end of her speech may invoked a misty eyed vision of a stronger fairer better britain a britain our children and grandchildren are proud to call home the problem though is that leaving the eu is not going to produce that kind of britain as the historian anthony barnett put it brexit is government of the old by the old for the old as she signed the letter triggering britain s exit from the eu on tuesday may had posed beneath a portrait of sir robert walpole often described as britain s first prime minister eurosceptics think highly of walpole because he prioritised getting extremely rich over european entanglements in one of his most quoted remarks walpole boasted to queen caroline in 1734 that there are fifty thousand men slain this year in europe and not one englishman what the eurosceptics always forget though is that walpole served a king george ii who was ruler not just of britain but of hanover and was therefore entangled in europe whether he wanted to be or not it was always thus for this island s striking front page showed the british jigsaw piece removed from the european whole but real countries do not move they stay where they are britain will be part of europe one way or another until the end of the world
2017-06-09,0,the british prime minister theresa may s gamble in calling an early election spectacularly failed on thursday night when she lost her majority in parliament and was forced to turn to a deal with a smaller party to stay in power may s attempt to forge a deal with northern ireland s democratic unionist party does not put brexit in doubt although negotiations due to start within days may now be even more complex and less predictable the prime minister went to see the queen on friday to confirm that she would form a government and that she was seeking a deal with the dup following extensive talks through the night with the unionists the largest northern irish party in favour of british rule in the country i will now form a government a government that can provide certainty and lead britain forward at this critical time for our country she said this government will guide the country through the crucial brexit talks that begin in just 10 days and deliver on the will of the british people by taking the united kingdom out of the european union she added we will continue to work with our friends and allies in the democratic unionist party in particular may had called the election which did not need to happen until 2020 at a time when she was riding high in the polls and had hoped to increase her small majority of 17 in order she said to strengthen her hand in the imminent brexit talks instead after a campaign in which she was criticised as dull and robotic and a major policy on social care had to be rewritten on the fly the prime minister lost 12 seats and her control of parliament although the tories remain the biggest party with 318 mps with 649 of 650 seats having declared meanwhile the leftwing opposition leader jeremy corbyn of the labour party who had been written off before the campaign as unelectable extreme and incompetent saw his personal ratings and those of his party rise and stunned pundits by gaining 31 seats giving labour a total of 261 mps labour defied the odds to win around 40 of the vote with the tories on 42 corbyn s aides said the jump in the party s share since previous leader ed miliband won 30 in 2015 was the largest between two general elections for any party since 1945 it was also higher than the 35 2 won by labour s tony blair in his third election victory in 2005 corbyn s achievement was credited to a unique alliance of enthused younger voters and previous non voters combined with some older anti establishment united kingdom independence party ukip voters hit by the tories austere economic policies turnout rose about two points from 2015 to 68 7 bernie sanders whose galvansing popularity amongst young progressives foreshadowed corbyn s surge said i am delighted to see labour do so well all over the world people are rising up against austerity and massive levels of income and wealth inequality people in the uk the us and elsewhere want governments that represent all the people not just the 1 i congratulate jeremy corbyn for running a very effective campaign a ferocious campaign from britain s rightwing tabloids culminating in the daily mail branding labour s leadership apologists for terror and the sun hitting out at jezza s corbyn s jihadi comrades appeared to have been largely ignored by the voters two major terrorist attacks during the campaign may have also damaged the tories more than labour in defiance of conventional wisdom i think it is pretty clear who won this election corbyn told the bbc we are ready to serve the people who have given their trust to us may whose self declared reputation as strong and stable may now be gone for good had sounded much less firm overnight if the conservative party has won the most seats and most votes then it will be incumbent that we will have that period of stability and that is what we will do she said after winning her own seat of maidenhead west of london nevertheless may s attempt at a deal with the dup appears to mean she can remain in office although she seems likely to have been seriously wounded by her strategic blunder in calling an election a second election is possible if the dup deal does not come together and a challenge to her leadership from within her own party cannot be ruled out arlene foster the leader of the dup confirmed talks about a deal with the conservatives would take place the union is our guiding star she said the prime minister has spoken with me this morning and we will enter discussions with the conservatives to explore how it may be possible to bring stability to our nation at this time of great challenge the shockwaves are only the latest reframing of the uk political landscape may took office last year after her predecessor david cameron resigned due to a strategic blunder of his own his decision to call a referendum on britain s membership in the european union britain s status within the eu had long split his party which was coming under serious pressure on the right from the fervently anti eu ukip and cameron who personally backed eu membership had hoped to cauterise the issue instead british voters surprised the world by voting for brexit cameron gambled lost may gambled lost tweeted sophia in t veld a member of the european parliament overnight tory party beginning to look like a casino it is unclear what exactly a new deal between the conservatives and the dup will mean for brexit the historically protestant dup backs british rule of the province and one of the party s key figures nigel dodds confirmed that its price for a deal with the tories included a promise that there would be no post brexit special status for northern ireland the dup fears that such special status a key demand of the northern irish nationalist party sinn féin which thinks the province should be part of the republic of ireland would decouple northern ireland from the rest of the uk the dup backed brexit last year but across northern ireland 56 voted to remain in the eu dodds said he was not thinking that the dup s 10 mps would take up cabinet positions in a formal coalition rather they would agree to support may in votes of confidence and support her budgets his party is fiercely opposed to corbyn viewing him as having a history of backing northern irish republicans and a united ireland senior conservatives said pro brexit mps were keen to see may remain in her post to press ahead with negotiating britain s exit from the european union formal talks must be completed by march 2019 guy verhofstadt the european parliament s brexit representative said the election outcome would make already complex negotiations even more complicated i hope the uk will soon have a stable government to start negotiations this is not only about the uk but also about the future of europe european capitals are thought to have hoped may would win a strong majority since her government would then feel confident enough to make concessions diplomats fear she will now run into difficulty with her own mps which will not be a recipe for good talks sterling tumbled as much as 2 5 percentage points on the result while the ftse share index opened higher the pound hit an eight week low against the dollar and its lowest levels in seven months versus the euro senior conservative sources said recriminations against may were already beginning within her own ranks among cabinet ministers with the brexit secretary david davis singled out by some of his colleagues for pressing her to gamble on the snap poll there are a lot of very very pissed off people in the cabinet and with him in particular said one may has cleaved close to donald trump since his victory in november and images of her holding his hand during a trip to the white house were mocked by her opponents and held up as evidence she was unable or unwilling to stand up to the unpopular american president there were calls during the campaign for a planned state visit by trump to be cancelled after he attacked the mayor of london over his response to last weekend s terrorist attack in london bridge taking a quote out of context but the tories seem keen to make sure the visit goes ahead and the relationship with the us remains as strong as possible as britain cuts its ties with the eu a free and independent britain is a blessing to the world and our relationship has never been stronger trump told may during that visit to washington but may herself has never looked weaker additional reporting by rajeev syal henry mcdonald heather stewart daniel boffey and jon henley
2017-03-12,0,ian mcewan has reportedly described the decision to hold a referendum on brexit as reminiscent of nazi germany and likened politicians and newspapers who attack judges scrutinising the process to robespierre during the terror of the french revolution the award winning author made the remarks during a visit to barcelona at the end of last week to promote his latest novel nutshell in comments reported by spanish newspapers and websites mcewan called brexit a real disaster questioned why it had been put to a referendum rather than parliament and lamented the toxic state of the debate in the uk since the vote last june sixteen million britons wanted to stay in the eu and 17 million wanted to leave but there exists a small and very energetic political group made up of opaque and impatient people who are driving the process and who speak as though half the country were the entire country he said according to el país it is also serious because great britain works on the basis of a parliamentary democracy and not through plebiscites which remind me of the third reich according to the newspaper he added that the politicians claiming to speak on behalf of the people tended to react violently to those who did not share their views their militant wing the tabloid press has started to look into the lives of the judges who rule that brexit could result in the loss of human rights to see whether they are homosexual or something it is reminiscent of robespierre and the terror of the french revolution the air in my country is very foul last november the high court upset the government s brexit plans by ruling that mps should have a vote on the formal process for beginning brexit three senior judges concluded that the government could not press ahead with triggering article 50 of the lisbon treaty without first consulting mps and peers in the commons and lords parts of the british press attacked the decision with the daily mail branding the judges enemies of the people in a front page headline and the daily telegraph headlining its report the judges versus the people the mail online went on to describe one of the judges sir terence etherton as an openly gay ex olympic fencer mcewan who has previously referred to the brexit vote as a plebiscite of dubious purpose and unacknowledged status also took the eu and the british government to task over their handling of the refugee crisis it is a really hard test for europe whose behaviour has not been exemplary we should accept more people he said according to el país england for example is only taking in 20 000 over five years and of course the eu should spend millions more euros to welcome them sustainably and integrate them the worrying thing is that the european far right is using it to fertilise a racist field that is already well fertilised however another newspaper el confidencial said he had praised the eu as a heroic project which with all its weaknesses and imperfections has allowed europe to live in peace for 60 years in a state of relative wellbeing the reports of mcewan s comments on brexit originally in english also varied with el mundo saying mcewan had criticised hasty decisions made through a plebiscite which remind me of the third reich while el confidencial reported him saying brexit has been a real disaster and i feel bad because we are a parliamentary democracy and i do not like these decisions adopted by plebiscite which remind me of the third reich writing in the guardian in july mcewan voiced disbelief at the brexit vote from our agriculture to our science and our universities from our law to our international relations to our commerce and trade and politics and who and what we are in the world all is up for a curious unequal renegotiation with our european neighbours he wrote and what was the nation s democratically tendered advice to our lawmakers that we are almost evenly split one third wants to leave fractionally less than a third wants to stay and a third does not know or does not care seventeen million against 16 million each full of contempt for the other and on this basis and unlike any other country in the world we are about to redraft our constitution and much else besides mcewan and his representatives have been asked for comment
2017-06-25,0,here are the main points from the question time leaders special i would do everything i can to ensure that any threat is actually dealt with earlier on by negotiations and by talks so that we do adhere to our obligations under the nuclear non proliferation treaty i think the idea of anyone ever using a nuclear weapon anywhere in the world is utterly appalling and terrible asked it he was saying he would never ever under any circumstances press the red button to launch a nuclear strike corbyn replied i think we have discussed this at some length about the aspirations we all have i do not want to be responsible for the destruction of millions of people neither do you therefore we have to work for a world where they are not available and not used after the programme boris johnson the foreign secretary said i thought it was really spine chilling to hear jeremy corbyn announce that all labour s support for our nuclear deterrent all labour s support for our armed forces was completely meaningless because when it came to the business of defending this country he would not do it in this job i do what i believe is the best for britain i could have stayed on doing that job for another couple of years and not called an election i had the balls to call an election my wage slips from 2009 reflect exactly what i m earning today how can that be fair in the light of the job that we do and a male nurse said i ve had a real terms decrease of 14 since 2010 so do not tell us we are getting a pay rise may replied i recognise the job that you do but we have had to take some hard choices across the public sector in relation to public sector pay restraint we did that because of the decisions we had to take to bring public spending under control because it was not under control under the last labour government and i m being honest with you in terms of saying that we will put more money into the nhs but there is not a magic money tree that we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want abbott wants to wipe the records of criminals and terrorists from the dna database that would mean that we could catch fewer criminals and fewer terrorists abbott used twitter to say may was wrong and abbott retweeted this i have not signed it because i actually have spoken to donald trump and told him that the uk believes in the paris agreement and that we did not want the united states to leave the paris agreement we have a situation at the moment where if jeremy corbyn was to get into no 10 he would be being propped up by the liberal democrats and the scottish nationalists you would have diane abbott who cannot add up sitting around the cabinet table john mcdonnell who is a marxist nicola sturgeon who wants to break our country up and tim farron who wants to take us back into the eu the direct opposite of what the british people want the nhs is an absolute shambles for mental health at the moment i have suffered so much over that year in part because of the work capability assessment let me tell you i am partially sighted i have mental health problems and other issues i went into my assessment and i was asked in detail about suicide attempts and i came out crying because i was so upset because of the way i was treated by that nurse and she came out after me because she had forgotten to measure my eyesight she found time to insult me by asking for all these upsetting details may replied i m not going to make any excuses for the experience you had that is why i think it is so important that we do deal with mental health she also said she wanted to take action to improve work capability assessments there is no place for antisemitism anywhere in our society and certainly not in our party members have been suspended if they have committed any remarks seen to be of an antisemitic nature we have a process that is independent of me within the party which investigates these and makes a decision on it livingstone has been suspended and further investigations may or may not happen after the election he is suspended from membership but he is suspended so that investigation can take place i do not approve of any terrorism of any sort any terrorist act of any sort it only divides communities and kills people i m very sorry this is not a debate this is a series of questions i think it is a shame the prime minister has not taken part in a debate and here is our main story that is all from me good night the audience member who challenged theresa may over her record of broken promises and backtracking during the bbc question time leaders special is chairman of ukip s youth wing at york university the press association reports in a fiery opening exchange abigail eatock told may that she had u turned on her decision not to call an election and on her social care plans and she accused her of ducking debates with labour leader jeremy corbyn who was appearing separately on the programme after the pm refused to go head to head with her rival soon after the back and forth a ukip source confirmed that eatock was the chairman of young independence the party s youth wing at york university where the bbc1 event was being held the times matt chorley has posted this excerpt from a diane abbott interview with andrew marr showing that contrary to what theresa may said abbott does not favour taking the dna of criminals off the dna database on newsnight emily maitlis has just said that theresa may did not use the phrase strong and stable once tonight why not she asked boris johnson the foreign secretary johnson said that may emanated both virtues and here is the official conservative reaction to the question time leaders special it is a statement from patrick mcloughlin the conservative chairman tonight was a clear demonstration of the choice at this election the prime minister showed voters that she has a plan for brexit is in command of her brief and was unafraid to take on the difficult issues jeremy corbyn wilted under pressure he waffled on and on in meaningless soundbites without offering anything of substance it is obvious that corbyn could not secure the good brexit deal that is vital to protect our economy meaning fewer jobs and more debt the only way to get a brighter future for our country is to vote for theresa may on 8 june here is the labour party s official reaction to the question time leaders special it is from a jeremy corbyn spokesperson the question time leaders special showed there is a very clear choice at this election but again the british public were denied the opportunity to see a debate between the only two people who could be prime minister next week jeremy outlined labour s plans to transform britain for the many not the few with a labour government students will not be saddled with tuition fee debt pensioners incomes will be guaranteed by the triple lock and winter fuel allowance and 95 of taxpayers will not pay any more tax theresa may could not defend her record and floundered on the lack of costings in her manifesto what the cap on social care will be and where the money will come from to fund our nhs the prime minister will not even debate in an election she called how on earth can she be trusted to negotiate the best brexit deal for the british people she repeatedly said she was not going to call an election but now she has she does not seem to want to take part in it the verdict from the twitter commentariat panel is finished it is at 9 41pm but you may need to refresh the page to get the whole thing to appear because i ve been updating it generally the view seems to be that jeremy corbyn came over as warmer and more relaxed apart from when he was challenged over whether or not he would be willing to press the nuclear button when his implied unilateralism he came closer than he has done recently to saying no without being explicit and his evasiveness clearly infuriated a section of the audience theresa may was generally robust and marginally more animated than when she appeared on the sky news channel 4 programme on monday but she faced a barrage of hostile and pertinent questions and with many of them her answers were uninspiring or even sometime unsympathetic for example by now she should have developed a better answer on why nurses have not had a proper pay rise and sometimes need to use food banks journalists are always on the look out for the killer blow at events like this but they are as rare as a unicorn and there certainly was not one tonight for my money corbyn had the better night assuming people care more about public services than the nuclear deterrent and if the programme attracted people who have not noticed how much he has improved in recent weeks they will have been impressed may was solid and it is customary for pms on programmes like this to face hostile questions about public services may put up with this with good grace but said little to enthuse wavering voters this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the question time leaders s special on twitter from the bbc s nick robinson from the sunday times tim shipman from the guardian s matthew d ancona from the daily mirror s jason beattie from the bbc s laura kuennsberg from the daily mirror s jack blanchard from the new statesman s stephen bush from itv s carl dinnen from the spectator s james forsyth from the guardian s paul johnson from sky s beth rigby from the guardian s dan sabbagh from huffpost s paul waugh from the guardian columnist paul mason from the daily mirror s kevin maguire from business insider s adam bienkov from the observer s sonia sodha q why will you spend so much on scrapping tuition fees when there are other things to spend money on dimbleby says it will cost 11bn a quarter of all labour s extra spending corbyn says he had the offer of free tuition he did not take it up but he says in other parts of the world free tuition is normal and that is it verdicts a summary and reaction coming up soon q a few months ago you said you would have a strategic defence review if you won the election why do we need one corbyn says every government coming into power does one there are key issues to look at including cyber attacks q why have you never recognised the ira as terrorism corbyn says he has deplored all types of terrorism by the ira or anyone else the man says they did kill a lot of people corbyn says all deaths are wrong and all killing is wrong the peace process was remarkable he says q you say you did not support the ira but you supported hamas how can we expect you go to into no 10 when you supported them corbyn says he never supported them you have to talk to people to have a peace process q you were talking to them when they were killing people corbyn says the government was doing that at the same time ian paisley was thrown out of parliament for saying so in a peace process you have to talk to people you do not agree with he says q are you saying you will never ever under any circumstances press the nuclear button corbyn says he has discussed this i do not want to be responsible for those deaths he says and neither do you
2017-05-27,0,the uk s full participation in european union security and intelligence co operation will be critical to the fight against terrorism after brexit leading british security experts have said as theresa may announced wide ranging new plans to counter extremism the growing demands for the prime minister to face down anti eu forces in the tory party and make membership of bodies such as europol the eu s criminal intelligence agency a top priority came amid fears that brexit could leave the uk with inferior access to key european databases and deprive british police forces of vital tools in high level pan european anti terror probes the calls from senior figures including sir hugh orde former chief constable of the police service of northern ireland and former head of europol max peter ratzel were reinforced on saturday night by dominic grieve the tory chair of the commons intelligence and security committee grieve said full participation even if it meant accepting eu rules and judicial oversight for the european court of justice ecj could not be more crucial he said he believed may was committed to remaining closely involved in eu security but believed that doing so would require compromise that would be hard for some in may s party to accept although our partnership with the us for intelligence sharing is extremely important the fact is that the current terrorist threat is very much a european dimension issue the schengen database and knowing about who has moved where are all intimately dependent on european systems and we have got to try to remain in them he said i think it is going to be very difficult and the government and parliament will have to face up to the fact that it might turn out during the brexit negotiation that some sort of mechanism for the european court is going to be necessary he added after the manchester attack which killed 22 people and left dozens of others grievously injured it was revealed that suicide bomber salman abedi had travelled back to england from libya via turkey and dusseldorf four days before the attack the bomb contained the same kind of explosives as those used in the paris and brussels attacks in 2015 and 2016 prompting speculation that abedi was linked to terror cells on the european mainland uk counter terrorism officials investigating the abedi network are working with europol with separate bilateral inquiries ongoing with german and belgian intelligence agencies orde told the observer that uk membership of eu bodies such as europol and eurojust which brokers judicial co operation in criminal cases not only allowed access to huge amounts of vital data but also meant uk police could set up joint inquiries with german police or those from other national forces without delay european arrest warrants were also essential he said if we do not have all this it makes it a lot more difficult to do this crucial work it it vital that we get to a situation as close to what we have as members of the eu as possible though it is difficult to see how we do that as members of europol and eurojust states are subject to eu rules on data transfers and procedures and ecj jurisdiction in any disputes or appeals over use of tools such as arrest warrants ratzel who led the pan eu crime fighting agency until 2009 warned that britain must accept some of the rulings of the ecj as part of any deal something may has previously ruled out my expectation is that once you have an important role to play you have to be under the european court of justice cherry picking cannot work you have to obey the rules of the club i am personally sure that the europeans will never accept britain having a role in europol without being under the rule of the european court of justice as anti terror policies of the rival parties were placed centre stage in the election campaign may declared on saturday night that more needed to be done she added we need to be stronger and more resolute in standing up to these people spelling out details of a new commission for countering extremism announced in the tory manifesto she said government had to widen its role and approach there is clearly a role for government in tackling extremism where it involves behaviour that is or ought to be criminal but there is also a role for government to help people and build up organisations in society to promote and defend britain s pluralistic values and stand up to the extremists may s initiative came as labour also attempts to boost its security credentials by pledging to appoint 1 000 more intelligence staff jeremy corbyn has already said he would appoint an extra 10 000 police 3 000 firefighters and 3 000 prison officers suggesting that public spending cuts had put people in danger corbyn said that ensuring the safety of communities demands properly resourced action across many fronts it means upholding and enforcing our individual rights promoting community relations supporting our emergency services tackling and preventing crime and protecting us from danger including threats of terror and violence he said the manchester bombing was the worst terror attack to hit britain since the 7 july attacks in london in 2005 a street in manchester s moss side was evacuated by counter terrorism officers and controlled explosives were used in a raid on a property in cheetham hill two men aged 20 and 22 were arrested in the early hours of saturday morning at the cheetham hill address police said neighbours identified yahya and mohamed werfalli as two of the

2017-05-07,0,the biggest donor to the brexit campaign has called on theresa may to unilaterally guarantee the rights of millions of eu nationals already in britain peter hargreaves the billionaire who donated 3 2m to the leave eu campaign said that the prime minister should reassure the three million eu nationals already in the uk that their current rights would be maintained hargreaves who is now retired after founding the hargreaves lansdown financial services company said he understood the reluctance to guarantee the rights of eu nationals before the delicate negotiations over brexit however he said may should simply make the gesture and not wait until brussels agreed to do the same for uk nationals living in eu states people who are doing great jobs in this country are feeling insecure and i think it would be really good for those people to have the comfort that we are not going to boot them out in 18 months time he told the observer i just think we should make the gesture full stop i do not think there should be a quid pro quo i just think we should make the gesture they would look pretty churlish if they did not reciprocate by guaranteeing the status of uk nationals in the eu his intervention comes after a week in which brussels officials expressed concern over reaching a deal on the status of eu nationals in the uk brussels is insisting that they are allowed to keep all their rights including access to healthcare and the right to bring a spouse to the uk it coincides with concern among some senior brexit backers over may s approach to immigration after brexit simon wolfson the tory peer and next boss who donated 50 000 to vote leave warned that may must not send the signal that britain will pull up the drawbridge after brexit meanwhile paul marshall the hedge fund manager who gave 100 000 to vote leave urged may to remove foreign students from official immigration figures she has refused to back the idea despite pleas from conservative mps and universities hargreaves said he was happy to see eu nationals already here maintain their current rights most of those are in work and adding to our economy he said we are going to be very selective about who we let in in the future but i think there should have been that comfort given because they came under different circumstances wolfson told the recent prosperity uk conference on brexit that foreign workers needed to be seen as an asset to our economy he criticised any attempt to impose arbitrary numbers on the number of migrants the uk should accept each year may has suggested she still wants a reduction of net migration to the tens of thousands wolfson said while it is important and essential that britain controls who comes into this country and it is important that we have the services and infrastructure to deal with an increase in numbers it is vital that we do not pull up the drawbridge we are in a period of record immigration and we have the lowest levels of unemployment on record since the war if we are too draconian on immigration it will have two adverse effects on our economy the first is it will undermine all of our quality of life and undermine growth and the second is it will send the worst of all possible signals to the rest of the world the most important thing to come out of brexit is sending a very clear message to the rest of the world that britain is an open country a free trading country one that embraces the rest of the world and does not reject it marshall said that the government should stop counting foreign students in migration figures arguing that universities must lie at the heart of any strategy for creating a prosperous post brexit economy it is essential that we continue to encourage the free flow of international students and research and it is a no brainer to take students out of the migration numbers he said polling of brexit voters even shows strong support for this change people in the north and midlands fully understand the logic of supporting the university sector they are simply not worried about student migration
2017-01-16,0,the chairman of a commons committee has described donald trump s warning that the us might abandon nato as radical and reckless saying europe would be vulnerable without american military protection julian lewis who chairs the defence select committee expressed the hope that the president elect did not mean what he has said and that his rhetoric was just a negotiating ploy to force european countries to increase defence spending in a lecture at westminster on monday evening the conservative mp said it is as true today as it was when nato was founded in 1949 that the only reliable deterrent to conventional war on the continent is the message broadcast loud and clear that an attack on any nato state means war with america right from the outset lewis was speaking after trump created alarm in european capitals by describing nato as obsolete in an interview published by the times on monday last summer trump also said he would not feel bound by nato s collective doctrine in which an attack on any one of the 28 member countries would be regarded as an attack on all responding lewis said and why is mr trump considering such a radical and reckless move it is because the european nato states especially those which call most stridently for an eu defence identity are investing nowhere near as much in their own armed forces in gdp percentage terms as either our principal ally in washington dc or our principal adversary in moscow the mp who was speaking in a personal capacity and not in his role as the committee chairman said that european countries without the us could deter nuclear blackmail from russia because both the uk and france had nuclear weapons but not an attack by russian conventional forces it is no answer to assert that europe will need to mount its own defence if donald trump s america turns its back on nato if america turns away europe will have little chance of deterring anything other than a nuclear threat from russia lewis said trump s intentions towards nato and russia are hard to gauge given the ambiguity and contradictions in his positions in contrast with the president elect s hints of a rapprochement with russia his pick as next defence secretary general james mad dog mattis has long been a vocal critic of russia and a firm supporter of nato in the same interview in which he called nato obsolete trump described theorganisation as important and called on members to increased their defence budgets lewis is as much in the dark about trump s intentions as just about everyone else but he hopes that trump is bluffing the incoming us president prides himself on being a shrewd negotiator and also the political heir to ronald reagan those of us who remember president reagan with admiration and respect need no reminding of his commitment to the north atlantic alliance and his appreciation of the central role of nato in preventing the third world war given lewis s remarks it seems highly probable the defence committee will hold an inquiry into the us role in europe the german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said trump s criticism of nato had caused great concern i ve spoken today not only with eu foreign ministers but nato foreign ministers as well and can report that the signals are that there is been no easing of tensions he said in response to the us president elect s comments on nato and the strength of the eu the german chancellor angela merkel said we europeans have our fate in our own hands but moscow welcomed trump s vision of an obsolete nato since nato is tailored toward confrontation all its structures are dedicated to the ideals of confrontation you cannot really call it a modern organisation meeting the ideas of stability steady growth and security said dmitry peskov spokesman for the russian president vladimir putin lewis also dismissed the idea of david cameron becoming nato secretary general arguing that he was unsuitable for the role at the end of last year there was media speculation cameron might be a candidate to replace jens stoltenberg when he stands down next year or the year after david cameron is a man of charm and ability he deserves to find a role commensurate with his talents and i am sure that he will said lewis who often found himself at odds with the former prime minister including when he opposed uk intervention in libya but those talents do not include wisely judging strategic issues whether when toppling arab dictators in place like libya increasing military commitments whilst cutting the armed forces predicting a third world war in consequence of brexit or dangerously delaying the renewal of trident for the sake of coalition politics as he did
2017-03-20,0,theresa may has insisted donald trump was simply being a gentleman when he grasped her hand during a visit to the us creating an image that caused widespread embarrassment the prime minister has used an interview with american vogue to praise the meeting with the president who she said had achieved a stunning election victory given his lack of experience in politics i like to think we got on she said adding that she would not reveal the details of private conversations with trump including whether she criticised his previous controversial comments about women all i would say is i ve been very clear i m not afraid to raise issues and the nature of the relationship is such that we should be able to be frank and open with each other her vogue interviewer gaby wood said may laughed when she raised the issue of the hand holding i think he was actually being a gentleman we were about to walk down a ramp and he said it might be a bit awkward she said may also talked about her relationship with her husband philip in which she cooked and he loaded the dishwasher asked what the pair argued about the prime minister responded do you know i think we argue about the same things that most people argue about like who has the remote and what we are watching tonight his history programme no ncis pushed on the regular comparisons made between herself and the conservative s only other female leader she said there can only ever be one margaret thatcher i m theresa may i do things my way wood also described may s vivienne westwood tartan trouser suit worn during her leadership bid in june and at her lancaster house speech setting out the plan for brexit people have described it as a lucky suit i think i m going to stop wearing it now may said on politics the prime minister laid out what she believed in i suppose if i could sum it up in opportunity freedom security she said stressing that protecting the fundamental freedoms that we have remained a crucial part of her counter extremism strategy because if you lose your freedoms then actually the terrorists have started to win she also described what she believed to be the key difference between the conservatives and the labour i think the labour party believes in pulling people down to a level we believe in helping people to rise up to improve their lives and the lives of their children may admitted that being an only child may have meant she was exposed to more adult thinking because the conversation around the breakfast table is more about current affairs and cricket she told wood she decided she wanted to become a member of parliament at 12 and volunteered for the local conservatives stuffing envelopes the interviewer said may was most relaxed when meeting schoolchildren who asked her a series of questions including if you had a superpower what would it be i think i d want to make sure everyone in the world had access to clean water and sufficient food so we did not see people starving said may offering girls who wanted to be prime minister the advice be yourself and if you have any setbacks do not ever think it is because you are a girl the prime minister was also asked how much money do you get paid i get paid two salaries i get paid as a member of parliament and i also get paid as prime minister and if you add those two up i suppose it is public knowledge that it is 142 000 may also addressed the controversial issue of trousergate in which her choice of brown leather trousers worth 1 000 for an interview caused a backlash asked if she was surprised may said look throughout my political career people have commented on what i wear that is just something that happens and you accept that but it does not stop me from going out and enjoying fashion and i also think it is important to be able to show that a woman can do a job like this and still be interested in clothes the fashion has clearly been chosen strategically possibly in response the furore over the 995 leather trousers may wore for a sunday times shoot in december wood who wrote the vogue feature describes the prime minister s style as decidedly no drama the navy dress and coat worn in one picture are from lk bennett a favourite high street haunt of the duchess of cambridge this is an approximation of clothes she is regularly seen in and is there to communicate that may is a woman of the people but the shoot is also clearly something of a personal coup for a woman who said her luxury on desert island discs would be a lifetime subscription to vogue who wears designers including vivienne westwood and amanda wakeley those leather trousers and has had entire articles devoted to her interest in shoes there are then signposts to show off may s fashion credentials to vogue s fashionable readers lk bennett is as those familiar with her style would know where may s leopard print kitten heels come from her red coat and sweater are from egg a cult store in london s belgravia in the sofa image her jacket is propped on her shoulders a style called shoulder robing often seen on street style stars outside of fashion shows wood talks to may about everything from the mays tv choices to feminism and the impact of brexit but this being vogue fashion is also on the list of subjects may is revealed to have no style advisers and to shop at a store in henley near her home she also takes the opportunity to make a political point i also think it is important to be able to show that a woman can do a job like this and still be interested in clothes she says the message here is that may takes fashion and vogue seriously expect to see her indulging in a half tuck 2017 s answer to shoulder robing any day now lauren cochrane
2017-01-24,0,david davis is likely to introduce a straightforward brexit bill on thursday two days after a significant ruling by the supreme court sources have suggested the secretary of state for exiting the eu said he would respond quickly to judges demands to give mps and peers a vote in parliament but warned that the point of no return for brexit had already been passed this does not change the fact that the uk will be leaving the european union he said the government is hoping to publish the bill on thursday but there is a possibility it could slip beyond that davis said the legislation would be narrow focusing only on the question of triggering article 50 and warned that it must not be used as a vehicle for attempts to thwart the will of the people or frustrate or delay the process of our exit from the european union this will be the most straightforward bill possible to give effect to the decision of the people and respect the supreme court s judgment he added stressing that it was not about whether the uk would leave the eu because that had been decided by the june referendum davis said government lawyers were scrutinising the long judgment but made clear that he remained confident article 50 would be triggered by the deadline at the end of march this timetable has already been supported by this house he said saying the legislation would be separate to the great repeal bill davis was urged by brexiters in parliament to issue the legislation quickly and keep it short but was also pressured by opposition figures and mps on his own side to publish the government s brexit plan as a white paper in order to allow further scrutiny ministers have claimed may s brexit speech at lancaster house was an adequate plan the shadow brexit secretary keir starmer said labour accepts and respects the referendum result and will not frustrate the process but we will be seeking to lay amendments to ensure proper scrutiny and accountability throughout the process that starts with a white paper or plan a speech is not a white paper or plan and we need something to hold the government to account throughout the process you cannot have a speech as the only basis for accountability for two years or more starmer was backed on the issue by labour s hilary benn who chairs parliament s brexit committee and a series of conservative backbenchers including ben howlett who said i believe that the government should publish a white paper in order to enable my constituents to have their views heard another tory mp anna soubry said mps should be able to discuss not just the triggering of article 50 but also the decisions to abandon the single market and free movement without debate or a vote what has my honourable friend got to lose with a debate on a white paper she asked davis who had described may s speech on brexit last week as the clearest exposition of a negotiating strategy i have seen in modern times said the prime minister s address was sufficient explanation i m afraid it is very difficult to see how you can leave the european union and still stay inside the single market with all the commitments that go with that said davis julian lewis the conservative mp for new forest east questioned the motives of those pursuing a soft brexit saying they wanted to leave the eu but remain a member in all but name the former cabinet minister iain duncan smith said the fact that it was a split judgment showed it was right for the government to take the case to the supreme court but pushed for no further delays may i urge davis when he brings this in front of us to keep it short to keep it simple and most of all to keep it swift he said aside from demands for a white paper there were also calls for the final vote on the brexit deal to be meaningful the green party co leader caroline lucas asked that the bill be early enough in the process to allow time for a renegotiation if mps and peers rejected it rather than crashing out of the eu without a deal the snp s brexit spokesman stephen gethins asked why the government feared parliamentary scrutiny he said the tories had only one mp in scotland and asked davis to seek consent from the scottish parliament before legislating on areas over which it has responsibility davis argued that despite the court s decision that the government need not obtain approval from the devolved administrations he would consult key figures in scotland wales and northern ireland davis also made clear that the government supported the right of the judges to come to their conclusion after the daily mail argued yet again the elite show their contempt for brexit voters we believe in and value the independence of our judiciary the foundation upon which the rule of law was built he told colleagues that followed a statement from the justice secretary liz truss who faced criticism for not defending the appeal court justices denounced by sections of the media as enemies of the people after they ruled against the government truss said our independent judiciary is the cornerstone of the rule of law and is vital to our constitution and our freedoms the reputation of our judiciary is unrivalled the world over and our supreme court justices are people of integrity and impartiality the shadow attorney general shami chakrabarti argued that it was not enough and that the prime minister should also speak out we have to be absolutely clear the courts have done their job she said they have not made a political judgment but just upheld a principle of parliamentary sovereignty which the brexit supporters said their campaign was all about the three judges in the high court were vilified and put at personal risk and that is unacceptable we need more than a statement from liz truss which is too little too late we need something from mrs may the eagerly awaited ruling routes the protracted brexit process through parliament handing over to mps and peers the authority to sanction the uk s withdrawal the decision sets clear limits on the extent of the government s executive powers rights embedded in the law by the 1972 european communities act which took the uk into what was then the european community cannot be removed by the government s prerogative powers a majority of the justices declared the supreme court made clear that it was up to parliament to decide what form the legislation would take and a very brief statute would not undermine its momentous significance
2017-06-23,0,representatives of eu citizens in britain have branded theresa may s offer to guarantee their rights to remain in the country after brexit pathetic and anything but fair and serious a group representing britons in europe as well as eu citizens in the uk will meet officials in the department for exiting the european union on friday morning to tell them of their anger with the prime minister s spin on the issue when she spoke at a dinner in brussels may made what she described as a fair and generous offer after a meal at the european council summit on thursday but it was met with fury by eu citizens who say it increases rather than eases anxiety particularly because they claim it is cast in the language of immigration law rather than existing eu law they say the offer is also damaging for britons in europe to whom a fortnight ago the eu offered a lifetime guarantee of all their current rights something that the british team in brussels failed to acknowledge on thursday night instead talking of how the uk s offer was only on the table if it was reciprocated by the eu there is something slightly pathetic about the prime minister s proposal which makes no reference to the detailed comprehensive offer tabled by the eu the prime minister described her proposal as fair and serious it is neither fair nor serious said nicolas hatton the founder of the grassroots group the3million which has been campaigning for the rights of those settled in the uk since the referendum last year sue wilson a briton who lives in spain and who chairs the bremain in spain group said one of the main concerns was that the uk s offer did not accept a role for the european court of justice the ultimate legal arbiter of all legal disputes relating to the eu including breaches of eu citizens rights across europe it will remain the arbiter until britain leaves the eu but downing street does not accept it has a role in legacy issues after brexit theresa may is acting as though she is making the first move and we should all be impressed and grateful at her generosity the offer already made by the eu was far more generous for both eu and uk citizens living abroad said wilson while we agree with angela merkel that this is a reasonable first step may is going to have to compromise she is not in the driving seat and we are sick and tired of being used as bargaining chips britons in france also expressed their fears on friday that may s opening move could damage their position in europe we find it bizarre that she expects the eu to reciprocate to her offer which falls short of their own does she expect the eu to water down its offer to match hers said dave spokes a spokesman for the group expat citizen rights in eu spokes added this is not a negotiation to get the lowest possible price it is or should be a negotiation to gain the best support for real people a country s citizens we are not surprised that mr juncker has described theresa may s offer on citizens rights as not sufficient this reflects our own assessment it seems a very odd strategy for the uk to offer less support for citizens than that being offered by the eu should they not be encouraging the eu to give more there was also concern that the british offer referred to building up rights and deals for those living in the country for five years whereas under eu law citizens start to acquire those rights after just three months in another eu country we are all eu citizens with associated rights acquired through eu membership these rights cannot be removed retrospectively wilson said the eu s offer was handed to may on 12 june after consultation with groups representing britons in about a dozen countries but it got little attention and was not publicised by westminster which was reeling from the surprise election result and then the grenfell tower disaster jane golding a british lawyer living in berlin who was involved in the consultations with the eu said eu citizens were not being treated the same as the british in europe at this stage i think the british offer raises more questions than it answers there are some broad lines of the offer set out but whether the status quo and the full bundle of rights that eu citizens in the uk currently have will be safeguarded is not clear from this statement so without answers to those questions we simply do not know yet whether the pm is offering certainty to eu citizens she said one of the main concerns of the3million is that the offer fails to mention the indivisible rights that eu citizens currently enjoy that no country can remove including the right to live work own a business and bring family into the uk nor does it mention the fact that eu freedom of movement rights start to be acquired after three months this in effect means a cut off date of 29 december 2018 three months before the scheduled departure from the eu allowing britons and other eu citizens to continue to migrate within europe until then without having their future rights threatened may s offer refers to an undated cut off point falling anywhere between the day article 50 was invoked 29 march 2017 and brexit day 29 march 2019 in a statement it said the3million finds this proposal unacceptable and calls on the government to revisit its approach and start constructive talks with the eu based on the balanced proposal published by the eu in its negotiating directives last night hatton revealed that david davis the brexit secretary had refused to meet representatives of eu citizens he described the decision as insulting since they had previously had talks with the eu s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier he described the prime minister s offer as the lowest possible position to enter talks it is disgusting they do not want to engage with eu citizens it is like one big game to them but these are people s lives hatton said barnier and the eu they also play political games and like good pr but they have listened to us and redrafted their proposal after they sent it round to the eu27 because of the feedback they got the uk seems to be stuck in this home office policy of creating a hostile environment

2017-02-26,0,nigel farage dined out with donald trump on saturday night after managing to secure a last minute invitation to join the us president for an evening meal the former ukip leader was photographed sitting opposite trump and alongside his daughter ivanka her husband and senior white house adviser jared kushner and the florida governor rick scott at the president s luxury hotel in washington dc posting the photograph on twitter farage wrote dinner with the donald however onlookers revealed that a place had only been made for him at the table at short notice no 10 was quick to play down the significance of the trump meeting and subsequent dinner at the trump international hotel in washington dc saying that they did not believe the us president would be misled into thinking he was being briefed by farage on official government policy we have an excellent ambassador who has and does meet the administration including president trump a spokesman said we have formal well established processes for communicating with the us administration and those are the ones we use they know we communicate through the existing channels i m 100 certain they are aware of that journalist benny johnson who said the secret service swarmed the place before trump s arrival had been keeping tabs on the group at the trump international hotel johnson the creative director of online news outlet independent journal review wrote on twitter farage was not invited to this dinner squeezed in at last minute in a blog detailing all the events of the evening the journalist said restaurant staff were given word just before trump arrived that an extra place needed to be added to the table farage was seen greeting trump in the lobby who pointed up to his table and appeared to invite him for dinner farage was later found wandering the lobby of the hotel with a large glass of red wine johnson said his teeth are wine stained and the british politician is happily swaying and speaking with anyone who approaches him when he asked what it was like to have the president invite you to dinner he writes that farage told him well it is really quite wonderful but as i ve gotten to know donald it really just does not surprise me you know what amazes me about your president he is a regular bloke truly just a normal chap upstairs at dinner he spoke to the table like any regular guy out to dine with friends and family there is no pretension at all johnson pressed farage for further details on what the president spoke about while eating but he just laughed and said it was nothing that interesting with a smirk and a wink earlier in the day farage had backed trump s treatment of the mainstream media heaping praise on his political ally in a television interview he told fox news they the media are simply not prepared to accept that brexit happened that trump happened they kind of want to turn the clock back and what they do not realise is they are losing viewers they are losing listeners they are losing this battle big time and i m pleased the president is not afraid to stand up to them speaking at the conservative political action conference cpac in washington on friday farage said the brexit vote and trump s election had launched a great global revolution he added and it is not going to stop it is one that is going to roll out across the rest of the great world farage said he was proud to have supported trump in the election and attacked us mainstream media for being in deep denial about trump s victory but said americans as a whole would grow to appreciate their new leader just as brexit becomes more popular by the day president trump will become more popular in america by the day he said as farage made further efforts to align himself with trump back in britain ukip was dealing with the fallout of its defeat to labour in the stoke byelection the party s deputy leader peter whittle admitted it may have been a mistake for the leader paul nuttall to run for the party in stoke on trent central so early in his leadership speaking on bbc1 s andrew marr show the london assembly member said if there was one mistake we made it was that maybe paul should not have run so early he is only been leader for 12 weeks people had not got to know him well enough i think we did not win this time there are many by elections coming up nuttall who whittle said could not appear on the show as he had a holiday booked immediately after the election result came second in stoke barely increasing the party s share of the vote despite ukip s pledge to seize power from labour whittle dismissed threats from arron banks ukip s main donor to set up another party unless he was made chairman saying there were other people who would provide money banks has threatened to pull his funding unless he is made chairman so he can purge members and stop the party being run like a jumble sale asked if he did not want banks as ukip chairman whittle replied it would be a very interesting conversation to have i ve always been very very grateful for arron s contributions if arron does take his money away there are other people obviously i would not want that to happen these sort of interventions are run of the mill they happen all the time within our party it is part of politics i think the difference is with us people tend to see a kind of do or die situation in virtually every controversy
2017-06-12,0,a contrite theresa may bought herself time with conservatives mps by apologising for failing to secure an overall majority while cabinet sources indicated that the prime minister would pursue a more conciliatory approach on brexit to shore up her leadership may addressed a packed session of her party s backbench 1922 committee on tuesday with what was described as an upfront mea culpa she declared i got us into this mess and i m going to get us out of it senior insiders added that one of the ideas actively being considered to win backing across parliament was not to major on the controversial no deal is better than a bad deal position taken by may before the election also under consideration is whether to exclude overseas students from the immigration numbers and even possibly to abandon the target to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands although nothing has been agreed any softening of the position on immigration could maximise the chance of a closer economic relationship with the eu may also admitted that the manifesto promise to make people pay more for their social care had been a mistake and said there would be no weakening of lgbt rights as the tories attempted to secure an electoral pact on tuesday with the socially conservative democratic unionist party the prime minister said more would be done to reach out to young voters and those working in the public sector she was contrite and genuine but not on her knees said one senior mp who attended the meeting adding that may had shown a warmer side there was none of the maybot the person added claiming that any talk of a leadership challenge had been silenced for now at least speaking after the meeting mps made clear that the prime minister had bought herself time with hopes that she could make it to the end of brexit talks in two years a cabinet member admitted that work was under way on how to achieve a deal with the eu27 that could pass through a much more finely balanced parliament involving seeking areas of compromise with other parties reports in the telegraph and evening standard claimed that secret talks had already begun between cabinet ministers and some labour mps any shift in tone will be seen as a coup for advocates of a soft brexit although those who campaigned to leave the eu are also offering their support to the prime minister ruth davidson the conservative leader in scotland who has won more influence after the party took 13 seats in scotland said she was pushing for an open brexit with maximum economic access after a private meeting with may in downing street davidson added that the party needed to reach out i do think that there can be changes in the offer of brexit as we go forward downing street is also preparing to put forward a skeleton version of a queen s speech as the parliamentary mathematics threatens to bring domestic policymaking to a halt unless the tories reach out to opposition parties the annual list of legislation which may be delayed from 19 june will have two big ticket items of brexit and counter terrorism policy but see most of the domestic agenda ditched according to one source may s plans for a sweeping shakeup of education including new grammar schools could be boiled down to a few pilots they said however despite jitters within the party and suggestions that may s days are numbered her performance in front of the 1922 committee appeared to reduce anger about the shock result after the vote stripped the conservatives of their majority and plunged the government into instability and the need for coalition talks with the dup heidi allen the mp for south cambridgeshire said the prime minister would be gone within six months however after the 1922 meeting allen who has fought her own party over disability benefit cuts and tough positioning on brexit said i saw an incredibly humble woman who knows what she has to do and that is be who she is and not what this job had turned her into she has lost her armadillo shell and we have got a leader back anne marie trevelyan the conservative mp for berwick upon tweed who has been an outspoken proponent of brexit said it was very positive to hear her take very firm responsibility for not being able to crystallise some of the seats we would hoped to win i felt she had very deeply considered over the weekend whether she should continue and came to us to say i will continue for as long as you want me to do so and i think that is exactly what we all hoped she would say mps said there was a tacit acceptance of the need to build a better consensus a broader backing for brexit has to be built and i think she recognises that one former minister said she was clear she was responsible she agreed on the need to listen to all the wings of the party on brexit one remainer on the left of the party was teary eyed as they expressed their renewed support for the prime minister while a hardline brexiter agreed describing her as very very humble and saying she has bought herself time she showed a side of her that was very appealing a warmer side at the centre of the debate were concerns about the manifesto mps admitted that it had been a disaster with voters particularly the so called dementia tax and the decision to press ahead with school funding cuts public sector workers felt very strongly about austerity a former cabinet minister said we have to offer a message of aspiration which is a very conservative word jeremy corbyn s massive gains with public sector workers appear to have driven anti austerity into the centre of political debate even among conservatives may acknowledged several warnings from mps who described meeting people who said they could not vote tory because of cuts to hospitals schools or failure to increase public sector wages in real terms anna soubry told the guardian it had been an issue she repeatedly encountered on the doorstep writing in a local newsletter she added we need a kinder conservatism that recognises the very real concerns about reduced school budgets a shortfall in nhs and social care funding and that some of our most valued public servants such as nurses have had their wages cut others argued that it was ok for the tories to keep their position but that they had failed to make the economic argument during the campaign soubry said it was outrageous that the chancellor philip hammond had not been given a bigger role in the campaign several mps told may they had had difficulties rebutting questions over school funding on doorsteps and in local hustings may said that justine greening would address the concerns and sources stressed that the education secretary had been making the case for better funding for schools for some time tories banged on the tables for about 30 seconds as may arrived for the crunch meeting in a roasting hot room packed with members of the house of lords as well as mps may took questions but one mp described them as more like speeches there was no appetite for a leadership election the mp said that is the last thing the country needs she said she would serve us as long as we want her and that she is been a party servant since she was 12 years old stuffing envelopes mps were pleased that the prime minister had removed her joint chiefs of staff fiona hill and nick timothy as she pointed instead to her new top aide the former tory mp gavin barwell and the chief whip gavin williamson one mp said that the party had faith in the two gavins
2017-03-15,0,theresa may is expected to refuse a new scottish independence referendum unless it is held after the uk has quit the eu the scottish secretary and other uk government sources indicated on wednesday that the prime minister was prepared for a drawn out battle with nicola sturgeon s government over the referendum s timing and the question that will be asked david mundell told the herald newspaper it would be impossible for people in the timescale suggested by nicola sturgeon to make a reasoned view and therefore have a legal fair and decisive referendum as we did in 2014 on the basis of the facts as they would be aware of them at that point if you are saying you want the referendum because of brexit then you have to know what the arrangement is that the uk has secured in relation to leaving the eu and how that has been delivered and of course you need to know what the snp alternative to that proposal is sturgeon revealed on monday she wants to hold the referendum between autumn 2018 and spring 2019 ideally before the uk formally signs a brexit deal expected in late march 2019 a uk government source added on wednesday that may would wait to respond until she had received formal notification from the first minister setting out precisely how and when the scottish government wants to stage the vote may is expected to argue that it would be premature and misleading to hold the vote before a final deal with details on trade and immigration is signed the prime minister clashed with the scottish national party mp tasmina ahmed sheikh during prime minister s questions over sturgeon s authority to demand the referendum referring to sturgeon s manifesto pledge to stage a referendum if the uk quits the eu ahmed sheikh said the first minister had won the largest vote in holyrood s history in the last scottish election does she agree that governments should stick to their manifesto promises and if so she cannot object to the first minister sticking to hers she asked may retorted that sturgeon headed a minority government and implied she had lost both the scottish independence referendum in 2014 and the one on eu membership in 2016 she said alex salmond the then snp leader had described the first referendum as a once in a generation vote under the scotland act sturgeon must seek the approval of westminster under a section 30 order to allow her to hold a referendum she is waiting until she wins holyrood s support for her plans next wednesday with the snp one seat short of an overall majority she must rely on six scottish green party votes to win the majority she needs with the tories labour and the liberal democrats planning to vote against her no 10 is waiting to see the wording of next week s holyrood motion and the details of sturgeon s request for a section 30 order before setting out its position the critical thing is what nicola is talking about said one source meanwhile two of may s closest downing street advisers fiona hill and nick timothy her joint chiefs of staff are expected to have private meetings in edinburgh with the scottish tory leader ruth davidson and her advisers to plan may s referendum strategy a scottish government source said sturgeon was happy for may to wait to see her proposals before responding we are realistic and hard headed about the mechanics of this the source said if holyrood gives us the green light we are then in a process where the existing bilateral links we have established and our minister to minister channels would then kick in the tories also believe sturgeon is in a far weaker position than polls showing support for independence as high as 49 suggest a yougov poll for the times on wednesday said only 43 of scots would vote yes the lowest figure for 18 months
2017-03-25,0,brexit negotiations are on course to fail unless both britain and the european union ditch their winner takes all approach to the coming talks the former president of the european commission josé manuel barroso has said with just days to go before theresa may formally notifies brussels of the uk s intention to leave the eu jean claude juncker s predecessor said the two sides were playing a dangerous game the uk s prime minister has said she believes no deal is better than a bad deal and some in her cabinet have openly talked up the prospect of walking away from the negotiating table michel barnier the eu s chief negotiator has placed the settlement of britain s 50bn in financial liabilities as the prerequisite for any progress last week the french former minister conjured up a vision of queues of dover nuclear fuel shortages and chaos for citizens as a consequence of britain s failure to live up to its responsibility asked about the coming brexit talks on the margins of saturday s rome summit to mark the 60th anniversary of the eu s founding the french president françois hollande he said he wanted them to be amicable but added we will ensure that it does not happen to europe s detriment that britain remains a partner of the union but that necessarily it will pay the consequences barroso also suggested that extremists on both sides of the channel wanted the uk to break away from the eu entirely i think both sides until now mostly put the issue in terms of a zero sum game and i think this is not helpful he said what they should understand both sides is that we have to work constructively because whether some people like it or not britain will be part of europe some people both on the continent and in the uk do not like the idea that britain is part of europe but it is of course britain not keeping the responsibility of membership cannot expect the privileges of membership that is quite clear having said that i think it is possible to come to a constructive agreement that minimises the negative points and offers some way forward but that requires on both sides strategic thinking and leadership barroso spoke ahead of the publication of a report on monday from the organisation that represents british manufacturers the eef saying it would be unacceptable for the british government to come away without a deal about 52 of all uk manufactured exports by value went to the eu in the 12 months to april 2016 with production processes crossing european borders numerous times estimates in the chemicals sector have shown that a tariff of between 4 and 6 tariff which the eu imposes on non member states would increase direct trading costs by more than 50m for a single company the eef will say that if the uk walk away with no preferential access to the eu market in place the manufacturing sector would bear much of the brunt of an immediate financial loss
2017-06-13,0,the lack of a majority government means the conservatives will probably have to ease austerity plans and boost spending on public services the newly appointed environment secretary michael gove has said gove a surprise addition to theresa may s new cabinet said the party would need to push ahead on brexit with the maximum possible consensus taking into account the views of remain voters discussions between may s team and the democratic unionist party over what concessions the northern ireland party will seek in return for propping up a conservative government are scheduled for later on tuesday the dup leader arlene foster is expected to largely avoid sectarian issues such as orange parades as conditions under which her mps would provide supply and confidence to a minority government and instead focus on budget based matters the dup has opposed some austerity measures including the bedroom tax and mooted changes to some universal benefits for pensioners such as the winter fuel allowance asked whether the conservatives would need to give ground on this gove told bbc radio 4 s today programme that some concessions were inevitable we do not have a majority and one of the things that i do think that we need to do is to make sure that when we bring forward a programme it commands the broadest possible level of confidence he said and we also need to reflect on what the election result told us about the way people want to see the economy managed in the future i think there is an important balance to be struck and we need to get on with the job of reducing the deficit so that we do not saddle the next generation with a burden of debt while may s government would seek sustainable spending gove said we also need to take account of legitimate public concerns about ensuring that we properly fund public services asked whether the conservatives loss of a majority in last week s election could soften brexit plans gove said it was necessary to proceed with the maximum possible consensus and to take into account the views of people who voted for the uk to remain in the eu asked what this might mean in practice gove declined to elaborate and refused to say whether he would support any cross party commission on brexit i do not think that i should specify and i do not want to specify the means by which we should involve everyone in a conversation gove was sacked from the cabinet when may entered no 10 the pair had fallen out when they were the education and home secretaries respectively saying he was naturally flattered to be asked back into government gove said there was no bad feeling between him and the prime minister i m a huge fan of theresa may s and i have been throughout my political career and i think that she was a great home secretary gove briefly and unsuccessfully challenged for the succession to david cameron having suddenly withdrawn his support for boris johnson as he did so scuppering the latter s chances asked on bbc breakfast about his relations with johnson gove said boris and i spoke at the weekend and we had a great friendly conversation he was kind enough to welcome me back to the cabinet with a very generous tweet and we were chatting yesterday in the margins of cabinet in another media appearance on itv s good morning britain gove was asked about a letter written by labour s deputy leader tom watson to may asking if the media boss rupert murdoch had sought gove s return to cabinet gove who writes a column for the murdoch owned times said tom sees rupert murdoch s hand behind everything i think tom believes that rupert murdoch picks the england cricket xi and the rugby first xv as well as decide who is on britain s got talent this is par for the course for tom when it comes to political mischief making in a subsequent interview with lbc gove said that now he was back in the cabinet he would be giving up his column for the times but might still contribute articles without payment i will no longer be writing there for money but if the editor of the times ever wanted to take an article from me i would always be happy to oblige
2017-06-09,0,jeremy corbyn has defied the pundits and the pollsters to restore the labour party as a serious electoral force and deliver a devastating blow to theresa may s political authority but how this remarkable election saw a surge in both conservative and labour votes as the first past the post system amplified the return of the two party system after an absence of nearly 20 years more than anything else it was a night in which britain s younger generation flexed their political muscles to real effect for the first time despite their calamitous campaign the conservatives increased their share of the vote to 42 up five points since 2015 which in any other election in the past three decades would have been enough to build a commanding majority but labour outperformed even that achievement as a unique alliance of enthused younger voters and previous non voters combined with older austerity hit anti establishment ukippers to deliver a 10 point rise in labour s vote compared with two years ago to 40 this is just below the 41 secured by tony blair in his 2001 landslide victory the youthquake was a key component of corbyn s 10 point advance in labour s share of the vote exceeding even blair s nine point gain in his first 1997 landslide no official data exists for the scale of the youth vote but an nme led exit poll suggests turnout among under 35s rose by 12 points compared with 2015 to 56 the survey said nearly two thirds of younger voters backed labour with brexit being their main concern overall turnout was up 2 at 69 the highest since 1997 with 85 of seats seeing an increase in voters the top five seats with the highest turnouts of 78 79 were winchester twickenham st albans wirral west and wirral south the first three featured fierce lib dem tory battles including vince cable s successful fight in twickenham ten seats that saw the largest 10 plus increases in turnout included newcastle upon tyne east ilford south foyle rossendale and darwen lewisham east and staffordshire south it is likely the youth vote had a decisive influence in seats such as manchester central canterbury and cambridge which are also in the top 22 seats for increased turnout london experienced the biggest concentration of seats with above average turnout 39 being above the national 69 benchmark the largest turnout falls came in scotland where 20 snp held seats recorded drops of up to 8 marking a turn in the nationalist tide only two seats in scotland saw increased turnout orkney and glasgow analysis of the local election results led many to conclude that the shift of ukip s 4 million former voters had almost all gone directly back to the conservatives they appeared to be fuelling the massive 15 point plus tory leads when the snap election was called and confirming boris johnson s claim they were a lost tory tribe but the data shows that picture to be a lot more complicated the ukip vote has fragmented with more than a third going to parties other than the conservatives in at least one seat canterbury where labour won for the first time ukip s failure to stand in a constituency where it secured 7 289 votes in 2015 seemed to fuel labour s 12 000 vote increase in wrexham another seat where ukip stood down it appears labour and the tories equally benefited from ukip s former voters keeping the seat labour despite its high leave profile this fragmentation of the ukip vote also enabled labour to hold on to nottinghamshire marginals such as vernon coaker s gedling the much touted tory surge across the midlands the north west and the north east failed to materialise partly as a result of this effect nigel farage claimed the conservatives had made a major miscalculation in assuming ukippers were just disaffected tory voters the new battleground seats include some unfamiliar names such as kensington in london as key marginals in hastings and rye the home secretary amber rudd now sits on a majority of just 346 and may have to spend more time in her constituency if she does not move to safer territory the tories are now defending 40 seats which are vulnerable to a swing of just 2 5 while there are only 29 labour mps sitting on such a slim majority this advantage to labour however may be eroded when the new constituency boundary changes come into effect next year which were expected to benefit the conservatives there were fears during the campaign that the corbyn surge fuelled by big labour leads among voters under 35 would simply stack up bigger majorities in the party s safe seats but labour made gains across the country in unexpected places such as canterbury plymouth and ipswich while the tories saw their more modest but still substantial increase in support concentrated largely in the seats they already held the national swing from conservatives to labour was 1 8 but there was a sharp brexit variation between remain and leave seats the results show an 8 swing from conservatives to labour in those seats that voted remain in last year s referendum in seats that voted leave there was a 1 swing from labour to the conservatives it appears corbyn s fudged brexit stance proved highly effective in minimising defections among leave voters while still proving positive enough for unhappy remain voters especially in london it was also very much a personal triumph for corbyn the conservatives fuelled by a stratospheric 28 point approval rating for may far outstripping her party s standing with voters chose to base their campaign around her the word conservative was reduced to a footnote corbyn s ratings began at 23 points and he faced a campaign of vilification in the tory papers not seen since their 1980s assault on michael foot corbyn minimised the damage through his unplugged style of mass rallies growing in strength through the campaign and eschewing may s itinerary of highly targeted marginal visits he ended the campaign with a remarkable yougov personal rating of 39 may whose wooden leadership and shortcomings became painfully plain to the public in the full glare of the campaign finished on a rating of 6 she was no longer the electoral asset her party had invested in so heavily but the election was not a uniform national story labour gained most in london and produced good results in wales meanwhile the most effective part of the tory surge came in scotland where they won more seats from the snp than labour it was however overwhelmingly a realignment among the parties voters that produced this hung parliament labour gained strongly among younger more affluent urban voters while the conservatives reached working class voters who had never supported them before the big casualties were the minor parties with ukip being the biggest its vote fell from 13 in 2015 to 2 and the party faces implosion after the resignation of its leader paul nuttall it was a happier story for the liberal democrats despite losing nick clegg the party s national vote share was little changed at 7 but its strategy of fighting the campaign as a series of individual byelections paid off increasing the number of seats from eight to 12 its first advance since 2005
2017-04-01,0,a new row has broken out over the so called tampon tax after it emerged that a quarter of a million pounds from a controversial levy on women s sanitary products is to be given to an anti abortion organisation under pressure from campaigners after failing to honour a pledge to scrap the 5 vat on sanitary products former chancellor george osborne said that more than 10m a year would be redistributed from the tax receipts to women s charities but there was consternation on saturday night among women s groups and politicians who had campaigned on the issue after it emerged that 250 000 of that money is going to life a charity that campaigns against abortion and has been at the centre of controversy over the information provided by a network of unregulated pregnancy counselling centres a spokesperson for the end violence against women coalition said we are surprised to see that life is the recipient of a very significant tampon tax grant the government set out clearly that this money would be spent in ways that would address women s specific needs and inequalities it is hard to understand how a service offering counselling based on the fundamental premise that abortion is wrong to vulnerable women can do that the government announced last friday that 70 organisations across the country would share 12m from the tampon tax fund which it said would improve the lives of disadvantaged women and girls across the country rob wilson the minister for civil society gave details of the funding on a visit to the suzy lamplugh trust which is to receive 200 000 to help increase its casework support service for women who are being stalked four other charities ranging from the women s rape and sexual abuse centre cornwall which is getting 179 157 to black country women s aid 240 401 were highlighted in a press notice from the department for culture media amp sport no mention was made of life but the organisation appears on a separate long list which says it will receive 250 000 for housing practical help counselling emotional support and life skills training for young pregnant women who are homeless there has been surprise not just at the award but at its size it is one of the largest donations on the list life describes itself as unique combining pro life advocacy and education work with nationwide services providing positive alternatives to abortion it served notice last year of plans to increase its online presence to compete with established service providers such as marie stopes and the british pregnancy advisory service bpas among others who criticised the grant was labour mp paula sherriff whose successful amendment to last year s budget led to the government pledging to abolish the tax it will seem bitterly ironic to many women if we are taxed for our biology only for the government to hand over that money to organisations that do not even believe we should have control over our own bodies especially when so many are left without basic sanitary protection she said just this thursday i led a commons debate on period poverty and discussed terrible cases like the homeless women who cannot afford tampons and whose health is at risk the girls in leeds who play truant during their periods and a charity that provides free sanitary products to africa now getting requests from schools in britain because so many female pupils cannot afford them tackling these issues would surely be a better use of the tampon tax fund the minister agreed on thursday to look at funding for sanitary protection in schools and homeless shelters and i will be asking the government to review their allocation of the tampon tax fund urgently there was also criticism from the women s equality party its leader sophie walker said we consider any restriction on women s reproductive rights as violence against us and thus it was a shock to learn the government has used the tampon tax fund to support a charity whose mission is anti choice and aims to make abortion a thing of the past while we appreciate the work life does to support homeless pregnant women and care for children with life limiting or terminal illnesses we are very disappointed to see the allocation of such significant funds to this one charity while many others struggle particularly those supporting black and minority ethnic women and disabled women who experience some of the highest rates of violence against them and yet are consistently at the bottom of the list for funding the government had originally faced a potential rebellion over the issue after an amendment tabled by sherriff won the backing of eurosceptics keen to assert britain s power to set its own tax rates osborne had originally pledged to remove the tampon tax in november 2015 but was unable to do so due to regulations applied by the european commission that prevented member states from doing so the government said on friday that it is committed to continuing the fund until eu rules allow a zero rate of vat to be applied to women s sanitary products and that a decision will be made on the future of the fund once this has been achieved wilson said at the launch of the fund from cornwall to dundee the tampon tax fund continues to benefit organisations in every corner of the uk working to improve the lives of disadvantaged women and girls including those who have been affected by violence this fund is helping to improve lives supporting our ambition to create a fairer shared society for everyone i m glad that so many worthwhile organisations will benefit from this money a spokesperson for life said we believe that our support services for women are not a luxury but are essential for them to have the space to look at options for continuing their pregnancies with support
2017-02-21,0,british mps lined up on monday to pour scorn on a racist and sexist donald trump who they said should not be allowed to come to britain for a state visit because of the risk it would embarrass the queen the us president was compared to a petulant child and had his intelligence questioned by mps during a three hour debate triggered after more than 1 8 million people signed a petition urging theresa may to cancel her invitation so many politicians packed into westminster hall for the debate that they had to have their speeches limited to five minutes each alex salmond said he was unsure over whether to be appalled by the morality of the invitation or astonished by its stupidity as an example of fawning subservience the prime minister holding hands with trump would be difficult to match the former scottish first minister said to do it in the name of shared values was stomach churning what exactly are the shared values that this house this country would hope to have labour s paul flynn said that only two us presidents had been accorded a state visit to britain in more than half a century and it was completely unprecedented that trump had been issued his within seven days of his presidency flynn who started the debate because he is on the petitions committee said trump would hardly be silenced by the invitation being rescinded accusing him of a ceaseless incontinence of free speech asked by caroline lucas co leader of the green party if trump s views on climate science should also be taken into account flynn responded that the president had shown cavernous depths of scientific ignorance on the issue they were speaking as thousands of demonstrators descended on parliament square to protest against the visit chanting and waving placards reading no to racism no to trump the shadow home secretary diane abbott addressed the crowds as did lucas who emerged from the debate to describe trump as a bully and a bigot inside the chamber flynn was criticised by a conservative mp when he quoted the observer s andrew rawnsley who has described the visit as the government pimping out the queen for donald trump jacob rees mogg responded that it was out of order to refer to pimping out our sovereign and argued that no one had complained when emperor hirohito came on a state visit to the uk who he said was responsible for the rape of nanking rees mogg was one of a number of tories to defend both the president and may for issuing a state visit nigel evans mp for ribble valley warned against sneering at the 61 million americans who voted for the president describing them as the forgotten people adam holloway conservative mp for gravesham said that while trump s travel ban on people from seven muslim majority countries was absurd it was rather refreshing to see a politician actually do what they had promised crispin blunt who chairs the foreign affairs committee said the queen would be embarrassed if the invitation was now withdrawn edward leigh conservative mp for gainsborough told colleagues that he was going to make a difficult argument and then claimed that trump s racism and misogyny had been overstated which one of us has not made some ridiculous sexual comment at some point in his past he said prompting an angry response from female mps a number of female mps stood up to complain of trump s sexism with paula sherriff labour mp for dewsbury and mirfield quoting his infamous grab her by the pussy comment which she said was sexual assault rushanara ali labour mp for bethnal green and bow urged the prime minister to remove her invitation because of the damage to the queen of the association naz shah labour mp for bradford west said she had once urged trump to come to her constituency to share a curry and meet a muslim chief superintendent headteacher health workers and so on but to do so now that he is president will only reinforce his actions his divisive racist and sexist messages this flies in the face of everything we stand for we cannot support what he is doing she said david lammy the labour mp for tottenham warned that african americans were afraid of the presidency saying trump was supported by the ku klux klan and had white supremacists in his inner circle salmond also said that trump would not have forgotten previous insults of him by the prime minister and said that his experience of dealing with the former reality television star who owns golf courses in scotland showed may was in a difficult position from my experience negotiating with donald trump never ever do it from a weak position because the result will be a total disaster however those close to ministers made clear that there would be no rowing back on the invitation to trump and hit out at mps it would be interesting to see how much time and public money was wasted on today s debate it achieved nothing apart from offering some who have nothing better to do the opportunity to grandstand the british people will be more interested in the important debate in the lords on brexit said a government source
2017-03-20,0,boris johnson will meet key white house figures including donald trump s most powerful aide steve bannon during a trip to the us this week the guardian understands the foreign secretary is also expected to meet stephen miller and kellyanne conway as well as republican congressional leaders and is likely to see the secretary of state rex tillerson the visit first to washington dc then new york comes after of a row over wiretapping claims that threatened to damage relations between the two countries press secretary sean spicer claimed last week that britain s gchq had helped barack obama spy on trump in comments that triggered a withering response from the former british ambassador to the us sir peter westmacott johnson is also expected to meet the president s national security adviser hr mcmaster but sources suggested he was unlikely to raise concerns about the controversy during the sessions a government source indicated that whitehall considered the situation resolved after us figures expressed regret and provided reassurances that it would not be repeated however a suggestion that mcmaster had apologised for the row have been publicly denied by spicer johnson is thought to have got on well with bannon who has courted controversy through his white nationalist views and hardline stance on the media in previous meetings as such he is considered a possible middleman between the british government and the trump administration johnson is not expected to meet the us president during his visit one foreign office source suggested the meetings would be foreign policy heavy with a focus on russia the middle east nato and the fight against islamic state but also include wide ranging talks on domestic policy the foreign secretary is likely to see tillerson at a washington summit on taking on isis during which more than 60 countries will be represented he will then travel to new york to chair a un security council meeting that will discuss the unfolding situations in somalia and south sudan where famine has killed tens of thousands of people
2017-06-06,0,theresa may has declared she is prepared to rip up human rights laws to impose new restrictions on terror suspects as she sought to gain control over the security agenda just 36 hours before the polls open the prime minister said she was looking at how to make it easier to deport foreign terror suspects and how to increase controls on extremists where it is thought they present a threat but there is not enough evidence to prosecute them the last ditch intervention comes after days of pressure on may over the policing cuts and questions over intelligence failures following terror attacks on london bridge manchester and westminster she said but i can tell you a few of the things i mean by that i mean longer prison sentences for people convicted of terrorist offences i mean making it easier for the authorities to deport foreign terror suspects to their own countries and i mean doing more to restrict the freedom and the movements of terrorist suspects when we have enough evidence to know they present a threat but not enough evidence to prosecute them in full in court and if human rights laws stop us from doing it we will change those laws so we can do it the proposed measures appear to be an attempt at strengthening terrorism prevention and investigation measures tpims rather than a complete return to labour s control orders which were repeatedly struck down by the courts and then scrapped by may in 2010 when she was home secretary they could involve further curfews restrictions on association with other known extremists controls on where they can travel and limits on access to communication devices she could even increase the period for which terror suspects can be held without trial currently 14 days a move that provoked clashes with civil liberties campaigners when tony blair attempted it after the 7 july 2005 attacks may told the sun she would consult the intelligence agencies about what they think is needed when we reduced it to 14 days we actually allowed for legislation to enable it to be at 28 days we said there may be circumstances where it is necessary to do this i will listen to what they think is necessary for us to do the conservatives have promised not to withdraw from the european convention on human rights during the next parliament but they could begin to try to replace or amend parts of the human rights act after the uk leaves the eu it is possible may s plans could involve seeking further derogations from the echr this is the way the government is seeking to prevent human rights claims against soldiers in future military situations earlier in the day the prime minister tried to return her election campaign to the issues of brexit and her leadership as the tories poll lead over jeremy corbyn s labour remained narrow but she continued to face a barrage of questions over the impact of cuts to policing sadiq khan the labour mayor of london said planned cuts of 10 40 in london over the next four years would make it harder to foil terrorist attacks on our city may was then repeatedly challenged about how the home office police and intelligence services dealt with the information relating to the attackers after boris johnson her foreign secretary said mi5 had questions to answer one of the attackers khuram butt 27 had been reported to the anti terror hotline in 2015 and a third attacker youssef zaghba 22 had been detained by italian authorities in 2016 zaghba named by police for the first time yesterday was put on an international terrorism database for an attempt to travel to syria in march 2016 which was thwarted after he allegedly told officials at bologna i am going to be a terrorist but this does not seem to have been spotted by uk intelligence agencies his mother valeria collina told the italian news magazine l espresso that her son was friends with the two other men and monitored by italian officials after his failed journey to syria may said she absolutely recognised people s concerns and added that she expected the intelligence agencies to launch a review of the london bridge attack we need to look at how the terror threat is evolving the way that terrorism is breeding terrorism and the increased tempo of attacks we have had three horrific attacks and we have foiled five others the tempo is there in a way we have not seen before she said we will look at how the processes were followed what they did they will want to be looking at that because they will want to learn lessons for the future if there are those lessons to be learned she added the police and security service have done a good job in foiling a number of plots just five in the last three months and a significant number in the last few years as well may declined to say whether zaghba had been monitored or subject to an exclusion order when he returned to the uk after being stopped in italy and declined an opportunity to apologise for any failures by the intelligence agencies despite having previously said she believed the police and security services had the resources they needed to deal with terrorism she went on to announce details of a proposed crackdown on terrorism at a rally of conservative activists in slough her remarks suggested that if she is re elected her government could look to step up the use of orders that restrict the movement of terror suspects there are currently only seven terror suspects considered enough of a threat to be given tpims while there are about 23 000 people considered to have been subjects of interest by the security services tpims which expire after two years can include overnight curfews of up to 10 hours electronic tagging reporting regularly to the police exclusion from certain zones enforced relocation and some limitations on use of a mobile phone and the internet elements of the orders could be strengthened but any attempt to return to the 18 hour a day curfews imposed by control orders would be likely to end up in the courts may s proposals follow criticism from labour and other parties about her cuts to policing and approach to tackling terrorism in the home office which she led for six years corbyn accused the prime minister on sunday night of trying to protect the public on the cheap by implementing 20 000 police cuts the prime minister has also been accused of politicising her response to the london bridge terror attack when she addressed the nation outside downing street on sunday she declared enough is enough as she announced plans tointroduce new anti terror laws without going into details about whatshe would do labour leader jeremy corbyn said you cannot keep our country safe on the cheap theresa may is refusing to put in the resources that are needed she has slashed funding for the police our courts system and border force i will do everything necessary and effective to keep our people safe we will always keep the law under review but do not believe would be terrorists and suicide bombers will be deterred by longer sentences or restricting our rights at home the right response to the recent attacks is to halt the conservative cuts and invest in our police and security services and protect our democratic values including the human rights act it is disgraceful that the conservative government is suppressing its own report into terrorist funding we will not shy away from the difficult conversations about who funds and supports terrorism tim farron the lib dem leader said may was only posturing about being tough on terror he added in her years as home secretary she was willing to offer up the police for cut after cut we have been here before a kind of nuclear arms race in terror laws might give the appearance of action but what the security services lack is not more power but more resources and responsibility for that lies squarely with theresa may the london bridge attack on saturday night left seven people dead and 15 remain in hospital in critical condition raids and searches of properties in east london continue but 12 others arrested as part of inquiries into whether anyone else helped the attackers have been released without charge
2017-02-17,0,britain is beginning to reassess how reliable an ally the us is the scottish conservative party leader ruth davidson has said in comments that contrast starkly with the official policy of the uk government during an interview at the women in the world summit in washington davidson said at the moment from the uk we have always seen america as being a very strong a reliable ally and now even after only 26 days or however long donald trump s tenure has been so far in pennsylvania avenue we are beginning to reassess how reliable an ally the united states is and that is a huge change in europe that is a massive massive shock we are going to want to make sure any deals that are done trump is going to honour we have to be sure of that theresa may was the first world leader to visit trump after he became president and she has been clear that the relationship between the uk and the us will remain strong despite the controversies surrounding the trump administration on the eve of her visit to the oval office in january may told journalists that opposites attract speaking before a press conference on thursday in which trump attacked the media davidson said the trend for politicians to demonise the media should worry us all we have to be very careful about popular nationalists populist strongmen part demagogues using a lot of their political capital at the beginning of their journey to delegitimise public scrutiny which is what demonising the media does she said and i think that if we learn our lessons from history there is a very strategic reason why you would do that and i think that should worry us all davidson said it was only lazy members of the media who thought she was not what you would expect a conservative necessarily to be the idea that i m something completely other is wrong because i worked for 10 years as a journalist for the bbc and for others and was interviewing politicians every day so i was not completely foreign to the world she said it was not like a bunch of one step away from white supremacist bloggers that are living just up the street she added taking a swipe at steve bannon trump s chief strategist and the co founder of far right website breitbart news and it turns out they are completely chaotic davidson expressed reservations about the decision to invite trump on a state visit to the uk the whole point of state visits is that it is about having people who share your philosophy your friends and all the rest of it that is the difference from a bilateral summit or whatever she said and the thing that i had a problem with is that that could go on while there are members of my own country being banned from the us people with joint passports but she concluded i will extend and i m sure the government of the united kingdom will extend every courtesy to the president of the united states when he arrives as you should with any world leader but we are going to want to make sure that any deal we do he is going to honour we have to be sure of that it is not the first time the scottish tory leader has been critical of trump before he was elected davidson was reported by the herald newspaper as saying the billionaire s impetuosity could be dangerous not just for america but for the world a source at the foreign office said the official position on the uk us relationship was well known and had not changed speaking in the commons last month the foreign secretary boris johnson said the uk s alliance with the us was vital on defence intelligence and security we work together more closely than any other two countries in the world that relationship is overwhelmingly to our benefit he said the prime minister s highly successful visit to the white house last week underlined the strength of that transatlantic alliance where we have differences with the unites states we will not quail from expressing them
2017-04-19,0,theresa may has stunned westminster by demanding a snap general election on 8 june that she hopes will turn her party s clear lead in the opinion polls into a healthy parliamentary majority and secure her conservative vision for brexit the prime minister made an unscheduled statement on tuesday morning from behind a lectern outside 10 downing street in which she recanted her repeated promise not to go to the polls before 2020 she accused opposition parties of trying to jeopardise her government s preparations for exiting the eu as she called for what would be a third nationwide poll in three years while the labour leader jeremy corbyn responded by saying he would welcome the opportunity to fight an election opposing tory austerity may said we need a general election and we need one now because we have at this moment a one off chance to get this done while the european union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin supporters of the prime minister said she would use the election to crush dissent over brexit with one projection by the election expert michael thrasher suggesting she could secure a majority of 140 on the basis of current polls his estimate suggests the number of tory mps could rise from 331 to 395 with labour potentially slumping from 229 to 164 under the fixed term parliaments act may cannot call an election directly but will lay down a motion in the house of commons requiring two thirds of mps to back it labour the liberal democrats and the scottish national party all promised not to stand in her way allowing for the commons to be dissolved on 3 may mps will vote on whether to dissolve parliament after a 90 minute debate on wednesday after prime minister s questions in a sign of the tone she is likely to adopt during the seven week campaign may quickly focused on her opponents in her address to the nation saying the country is coming together but westminster is not she added in recent weeks labour have threatened to vote against the final agreement we reach with the european union the liberal democrats have said they want to grind the business of government to a standstill the snp say they will vote against the legislation that formally repeals britain s membership of the european union and unelected members of the house of lords have vowed to fight us every step of the way corbyn made clear that labour would back the government in calling for dissolution despite anger from some of his party s mps who are worried about losing their seats in the election the labour leader said i welcome the prime minister s decision to give the british people the chance to vote for a government that will put the interests of the majority first labour will be offering the country an effective alternative to a government that has failed to rebuild the economy delivered falling living standards and damaging cuts to our schools and nhs one shadow cabinet member and ally of the labour leader argued that corbyn could turn around public expectations over the next eight weeks opposition politicians pointed out that may had repeatedly said she would not call a general election the prime minister said she had come to the decision reluctantly and recently but felt it was necessary to secure stability at a time when her party is riding high in the polls sources suggested that advisers believed the argument would resonate with the public may used a television interview with itv s political editor robert peston to suggest she had made her decision during last week s break from parliament before easter i spent a few days walking in wales with my husband i thought about this long and hard and came to the decision that to provide for that stability and certainty this was the way to do it she said but the guardian understands that may had been considering the question for a few weeks and had all but made up her mind before using the holiday to mull it over the idea had been a tightly guarded secret only discussed among a very small group of her closest advisers with senior colleagues in the party only finding out on tuesday sources admitted that a key hope was to boost the tories slim working majority of 17 in order to help pass brexit linked legislation such as the great repeal bill as well as plans for a future immigration system and domestic policies such as may s flagship grammar schools reform they said the prime minister was determined to avoid endless back and forth on important issues key cabinet members including the home secretary amber rudd the brexit secretary david davis and the foreign secretary boris johnson were informed of the decision in individual meetings on tuesday morning the chancellor philip hammond also knew in advance recent polls show a healthy lead for the conservatives a guardian icm survey on tuesday placed the party 21 points ahead of labour despite a policy blitz by corbyn s party it had the tories on 46 compared with 25 for labour and 11 for the lib dems it also suggested there was support for a snap election with 55 of respondents backing the idea compared with 15 opposing it labour sources pointed out that polls had not been consistent with one recently placing the tory lead at just nine points the lib dems made clear that they planned to turn the general election into a referendum on a hard brexit with the leader tim farron telling voters this election is your chance to change the direction of our country writing in the guardian he said there are large numbers of conservative seats where the lib dems are the challengers seats up and down the country where the tories are looking vulnerable where constituents will question this brutal dumb hard brexit the only way to stop theresa may winning a majority the only way to stop a hard brexit is by the lib dems winning in those seats among well known lib dems standing for re election will be the former cabinet ministers vince cable and ed davey the snp was less supportive of the notion of an early election but said it would not stand in the way the party s westminster leader angus robertson claimed that scotland was now a two horse race between the snp and the conservatives adding that he was hopeful of gaining on the 56 of 59 scottish seats won in 2015 senior conservatives suggested that may would focus the election on leadership as well as on completing brexit and key domestic policies such as education the party is also likely to repeat a 2015 tactic to contrast the likelihood of a conservative majority to a corbyn led coalition that included the snp downing street ruled out may appearing in any head to head tv debates despite demands from corbyn i say to theresa may who said this election was about leadership come on and show some he said let us have the debates it is what democracy needs and what the british people deserve but broadcasters are likely to avoid heated clashes with downing street as seen during the 2015 election which ended with david cameron taking part in special election programmes instead of head to heads the election caused nerves among labour mps with some bemoaning the possible loss of colleagues and two of the party s politicians tom blenkinsop and alan johnson saying they would not contest their seats tony blair has called on voters to consider maintaining politicians of any party determined to maintain an open mind on brexit the damage to the country will be huge if we end up with an unrestrained brexit at any cost majority he wrote claiming may was trying to take advantage of labour s difficulties the state of the labour leadership offers such an obvious target that it would be an extraordinary act of political self denial to refuse to put the opposition to the test said blair arguing that the prime minister also wanted a mandate for brexit before the talks ran into inevitable difficulties conservatives were largely supportive of the decision with steve baker a key backbencher who chairs the european research group claiming that labour and the lib dems were trying to scupper brexit i am delighted that the prime minister has decided to ask the parliament to go to the country in pursuit of a mandate for the plans she has set out for leaving the european union this should be great news for a strong and stable government a strong negotiating hand and a good deal he said labour are going to decide if they want a real brexit or a fake one a fake brexit is staying in the customs unions or eea unable to chart our own course on trade policy and services regulation others claimed that may had been driven by controversy facing her party over election expenses in 2015 with the cps still considering charges against dozens of mps but some tories were more nervous with one mp first elected in 2015 with a relatively small majority over the liberal democrats saying he was preparing for a tough battle i m in a better position than some colleagues there is a few who are more panicky than me he said but it is still tricky for me i d have preferred to get more things done before i stood for election again and there is only so much you can do in less than two years five years gives you a chance to make your mark
2017-03-06,0,theresa may will not allow mps and peers a proper veto over her brexit deal in case it gives the eu the incentive to offer the uk bad terms her spokesman has said the prime minister believed the uk must not allow the establishment of a process that encouraged eu countries to scupper brexit he said on monday the warning came on the eve of a house of lords debate about giving mps and peers a meaningful vote at the end of two years of talks with brussels parliament is currently only being offered a take it or leave it vote accept may s brexit deal or leav e the eu with no deal and trade on world trade organisation terms instead however peers are expected to vote on a cross party basis for parliament to have the power to reject may s deal and send her back to the negotiating table if it does not like what she has achieved asked why the government would not accept a more meaningful vote may s official spokesman said the pm believes we should not commit to any process that would incentivise the eu to offer us a bad deal he said any deal that could be rejected by mps would give strength to other parties in the negotiation we believe it should be a simple bill in relation to triggering article 50 and nothing else downing street s position indicates the government will not accept any amendment passed by the lords in relation to a vote at the end of the two years of negotiations it is also sticking to its stance of refusing to guarantee the rights of eu citizens living in the uk until a similar guarantee is achieved for uk citizens in the rest of the eu the house of lords voted by 358 to 256 last week in favour of guaranteeing the rights of eu citizens in the uk as part of its scrutiny of the brexit bill mps are likely to reverse that change when the legislation returns to the commons and peers are expected to back down after that in order not to block the passage of the bill by the end of march when may wants to trigger article 50
2017-01-17,0,theresa may is expected to use the most important speech of her premiership to confirm that britain will be leaving the single market while insisting that it wants to remain the best friend to european partners in remarks that critics will cite as evidence that the government is pursuing a hard brexit the prime minister will say there is no option that leaves britain half in half out as she sets out 12 key priorities for the eu negotiations critically she will insist there will be no compromise over the ability to control borders and regain sovereignty speaking to an audience at lancaster house westminster including ambassadors from across the world may will stress her ambition to reach out beyond the continent to build new trading relationships in a move that suggests the uk will also leave the customs union however the prime minister is likely to restate an argument that she does not see it as an either or choice and say that whatever final deal on trade and customs duties is struck lorries will be able to pass through dover and other ports unhindered despite warnings from others on the issue we seek a new and equal partnership between an independent self governing global britain and our friends and allies in the eu not partial membership of the european union associate membership of the european union or anything that leaves us half in half out may is expected to say we do not seek to adopt a model already enjoyed by other countries we do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave the united kingdom is leaving the european union my job is to get the right deal for britain as we do advisers know the speech could have an impact on the value on sterling by confirming that the uk cannot stay in the single market but may will say that british voters backed brexit with their eyes open in a speech that will delight eurosceptic backbenchers she will avoid talking about soft or hard options but instead promise a clean break from the eu the priorities include control over immigration and removing britain from the jurisdiction of the european court of justice plus securing the rights of eu citizens in britain committing to retain workers rights building a strong trading relationship with the eu and rest of the world making britain an attractive place for investors and students and preserving the union may will say that these negotiating priorities will be driven by four underlying principles certainty and clarity a stronger britain a fairer britain and a truly global britain the prime minister will attempt to offer a more positive vision of the situation to other european countries our vote to leave the european union was no rejection of the values we share the decision to leave the eu represents no desire to become more distant to you our friends and neighbours we will continue to be reliable partners willing allies and close friends she will say we want to buy your goods sell you ours trade with you as freely as possible and work with one another to make sure we are all safer more secure and more prosperous through continued friendship may s words which sources say have had significant input from the foreign secretary boris johnson and brexit secretary david davis is likely to be cheered by mps who support brexit staff in downing street are also said to be positive about the speech which is expected to be long and detailed however many of may s opponents including some within the conservative party will despair at the lack of compromise on migration and sovereignty that will mean britain has no choice but to leave the european single market whitehall sources suggested that may had been urged to take a harder stance over brexit by cabinet colleagues who have argued that a rerun of the referendum would result in an even more emphatic victory for brexit in the region of 60 40 they believe the fact that the predicted economic downturn has not materialised means that voters are increasingly warming to the idea of britain s clean break the scottish national party is likely to react with anger to may s likely decision to ignore their demands to attempt to reach a special settlement for scotland under which it could stay a member of the internal market while retaining free movement of labour the first minister nicola sturgeon has warned that failure to heed the desires of the scottish government in the face of last june s remain vote north of the border could result in a second independence referendum angus robertson the party s leader in westminster said the prime minister should know that the snp and the scottish government are not bluffing we are deadly serious about protecting scotland s place in europe and i would expect to hear that she is taking this seriously if making keynote speech about brexit but i m not holding my breath tim farron the liberal democrat leader also hit out at may highlighting the fact she had been photographed for vogue magazine i assume they are going to change the name to vague for this edition to match her vision of our future trading relationship with europe she could get also a critical response from conservative backbenchers planning to tour radio and television studios on tuesday to respond to the speech meanwhile the swedish foreign minister ann linde told the guardian that it was inevitable that britain would have to leave the single market speaking during a trip to the uk which included a meeting with the brexit secretary the swedish politician said the messages i got from ministers is that there is no political possibility to keep free movement of people and the european court of justice it is not possible to be in the single market if those parameters are not there linde warned that leaving the customs union was not risk free with an official inquiry in sweden finding that 2 000 companies said it was particularly difficult to trade with norway which is outside the customs union she said that negotiations could take time with at least 15 months for exit talks before discussions about a new trade deal after that but linde insisted that she wanted the remaining member states the eu27 to embark on constructive negotiations with britain as it was in everybody s interest she said she hoped that may would strike a different tone on tuesday than in a speech during last september s conservative party conference that may was given an economic boost before the speech when the international monetary fund which had warned during the referendum campaign of a negative impact from a brexit vote upgraded its outlook for the british economy this year the imf said it expected the uk to grow by 1 5 up from a previous forecast of 1 1 however the washington based institution cut its forecast for 2018 from 1 7 to 1 4 owing to uncertainty over britain s unsettled exit terms investors displayed unease on the eve of may s speech with the ftse 100 index ending a record 14 day winning streak on monday the pound dipped below 1 20 at one point as it fell to a three month low reflecting concerns that the prime minister would confirm plans for a hard brexit the government will present tuesday s speech as its plan for exiting the eu as demanded by labour during a parliamentary vote however the shadow brexit secretary keir starmer argued that a one off speech is not the same as a plan for brexit he argued that may s priority should be the economy having spoken to businesses trade unions and communities across the uk it is clear what they need to hear that the prime minister will put jobs and the economy first ensure companies are able to trade without tariffs or additional impediments that there will be no watering down of key employment or environmental rights and that we will form a new cooperative relationship with the eu rupert harrison former chief of staff to george osborne at the treasury said he did not believe may was definitively ruling out leaving the customs union especially in key industries i think there is a possibility the uk will seek to remain in the customs union in some very important sectors where we have integrated supply chains across borders car manufacturing and aerospace harrison now chief macro strategist at blackrock said it was very difficult to imagine how you build an airbus aircraft without being in the customs union in some way or how some of the big car manufacturers who are shipping parts sometimes several times across borders can continue doing so without being in the customs union however prominent remain campaigners including former lib dem leader nick clegg and new labour cabinet minister peter mandelson voiced dismay at the proposals in the speech clegg told the guardian may was sending the signal that the needs and aspirations and interests of 16 1m fellow citizens counts for nothing mandelson said the prime minister was trying to conceal the difficult choices britain would be forced to make outside the single market and the customs union customs barriers add costs and delays which would mean we lose our market share he told bbc radio 4 a hard brexit is when financial and other services cannot access the eu market because regulators do not accept the equivalence of the new uk regulatory regime when staff needed to fill vacancies are not able to come here there are no clicky fingers solutions but not even to acknowledge that there are difficult choices that have to be made i think is very worrying the former eu trade commissioner said may had to make it absolutely clear that the country s interests come first not partisan interests and she is got to be a prime minister for the whole of the country not just those who voted to leave
2017-01-20,0,nigel farage s love affair with donald trump s america has taken another leap forward with news the former ukip leader is to become a commentator on fox news fox announced farage would be joining to provide political analysis on its main news channel and its business network in a short statement during trump s swearing in as the 45th us president fox is owned by rupert murdoch who has attempted to forge ties with trump following his victory and was also a backer of the campaign to leave the eu new york magazine s gabriel sherman has reported that the media mogul who owns the sun and times newspapers in london speaks to trump at least three times a week trump has publicly praised farage posing with him just after his election victory and tweeting that he would make a great ambassador to the us on thursday night farage and his ally aaron banks who bankrolled the leave eu campaign held a party at a washington hotel near the white house during the event farage repeatedly praised trump describing him as the only person i have ever met in my life who makes me feel like an introvert and saying that brexit is great but trump is brexit plus plus plus steve hilton the former adviser to david cameron who was also recently unveiled as a fox contributor was also at the party organised by banks and farage trump did not attend despite the organisers repeatedly suggesting he might it is unclear whether the fox role will affect farage s radio show on lbc which only began two weeks ago or his role as mep for south east england
2017-05-24,0,the first visible signs of the deployment of 984 soldiers on the streets of britain will be on wednesday afternoon outside downing street the houses of parliament and buckingham palace as they backfill guarding duties at key sites currently carried out by armed police officers both the prime minister and home secretary made clear in their announcement of the move that they are extremely wary of the political impact of the sight of armed soldiers patrolling the streets of britain and want to use them for as short a time as possible the threat level has only twice before been raised to critical since the system of official threat levels was introduced on 1 august 2006 it was raised for three days from 10 august 2006 at the time of the transatlantic airliner plot and on 30 june 2007 when the security services uncovered the plot to bomb a nightclub on london s haymarket this was a plot that culminated in the attack on glasgow airport the threat level was reduced to severe three days later on 13 august 2007 after suspects were arrested as far afield as australia however already there are warnings to the police that this time the critical threat may last up to a week the use of troops in aid to the civil power on the streets of britain is a major move by the security chiefs and directly flows from the decision to raise the threat level from severe meaning an attack is likely to critical meaning an attack is expected imminently as theresa may explained when she made the decision public this means that armed police officers responsible for duties such as guarding key sites will be replaced by members of the armed forces which will allow the police to significantly increase the number of armed officers on patrol in key locations you might also see military personnel deployed at certain events such as concerts and sports matches helping the police to keep the public safe in all circumstances members of the armed forces who are deployed in this way will be under the command of police officers sports events are expected to include this weekend s fa cup final the announcement of the move to a critical threat level on tuesday night was unusual in recent years changes in the threat level have been announced by the home secretary alone on a recommendation from the independent joint terrorism analysis centre jtac the decision was also unusual in that mi5 s definition of a critical threat is that an attack is expected imminently may did not say this in her late night statement instead she said only that it was a possibility we cannot ignore that there is a wider group of individuals linked to this attack and that a further attack may be imminent this is different and does not mean that they know an active cell including a potential bomber is at large but that they fear it may be the case and need to be cautious for both may and amber rudd one major reason for their anxiety will be that the sight of armed troops on the streets will provoke accusations of moves towards a french style militarised police state and inevitable speculation that in the middle of a general election campaign the decision comes with political overtones as well as from operational necessity the last time the use of troops under operation temperer was considered was immediately after the terrorist attacks in paris but in the face of defence reservations they were only used covertly as backup for the visible armed police presence at railway stations and airports and so this is the first time the plan has been fully activated both may and rudd will be also be mindful of the reaction to a 2003 decision by tony blair to deploy 400 soldiers and three scimitar armoured cars at heathrow airport in response to an alleged plot for a missile attack on aircraft blair was sharply criticised for his send in the tanks style response to a terrorist threat defence chiefs are also anxious about the use of their troops on the streets they look at france where an initial deployment in the immediate aftermath of the brussels and paris attacks has proved far from temporary indeed their numbers have since been increased and armed soldiers patrolling the streets are now a common sight even in towns in rural france the military has also voiced concerns about overstretch and the morale of the troops being used operation temperer means that up to 3 800 armed troops can be deployed at sensitive sites and events transport hubs and other crowded public places in order to release the armed police for other policing duties they can only be used to augment armed police officers engaged in protective security duties and can only be authorised by a cobra emergency meeting the prime minister went out of her way to stress that the armed troops would be under the direct command of the police who would also determine where and how they are used the home secretary also stressed it was a temporary measure the decision to increase the threat level was taken by jtac which analyses and assesses all intelligence relating to international terrorism in britain and overseas it brings together counter terrorism experts from the police security services and whitehall departments they include charles farr chairman of the joint intelligence committee and mark sedwill national security adviser who both worked very closely with may at the home office as may indicated it met repeatedly on tuesday to assess the level of threat in the morning it decided that the threat level should remain at severe but as the police investigation continued into the associates of the manchester suicide bomber salman abedi they took the decision to raise it to the highest level as the prime minister explained the possibility of a wider network being behind abedi s attack justified their decision the clear implication is that he came from a terrorist jihadi cell some elements of which may well still be active and a real danger
2017-04-01,0,an urgent review of weak and helpless electoral laws is being demanded by a group of leading academics who say that uncontrolled dark money poses a threat to the fundamental principles of british democracy a working group set up by the london school of economics warns that new technology has disrupted british politics to such an extent that current laws are unable to ensure a free and fair election or control the influence of money in politics damian tambini director of the media policy project at the lse who heads the group made up of leading experts in the field said that new forms of online campaigning had not only changed the ways that political parties target voters but crucially had also altered the ability of big money interests to manipulate political debate there is a real danger we are heading down the us route where whoever spends the most money is most likely to win that is why we have always controlled spending in this country but these controls are no longer working its policy brief published on saturday concludes that current laws can no longer ensure the fundamental principle of a level playing field or guard against foreign influence and that parliament urgently needs to review uk electoral law it comes as questions continue to be asked about spending during the referendum campaign in an interview published in sunday s observer new review arron banks the founder of the leave eu campaign says we were just cleverer than the regulators and the politicians of course we were the electoral commission is investigating whether work that the data analytics firm cambridge analytica may have done for leave eu constitutes an undeclared donation from an impermissible foreign donor cambridge analytica is majority owned by the hedge fund billionaire robert mercer who bankrolled donald trump filings from the white house disclosed on friday that steve bannon donald trump s strategy chief was paid 125 333 by the firm last year asked whether he was worried about the electoral commission s investigation into leave eu banks said i do not give a monkey s about the electoral commission banks also claimed that vote leave cheated to get around campaign financing rules by donating money to third party campaigns they cheated they gave 650 grand to a student come on they absolutely 100 cheated a spokesman for vote leave responded the electoral commission gave us a clean bill of health privately the commission admitted that the only penalties it was allowed to impose by law offered no deterrent to political parties particularly in a one off referendum in addition the lse found that loopholes in electoral law mean that spending by political parties during the referendum was almost entirely unregulated or even recorded the real cost of the campaign building databases to target voters via social media occurred almost entirely outside the period regulated by law tambini said we do not have a system that is working any more in this country we have had laws to control spending by political campaigns but online campaigning has changed everything and none of the existing laws cover it the ability to throw around large amounts of cash is almost completely uncontrolled the key costs in campaigning building the databases is happening during the period when campaign spending is not regulated at all there is a real danger that public trust in the democratic process will be lost there is real potential for foreign influence we have now the ability to manipulate public opinion on a level we have never seen before and the current framework is weak and helpless the electoral commission has not yet made any public statement but privately it said we did have this environment that guaranteed a level playing field but with the shift online that has all changed we will not be able to limit the power of money in elections that is what we are very concerned about tambini said it is urgent there could be a wholesale loss of trust in the process as the result of a scandal or swinging of an election though some would argue that has already happened there has to be a principle of transparency the public needs to know where the money is coming from and we do not martin moore director of the centre for the study of media communication and power at king s college london said the machinery of campaigning had changed so rapidly the law has had no chance to catch up the first election where digital made a difference was in 2008 and now it is where pretty much all the spending is it has been a shift that has happened in less than 10 years what we are seeing is exactly the same sort of disruption that we have seen in news and music and other industries that is exactly what is happening in politics the problem is that if you disrupt politics you are also disrupting the democratic process and you are creating a very dangerous or volatile situation in addition the electoral commission said privately that it did not have the resources to monitor campaigns in real time it is just not practical there is some proactive stuff that we can do but we simply do not have the resources the only action it can take is once the campaign is over and then the only penalties are fines which campaigns can simply cost into their spends
2017-06-21,0,theresa may will press ahead with a brexit dominated queen s speech shorn of a series of controversial social policies after failing to complete confidence and supply negotiations with the democratic unionist party the conservative leader will become the first prime minister in decades to lay out a legislative programme without a guaranteed house of commons majority after dup sources said the two party negotiations have not proceeded in the way we would have expected the northern irish party accused downing street negotiators of being chaotic and said the conservative high command ought to stop their backbenchers whingeing about the dup and show our party some respect the dup added that the party cannot be taken for granted no 10 sought to brush off the intervention with may promising on tuesday that she would use the queen s speech to respond with humility and resolve to the message the electorate sent after the snap general election left the tories with 318 seats eight short of an overall majority plans for a new generation of grammar schools will be among a number of high profile policies to be dropped by the pm in a speech which will instead emphasise brexit counterterrorism and the least controversial aspects of the domestic agenda the speech is likely to steer clear of any mention of contentious issues such as gay marriage or abortion ian lavery the chair of the labour party accused may of having no mandate no authority and no programme to even win support in parliament for those areas of policy this is chaos from a weak and wobbly prime minister he said at the moment it looks like the tories are unable to put together even a basic programme for government in the queen s speech or stitch together a stable deal with the dup to stay in office tory sources insisted the government was confident of winning support for its legislative agenda with an agreement with the dup still expected to be signed off on thursday well before next week s crucial parliamentary vote on the queen s speech defeat for may in that vote would mean her government would fall may s own backbenchers including some of her most vociferous critics also made clear that they would back the government at this point although made no promises for continued support in the medium term in order to secure enough parliamentary backing may will have to scrap plans to end free school meals for younger pupils and drop her party s social care policy including means testing of the winter fuel allowance alongside lifting the ban on selective schools she insisted however that she would be pushing ahead with brexit legislation including a great repeal bill to bring eu regulations into uk law and a series of other bills linked to customs trade immigration and agriculture much has been said in recent days about what the general election signified about britain s decision to leave the eu she said responding to a clamour from some for a softer form of brexit given the new parliamentary mathematics the fact is that over 80 of the electorate backed the two major parties both of whom campaigned on manifestos that said we should honour the democratic decision of the british people a cabinet minister said jeremy corbyn s party was essentially in the same position as the tories when it came to ending free movement and leaving the single market despite a number of backbench labour mps questioning the position the shadow chancellor john mcdonnell said labour would seek to create alliances with tory rebels and other parties to reverse some of the most dangerous cuts of austerity there is a whole range of issues around austerity where we think there may well be majorities in parliament now to reverse some of the proposals particularly those brought forward in the last budget he told bbc radio 4 s today programme we will finalise the drafting of amendments over next the next few days we will wait to see the queen s speech today from all the reports it is pretty light but remember most of the austerity that is rolling forwards is from the budget and we will not see another budget until the autumn may said her government would be one that consults and listens as she struck a more conciliatory tone after the election seriously weakened her leadership and resulted in the loss of her two closest advisers nick timothy and fiona hill the election result was not the one i hoped for but this government will respond with humility and resolve to the message the electorate sent may said we will work hard every day to gain the trust and confidence of the british people making their priorities our priorities she will face a tense atmosphere on wednesday with protesters planning a day of rage march on parliament in protest at the government s handling of the grenfell tower tragedy organisers have written on facebook that they hope to bring down the government and shut down london a difficult few weeks for may led to her facing crowds chanting coward after initially failing to meet people affected by the fire as well as the series of brexit bills may is expected to respond to recent attacks in manchester london bridge westminster and finsbury park with beefed up counter terrorism plans including a focus on social media there will also be some uncontroversial domestic moves including a civil liability bill to tackle a rampant compensation culture in which whiplash claims have spiked there will also be a financial guidance and claims bill to help consumers make effective decisions and draft legislation on cracking down on domestic violence particularly where children are involved and pushing ahead with plans to ban letting fees for renters sources said the queen s speech would also include a consultation on social care and a bill on mental health but nothing on the nhs more widely in order to pass the legislation next week may is almost certain to need the support of the 10 dup mps to give her a majority in the commons problems have emerged in the discussions between the tories and the dup with unionist sources saying backbiting from tory backbenchers against their party had stiffened their resolve to dig in they said complaints by tory mps about having to deal with the dup had gone down badly they attempted to bounce us into a deal on saturday night and then we had the backbenchers saying that we were unsavoury etc there is also a concern within the dup that extra spending in northern ireland could trigger a barrage of complaints from english scottish and welsh tories over the special treatment the dup wants to abolish air passenger duty for northern ireland s airports but there are concerns that a special deal could lead to demands for the same elsewhere in the uk the dup deal is likely to be one of confidence through which the party will back the queen s speech and support the government in any confidence votes and supply which refers to support for budgets and financial measures hannah white the director of research for the institute for government thinktank explained how may would have to operate to survive the parliament getting legislation through the commons should be possible with effective whipping she said while government and opposition numbers on public bill committees will be evenly balanced procedural conventions around the way the chair votes when a committee vote is tied mean the conservatives should be able to get bills through committees without any amendments then drawing on the support of the dup or other parties they may be able to make any amendments they need at the report stage may will however face fierce resistance to some of her brexit legislation with a parliament in which opponents of a hard brexit feel emboldened by the general election result frances o grady the tuc general secretary said theresa may failed to win a mandate at the ballot box for her no deal brexit instead we need a brexit deal that puts jobs and rights at work first she said the great repeal bill must not be allowed to get away with eroding the rights that working people got from the eu other campaign groups including global justice now and another europe is possible claimed the legislation could result in a decimation of rights
2017-05-02,0,there is nothing more traditionally british on a visit to the seaside than eating chips in the open air but during a campaign visit to cornwall on tuesday theresa may looked distinctly uncomfortable while tucking into a cone of them pictured on a walkabout in mevagissey may looked for all the world like she had never eaten chips before or at least not without a knife and fork may was visiting the st austell and newquay constituency that the conservative steve double took from the liberal democrats in the 2015 election one of a number of seats in the south west where the tories ousted their coalition partners over the weekend may was criticised for her robotic and awkward performances on the andrew marr show and peston on sunday and these pictures will do little to dispel the feeling that may can be ill at ease at public events one theory that has emerged however is that may look awkward faced with an unexpected carbohydrate intake she has previously revealed she has type 1 diabetes twitter users were quick to mock the pictures may s campaign has repeatedly been criticised for keeping her away from the general public local people were excluded from campaign speech in leeds and there were accusations that she was hiding while campaigning in scotland when she held a rally in a tiny community hall in aberdeenshire with such poor phone reception that live coverage of the event was impossible on wednesday the may campaign banned cornwall s biggest news website from filming a visit to a factory jacqui merrington digital editor of cornwall live said a number of us have had an experience with david cameron and tony blair visiting this was much more restricted than we have seen in the past eating during a general election campaign can be a minefield for party leaders a photograph of ed miliband attempting to eat a bacon sandwich became one of the iconic images of opposition to the then labour leader during the 2015 election campaign making the front page of the sun the day before the vote
2017-02-25,0,the us billionaire who helped bankroll donald trump s campaign for the presidency played a key role in the campaign for britain to leave the eu the observer has learned it has emerged that robert mercer a hedge fund billionaire who helped to finance the trump campaign and who was revealed this weekend as one of the owners of the rightwing breitbart news network is a long time friend of nigel farage he directed his data analytics firm to provide expert advice to the leave campaign on how to target swing voters via facebook a donation of services that was not declared to the electoral commission cambridge analytica an offshoot of a british company scl group which has 25 years experience in military disinformation campaigns and election management claims to use cutting edge technology to build intimate psychometric profiles of voters to find and target their emotional triggers trump s team paid the firm more than 6m 4 8m to target swing voters and it has now emerged that mercer also introduced the firm in which he has a major stake to farage the communications director of leave eu andy wigmore told the observer that the longstanding friendship between nigel farage and the mercer family led mercer to offer his help free to the brexit campaign because of their shared goals wigmore said that he introduced farage and leave eu to cambridge analytica they were happy to help because nigel is a good friend of the mercers and mercer introduced them to us he said here s this company we think may be useful to you what they were trying to do in the us and what we were trying to do had massive parallels we shared a lot of information the strategy involved harvesting data from people s facebook and other social media profiles and then using machine learning to spread through their networks wigmore admitted the technology and the level of information it gathered from people was creepy he said the campaign used this information combined with artificial intelligence to decide who to target with highly individualised advertisements and had built a database of more than a million people based on advice cambridge analytica supplied two weeks ago arron banks leave eu s founder stated in a series of tweets that gerry gunster leave eu s pollster and cambridge analytica with world class ai had helped them gain unprecedented levels of engagement ai won it for leave he said by law all donations of services in kind worth more than 7 500 must be reported to the electoral commission a spokesman said that no donation from the company or mercer to leave eu had been filed brittany kaiser an employee of cambridge analytica scl appeared on a panel at a leave eu press conference to explain the technology behind the campaign and in documents leave eu filed with the commission it reported that cambridge analytica was a strategic partner the observer reported in december that cambridge analytica had worked on the leave campaign and received a letter from the campaign to say this was untrue it later wrote to say it is a us company based in the us it has not worked in british politics it declined to comment last week on whether it had donated services to leave eu leave eu declined to say why it had not declared any donation of services to the electoral commission mercer and his daughter rebekah are emerging as key figures in the ascendancy of trump and as the observer details today the strategic disruption of the mainstream media a brilliant computer scientist who did pioneering work at ibm in ai mercer made billions with renaissance technologies a hedge fund that specialises in automated trading as well as financing trump s campaign he encouraged trump to take on two key advisers steve bannon and kellyanne conway and on saturday the washington post revealed him as one of the owners of breitbart bannon s role within the trump administration is being increasingly examined but until now mercer s connection has escaped the same sort of close scrutiny particularly with regard to the media breitbart which has become the leading platform for the alt right is only one of a series of investments that aim to change the media landscape and political views not just in the us but also in britain a british version of breitbart was launched in 2014 bannon told the new york times explicitly to try to influence the upcoming general election he and farage have been close friends since at least 2012 and the site has been an important cheerleader for ukip with its editor raheem kassam at one point working as chief adviser to farage until now however it was not known that mercer had explicitly tried to influence the outcome of the referendum drawing on cambridge analytica s advice leave eu built up a huge database of supporters creating detailed profiles of their lives through open source data it harvested via facebook the campaign then sent thousands of different versions of advertisements to people depending on what it had learned of their personalities a leading expert on the impact of technology on elections called the relevation extremely disturbing and quite sinister martin moore of king s college london said that undisclosed support in kind is extremely troubling it undermines the whole basis of our electoral system that we should have a level playing field but details of how people were being targeted with this technology raised more serious questions he said we have no idea what people were being shown or not which makes it frankly sinister maybe it was not but we have no way of knowing there is no possibility of public scrutiny i find this extremely worrying and disturbing
2017-06-03,0,a week before a british election that was meant to be a foregone conclusion theresa may finds herself where no conservative prime minister ever wants to be neck deep in political hot water in the genteel city of bath home to a comfortable tory majority in the 2015 general election this ought to be a parliamentary constituency where the passage of yet more polling should barely cause a murmur may s surprise decision to call another election was intended to raid deep into opposition labour territory and bolster her narrow majority of mps in time for forthcoming brexit negotiations instead the vicar s daughter who inherited the keys to number 10 downing street after the brexit referendum result forced the early departure of david cameron has watched her 20 point lead in the national opinion polls evaporate now she is forced to defend stronghold seats like bath rather than dream of a landslide victory on thursday just why the former home secretary has lost her reputation for being a safe pair of hands is vividly apparent during a visit to an engineering factory just beyond the city s georgian stone splendour despite rehearsing her well drilled message that only a strong and stable tory majority can force a palatable outcome from eu negotiators may is berated by a woman from the company s export office who wants to know how it is going to sell its products without access to the european single market another factory worker demands to know what on earth she was doing proposing a so called dementia tax in the party s disastrously received election manifesto though brexit remains popular nationally and equally problematic for her labour opponent jeremy corbyn he has succeeded in shifting the debate to social issues an hour earlier he decides to upstage the prime minister by agreeing to a televised debate that night a previously supine british press pack is suddenly shouting about why she is not willing to attend the debate outside the factory a crowd has gathered to reprise a hit chant from the end of the last period of conservative dominance in the 1990s when local mp chris patten also lost this seat tories out they shout may s strong and stable mantra looks more and more like a millstone despite its dominance of 20th century british politics the conservative party has a curious knack for shooting itself in the foot sir edward heath a predecessor of may s who was the last to ask the queen to dissolve parliament ahead of time and call a snap election found that his rallying cry who governs britain was met with the wounding answer not you that 1974 election was the first to take place after britain joined the european economic community do you want a strong government which has clear authority for the future to take decisions which will be needed asked heath in an eerie echo of theresa may against the topsy turvy political backdrop following the 2016 referendum to leave the united kingdom is perhaps in even less mood to be taken for granted now whether corbyn really threatens an upset as shocking as the brexit result or the election of donald trump remains to be seen despite a dramatic narrowing of some national polls the same opinion sampling industry which showed him beyond all hope a couple of weeks ago remains almost as loathed and suspect as the political establishment traditional polling companies which weight responses according to historic turnout rates show may with a still comfortable two digit lead upset can only really come if corbyn defies demographic inertia and persuades millions of young people to come out and vote for his message of income redistribution and free university tuition experts brand polls utter tripe blasted the europhobic sun newspaper when may first appeared to stumble for labour the closest political analogy is neither brexit nor trump but corbyn s american political doppelgänger bernie sanders who was coincidentally in britain this weekend for a book signing tour to explain why he lost nonetheless britain s parliamentary system offers some intriguing possibilities even if this year s fiery leftwinger fails to ignite political revolution despite her current majority of 17 mps may called the election to give herself breathing room ahead of tricky brexit talks that start on 19 june with labour in apparent disarray after disastrous local government elections tory strategists had hoped she might even win the sort of three digit lead not seen since margaret thatcher or tony blair now the prime minister is warning voters that the loss of just six seats is all that stands between her and a potentially unstable alliance led by corbyn coalition governments have had a suspiciously foreign feel in britain since the liberal democrats lib dems helped prop up cameron s first government and labour currently insist they would not enter into a formal alliance with either the lib dems or scottish nationalists snp but since both these two smaller parties are passionately committed to remaining in the eu a so called hung parliament could test the resolve of either of the two dominant supporters of brexit britain s ongoing political uncertainty also comes against a backdrop of fading economic growth and rising security fears the national shock following the terror attack in manchester and irritation at the way details of the police investigation were leaked by us security sources has only underlined how dependent britain is on international alliances that have been thrown into turmoil by brexit and trump may s latest political dilemma is how to respond to trump s rejection of the paris climate accord join the g7 outrage and risk offending her last international ally or continue to provide only muted criticism and risk being accused of inheriting blair s role as poodle to a loathed american master the election that was meant to be all about brexit has turned out to be anything but national security social affairs even a surprise tory proposal to bring back fox hunting all are looming almost as large in the minds of voters as they head back to the polls on 8 june may had predicted this would be hunting season she did not expect to find herself in the role of the fox
2017-06-25,0,this blog is wrapping up now our election results live blog manned by andrew sparrow who will be taking you through the night is live now thanks for reading if you thought the offer of a free banksy print subsequently withdrawn as it was warned it could invalidate the results was good with just over an hour until the polls end the actor and comedian david schneider has offered some tongue in cheek i should add in case the electoral commission is reading incentives to get out and vote liz a lib dem supporter in the south london marginal of kingston and surbiton where ed davey is trying to take his old seat back from tory politician james berry has been pounding the street this evening offering lifts to the polling station apparently cleggmania lives on if this picture she sent from the lib dem hq toilets is anything to go by she says the lib dems are hopeful but not confident about davey s prospects she writes a steady stream of volunteers is flowing in and out of the k amps ld hq as we are collecting the names of any potential voters who we think might not have voted yet it has been a long day some were out at 6am dropping election day leaflets and are still going fuelled by orange squash biscuits and bananas and if that is not enough to keep us going the lifesize clegg in the ladies loo should do it we are hopeful but not overconfident ed davey is very popular with the locals but there is a sense that national politics is going back to a two party system and this is impacting how people vote locally not giving up though in 1997 ed won with just 56 votes so we know that every last vote is crucial this is the advice to people affected by the problems in newcastle under lyme another overseas voter has got in touch about problems that stopped him voting james pellington writes from the united states i was told my overseas registration had expired apparently i have to re register every year and then while re registering was told that my identity could not be confirmed this is despite me registering in the exact same address as previously registered i need to find another british voter who is registered overseas to confirm my identity eventually the election office agreed that i was the same person that they had previously registered then i also needed to register to vote by postal ballot and after providing my overseas address was told i needed to provide an address in the uk when they finally agreed to register me at my overseas address they sent the ballot paper so that it arrived on monday despite having registered several weeks before i arrived at the post office first thing on monday morning and they told that to get it there before polls closed would cost 80 62 and they could not guarantee thursday delivery in the end i could not justify such a cost for a vote that may or or may not be counted particularly since my constituency seat is considered safe i m not sure if this experience mirrors other overseas voters but the process is definitely flawed paul farrelly labour s candidate in newcastle under lyme where keele university students have been complaining of being turned away despite having voter cards has been scathing in his criticism of the electoral services department he will be taking up the issues experienced today and in the run up to the election with the electoral commission the electoral services department here in newcastle is a shambles and there is chaos which is denying people votes on a scale unprecedented in my 30 years of fighting and organising elections we have spent the past week firefighting over scores of postal votes which have not arrived and we not only have lots of registration applications that have not been processed but people including students being turned away when they are indeed registered each passing hour is not only spoiling election day but just adding to the issues for complaint which i will be referring tomorrow to the electoral commission and other bodies for an independent outside investigation the reality is that electoral services in newcastle have been all over the place since a licensing fiasco led to the departure of good experienced staff last summer more on the reports that some voters from keele university have been turned away ben anderson a history lecturer at the university who had reached out via our election callout told the guardian there have been students who have not been able to vote because they have not appeared on the registers supplied to officers the polling officers have been doing their best to sort that out but there is clearly an issue there were a number there holding their polling cards so i am sure there were genuine because the assumption is that they registered too late and were not on the list for that reason there are suggestions that hundreds could have been turned away there have been reports of students from keele university being turned away at polling stations despite being eligible to vote the reported problem is in the constituency of newcastle under lyme where labour won by just 650 votes from the conservatives at the last election in 2015 and where ukip is not standing this time in a post directed towards students the university s english department appeared to acknowledge there were problems suggesting it was because some registrations were not on the lists sent out to polling stations more queues building up as people finish work and students get out of bed that is a joke by the way a bad one admittedly before you send me your outraged comments the national federation of cypriots in the uk has been urging members to get out and vote for candidates who support the island the federation which represents more than 300 000 britons of cypriot origin the largest and most significant community of cypriots outside of cyprus itself has listed parliamentary candidates who have signed the federation s cypruspledgecard it says go out and vote for the candidates that have demonstrated real support for cyprus in the past have campaigned for a free united cyprus and have campaigned against the turkish occupation we must ensure that these candidates from all political parties are elected by casting our votes and having our voice heard these candidates have asked questions and spoken about cyprus in parliament attended and supported our events actively shown that they support a free united cyprus based upon a just and viable solution to the cyprus issue and have campaigned against the turkish occupation another reader has written in about voting problems mary hart said both my son and my husband who prefer not to be named were unable to vote today as overseas voters who registered before the deadline my husband sent his signed proxy form to sheffield election office for sheffield hallam constituency on 22 may his proxy turned up to vote for him today and was told he was not on the list my son phoned the elections office at sheffield several times to confirm he was able to vote today he is actually in the uk at the moment turns up at the polling station to be told he has not yet been processed so will be about another two months till he can vote since we will have been living away from britain for over 15 years by the time of the next election presumably that was our last chance i just hope my postal vote made it in time anna piela has written in to say she was initially refused her vote today as a category g eu citizen even though she is a naturalised british citizen she is a dual citizen also with polish citizenship and registered to vote she has blogged about it i approached the table gave my address and was then told that i was category g funny i felt more like category b at that point meaning i was ineligible to vote in this election as a polish citizen i felt everybody s eyes on me do they think i am a fraud i started to feel hot and embarassed she said a lady at the polling station called a number for her after piela had called the leeds electoral commission to no avail she got put through and was told that i was ineligible to vote as a polish citizen well was not i glad to whip out my british passport and wave it in her face and then whoever was at the end of the line started crumbling oh it is a clerical error they say she is indeed a uk citizen so what do i do asked the nice lady give her a ballot and mark a clerical error in your register they said so that was that they said at the station that there had been four other people who were refused the ballot there despite being apparently naturalised and registered but they did not persevere like i did and walked away i voted smiled and left with a very high blood pressure rate for sure well that is how elections are won and lost and citizens categorised as a or b yes those of us who may be a g cumbria s news amp star reports that police are investigating copeland s conservatives after posters for their candidate trudy harrison were put up near polling stations political parties are forbidden from displaying election material near to polling stations harrison said the poster which was on private property was not put up by her or anyone on her campaign team just under five hours to go if you have ever wondered about those people who loiter outside polling stations who ask you for your polling number this is a useful explainer they are not just nosy parkers this is lovely although it is rather dispiriting that the clangers appear not to live in a democracy see how lucky we are you are probably thinking to yourself or perhaps not what is the former ukip leader nigel farage doing today now that he is not standing for parliament well the anti elitist public school educated former city broker is at the global investment forum sponsored by a swiss banking group and global private equity boutique in liverpool the rotunda gym is being used as a polling station so this is what they mean by a ballot box and here is another one
2017-01-23,0,theresa may wants to explore how to boost us uk migration when she meets the us president donald trump this week as part of their talks over an early trade deal according to british government sources the disclosure follows hard on the heels of the confirmation from the australian high commissioner in london that exploratory talks have already begun on a uk australian free trade deal and that greater access for australian businesspeople to britain will have to form part of it this approach linking any future expansion of highly skilled migration to successful trade deals with america and australia contrasts sharply with may s blunt refusal during her visit to india last november to increase the number of uk visas for highly skilled indians despite its potential to boost the prospects of a future trade deal may has yet to make clear how she sees non european immigration policy developing after brexit when she became prime minister in july she rejected the leave campaign s demands for an australian style points based system saying it would leave britain without full control over who enters the uk she also rejected leave campaigners promises that brexit could mean a boost in immigration from india and pakistan to meet the skill needs of the uk curry industry but now it is emerging that may s policy to keep britain open to the brightest and best will be shaped by any early post brexit trade deals that the uk is able to negotiate and it is quickly becoming apparent that those deals are more likely to be done with countries such as america australia canada or new zealand rather than india or china however the danger is that immigration policy for businesspeople and the most highly skilled becomes based on the old kith and kin white commonwealth of australia canada and new zealand by default if not by design in the case of the us british government sources told the telegraph may wants to explore ways to make it easier for us citizens to work in the uk and for britons to work in the us the latest figures show there are 181 000 us born citizens in britain and 758 000 resident britons in the us we can grow those numbers a senior government source was quoted as saying it may well be that as trump implements his america first immigration policy a uk trade deal could guarantee current british access to the us labour market rather than extend it but it could come at the price of increased migration of americans to britain a similar ambition was echoed on saturday by alexander downer the australian high commissioner in london when he told bbc radio 4 s today programme we would want to see greater access for australian businesspeople working in the uk and that is often been a part of free trade negotiations it has not always been by the way but it is often been part of our free trade negotiations it might just make it a bit simpler actually for example an australian company that invests in the uk might want to bring some of its executives to the uk that can be done with what are called tier 2 visas but maybe that could be made a little bit easier downer confirmed that easier visa arrangements were negotiated alongside the last australian us trade deal non eu migration makes up more than half of britain s annual net migration figure which stands at 335 000 may has pledged to bring that down below 100 000 and the warning signs are that future immigration policy could lead to greater numbers of americans australians new zealanders and canadians coming to the uk while ever tighter restrictions are placed on indians pakistanis africans and east europeans
2017-01-28,0,jeremy corbyn is facing a serious revolt by grassroots labour supporters who backed him to be leader as the party s crisis over brexit escalates rapidly with more members of corbyn s frontbench considering resigning shadow welsh secretary jo stevens became the first to quit the shadow cabinet on friday the rebellion is now spreading among local party members who are furious at his support for theresa may s plans for triggering the article 50 process on saturday night a highly critical open letter to the labour leader circulating on facebook had been signed by almost 2 000 members in constituency parties across the country around half of whom are believed to have voted for corbyn as leader the letter organised by a group called labour against brexit accuses corbyn of a betrayal of your socialist values and of backing a policy that will hurt working people one of the organisers jonathan proctor of the north tyneside constituency labour party told the observer that the motive was not to destabilise corbyn but to stand up for labour principles and values he said the response from members since its launch on friday had been overwhelming the letter is the first real sign of grassroots unrest against corbyn in his own power bases in the constituency parties it makes clear that his support had been based on a belief that he would create a more democratic party that would be true to labour values including supporting eu membership in short we are the grassroots that you have always been keen to represent it states all of us share core labour values of equality and opportunity for all and we share a belief in fighting for social justice and while we may differ in our beliefs and feelings with regards to your leadership we are nevertheless united in our belief that you and your leadership team have made the wrong call on the party s policy on brexit it adds additionally many of us voted for you as our leader because of your desire to make the labour party more democratic with policy being set by members at labour party conference 2016 it was resolved that unless the final brexit settlement proves to be acceptable then the option of retaining eu membership should be retained the final settlement should therefore be subject to approval through parliament and potentially through a general election or referendum we believe that this exemplar of democracy within the party should no longer be ignored let us speak with one voice as democratically made by our members corbyn has been struggling to hold the party together after saying that labour mps would be subject to a three line whip instructing them to vote in favour of the parliamentary bill to trigger the brexit process which will be debated in the commons for the first time on tuesday and wednesday tulip siddiq the mp for hampstead and kilburn has left her frontbench post and two whips thangam debbonaire and jeff smith have said they will not vote for the bill another shadow cabinet member rachel maskell is said by colleagues to be considering resigning and clive lewis regarded as close to corbyn early in his leadership now says he will vote against the bill at third reading unless there are a series of safeguards writing on his facebook page lewis says these must ensure that the uk commits to having the closest relationship to europe and the single market as is possible protect worker rights have proper report back mechanisms on the negotiations and have final say over the eventual negotiated deal he adds if the government does not accept these amendments i will vote against triggering article 50 at the third and final vote in the brexit referendum last year an estimated 65 of labour voters backed remaining in the european union but roughly two thirds of the constituencies with labour mps in place voted overall to leave one of the biggest votes for brexit came in stoke where 69 4 of people voted for brexit with corbyn s party facing a crucial byelection in stoke on trent central on 23 february caused by the resignation of tristram hunt and another the same day in copeland in cumbria labour mps believe corbyn s decision to impose a three line whip is driven in part by fear of being defeated by ukip the anti eu party s new leader paul nuttall is standing in the stoke seat and is expected to run labour close in one of it traditional strongholds the official labour line is that while it understands that many labour mps particularly in seats that voted remain are torn over brexit the outcome of the referendum was clear and the will of the people should not be obstructed david lammy the labour mp for tottenham said there was also anger with corbyn over the decision to impose a three line whip on a timeable motion that would cut the debate on the bill to five days labour members are quitting the party in droves as a result referring to corbyn s handling of the issue he said it is shockingly bad politics everyone understands labour voters are split down the middle over brexit north and south middle class and working class young and old but so too are the tories by taking a side and not allowing mps to vote with their conscience labour s leadership is forcing an exodus of remain voters and members a hard brexit of the type that the tories are set on pursuing will hurt labour supporters and people in labour areas so of course there is real concern among colleagues a shadow cabinet member told the observer this is not easy for jeremy and i feel sorry for him but the way it has been handled is corroding our support it is falling away fast alex salmond the snp s international affairs and europe spokesman said labour was running scared of ukip and failing to do its constitutional duty of holding the government to account he added the referendum happened as a result of tory fear of ukip and now it is bulldozed through without proper opposition because of labour s fear of ukip chris leslie labour mp for nottingham east who will vote against the bill said corbyn was losing support over the issue and asked why he had not put the matter to consultation in the wider party there is a very noticeable change of mood among many members who joined recently to support jeremy it is surprising given that he backs giving the membership a say and did so over military action in syria that he does not do the same over article 50
2017-05-26,0,the sight of the army on britain s streets after the manchester suicide bomb attack is a clear sign that the uk s foreign policy and approach to fighting terrorism is not working jeremy corbyn has said the labour leader said there must be more money for law enforcement as he suggested britain s intervention in wars abroad had fuelled the risk of terrorism at home many experts including professionals in our intelligence and security services have pointed to the connections between wars our government has supported or fought in other countries and terrorism here at home he said his comments drew immediate criticism from the conservatives and liberal democrats with sir michael fallon the defence secretary accusing corbyn of very muddled and dangerous thinking that implied blame on britain for somehow bringing the manchester terror attack on itself boris johnson the foreign secretary intensified the attack saying corbyn s comments were absolutely monstrous speaking alongside the us secretary of state rex tillerson he said it was absolutely extraordinary and inexplicable in this week of all weeks that there should be any attempt to justify or to legitimate the actions of terrorists in this way however corbyn pitched his intervention carefully saying he was clear that terrorists were entirely to blame for their own actions but that governments must also examine the effectiveness of their policy decisions no rationale based on the actions of any government can remotely excuse or even adequately explain outrages like this week s massacre he said speaking in westminster but we must be brave enough to admit the war on terror is simply not working we need a smarter way to reduce the threat from countries that nurture terrorists and generate terrorism a labour government would ensure that our foreign policy reduces rather than increases the threat to this country he added he said seeing the army on our own streets today is a stark reminder that the current approach has failed the longtime peace campaigner and former chair of the stop the war coalition also made a direct promise to troops that under a labour government they would only be sent into combat abroad if they were properly resourced and there was a clear need for military intervention and a plan for lasting peace afterwards that is my commitment to our armed services he said this is my commitment to our country i want the solidarity humanity and compassion that we have seen on the streets of manchester this week to be the values that guide our government there can be no love of country if there is neglect or disregard for its people his speech marked the return of labour to national campaigning after a pause following the manchester arena suicide bombing which killed 22 people and injured 116 after an ariana grande pop concert aimed at young girls corbyn s event started with a minute s silence and he did not take questions afterwards as aides said the campaign was being phased in with less than a fortnight until polling day labour is gaining ground on the conservatives who are now just five points ahead according to the latest yougov poll for the times corbyn s speech emphasised that he was only blaming terrorists for the attack and he stressed he did not want to make a narrow party political point but he made clear criticisms of theresa may s record as home secretary when she oversaw cuts to policing he told his audience in london that a government led by his party would provide more resources for law enforcement and the nhs to ensure people were not protected and cared for on the cheap within hours of the speech fallon who has often been used by the tories as an attack dog in elections told the bbc and sky that corbyn was implying this attack might be our fault might be britain s fault as a result of our foreign policy this is a very badly timed speech showing some very muddled and dangerous thinking he seems to be implying that a terrorist attack in manchester is somehow our fault it is somehow britain s fault jeremy corbyn is far too ready to find excuses and far too slow to support the police and the security services this is a man by the way who has opposed every piece of terrorist legislation who thinks we should talk to terrorists and who is even questioned whether police should be right to shoot to kill he said the number of armed officers on the streets had increased and claimed the safety of people was not just about overall numbers of police but frequency of patrols and funding for the intelligence services it also means being tough against terrorism and that is where mr corbyn is weak it is where he lets himself down he said johnson added to the attack after meeting his us counterpart in london this is a moment when we should be coming together uniting to defeat these people and we can and we will not just in iraq and in syria but of course in the battle for the hearts and minds he said they are wrong their view of the world is a corruption and perversion of islam and it can be completely confounded but now is not the time to do anything to subtract from the fundamental responsibility of those individuals that individual in particular who committed this atrocity and i think it is absolutely monstrous that anybody should seek to do so tim farron the liberal democrat leader also criticised corbyn s speech saying a few days ago a young man built a bomb walked into a pop concert and deliberately slaughtered children our children families are grieving a community is in shock jeremy corbyn has chosen to use that grotesque act to make a political point farron added i do not agree with what he says but i disagree even more that now is the time to say it that is not leadership it is putting politics before people at a time of tragedy but shami chakrabarti the shadow attorney general and former liberty campaigner said corbyn had been subject to horrible character attacks and people misinterpreting his speech she told the bbc s world at one i hear the criticism but that is not my reading of the speech jeremy was clear there was absolutely no excuse no justification based in foreign policy for the atrocities we have seen however it is right he says to the military as a pm in waiting it is because there is clear need and there will be a plan you are correct that ill conceived conflicts will be jumped on as an excuse but the reason not to engage in ill conceived conflict is because it is ill conceived corbyn and his close aides have long held the view that british foreign policy including the involvement of troops in iraq and afghanistan which he vehemently opposed has exacerbated the risk of terrorist attacks by destabilising the middle east and fuelling suspicion of the west
2017-04-11,0,vladimir putin is toxifying the image of russia by backing bashar al assad and the g7 must consider fresh sanctions against russia and syria in response to last week s chemical attack on civilians boris johnson has said as downing street revealed that theresa may and donald trump agreed a window of opportunity existed to put on pressure on russia to abandon assad the foreign secretary stepped up the pressure on the russian president amid evidence that the syria had used chemical weapons i think the russians need a way out and a way forward johnson told the bbc in italy ahead of the g7 talks in the tuscan city of lucca if you think about the position of vladimir putin now he is toxifying the reputation of russia by his continuing association with a government which has flagrantly poisoned its own people he called on moscow to do everything possible to bring about a political settlement in syria and work with the rest of the international community to ensure that the shocking events of the last week are never repeated johnson hopes to persuade the g7 to back proposals for new financial sanctions including measures targeted at key military commanders from russia and syria britain and the us believe the g7 should offer russia a choice of continuing to back assad and facing fresh penalties or working more closely with the west to combat the threat of islamic militant groups across the middle east and to rebuild syria theresa may spoke with donald trump on monday night to discuss the syrian regime s chemical attack and the us response a downing street spokesperson said the prime minister and the president agreed that a window of opportunity now exists in which to persuade russia that its alliance with assad is no longer in its strategic interest they agreed that us secretary of state tillerson s visit to moscow this week provides an opportunity to make progress towards a solution which will deliver a lasting political settlement the french foreign minister jean marc ayrault made the same linkage on the sidelines of the summit saying the fight against terrorism cannot be effective if we do not link it to resolving the syrian situation johnson held talks with rex tillerson the us secretary of state before joining the other g7 foreign ministers for the summit the foreign secretary s allies said last week s attack had helped shift opinion in washington towards the necessity of regime change in syria if a diplomatic solution to the long running conflict was to be found donald trump ordered a missile strike on syrian airbases last week after seeing footage of the chemical weapons attack despite repeatedly expressing wariness about intervening in the middle east during his presidential campaign but tillerson subsequently appeared to suggest that defeating the islamic state not removing assad was washington s top priority johnson has been criticised for cancelling a planned visit to moscow on monday in the wake of the devastating syrian attack on the town of khan sheikhun after saying last week s events had changed the situation fundamentally the labour leader jeremy corbyn said on monday that the foreign secretary was displaying a cold war mentality by withdrawing from the trip rather than continuing to pursue dialogue with moscow he warned that johnson s backing for the american missile strike risked sparking something utterly disastrous but johnson believes last week s retaliatory action by the us could open the door to a fresh diplomatic effort to remove assad from power tillerson will travel to moscow on tuesday to deliver the g7 s message to the russian foreign secretary sergei lavrov russia reacted furiously to the us intervention in the conflict and has questioned the account of the chemical weapons attack given by the us and other western countries
2017-03-31,0,britain could be forced to accept eu law immigration controls and budget payments after it formally leaves the bloc in 2019 if it wants a transitional period to cushion the blow of brexit the eu s draft negotiating guidelines suggest published by the european council president donald tusk the guidelines contained a number of demands that could be difficult for theresa may to sell to the public and the pro brexit element of her party including an extended transitional deal that could spill into a 2020 general election they offered a softened proposal to allow talks on britain s future relationship with the eu to begin after sufficient progress has been made on negotiating a withdrawal agreement which would include settling the uk s bills and citizens rights but the eu also argued a trade deal could only be concluded once britain had formally left and become a third country a jurisdiction outside the european economic area contradicting the prime minister s claim to be confident it can be completed before brexit day on 30 march 2019 the guidelines make clear the bloc s primary objective is to preserve the integrity of the single market which excludes participation based on a sector by sector approach two senior uk sources with knowledge of whitehall and brussels said the document clearly suggested the eu only believed there would be a framework for a future trade deal ready by march 2019 and the actual negotiations would take longer this could necessitate some kind of transitional arrangement during which the uk would remain subject to the jurisdiction of the eu which would be difficult for theresa may to sell to the right of the conservative party and the electorate going into an election in 2020 the draft text says to the extent necessary and legally possible the negotiations may also seek to determine transitional arrangements which are in the interest of the union and as appropriate to provide for bridges towards the foreseeable framework for the future relationship any such transitional arrangements must be clearly defined limited in time and subject to effective enforcement mechanisms should a time limited prolongation of union acquis be considered this would require existing union regulatory budgetary supervisory and enforcement instruments and structures to apply rather than transitional arrangements may and her brexit secretary david davis use the term implementation phase for a process which has been demanded by businesses to avoid taking the uk to an economic cliff edge on the day of departure they would be likely to fight the idea of remaining under eu jurisdiction beyond the uk s formal exit from the eu speaking as the eu s draft negotiating guidelines pdf were sent to national capitals on friday tusk said the eu27 were united talks would be difficult complex and sometimes confrontational but the bloc would not seek to punish britain brexit itself is already punitive enough he said the guidelines make clear it will be for the council to decide when sufficient progress has been made on the withdrawal deal the priorities of which will include the rights of eu citizens in the uk and british citizens on the continent and agreement on britain s legal and budgetary commitments and liabilities tusk rejected the description of a brexit bill and said it was simply a case of the uk having to pay for what successive british governments had signed up to fund it is only fair towards all those people communities scientists farmers and so on to whom we all the 28 promised and owe this money the uk s only land border with the eu between northern ireland and the republic will also be a key priority in the withdrawal deal with the eu calling for flexible and imaginative solutions with the aim of avoiding a hard border speaking alongside tusk joseph muscat the prime minister of malta said the negotiations would undoubtedly be tough but it will not be a war and the two sides needed to remain friends the draft guidelines may be revised over the next month but are as likely to be strengthened as they are weakened tusk will chair a summit of eu27 leaders at the end of april to finalise the bloc s negotiating position the european commission will then draft its more detailed negotiating directives which are expected to be adopted at a meeting of european ministers on 22 may after which formal talks between davis and the eu s chief negotiator michel barnier can begin the guidelines say the uk must accept eu rules such as the four freedoms including free movement continuing budget contributions and the judicial oversight of the european court of justice during a transitional period likely to follow its departure in 2019 and before any free trade pact can be finalised may has said britain aims to leave the single market and most of the customs union in favour of agreeing a bespoke free trade deal for individual industrial sectors such as the automotive and pharmaceuticals industries but a non member cannot have the same rights and enjoy the same benefits as a member and there can be no cherry picking the guidelines say separate negotiations between individual eu states and the uk are also ruled out the guidelines specify that any trade deal must be on a level playing field in terms of competition and state aid with safeguards against unfair competitive advantages through fiscal social and environmental dumping downing street sources said the the government was relatively relaxed about the guidelines with one source saying there were no surprises really a no 10 spokesman said these are draft guidelines and we look forward to beginning negotiations once they have been formally agreed by the 27 member states it is clear both sides wish to approach these talks constructively and as the prime minister said this week wish to ensure a deep and special partnership between the uk and the european union but owen smith the former labour leadership candidate said tusk s statement showed how may s lofty rhetoric is colliding with hard reality the guidelines underlined the difficulty the government would have in keeping its brexit promises he said ministers and leave campaigners have presented brexit as a cost free option it is not there will be a cost to brexit we just do not know how deep it will be it is time for the government to start levelling with the british people barnier has said he hopes the main outlines of the withdrawal agreement will be clear by autumn enabling a broad agreement to be reached at a summit in december he has said he hopes to start talks with the uk on a future relationship in january 2018 but there are lingering fears the talks could collapse the draft text says the eu wants an agreement but it will prepare itself to be able to handle the situation also if the negotiations were to fail a senior eu official said the european commission took little notice of may s claim that no deal was better than a bad deal with the eu noting that the uk was four or five times more dependent on exporting to the eu than the other way around he said threats are never a good instrument in a negotiation and empty threats are even poorer instruments in a negotiation the official said that if the uk walked away without a deal it will be bad for the union but i think it would be fair to say it would be very bad for the uk on citizens rights the commission said it was presumed that uk promises to protect the rights of eu nationals already in the country would include the right for those who have previously lived there to return and for current and future spouses and dependents to join those already in the country
2017-05-30,0,theresa may set the tone for the final phase of the general election campaign with her strongest personal attack on jeremy corbyn on tuesday claiming the labour leader s performance in the previous night s live tv debate showed he would be naked in the negotiating chamber when brexit talks start next month the outspoken remarks represent an attempt by conservative strategists to refocus the prime minister s message on a direct comparison between herself and the labour leader as the party seeks to shore up its opinion poll lead with little more than a week before voters go to the ballot box in a speech to party activists and journalists in wolverhampton may launched a series of strongly worded attacks on corbyn s character and leadership style she said monday s television debate in which the two leaders faced questions from a live audience and from jeremy paxman on channel 4 and sky news had revealed corbyn as unfit to lead britain through the tough talks ahead jeremy corbyn s minders can put him into a smart blue suit for an interview with jeremy paxman but with his position on brexit he will find himself alone and naked in the negotiating chamber of the european union she said as the audience of tory activists laughed awkwardly she added now i know that is an image that does not bear thinking about but actually this is very serious with the brexit negotiations due to begin just 11 days after polling day he is not prepared for those negotiations but i am prepared prepared to take the difficult decisions that leadership demands prepared to do what is necessary to protect and defend our country the use of naked in the phrase appeared to be a dig at corbyn s anti nuclear stance the word was famously used in 1957 by labour s nye bevan against unilateralists on the left of his party when he warned that stripping britain of nuclear weapons would send a future foreign secretary naked into the conference chamber corbyn had been questioned by paxman during the channel 4 debate on whether he would use nuclear weapons or launch a drone strike against a suspected terrorist may said what last night s television debate brought home in technicolor was that only we have the will and the plan to make a success of brexit he is not prepared to use the nuclear deterrent he is not prepared to take action against terrorists he is not prepared to give the police the powers they need to keep us safe she said she described brexit as the defining issue of the election and claimed the labour leader had lurched chaotically from half baked plan to half baked plan she added i am prepared i am ready to go jeremy corbyn is not everything depends on and will be defined by the outcome of these next five years this is no time for a weak leader to be making it up as they go along labour issued no formal response to may s remarks because corbyn s team has made a deliberate decision not to respond to personal attacks although the conservatives remain comfortably ahead in the polls the party s lead has been slipping s latest icm poll still gives the conservatives a 12 point lead putting them on a 45 share of the vote down two points from last week with labour unchanged at 33 a separate seat by seat projection by polling company yougov released late on tuesday predicts that the uk is on course for a hung parliament according to its estimates may could lose 20 seats and her majority while labour could gain 28 seats such a result would see the tories 330 seats reduced to 310 and labour s 229 become 257 the figures are from the polling model s central estimate which acknowledges a large range of variation but it predicts that even a good night for the tories would give them only 15 more seats than may now has the tories poll lead has narrowed significantly since the start of the campaign in particular in the wake of the party s manifesto launch which led to days of damaging headlines about the controversial social care policy the backlash prompted may to announce that she would cap the total costs of elderly care to prevent wealthier pensioners seeing too much of the value of their homes set aside to pay for their care though she has still not revealed at what level such a cap will be set as the focus of the conservatives campaign narrows in the remaining few days labour will seek to switch the debate away from brexit and back to the state of britain s public services on wednesday with a press conference in london underlining the likely impact of another five years of spending cuts over the last seven years the tories have starved the public services we rely on of resources running them down and pushing them into disrepair corbyn is expected to say patients are suffering ever longer waits and overcrowded wards those who need care have been left without it children are crammed into overcrowded and crumbling classrooms it has to change one senior tory said may s renewed stress on her leadership qualities was a return to the strategy mapped out by her campaign adviser lynton crosby and based on polling and focus group findings the strategy from the beginning was always him or me specifically him and me on brexit what is happened is turbulence and events have thrown it about a bit we are going back to that core message he said may s rhetoric against the labour leader appeared to have toughened significantly underlining the conservatives determination to exploit what they regard as corbyn s weaknesses one insider suggested that by making a speech last friday drawing a link between terrorist attacks such as the deadly bombing in manchester and britain s foreign policy the labour leader had made himself fair game unlike at events in the early days of the campaign the bright blue backdrop to may s speech prominently included her party s name urging voters to back theresa may and the conservatives her speech to tory activists also touched on many of the running themes of her premiership renewing the pledge to put government at the service of ordinary working people may s claims came as a group of independent experts based at kings college london warned that none of the parties is being honest with voters about the full implications of brexit the report from the uk in a changing europe group is called red yellow and blue brexit the manifestos uncovered pdf it warns that the kind of brexit deal that britain secures will affect everything from trade to foreign policy and its impact has been underplayed by all the major party manifestos what is striking is that while all three parties view brexit as a major event the manifestos treat it largely in isolation from other aspects of policy rather than the defining issue of the next parliament said prof anand menon who chairs the group asked about may s comments he added no prime minister goes in naked because that is what the civil service is for but the big question is whether the civil service will be given sufficient resources for the scale of the task ahead
2017-04-15,0,the eu is set to inflict a double humiliation on theresa may stripping britain of its european agencies within weeks while formally rejecting the prime minister s calls for early trade talks the observer has learned that eu diplomats agreed their uncompromising position at a crunch meeting on tuesday held to set out the union s strategy in the talks due to start next month a beauty contest between member states who want the european banking and medicine agencies currently located in london will begin within two weeks with selection criteria to be unveiled by the president of the european council donald tusk the european banking authority and the european medicines agency employ about 1 000 people many of them british and provide a hub for businesses in the uk it is understood that the eu s chief negotiator hopes the agencies will know their new locations by june although the process may take longer cities such as frankfurt milan amsterdam and paris are competing to take the agencies which are regarded as among the eu s crown jewels meanwhile it has emerged that britain failed to secure the backing of any of the 27 countries for its case that trade talks should start early in the two years of negotiations allowed by article 50 of the lisbon treaty the position will be announced at a brussels summit on 29 april despite a recent whistlestop tour of eu capitals by the brexit secretary david davis diplomats concluded unanimously that the european commission was right to block any talks about a future comprehensive trade deal until the uk agrees to settle its divorce bill which some estimate could be as high as 60bn and comes to a settlement on the rights of eu citizens may will have hoped that draft european council guidelines leaked last month which took a tough line on the negotiations including a clause ruling out a trade deal within two years would have been softened during consultation with the member states however the lack of any questioning of the european commission s position on the timeline surprised brussels veterans wearily used to displays of eu disunity senior eu sources claimed that britain s aggressive approach to the talks including threats of becoming a low tax low regulation state unless it was given a good deal had backfired however realistic the threats were or not they were noticed one senior eu source said the future prosperity of the single market was challenged that had an impact it pushed people together another senior diplomat said initial sympathy with britain had fallen away in many capitals due to the approach of theresa may s government of course we want to protect trade with britain but maintaining the single market keeping trade flowing there is the priority and so we will work through the eu s chief negotiator michel barnier the source said britain used to be pragmatic that does not seem to be the case any more and we need to protect our interests it is understood that diplomats representing the right wing polish government voiced concerns about the rigid timetable for the talks in the private meeting on tuesday suggesting there were grounds for flexibility even then the intervention fell far short of backing the uk s position that there could be parallel negotiations on the terms of withdrawal and the future relationship a senior eu source said no one questioned the phased approach in a further sign of britain s isolation spain s right of veto over any future eu uk deal applying to gibraltar was not discussed on tuesday despite the uk s anger over the issue eu sources said the contentious position is set to be waved into the final eu negotiating position by consensus french diplomats instead spent part of the meeting warning member states to help companies on the continent prepare for a scenario in which the uk crashes out of the eu without any deal or even transitional arrangement in place for after the country leaves the bloc in 2019 leading to tariffs and customs checks keir starmer the shadow brexit secretary accused the government of wasting an opportunity where ministers should have been building bridges as it approaches what have been billed as the most important negotiations the uk has ever faced he said it is deeply concerning that the prime minister is now so isolated from our eu partners i have emphasised in parliament on a number of occasions that the tone adopted so far by the government is unlikely to get the talks off to a good start the prime minister should have spent the last nine months building alliances across europe not pandering to those in her cabinet and her party who want to sever all links with the eu and retreat from our closest allies and most important trading partners liberal democrat leader tim farron said april is set to be a humiliating month for may her choice to pursue a hard brexit is starting to hit with reality and we are starting to see the impact that is going to have on britain the european commission said earlier this month that talks about a potential trade deal would occur only once sufficient progress had been made on britain s 60bn divorce bill and the position of eu citizens in the uk and british citizens on the continent it is understood diplomats representing the eu27 did discuss a definition of sufficient progress but ultimately left it to the leaders to decide an eu source said it was hoped that scoping talks on a deal and a transitional arrangement on access to the single market could start in the autumn the eu s negotiating position detailed in the european council s so called draft guidelines will also be redrafted to include mention of the european parliament s role in a sign that meps are angling to play a greater part in shaping the talks tusk s team will fine tune the guidelines ahead of a final meeting of diplomats on 24 april an eu source said a one day summit of leaders will take place on 29 april in brussels to sign off on the document
2017-06-17,0,senior business figures have heaped further pressure on theresa may to change course for a softer brexit in the wake of the election amid fresh warnings of the impact of immigration controls and leaving the single market stuart rose the tory peer and chairman of online grocer ocado who backed remain said the election had been a proxy re referendum against hard brexit karan bilimoria the founder of cobra beer and remain backer said the prime minister had zero credibility and that britain could now rethink leaving and brian mcbride chairman of asos and wiggle has raised concerns about access to labour and customs checks business groups are pressing downing street for a change in tone as well as a formal role in the brexit process they also want an end to may s repeated mantra that no deal is better than a bad deal josh hardie the cbi s deputy director general said it is a time for reflecting on how businesses are feeling it is absolutely clear that for the new government the priority has got to be putting the economy first the intervention comes on the eve of brexit talks that begin even before may has finalised a governing deal with the dup or navigated a curtailed queen s speech through parliament the chancellor philip hammond who had been in line for the sack before the election result is also signalling he wants a softer brexit that could include a more comprehensive transitional deal in comments putting him at odds with the prime minister s determination to go for a hard brexit that includes leaving the single market customs union and slashing immigration he will today assert that the majority of britons want a deal that protects jobs economic growth and prosperity david davis the brexit secretary says on sunday that he would head into monday s brexit talks aiming to secure a deal that works for all parts of the united kingdom but signalled that the plan was still to leave the customs union and reduce immigration we will soon introduce bills for new immigration and customs arrangements and the great repeal bill will transpose all eu law into uk law he said the bill which could be hit by a series of parliamentary rebellions will be introduced as part of the queen s speech on wednesday the government also risks accusations of weakness by announcing that the parliamentary session will be extended to two years effectively avoiding another queen s speech next year insiders insisted the move would give mps time to consider crucial legislation on brexit they said it will still be a substantial legislative programme designed to tackle social injustice meanwhile british businesses have sounded the alarm over damaging labour shortages after brexit with thousands warning that they will be hurt by even a modest move away from the eu s free movement rules almost a quarter of the business community say that restricting entry to britain to eu migrants with a job offer would have a negative impact on them rising to 30 of companies in low wage industries the warning is contained in a comprehensive analysis of business views on migration by the chartered institute of personnel and development cipd and the national institute of economic and social research to be published on monday the report contains alarming findings revealed exclusively to the observer over the number of companies who believe they will be damaged by a move away from freedom of movement rules it includes a poll of more than 1 000 companies weighted to represent britain s business community which finds that 23 believe allowing in an unlimited amount of eu migrants with a job offer would have a negative impact on their organisation more than a third 35 of businesses in low wage industries said they recruited eu nationals because they cannot fill the positions with uk born applicants signalling that labour shortages could result from a clampdown there was even more disquiet about stricter schemes among the 91 of companies that expected to hire eu migrants some 28 warned that giving skilled eu workers five year visas would hurt them more 30 said that one year visas for unskilled workers would do damage a 10th of businesses warned that the numbers of eu nationals they were hiring was already falling in the wake of brexit peter cheese chief executive of the cipd said businesses are clearly sounding the alarm on the impact that constraints on immigration could have on the economy the shifting political landscape has led some remain supporting business figures to speak out rose said i believe the election this was a proxy re referendum i think it was the public s way to demonstrate that all was not all as they wanted is this an opportunity to have a rethink i think the single market and customs union should still be on the table who is going to tell the man on the clapham omnibus and when will they tell him that he is not going to be better off bilimoria said we have a prime minister who has zero credibility with the country with her party and in parliament she was the driving force in pandering to the brexiters in her party who were in the driving seat
2017-02-22,0,people just ain t no good this is the refrain of the moment is not it everywhere you look people are becoming more selfish insular nasty and uncaring the coarsening of public discourse often online reveals anger alienation and a dangerous kind of apathy that feeds on low level anxiety and perpetual disappointment political rhetoric has normalised expressions of hatefulness almost nothing is unsayable prejudice is not a subtext it is out and it is proud no wonder amnesty has spoken out about this toxic language the rhetoric around refugees and migrants has been deliberately dehumanising we end up now with a government that can shirk its basic responsibility of taking in unaccompanied children internationally we have seen open viciousness tirana hassan amnesty s director of crisis research talked of how many leaders have propagated the dangerous idea that some people are less human than others we all know which leaders she means rightwing leaders specialise in conjuring visions of chaos in our peripheral vision donald trump does this literally the world outside his gated existence is a vision of hell murder rape terror the authoritarian worldview depends on a fear of the anarchy and destruction about to be unleashed at any second the enemy without thatcher used to do this with the enemy within remember the legitimisation of dread is a powerful thing it is also extremely polarising the constant summoning of darkness it is exhausting it depends on constantly feeding the idea that everything is broken that there are no longer basic standards of how to behave if you live online this is easy to maintain everything is awful all the time there is no dialogue no law just a cacophony of screams and then and then do something fairly normal go into a primary school queue for a cash machine stop at a traffic light and you see something different society has not completely broken down there are basic rules and even some civility and agreement about what these are from spitting to taunting someone over their race gender or sexuality discouraged by good old political correctness certain behaviour in classrooms is not allowed in doctors surgeries and on public transport there are signs saying such abuse will not be tolerated of course i witness appalling behaviour but i also witness good behaviour seats are given up on buses people queue at cash machines small talk is made in the supermarket this is not to say that life is not extremely hard for many people but somehow the world that many politicians conjure up of constant division is their world for the decline in basic civility and treating each other as human comes often from the top down it is not just politicians such as nigel farage who spew out lies and hostility to migrants what does theresa may mean when she says citizens of nowhere how can a supposed christian go back on the dubs amendment how can it be ok for a tory grandee to start woofing at a female politician when she stands up to speak these people are not meeting the standards of behaviour required in a primary school classroom their we are going to hell in a handcart mentality depends entirely on displacing antisocial behaviour to the lower orders migrants mexicans muslims this fear is maintained further by reporting the public space as something that is always dangerous again where we do share public space it may well be fraught but our experience is not only bad watching the bbc2 series hospital one cannot but be struck by how hard so many people work in the nhs an ethos of kindness and cohesion may seem idealistic at the moment but to say that it exists nowhere takes us into a spiral of despair i hear many parents saying they no longer know how to talk to their children about sharing and bullying or simple respect because the kinds of behaviour we see from public figures is so out of control the bullying is top down a lack of empathy or compassion is flaunted as glinting iconoclasm in the face of this to insist on kindness in public may seem wishy washy but kindness is hardcore that is what i thought when i heard brendan cox talk about it to insist on kindness togetherness and unity to say that atomisation and fear will not destroy us and to hear it said by jo cox s husband is moving in her memory he wants everyone to get together in june for street parties bake offs or whatever they fancy maybe this sounds a little old fashioned in a world of monster trolls and hate speech well we are always told that solidarity is old fashioned that there is no such thing as society but as jo said we have far more in common than that which divides us as the neocon journey morphs into full blown conservative nihilism it is critical now to say that sometimes we rub along in our shared spaces that we make society as well as break it for if we truly believe hell is other people we are really lost
2017-06-23,0,theresa may made a fair and serious offer to european union leaders over the contentious issue of the future rights of eu citizens offering those who arrive lawfully before brexit the chance to build up the same rights to work healthcare and benefits as uk citizens speaking at the end of a dinner at an eu leaders summit in brussels after formal brexit talks kicked off on monday may set out the uk s opening offer on the rights of eu citizens an issue both sides have said they would like to be resolved early in the talks the prime minister told them the uk was willing to agree to a cutoff point between 29 march this year when may formally triggered article 50 and the later date of march 2019 as preferred by the european commission eu citizens already in the uk and those who arrive lawfully during a subsequent grace period expected to be up to two years will be given the opportunity to build up five years worth of residence the grace period could start at any point up to the date of brexit and would allow eu citizens time to regularise their status that will entitle them to a special category of settled status conferring the same rights to work pensions nhs care and other public services as british citizens which they will maintain for life the offer which is contingent on a reciprocal pledge about the rights of the 1 2 million british citizens currently living elsewhere in the eu falls short of the eu s demand for its citizens living in the uk to maintain all eu rights in perpetuity but the prime minister told eu leaders that she did not want to see anyone already in the uk forced to leave or families split up the uk s position represents a fair and serious offer and one aimed at giving as much certainty as possible to citizens who have settled in the uk building careers and lives and contributing so much to our society may said but the uk is not prepared to concede to the eu s demand to allow the european court of justice to be the guarantor of those rights a government source said the commitment we will make will be enshrined in uk law and enforceable through our highly respected courts may s proposal came in response to the eu s own offer on the future rights of uk citizens living in other eu countries according to eu sources may s presentation was accepted as a reasonable opening offer by leaders but there was no discussion the eu negotiating team will now open a technical review of the offer it is understood angela merkel the german chancellor called may s offer a good start but said many other issues related to britain s departure from the bloc still need to be resolved theresa may made clear to us today that eu citizens that have been in britain for five years will retain their full rights that is a good start merkel told reporters but there are still many many other questions linked to the exit including on finances and the relationship with ireland so we have a lot to do until the next eu summit in october the government s insistence that it would not guarantee the rights of eu citizens unilaterally has created uncertainty about the future of those already living in the uk in the year since the referendum result and sparked a vociferous campaign from individuals and groups including the grassroots campaign the3million after the grace period has elapsed newly arriving eu citizens will be subject to whatever immigration system replaces freedom of movement after brexit campaigners for eu citizens living in the uk branded the prime minister s offer as disgraceful nicolas hatton founder of the3million said they have gone for the worst scenario possible this is just negotiation tactics and it is disgusting they do not want to engage with eu citizens and they think it is just this big game the3million along with a coalition of 13 campaign groups lobbying for the rights of 1 2 million britons living in europe have met the eu s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier and brexit ministers across europe and said the eu officials have at least listened to them and put in virtually everything they asked for in the eu proposal he said they would raise their objections at a scheduled meeting with officials at the department for exiting the eu on friday the group has a further meeting with ministers on monday but hatton disclosed that the brexit secretary david davis refused to meet us which we also find insulting earlier jane golding a british lawyer living in berlin said it was legally untenable for britain not to preserve the rights of any eu citizens who were exercising their eu freedoms by living and working in britain she said the eu had pledged to give the british living on the continent their full rights and called on the prime minister to reciprocate golding said campaigners in germany had met officials from the german foreign ministry including their brexit lead as well as officials from four other german ministries the eu have made a huge effort and have listened to us she said but theresa may s outline she claimed raised more questions than it answered whether the status quo and the full bundle of rights that eu citizens in the uk currently have will be safeguarded is not clear from this statement keir starmer the shadow secretary of state for exiting the eu said labour has been clear that people should not be bargaining chips in the brexit negotiations the prime minister s offer is too little too late and falls far short of the full and unilateral guarantee labour would make we believe there must be a clear commitment that there will be no change to the status of eu nationals in the uk this is not only the right thing to do but it will also help deliver a reciprocal agreement for the 1 2 million uk nationals living in the eu tim farron the liberal democrat leader said these proposals are frankly too little too late and leave millions of people still facing unanswered questions over their futures here it is simply not good enough after may s departure the 27 remaining eu leaders took just four minutes to take the next step in the process for choosing new host cities for the two eu agencies being removed from london the european medicines agency and the european banking authority based in canary wharf and employing 1 050 people will move to other eu cities after brexit eu leaders have now decided on the contest rules for choosing new host cities paving the way for decisions on locations in the autumn an immigration bill was among the eight brexit focused pieces of legislation set out in wednesday s queens speech and no 10 has stressed that it remains committed to the target of reducing net immigration to the tens of thousands the prime minister also promised to streamline the administration of the new system replacing the current cumbersome application form with simpler digital tools may s account of the broad principles underlying the government s offer left a number of key questions unanswered including what would happen to the children of those granted the new status full details will be published in a paper to be laid before parliament on monday but her emollient tone chimed with the government s less adversarial approach to the talks since the snap general election wiped out may s majority six weeks ago the prime minister stood outside no 10 and accused unnamed figures in brussels of issuing threats claiming there are some in brussels who do not want these talks to succeed who do not want britain to prosper but with may now forced to govern with a minority in the commons she is under pressure including from within her own cabinet to take a less combative approach philip hammond the chancellor has said the government will make the economy the top priority in talks and could agree to transitional arrangements lasting up to four years to avoid the country being driven over a cliff edge as a result of the talks meanwhile senior labour figures including the mayor of london sadiq khan are pressing for the government to put the possibility of britain remaining a member of the european single market back on the agenda after outlining her proposals may left the dinner to allow her fellow leaders to continue discussions earlier at the summit the lithuanian president dalia grybauskaitė suggested that there was wriggle room in the eu position on citizens rights brussels has insisted that all eu nationals who move to britain before the uk s withdrawal retain all their current freedoms and have them protected by the european court of justice grybauskaitė said we need to think about the future and the sooner we settle the future the better for all of us for us the cutoff date is not so important it is up to britain to decide how much they they involve the eu judiciary however merkel indicated that there would be intense negotiations over the issue she said my tendency is to offer the most far reaching guarantees for eu citizens as possible but i can not pre empt the discussion
2017-01-29,0,divisive unhelpful and wrong that was how theresa may described donald trump s suggestion that muslims should be banned from the us in december 2015 when he was still fighting to be the republican candidate for the presidency and she was home secretary it was always too much to hope that as prime minister she might choose her first meeting with the new leader of the united states for a historic love actually moment in which she reminded the world about those views after all downing street has made very clear that pragmatism will rule when it comes to uk us and may trump relations this trip was not about calling things out but about securing a love in that might take advantage of the potential benefits to britain of a trump presidency namely his promise to propel a post brexit uk from the back to the front of the trade queue the aim was to build an image of the us and the uk hand in hand although i m sure even the prime minister s advisers cringed when they saw trump physically grasp hold of the prime minister that awkwardness aside downing street saw the visit as a strategic coup and yet even as the prime minister boarded a plane headed to philadelphia there was growing hope that she might use the visit to express british disquiet about some of trump s first moves as president already there was a clamour from mps to express british alarm at his latest comments in support of extreme interrogation techniques such as waterboarding to be fair to the prime minister it was not until after her meeting that trump made his next highly controversial move to stop people from seven countries entering the us but her decision not to condemn the decision during the second leg of the tour in turkey quickly turned any focus on the visit from warm words on trade and strong language on nato to mounting anger about a failure to speak out by then may had the choice to either line up with those such as the controversial ukip donor arron banks defending trump or to agree with the many conservative mps joining the likes of jeremy corbyn sadiq khan and tim farron in criticising the policy the tory critics included the party s leader in scotland ruth davidson and the former chair sayeeda warsi heidi allen mp said i do not care how special the relationship is some lines just should not be crossed and her tory colleague sarah wollaston demanded that trump not be allowed to address mps in westminster hall for a state visit later this year and then there was the question of british nationals with another tory mp nadhim zahawi facing being banned alongside olympic star and british hero sir mo farah government aides spent sunday trying to tackle the crisis their late night statement about disagreeing with the policy was followed by public interventions from the chief secretary to the treasury david gauke and then foreign secretary boris johnson who said it was wrong to stigmatise because of nationality quickly arranged conversations between johnson and amber rudd and their us counterparts followed but the headache lingers for may as other world leaders are much clearer in their condemnation of trump while downing street insists that the state visit invite is not being rescinded that is despite even davidson questioning how it could occur on monday may perhaps via her foreign secretary will need to field questions about what she knew and when and if she raised any concerns in private labour will demand to know why canada was able to offer reassurances on saturday that britain could not and meanwhile a government petition is growing at pace the prime minister now faces a thorny dilemma how to remain dignified alongside her desire to build an economic relationship with the us that can help britain navigate its post brexit journey
2017-06-12,0,the labour deputy leader tom watson has written to theresa may asking if rupert murdoch asked her to reappoint michael gove to the cabinet or face bad press in his newspaper titles gove s shock return as environment secretary comes a little over a year after may fired him as justice secretary following his ill fated attempt to lead the conservative party he was immediately rehired by rupert murdoch s times where he had worked as a columnist and book reviewer from 1996 to 2005 on a reported 150 000 a year gove became embroiled in scandal earlier this year over reports that murdoch was in the room when donald trump gave his first post election foreign newspaper interview in the uk to him i am writing to ask you about any influence rupert murdoch may have sought to exert over cabinet appointments said watson in a letter to may published on monday specifically it has been suggested to me that rupert murdoch asked you to appoint gove to the cabinet watson questioned whether the tories failure to secure a parliamentary majority may have led her to consider currying favour with the murdoch press it might be tempting to allow yourself to be influenced by powerful media proprietors who can shape the way your government is covered said watson he called on may to answer three questions relating to murdoch had he ever made suggestions about ministerial or staff appointments had he ever specifically suggested that gove should be given a ministerial position and had he ever said there might be consequences in the pages of his papers if she did not take his advice a downing street spokesperson said the letter has been received and we will respond in due course gove has shown his admiration for murdoch over the years telling the leveson inquiry into press ethics in 2012 that the media mogul was one of the most impressive and significant figures of the last 50 years another insight into their relationship was exposed when a personal email from gove s wife sarah vine a columnist for the daily mail was accidentally leaked in it she discussed whether murdoch would support his leadership bid may s relationship with the media faces further scrutiny over whether the government presses ahead with proposals in its manifesto regarding the regulation of the newspaper industry the conservative manifesto said the party would scrap leveson 2 a proposed investigation into the relationship between the media and the police and repeal section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 which would force newspapers to pay the legal costs of both sides in libel privacy and harassment cases if they did not accept an approved regulator section 40 was a key plank of the recommendations by lord justice leveson in his first inquiry into the press however david davis the brexit secretary said on monday that parts of the manifesto may be pruned away after the conservatives failed to win a parliamentary majority in the election labour s manifesto pledged to implement the recommendations of leveson including section 40 and press ahead with part two of the inquiry the tories are in negotiations with the democratic unionist party about a deal that will allow key legislation such as the queen s speech and the budget to pass through parliament the dup manifesto does not make any reference to press regulation but calls for the tv licence fee to be scrapped and for a reform of the bbc following an independent review the manifesto says the tv licence fee is a highly regressive tax which was designed for a different era and a world of communication that no longer exists the success of netflix and amazon streaming services shows that subscription based media can and does work an independent commission should be established to conduct a review of how the bbc is structured and the services it provides and to examine alternative funding models identify the opportunities for competitive tendering of key services and produce a plan that will either significantly reduce the licence fee or abolish it
2017-04-23,0,on 9 march 2017 an ordinary thursday morning ian stubbings a 35 year old londoner was walking down the street near his office in south kensington when he spotted a familiar face he turned and saw a man entering the redbrick terrace which houses the ecuadorian embassy where the wikileaks founder julian assange has been holed up since 2012 and the familiar face it was nigel farage the man who spearheaded britain s exit from the european union i thought hang on a moment stubbings says that looks a bit dodgy i knew the building was the embassy because i often see camera crews outside but there was no one else around i was the only person who d seen him and i did not know what the significance was and i still do not actually but i thought that is got to be worth telling and i was the only person who d witnessed it so at 11 22am he tweeted it his handle is custardgannet and he wrote genuine scoop just saw nigel farage enter the ecuadorian embassy moments later a reporter from buzzfeed who happened to follow him on twitter picked it up and tweeted him back and stubbings told her no press or cameras around no press or cameras around that is until buzzfeed turned up just in time to catch farage leaving 40 minutes later nigel farage just visited the ecuadorian embassy in london the headline said asked by buzzfeed news if he would been visiting julian assange the former ukip leader said he could not remember what he had been doing in the building and that was how the world found out by accident that the founder of wikileaks the organisation which published hillary clinton s leaked emails a decisive advantage for donald trump s campaign and farage a friend of donald trump were mutually acquainted in britain we routinely treat farage as if he were widow twankey in the national pantomime that is ukip politics and widow twankey dropping by on the man who lives in the ecuadorian embassy s broom cupboard seemed just one more weird moment in the weird times in which we now live six weeks on it had faded into yet another episode in the surreality show that now passes for normality but in a week that saw two major developments on both sides of the atlantic regarding the respective roles that assange and farage played in the us election and the eu referendum the same week in which a uk general election was announced it is an attitude that needs urgent re examination for if you were to pick three individuals who had the most decisive impact on that most decisive of years 2016 it would be hard to see beyond trump assange and farage what was not known until ian stubbings decided to go for an early lunch is that there is a channel of communication between them last week brought this more clearly into focus because in a shock development last thursday the us justice department announced it had prepared charges with a view to arresting assange a day later the electoral commission announced it was investigating leave eu the brexit campaign farage headed significantly the commission said its investigation was focused on whether one or more donations including of services accepted by leave eu was impermissible one of the grounds on which a donation can be deemed impermissible is that it comes from abroad a fundamental principle of british democracy and our electoral laws is that foreign citizens and foreign companies cannot buy influence in british elections via campaign donations robert mercer the billionaire hedge fund owner bankrolled the trump campaign and his company cambridge analytica the observer has revealed donated services to leave eu if this issue forms part of the electoral commission investigation this is not just a case of possibly breaking rules by overspending a few pounds it goes to the heart of the integrity of our democratic system did leave eu seek to obtain foreign support for a british election and if so does this constitute foreign subversion what did or did not happen on 9 march may perhaps reveal clues to understanding this to unravelling the links between wikileaks the uk and the trump administration an administration embroiled in ever deeper connections to the russian state between trump whose campaign was funded by mercer and who came to power with the help of the same analytics firm now under investigation for its work with leave eu and brexit and 9 march was the day that all these worlds came together when the cyber libertarian movement that assange represents collided headfirst with the global rightwing libertarian movement that farage represents when nigel farage tripped down the steps of the ecuadorian embassy a visit that he did not expect to be photographed or documented a beam of light was shone on a previously hidden world a political alignment between wikileaks ideology ukip s ideology and trump s ideology that is not necessarily just an affinity it is also potentially a channel of communication david golumbia an associate professor at virginia commonwealth university in the us who has studied wikileaks describes it as the moment when the lines suddenly become visible he says it was like the picture suddenly came into focus there is this worldwide rightwing nationalistic movement that is counter to the eu and this is present in the us and europe and russia and we are just starting to understand how they do all seem to be in communication and co ordination with each other in many ways it was not a surprise there are clear ideological similarities between assange and farage they have both been regulars on rt russia s state sponsored news channel they have both been paid indirectly by the russian state to appear on it ben nimmo a defence analyst with the atlantic council s digital forensic research lab points out that farage has voted systematically in favour of russian interests in the european parliament there is very very strong support for the kremlin among the far right in europe and farage is squarely in that bloc with the likes of the front national in france and jobbik in hungary in february when i started my investigation into leave eu and cambridge analytica i met andy wigmore its director of communications for a coffee and he told me that farage was in the us where he was going to be making a big platform speech at cpac the us conservative conference and it is not going to be his normal mr brexit speech he said he is going to be talking about the need for closer relations with russia really i said that sounds odd what no way farage has been across the subject for years in the european parliament it did not make much sense at the time and in fact that was not the speech that farage made on 24 february he told the crowd our real friends in the world speak english the next evening he had dinner with trump at the washington trump hotel and tweeted a photo of him with the donald in the early hours of the morning eleven days later he headed off to the ecuadorian embassy buzzfeed s story dropped at 1 31pm and 57 minutes later at 2 28pm wikileaks made an announcement it would host a live press conference by julian assange about his latest leak vault 7 the timing of this was lost in the is not that bizarre tone of the coverage and maybe also it is only with distance that it raises significant questions not least because the complex web of connections between the trump administration is a challenge for even hardened us newshounds to follow nearly every day of 2017 has brought forth some new nugget of fact about trump russia but this was a tough week for trump even by his standards the witch hunt as he is termed it was gathering pace on 2 march his attorney general jeff sessions recused himself from the trump russia investigation and on 4 march trump retaliated in a tweetstorm which accused obama of wiretapping him and then on 7 march he finally caught a break some other news came along to knock him off the front page for more than a month wikileaks had been periodically issuing cryptic tweets about vault 7 a month passed before it finally landed a leak that whether by accident or design embarrassed the cia wikileaks data trove had come from what it called the cia s global hacking force its center for cyber intelligence cia scrambles to contain damage from wikileaks documents said the headline in what trump calls the failing new york times the documents apparently showed that the cia had the capability to hack a huge number of devices not just phones but also tvs in the midst of the most serious investigation of foreign cyber interference in a current administration in us history vivid revelations about the us s similar capacity to interfere abroad had hit the headlines a highly placed contact with links to us intelligence told the observer when the heat is turned up and all electronic communication you have to assume is being intensely monitored then those are the times when intelligence communication falls back on human couriers where you have individuals passing information in ways and places that cannot be monitored when asked about the meeting in the embassy farage said i never discuss where i go or who i see in october roger stone a republican strategist whose links to russia are currently under investigation by the fbi told a local cbs reporter about a back channel communication with assange because we have a good mutual friend that friend travels back and forth from the united states to london and we talk asked directly by the observer if nigel farage was that friend his spokesman said definitely not and in some ways this may not be the point a channel exists in the perfect storm of fake news disinformation and social media in which we now live wikileaks is in many ways the swirling vortex at the centre of everything farage s relationship with the organisation is just one of a whole host of questions to which we currently have no answer some of those questions dog arron banks the bristol businessman who bankrolled leave eu and who announced last week that he is standing for election in clacton when i interviewed him last month he said not a single penny of russian money has been put into brexit though that was not a question i had asked him he is however openly pro putin and anti democracy it is not possible to run that entire country russia as a pure democracy he said when asked about the investigation into leave eu s campaign finances he told me i do not give a monkey s about the electoral commission on friday night he released a letter saying that he would no longer co operate with the commission a body mandated by parliament to uphold uk electoral law and said he would see them in court as britain hurtles towards a general election to choose a government that will take us out of the european union this may be the moment to realise that nigel farage is not widow twankey and that this is not a pantomime farage s politics and his relationships are more complicated than we the british press have previously realised his relationship to mercer and cambridge analytica the same firm that helped trump to power is now under official investigation every day more and more questions are being asked about that administration yet here in britain we plunge blindly on real hard questions need to asked about what exactly these relationships are and what they mean do not they
2017-03-29,0,theresa may has told parliament that she accepts brexit will carry consequences for the uk as a letter delivered to brussels began a two year countdown to britain s departure from the eu the prime minister made a speech on triggering article 50 minutes after the european council president donald tusk confirmed he had received notification he declared that the uk has delivered brexit nine months after a bruising referendum campaign we understand that there will be consequences for the uk of leaving the eu we know that we will lose influence over the rules that affect the european economy we know that uk companies that trade with the eu will have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part just as we do in other overseas markets we accept that she said a number of mps congratulated the prime minister on the tone of her letter to tusk which stressed britain s commitment to the continent as a close friend and ally but others accused her of issuing a blatant threat to withdraw security cooperation if the eu27 fail to deliver on a trade agreement the letter suggests that the government hopes to roll the separate issues together claiming no deal will mean wto rules but also that our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened may s spokesman repeatedly insisted placing security and trade relations alongside each other in the letter to tusk was not intended as a threat it is a simple statement of fact that if we leave the eu without a deal then the arrangements we have as part of our eu membership will lapse he said the prime minister said wednesday was a day of celebration for some and disappointment for others a point underlined as passionate campaigners on either side of the debate rose after her statement to put forward their arguments the referendum last june was divisive at times not everyone shared the same point of view or voted in the same way the arguments on both sides were passionate she said may said her government accepted repeated warnings from european leaders that britain could not cherrypick during eu negotiations and that was why it would not remain a full member of the single market she urged her european counterparts to help secure a bold and ambitious free trade agreement as she promised to approach the talks constructively respectfully and in a spirit of sincere cooperation may stressed a number of times that she wanted a new deep and special partnership with the rest of the eu she made clear that in her eyes there was now no way to stop brexit adding that her government was acting on the democratic will of the british people this is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back britain is leaving the european union we are going to make our own decisions and our own laws we are going to take control of the things that matter most to us and we are going to take this opportunity to build a stronger fairer britain a country that our children and grandchildren are proud to call home she said that security in europe was more fragile than at any time since the cold war warning that any weakening of cooperation would be a costly mistake the need for close cooperation on that issue had been reinforced by the abhorrent attack on westminster bridge and this place last week the labour leader jeremy corbyn responded by promising that the government would be held to account at every stage of the negotiations the british people made a decision to leave the european union and labour respects that decision he told mps the next steps along this journey are the most crucial and if the prime minister is to unite the country the government needs to listen consult and represent the whole country not just hardline tory ideologues on her own benches he promised to oppose any threats to turn britain into a low wage tax haven minutes before may began her statement tusk announced that he had received the british government s letter with a tweet the six pages starting britain s exit from the eu and handed over by the uk s eu ambassador sir tim barrow set seven key principles for britain as it entered the talks including may was heckled when she declared that she would fight for the liberal democratic values of europe and insisted that the uk was not leaving europe and would remain a close friend and ally the prime minister stressed her desire to strengthen the union of the four nations of the uk in comments that led to a response from snp mps she said the government would negotiate for all parts of the country arguing that the devolved administrations would have more powers after brexit in response to comments by the snp s angus robertson about scotland s vote to remain in the eu may stressed that her own maidenhead constituency had voted to stay within the union but that she had to honour the overall vote in prime minister s questions before the statement the former snp leader alex salmond stressed disunity across the country as he urged the government to delay the triggering of article 50 after nine months of this prime minister s approach to brexit northern ireland is deadlocked the welsh are alienated scotland is going for a referendum the english are split down the middle and brexit mps are walking out of committees because they do not like home truths he said tim farron the lib dem leader later said it is shameful that theresa may has threatened to withdraw security cooperation from our closest neighbours and allies with growing terrorist threats from around the world it is imperative that we work together with european allies for our mutual security she is prepared to put the safety of british and european citizens on the line just so she can deliver her hard brexit yvette cooper labour chair of the home affairs select committee suggested it would be dangerous to wrap the issues together she should not be trying to use this as a bargaining chip in the negotiations this is not a threat to the rest of europe it would be a serious act of self harm she should rule out now walking away with no security deal as our national security and public safety depend on it asked by labour mp catherine mckinnell may denied making a threat i go on to make very clear in the letter that not having arrangements not having agreements on these issues would not be in the interests of the uk and european union and we should work to ensure that we secure a deal she said earlier in the day mps were given details of the article 50 letter during a special cabinet meeting senior conservative mps ended the session by banging the table enthusiastically including those who had backed remain according to someone who was present however it appeared that there may still be tensions across the cabinet table when philip hammond said britain accepted it could not have its cake and eat it when negotiating with the eu in comments that may be seen as a dig at boris johnson who said late last year that the government s policy was to have it all the chancellor said britain s position to leave the single market and full customs union had sent a clear signal that we understand we cannot cherrypick we cannot have our cake and eat it a whitehall source retorted we should not be downbeat today and we can absolutely have the best deal claiming that hammond might

2017-04-27,0,the german government is encouraging britain to agree a mathematical formula for calculating its european divorce settlement rather than settling on a precise figure in an attempt to avoid a looming clash that risks derailing brexit talks the chancellor angela merkel put the eu on a potential collision course with theresa may on thursday by insisting it made no sense to negotiate a future uk eu relationship without first reaching agreement on the uk s financial commitment to the eu in her first big brexit speech since may triggered article 50 merkel told the german parliament that british politicians were still living under an illusion that the uk would retain most of its rights and privileges once it left the eu countries with a third country status and that is what great britain will be cannot and will not have the same or even more rights as a member of the european union she said you may think that all this is self evident but i have to put this so clearly because i get the impression that some in great britain still have illusions about this and that is a waste of time there are mounting fears that the intransigent position of european leaders is encouraging the hardliners in britain who are threatening to walk away with no deal britain s cbi german carmakers and the irish government all sounded the alarm on thursday at the dire prospects for uk eu trade if there was no agreement privately officials in berlin are looking for creative solutions to the problem which might avoid the prime minister being forced to write a politically unpalatable 60bn 51bn cheque before she even gets to start negotiating future trade relations german government sources suggest that a constructive solution mentioned in merkel s blunt statement could take the form of the uk agreeing to a formula by which britain s future contributions in specific areas such as pensions eu budget growth funds would be calculated thus avoiding coming up with concrete sums the idea was met with a mixture of bemusement and scepticism in london where the tory government remains determined to try to negotiate its future trade relationship at the same time as separation talks eurosceptic critics in the media are likely to calculate an implied cost of brexit whether or not politicians are willing to acknowledge it publicly uk government sources pointed to earlier speeches by merkel where she suggested there was merit in parallel talks they suggested that the looming german election could be responsible for a hardening of language which they hoped would be temporary german taxpayers are likely to end up footing the largest bill for filling any eu budget shortfall after brexit leading to domestic pressure not to be seen to let britain off the hook in the uk parliament david jones the brexit minister told mps that the government was willing to leave the eu with no deal if necessary the ambition and intention of the government is to achieve the best possible free trade agreement with our eu partners however our position also is this we expect to negotiate toughly and unlike the opposition our position will be made clear to the european union that we are prepared to walk away from the negotiating table if it is not possible to achieve a deal that suits us merkel was speaking shortly before european affairs ministers met in luxembourg to finalise the negotiating guidelines eu leaders are due to adopt at a special summit on saturday the first ministerial talks without a british presence since 1973 these guidelines flesh out the core principles of the eu s negotiating strategy preserving the single market and stopping the uk from cherrypicking the eu s advantages as well as a ban on talks about a future trade deal until the uk agrees its eu divorce including paying the brexit bill with the text largely agreed the meeting served as a show of unity before brexit talks it was an unprecedented signal of trust unity and consensus of the 27 eu member states declared louis grech the deputy prime minister of malta who chaired the meeting all delegations agreed with the overall thrust of the guidelines and expressed their full support we made it very clear in the guidelines that the single market is indivisible and there will not be cherrypicking responding to a question about the uk contributions to the eu budget he said the financial settlement had not been discussed in detail
2017-04-12,0,foreign governments such as russia and china may have been involved in the collapse of a voter registration website in the run up to the eu referendum a committee of mps has claimed a report by the commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee pacac said mps were deeply concerned about the allegations of foreign interference in last year s brexit vote the committee does not identify who may have been responsible but has noted that both russia and china use an approach to cyber attacks based on an understanding of mass psychology and of how to exploit individuals the findings follow repeated claims that russia has been involved in trying to influence the us and french presidential elections ministers were forced to extend the deadline to register to vote in the eu referendum after the collapse of the government s website on 7 june 100 minutes before the deadline the collapse resulted in concerns that tens of thousands of people could have been disenfranchised at the time the government said it was the result of an unprecedented spike in demand with more than 500 000 people trying to register on the final day the report published on wednesday said there were clues that a distributed denial of service attack ddos using botnets a network of computers infected with malicious software was used to overwhelm the site the crash had indications of being a ddos attack we understand that this is very common and easy to do with botnets the key indicants are timing and relative volume rate the committee s report said while the incident had no material effect on the outcome of the referendum the committee said it was crucial that lessons were learned for future votes that must extend beyond purely technical issues the report noted the us and uk understanding of cyber is predominantly technical and computer network based for example russia and china use a cognitive approach based on understanding of mass psychology and of how to exploit individuals the implications of this different understanding of cyber attack as purely technical or as reaching beyond the digital to influence public opinion for the interference in elections and referendums are clear pacac is deeply concerned about these allegations about foreign interference the report concluded britain is being hit by dozens of cyber attacks a month including attempts by russian state sponsored hackers to steal defence and foreign policy secrets gchq s new security chief ciaran martin said in february the chancellor philip hammond said the national cyber security centre which martin heads had blocked 34 550 potential attacks on government departments and members of the public in the six months to february about 200 cases a day the committee which is chaired by the senior backbencher bernard jenkin was also highly critical of the way david cameron held the referendum to call the bluff of his critics and then resigned when he lost it said that in future referendums the prime minister of the day should be prepared to carry on in office and to implement the result whatever the outcome there was no proper planning for a leave vote so the eu referendum opened up much new controversy and left the prime minister s credibility destroyed it said it should be reasonable to presume that the sitting prime minister and his her administration will continue in office and take responsibility for the referendum result in either eventuality according to the report there were many occasions in the run up to the vote when it appeared officials were being drawn into referendum controversy damaging the civil service s reputation for impartiality a cabinet office spokeswoman said there was no evidence to support the committee s claim of possible interference from foreign governments we have been very clear about the cause of the website outage in june 2016 it was due to a spike in users just before the registration deadline there is no evidence to suggest malign intervention she said we conducted a full review into the outage and have applied the lessons learned we will ensure these are applied for all future polls and online services
2017-03-05,0,michael gove and other tory brexit campaigners on sunday called on theresa may to unilaterally guarantee the rights of 3 2 million eu citizens to remain in the uk as they back a parliamentary report that brands the government policy as unacceptable gove is one of several pro brexit tories on the all party select committee on exiting the eu who say that may s approach is causing great anxiety and uncertainty to people who work hard in the uk pay their taxes and deserve immediate reassurance about their futures the committee says in a report published on sunday that eu citizens should not be used as bargaining chips in negotiations over brexit the report piles yet more pressure on may following a vote in the house of lords last week in which peers defeated the government by 358 to 256 over the rights of eu citizens the peers backed an amendment to the brexit bill urging ministers to ensure within three months of article 50 being triggered that the eu citizens living in the uk be given the right to stay while ministers have vowed to reverse the defeat and strike out the amendment when the bill returns to the commons next week the report is evidence that concerns expressed by labour snp and liberal democrat mps are widely shared in tory ranks even among those who have advanced the case to leave the eu as well as gove other hardline leave supporters on the committee who unanimously approved the report include former tory ministers dominic raab and peter lilley so far may has insisted she will not guarantee the rights of eu citizens until the other 27 member states make similar pledges that the rights of uk nationals living in their countries are also assured the attempt to turn their futures into a negotiating weapon has angered many senior conservatives including viscount hailsham who told peers last week that guaranteeing the rights of eu citizens was a matter of principle as many eu citizens had made career changing and life changing decisions to move to the uk which could not easily be reversed the committee report states the result of the referendum and subsequent debate in the uk and across the eu have created a great deal of anxiety and uncertainty for eu citizens resident in the uk and for uk citizens in the eu eu nationals in the uk did not have a vote in the referendum they came to the uk legally and have contributed to the uk economically and culturally and enriched uk society the vast majority have worked hard paid their taxes integrated raised families and put down roots it is difficult to see what more the uk could have asked of them the result of the referendum however has made them very unsure of their future although the government has said it wants eu citizens to be able to remain the committee notes that this has not offered sufficient reassurance that the rights and status that they have enjoyed will be guaranteed the mps add eu nationals in the uk and uk nationals in the eu are aware that their fate is subject to the negotiations they do not want to be used as bargaining chips and the uncertainty they are having to live with is not acceptable notwithstanding the assurance given by the home secretary we recommend that the uk should now make a unilateral decision to safeguard the rights of eu nationals living in the uk the committee also calls for the system by which eu nationals can apply for permanent residence after having lived in the uk for five years to be drastically simplified eu nationals currently have to fill in an 85 page form that the mps say is so complex and onerous that it will cause huge bureaucratic logjams the labour chair of the committee hilary benn mp said the permanent residence application process is disproportionately burdensome and involves collection of information which goes far beyond what is required to prove residence over a five year period while there will always be complex cases that require detailed consideration it should be possible to clarify the status of the vast majority of individuals already here by simply using a streamlined system labour s brexit spokesman keir starmer said on saturday this just emphasises how isolated the prime minister is now on this whether you campaigned to remain or leave there is a growing consensus including now the house of lords and the cross party brexit select committee that eu nationals should not be used as bargaining chips the prime minister needs to listen to this and act now friends of gove and raab said they still expected them to vote against the lords amendment when it returned to the commons on the grounds that the concession should be made separately and should not have to be included in the actual brexit bill to trigger article 50 labour while insisting that it will not seek to block or hold up brexit will continue to support the lords amendment in the commons on tuesday the government is facing the prospect of a second defeat on the brexit bill when peers vote on an amendment that would require a proposed deal on brexit to be put to a vote in both houses of parliament before it is agreed with the eu or voted on in the european parliament the amendment has strong cross party backing and is expected to be passed by a large majority
2017-04-28,0,when barack obama banks the cheque for 400 000 he will receive for talking to an audience of wall street bankers and their most important clients in september the former president might like to quietly thank the statesman who did so much to pioneer the idea of the celebrity political speaker winston churchill more than 70 years ago in march 1946 churchill recently ousted as prime minister turned up at westminster college in fulton missouri to present his views on the state of the world the audience in fulton certainly got more than it bargained for because churchill used his lecture to coin the phrase that came to describe the cold war britain s wartime premier with us president harry truman in the audience described how an iron curtain had descended across europe from stettin on the baltic sea to trieste on the adriatic these days former us presidents are the biggest draw on the international speaker circuit their speeches can command hundreds of thousands of dollars from banks hedge funds and corporations the reasons behind inviting esteemed guest speakers have changed little down the years hosts are looking for political insight information that makes them think they are in the know or simply some juicy gossip by the standards of american chief executives occupants of the white house are poorly paid obama will earn as much for his speech at cantor fitzgerald on the sensitive theme of healthcare issues as he earned in a year as president his predecessors bagged far bigger fees bill clinton once received 750 000 for addressing the telecoms company ericsson in hong kong but speaking for big bucks can have its pitfalls hillary clinton quickly joined the speaking circuit after leaving office as secretary of state in 2013 for a minimum of 225 000 per speech but a series of talks paid for by goldman sachs including one at the bank s builders and innovators conference held in marana arizona were cited by her political rivals as examples of how out of touch with ordinary voters she had become david cameron and george osborne have faced similar problems after presiding over a period of falling real wages that is unprecedented since victorian times the pair command more for a speech than their erstwhile constituents could make in a year neither appears especially bothered however cameron has reportedly told friends that it is time to put some hay in the barn following his departure from politics osborne who only resigned as an mp when the snap election was announced said he was just doing what his predecessors had done osborne s speeches were given in private but the fees he received had to be disclosed while he remained an mp in just one week in november five months after he was fired by theresa may he received 187 474 for speeches at banks and hedge funds in london and new york among those payments was 34 109 from blackrock the world s biggest fund manager which has since hired him to work one day a week for 650 000 a year he has also been paid to speak by wall street bank jp morgan and at the annual meeting of the rich and powerful in davos in january where he was pictured socialising with george and amal clooney the former chancellor received 51 829 from hsbc at hsbc s annual meeting on friday the bank s chairman douglas flint was challenged about osborne s role and said the former chancellor had talked about global political issues alistair darling osborne s predecessor at the treasury takes issue with the idea that all ex politicians are raking it in the americans seem to pay very large sums of money darling says but i do not do the after dinner circuit and and i ve never spoken in america some former politicians have earned a reputation as accomplished after dinner speakers notably william hague the former foreign secretary who has been dubbed the david beckham of witty toasts by hillary clinton american audiences were especially interested in what thatcher had to say about the lifting of the iron curtain and in john major s take on the first gulf war against saddam hussein in 1990 tony blair s decision to join george w bush in the 2003 invasion of iraq meant he was the most sought after british politician since thatcher the hot topics these days are brexit about which alistair darling says he has done quite a few at conferences and seminars insight into european and us politics and trade wars cameron spoke at a tourism conference in bangkok this week the lack of a referendum was poisoning british politics and so i put that right he said he also tailored his words for his audience telling delegates that the biggest threat to our world and also to your industry is the threat of islamist extremism andrew honnor of greenbrook communications which advises hedge funds says people engage speakers to help manage and understand political risk everyone is trying to get their head around it and how to factor it into their models many of the events like osborne s are held in private with invitation only audiences of either staff or clients often on the understanding that speakers will not be quoted in the hope that politicians will spill the beans but even so one city executive says this does not necessarily make the politicians less cautious the speakers are still aware that something they say could get out of the room hedge funds always desperate for information are among the biggest users of political speakers possibly just to stay in touch with the real world do not underestimate the bubble that some of some of these guys live in says honnor they crawl over financial models and think very differently to the way a politician thinks
2017-03-04,0,the embattled leader of the democratic unionists in northern ireland arlene foster will remain in her post despite her party losing 10 seats in thursday s election to the devolved assembly in belfast one of her mps has said jeffrey donaldson insisted that instead of seeking her resignation the focus should be on arlene and the party getting a government up and running again at stormont sinn féin is now only one seat behind the dup after a bruising and divisive election caused by foster s refusal to temporarily stand down as northern ireland s first minister following a botched green energy scheme scandal which has the potential of costing taxpayers 500m gerry adams sinn féin s president said late on saturday that the election result which saw his party move up to 27 seats showed the notion of a perpetual unionist majority has been demolished in northern ireland speaking earlier in west belfast adams described sinn féin s performance as a watershed moment the dup remain the largest party in the new assembly with donaldson stressing that foster would still be their nominee as first minister if and when a power sharing government is restored donaldson said i am not aware of any election in the past where the leader of the largest party resigns because they have won the election we need to learn the lesson and understand what people were saying in this election and what the key messages are we have been given the responsibility as the main party to take the lead at stormont and that is what we intend to do so we are not going to get bogged down on what some people want to focus on which is personalities the election results mean the dup and sinn féin will once again lead the negotiations aimed at creating a new power sharing government in belfast when they take place on monday however the prospect of the parties reaching agreement in the three week timeframe imposed by the northern ireland secretary james brokenshire appears remote if that deadline passes the government would be obliged to call yet another snap election but it may instead opt to put stormont in cold storage and reintroduce direct rule before the negotiations start on monday the irish government has been contacting all of the parties over the weekend to persuade them to reach a deal in a statement on saturday night ireland s foreign minister charlie flanagan said the high 65 turnout at the election demonstrated that people in the north cared about the institutions set up under the 1998 good friday agreement and the devolved government flanagan said as co guarantors of the good friday agreement and subsequent agreements the irish and british governments stand ready to provide whatever support or engagement may be necessary to re establish the devolved institutions in this regard i plan to be in touch with the parties in northern ireland and with secretary of state brokenshire over the next 24 hours earlier on saturday the northern ireland secretary also claimed that the election results proved that people in the region wanted cross community devolved government back in place brokenshire called for intensive negotiations between the parties to begin on monday morning he insisted his prime goal was to see power sharing devolution restored rather than the imposition of direct rule northern ireland has made great strides forward over the past two decades he said all of us must continue the work of building a stable peaceful and prosperous northern ireland that works for everyone based on the strong foundations of the belfast agreement and its successors it is with positive intent that the uk government approaches the days ahead i will be speaking to party leaders during the course of today and remaining in contact with the irish government the dup took a major electoral hit over the controversy around a renewable heat incentive scheme that became known as the cash for ash scandal owing to poor accounting the incentive resulted in farmers and small businesses making 1 60 for every 1 they invested in boilers fired with wood pellets and other recyclable materials it will now cost taxpayers in northern ireland an estimated 500m the dup was criticised first for championing the scheme through foster and then for defending the project despite the spiralling cost to the public purse all 90 seats were declared on saturday morning with 28 to the dup sinn féin on 27 the sdlp with 12 the ulster unionists falling to 10 the cross community alliance party with eight the green party securing two the hardline traditional unionist voice coming back with one seat and the leftwing people before profit party going down to one the independent unionist and justice minister in the last coalition clare sugden was also re elected this article was amended on 6 march 2017 an earlier version stated the potential cost of the green energy scheme as both 500 000 and 500m the latter is correct
2017-02-18,0,the eu fears millions of its nationals living in the uk will be left stranded in a legal no man s land after the country leaves the eu because of the weaknesses of the british immigration system a document obtained by the observer reveals meps and senior european diplomats fear that chaos will ensue as the home office does not have the information or systems in place to select who can stay once the uk restricts access to nationals from the other 27 eu member states it is widely assumed that at an early stage of the article 50 negotiations britain and the eu will agree a cut off date after which foreigners who have settled in the country will not have an automatic right to remain but a leaked document drawn up by meps on the european parliament s employment committee to aid the eu s brexit negotiations warns the uk has no population register in practice it would be difficult to determine which eu27 citizens were residing legally in the uk before the brexit would have taken effect if all 3 3 million eu citizens were to initiate procedures aimed at proving the exercise of treaty rights the administrative system would be overburdened an opinium poll for the observer published today finds that a large majority of britons believe eu nationals living in the uk should be given the automatic right to stay just 5 said they should be asked to leave but eight months after last june s referendum uncertainty about the future has become a source of deep anxiety among european citizens living in the uk responding to the brussels report one senior diplomat from an eastern european state said it came as a surprise to me that the uk was unable to monitor comings and goings they will have to find a workable solution quickly tony blair s government was forced to drop plans for a national id card and population register in 2007 because of concerns over the security of citizens data not least from david davis now secretary of state for exiting the eu the cabinet office advises that eu nationals do not need to register for any documentation in order to enjoy free movement rights and responsibilities in the uk the government does not track eu nationals as they enter and leave the country the databases of the department for work and pensions hm revenue and customs and the home office do not share information the government could use the national insurance number system to help distinguish between those who were in the country before and after brexit but it would not cover those who neither work nor claim benefits allowing the right of residence to anyone who has registered for a national insurance number before a particular date would also give a right to stay to potentially millions of people who are no longer in the country including those who were in the uk only briefly and have little or no connection to the uk it would also not deal with the question of the rights of family members of those with national insurance numbers to join their relatives in the country last week theresa may stressed the importance of an early deal on eu citizens rights after brexit during talks with the french prime minister bernard cazeneuve at downing street amid growing criticism of the government s refusal to give early and absolute assurances some ministers have suggested that the issue will be a bargaining chip in the talks responding to the leaked document keir starmer shadow secretary of state for exiting the eu told the observer that the government had not done enough he said this report reinforces the need for the pm to take decisive action to support eu nationals in the uk for months labour has called for the pm to show a lead on this and to end unnecessary uncertainty for eu nationals not only has theresa may failed to do so but we now hear of real concern that the immigration system she presided over for six years may not be able to properly process eu nationals cases the pm needs to act swiftly to address this both by unilaterally granting residency rights for eu nationals already in the uk and by ensuring the home office has the necessary resources in place the home office declined to offer any guidance on how the government planned to distinguish between claims of eu nationals claiming that work on the problem was ongoing we are currently considering the various options as to how eu migration might work once we have left it would be wrong to set out further positions at this stage it said european citizens resident in the uk make a vital contribution both to our economy and our society that is why we will be making securing their status as well as that of british nationals in the eu a priority as soon as we trigger article 50 and the negotiations begin a spokesman said eu nationals who have lived in the uk for five years can gain automatic permanent residency status although there have been numerous cases of bosses asking for their foreign employees to acquire permanent residency cards in order to guarantee their jobs there has been almost a 50 increase in the number of eu citizens applying for permanent residency documentation since the vote on 23 june eu nationals say that to obtain permanent residency cards they have to complete an 85 page form requiring huge files of documentation including p60s for five years historical utility bills and a diary of all the occasions they have left the country since settling in the uk some have received letters inviting them to prepare to leave the country after failing to tick a box on a form the liberal democrats are confident that an amendment to the article 50 bill giving eu nationals a right to stay irrespective of the coming negotiations and the number of years people have lived in the uk will be successful in the house of lords placing may in a position of having to vote it down when the legislation comes back to the commons the european parliament is also due to debate the rights of eu nationals in both the uk and on the continent on 1 march two of the parliament s committees are to host joint hearings to which home office ministers are set to be called to give evidence lord newby the lib dem leader in the lords said the government is generating real fear and uncertainty amongst large numbers of people
2017-01-15,0,theresa may will aim to strike a defiant tone in her upcoming brexit speech on the risks to the rest of the eu of giving britain a raw deal echoing the combative approach taken by the chancellor in a speech by the prime minister on tuesday that will be watched closely in eu capitals downing street is keen to impress that there are potentially lucrative economic opportunities elsewhere weeks before the uk is expected to trigger article 50 philip hammond in an interview with german newspaper welt am sonntag warned that britain would do whatever we have to do to regain competitiveness and appeared to accept that the uk was prepared to become a tax haven if necessary the chancellor was responding to a suggestion that the impression on the european continent is that your government sees the future business model of the uk as being the tax haven of europe hammond said most of us who had voted remain would like the uk to remain a recognisably european style economy with european style taxation systems european style regulation systems etc i personally hope we will be able to remain in the mainstream of european economic and social thinking but if we are forced to be something different then we will have to become something different the labour leader jeremy corbyn said the comments suggested the threat of some sort of trade war with britain s eu partners and accused hammond of wanting to turn the uk into a bargain basement economy it really does not seem to me to be a very sensible way forward he said brexiters in the cabinet believe the government would be better placed to reach ambitious trade deals with countries outside the eu including the us if it were not tied into existing arrangements the pound hit a fresh 31 year low in the wake of reports on may s speech falling below 1 20 in trading on sunday night one analyst warned that sterling will go on a market roller coaster following claims that the uk will seek a hard brexit so far eu leaders have been united in saying there will be no cherry picking of legislation suggesting that may will not be able to impose strict limits on immigration while retaining the economic benefits of eu membership in his interview on sunday the chancellor reiterated the government s view that the brexit vote was a signal that voters would like to see tougher controls on immigration we are aware that the message from the referendum is that we must control our immigration policy he said hammond s intervention came after mark carney the bank of england governor told the treasury select committee the greatest risks to financial stability from an unruly brexit were for other eu members the prime minister s speech at lancaster house in london on tuesday will be analysed carefully in financial markets for signs that the government has abandoned the idea of remaining in the single market sterling fell sharply after may s party conference speech in october in which she appeared to signal a hard brexit the pound which hit a 31 year low against the dollar after the referendum will be under further pressure if may rules out staying in the single market there has been no decision about whether to publish a document setting out may s approach to brexit negotiations or let the prime minister s speech stand as the plan as she promised to mps over the weekend the brexit select committee chaired by the labour mp hilary benn but including the key leave campaigning conservatives michael gove and dominic raab called for the government to publish a formal white paper setting out its priorities for when talks begin the government is awaiting the result of the supreme court appeal on whether it must consult parliament before triggering article 50 beginning the formal divorce process with the eu a verdict is expected within a fortnight may is likely to emphasise britain s enthusiasm for pressing ahead with negotiating trade deals with countries including the us in his interview hammond said the brexit vote was not a sign that britain has chosen to take a more isolationist stance and rejected the comparison with the forces that swept donald trump into the white house i cannot speak for what is going on in the us that is a different political movement but in my judgment it would be a mistake to read the brexit vote as being part of the same strand of thinking that has formed in the us if you look at the media and the reporting during the brexit referendum campaign there was no anti trade rhetoric it was the exact opposite he said
2017-01-01,0,scotland looks set to be the first part of the uk to pilot a basic income for every citizen as councils in fife and glasgow investigate trial schemes in 2017 the councillor matt kerr has been championing the idea through the ornate halls of glasgow city chambers and is frank about the challenges it poses like a lot of people i was interested in the idea but never completely convinced he said but working as labour s anti poverty lead on the council kerr says that he kept coming back to the basic income kerr sees the basic income as a way of simplifying the uk s byzantine welfare system but it is also about solidarity it says that everyone is valued and the government will support you it changes the relationship between the individual and the state the concept of a universal basic income revolves around the idea of offering every individual regardless of existing welfare benefits or earned income a non conditional flat rate payment with any income earned above that taxed progressively the intention is to provide a basic economic platform on which people can build their lives whether they choose to earn learn care or set up a business the shadow chancellor john mcdonnell has suggested that it is likely to appear in his party s next manifesto while there has been a groundswell of interest among anti poverty groups who see it as a means of changing not only the relationship between people and the state but between workers and increasingly insecure employment in the gig economy kerr accepts that while he is hopeful of cross party support in glasgow there are months of work ahead including first arranging a feasibility study in order to present a strong enough evidence base for a pilot but if there is ever a case to be made then you need to test it in a place like glasgow with the sheer numbers and levels of health inequality if you can make it work here then it can work anywhere the idea has its roots in 16th century humanist philosophy when it was developed by the likes of thomas more but in its modern incarnation it has lately enjoyed successful pilots in india and africa despite its utopian roots champions believe that this is an idea whose time has come particularly in scotland where the governing snp voted in support of a basic income at their spring conference although the proposal has yet to make it into their manifesto at the heart of any experiment with basic income is money how much should people get and where will it come from kerr says his instinct is to base the amount on similar calculations to those made for the living wage it is about having more than just enough to pay the bills but part of the idea of doing a pilot is to make mistakes and also find out what is acceptable to the public there will be a lot of resistance to this we should not kid ourselves part of the problem is we are working against a whole discourse of deserving and undeserving poor as for where the money comes from the funding question is always the big one and really will depend upon the approach a pilot takes says jamie cooke head of rsa scotland which has been spearheading research on the subject across the uk drawing on the experience of similar projects ongoing in finland utrecht in the netherland and ontario in canada cooke suggests it could be funding from particular trusts it could be individual philanthropic funding as we have seen in the states or it could be a redirection of the existing welfare spend obviously the latter is much harder to do in a pilot although that will be happening in finland next year where the experiment is being taken forward by the national government as the scottish government consults on what it has described as the biggest transfer of powers since devolution began the devolution of around 2 7bn or 15 of the total scottish benefits bill affecting 1 4 million people both kerr and cooke believe that this is an ideal moment to consider the basic income seriously it is a time to be testing out new or rather old ideas for a welfare system that genuinely supports independence says kerr cooke likewise believes that cross party support is key pointing to the fact that the leader of the conservative group on fife council has joined forces with the fairer fife commission the council s independent poverty advisory group which initially recommended the trial with the aim of designing a pilot within the next six months scotland was recently added to the list of places to watch for basic income activity by the basic income earth network founded by the radical economist guy standing whose hugely influential book the precariat identified an emerging social class suffering the worst of job insecurity and most likely to be attracted to rightwing populism the thing about scotland is that they really understand the precariat says standing who recently visited the country to meet civil servants local authorities and campaigners to discuss a basic income the sense of insecurity the stagnating living standards all of those things are clear in scotland and the fact that so many within the snp are supportive means there is a real opportunity to do a pilot in scotland the momentum is there he says and once it is framed around a desire for greater social justice then you get away from the stale debate about whether if you give people the basic income then they will be lazy people relate to the idea that everyone should have a social dividend everywhere i go it is the communities that feel left behind by globalisation that are most interested in the idea of a basic income we have seen a sea change in attitudes this sense of alarm about populist rightwing politics has brought more people to thinking we need to do something to provide better security for people we are risking our economic and political stability if we do not do something about it
2017-05-14,0,the human rights group cage is preparing to mount a legal challenge to uk anti terrorism legislation over a refusal to hand over mobile and laptop passwords to border control officials at air terminals ports and international rail stations cage which campaigns on issues such as torture discrimination and wrongful imprisonment is planning to fight the issue as a surveillance v privacy test case the move comes after its international director muhammad rabbani a uk citizen was arrested at heathrow airport in november for refusing to hand over passwords rabbani 35 has been detained at least 20 times over the past decade when entering the uk under schedule 7 of terrorism legislation that provides broad search powers but this was the first time he had been arrested he said he had cooperated as usual and handed over his laptop and mobile phone on previous occasions when asked for his passwords he said he had refused and eventually his devices were returned to him and he was allowed to go but there was a new twist this time when he refused to reveal his passwords he was arrested under schedule 7 provisions of the terrorism act and held overnight at heathrow polar park police station before being released on bail he expects to be charged on wednesday the case comes against the backdrop of a campaign gathering momentum in the us against proposals by the trump administration to require travellers to the us to hand over social media account passwords as a condition of entry the flydontspy campaign is backed by a host of groups including the american civil liberties union and amnesty international jim killock executive director of the uk based open rights group expressed sympathy for rabbani using general terrorism powers to compel people to hand over passwords is inappropriate killock said the police should have a specific reason to acquire a password investigations should take place when there is actual suspicion and the police should be able to justify their actions on that basis rather than using wide ranging powers designed for border searches killock said the issue raises parallels with david miranda partner of journalist glenn greenwald who mounted a successful court challenge last year after being held at heathrow under the same terrorist legislation in 2013 in the wake of the edward snowden whistleblowing story rabbani who said he is prepared to go to jail said forcing someone to hand over their passwords is like a digital strip search it is more pervasive than a physical strip search with a digital strip search it is not merely the possessions you carry that are searched it is all your personal and professional life that is online he said he could not hand over his passwords because material in his laptop documentation relating to a legal case being built around alleged torture involving the us intelligence agencies which will eventually be made public was privileged and it was up to the person involved to give permission that person declined and rabbani said he was tied by this rabbani who studied economics at the school of oriental and african studies university of london joined cage five years ago as managing director in august last year he became international director a role that includes helping investigations of torture victims he argues that the real objective of schedule 7 is not stopping terrorists entering the uk but as a tool to build up a huge data bank on thousands of uk citizens cage calculates that more than 500 000 british nationals mainly muslims have been detained since the legislation was introduced but only 0 2 resulted in arrests it says and of these an even smaller percentage were charged rabbani is one of about 30 000 british nationals detained last year under schedule 7 of these he said only five resulted in arrests and he is one of them the metropolitan police without naming rabbani confirmed that a 35 year old had been arrested at heathrow on 20 november and placed on bail
2017-01-11,0,cabinet ministers have privately conceded that they are very likely to lose a landmark legal case on brexit in the supreme court and have drawn up at least two versions of a bill that could be tabled after the ruling sources have told the guardian that senior government figures are convinced seven of the 11 judges will uphold the high court s demand that theresa may secure the consent of mps and peers before triggering article 50 it is understood that more than one possible bill has been prepared so that the ministers are ready to respond to any detailed guidance from the judges into what the legislation should look like it is not yet clear when the decision is likely but the guardian has been told that the government has asked the supreme court for early sight of the judgment to allow contingency planning however a spokesperson for the supreme court made clear on wednesday that would not happen saying it is just too sensitive ministers hope the court will allow may to put together a short three line bill or even just a motion which is narrowly focused on article 50 itself and difficult for parliamentarians to amend however lady hale deputy president of the court gave a lecture in november suggesting it was possible for the judges to go much further and demand a comprehensive replacement of the 1972 european communities act dominic raab a conservative mp and former minister who campaigned for brexit told the guardian he and colleagues were not too worried about the case i hope we get some common sense from the supreme court but i do not expect the ruling to hold up triggering article 50 and the vast majority of people whichever way they voted now want us to get on and deliver brexit he said however some remain supporting mps and peers are hoping there will be an opportunity to amend legislation for example to demand that the prime minister pursue the closest possible economic relationship with the eu the liberal democrats plan to lay down amendments demanding a brexit deal be put to the public in a second referendum and that 16 and 17 year olds get a vote some pro brexit mps have been urging the prime minister to adopt a keep it simple strategy a phrase borrowed from management theory ensuring any bill is as brief as possible to minimise the risk it could be derailed mark harper the former tory chief whip who backed remain in the referendum said he believed the supreme court would only be able to demand that the government either produce a motion or a bill but not demand any level of detail beyond that he suggested may s government would probably try to publish something very tight that gives authority to ministers to trigger article 50 before the end of march harper said that while it was not possible to avoid any amendments at all a short and focused bill would make it difficult for mps to cause trouble for may by constraining her room for manoeuvre during brexit negotiations he said that if he was still chief whip he would not be complacent about the process but was cautiously optimistic that the legislation would be passed any attempt by the government or the claimants to obtain advance notice of the supreme court decision has been stymied in most cases it is normal practice for the lawyers involved to be sent the judgment on an embargoed basis beforehand in cases as sensitive as the article 50 appeal the judgment is kept secret until the last moment to ensure that it does not leak out a supreme court spokesperson said in view of the potential sensitivity of the case there will be no copies of drafts available to anybody before the day of hand down ministers are planning to move quickly after a judgment to avoid the days of speculation and anger that followed the high court ruling which took the government by surprise the first step is likely to be a statement to the house of commons by the brexit secretary david davis he is proving popular among mps since taking up his role with friends in the conservative party planning a drinks reception this month to belatedly welcome him back to the frontbench his ally andrew mitchell has joked that it is time for a celebration now it is clear that davis who stepped down as an mp in 2008 is not going to resign from this role one rumour circulating in westminster is that the government plans to publish a press release claiming a win of sorts if four judges rule in favour of the government while seven are against that is the outcome that ministers believe is most likely and while they think they are likely to lose the case being brought by gina miller which would require them to publish an act of parliament they are more confident about other aspects in particular they do not think it is likely that the judges will order may to seek agreement from the scottish and welsh devolved administrations before starting the brexit process the prime minister will give a speech setting out her approach later this month and she will later publish a plan for brexit after signing up to a motion put forward by the labour party moderate conservative mps had urged the government to table a formal white paper setting out its priorities as it negotiates brexit including the answer to key questions such as whether may hopes to keep britain in the single market or the customs union but they now expect may to publish a less definitive menu of options amid fears that a detailed white paper could constrain her room for manoeuvre in the coming months the government is still very concerned that if it puts forward a white paper it will be subject to amendment said one backbencher separately the scottish national party snp is seeking to use the political crisis in northern ireland to ramp up the pressure on the government over its decision to table article 50 by the end of march northern ireland like scotland voted to remain in the eu and the government has promised to take formal account of opinion in other parts of the uk through regular meetings of a joint ministerial committee as it enters talks deirdre brock the snp s spokeswoman on northern ireland challenged james brokenshire on monday she asked the secretary of state for northern ireland now that there is no effective administration at stormont who can speak up for northern ireland in the joint ministerial committee and remembering that northern ireland voted to remain can he tell us what he is doing to ensure that the interests of the people of northern ireland are being looked after when brexit negotiations are considered
2017-06-17,0,concern is growing within the conservative party over theresa may s handling of the grenfell tower fire with some fearing it could become her poll tax moment several of the prime minister s allies defended her response to the tragedy on saturday after she was criticised for her initial failure to meet residents and stilted interviews that left many questions unanswered they said there was an unfair narrative that did not reflect efforts she had been making behind the scenes there is a story out there and facts are selected to fit it said one there is concern however among tory mps that the disaster has again placed the spotlight on may s difficulties in demonstrating empathy and responding on her feet weaknesses that were exposed during the election campaign it is an extraordinary tragedy and there will be a lot of questions to ask but i cannot help feeling that in some people s minds this might be her poll tax moment said one former minister you can see real anger labour may not be able to form a government without an election but they could get people out on the streets we have a really difficult problem inside the commons and tough times with this sort of emergency coming up outside margaret thatcher s plan to introduce the poll tax officially called the community charge was eventually abandoned following riots in 1990 another tory mp compared may to gordon brown whose mechanical style and insistence to be across all detail allowed him to be a successful chancellor but did not translate well once he was prime minister she is a bit like brown what appear to be her strengths actually contain her weaknesses as well and she finds it very difficult to publicly display her emotions the mp said that is not to say she does not have a sense of humour or that she cannot cry but she is adrift at present after the shock of the election result and the grenfell disaster may now faces a difficult week that will also see the government announce a stripped down queen s speech with plans to introduce new grammar schools change the education funding formula and cut winter fuel payments expected to be ditched or diluted there is a febrile atmosphere inside the parliamentary conservative party there is little appetite for an immediate leadership challenge or an election which many mps are convinced they would lose but mps believe it could soon become obvious that the party has no scope to pass significant new laws with may now more damaged than ever they fear the conservative party conference will be the stage for an october beauty contest to select a new leader it is almost overwhelming said one tory mp things are changing so quickly the assumption is theresa may has weeks or months william hague s definition of the tory party was that it was an autocracy tempered by regicide i think if you look back over 150 years that is exactly so the departure of may s joint chiefs of staff nick timothy and fiona hill in the wake of the election has also left the prime minister without her two most trusted advisers some tories are convinced she is still in touch with the pair the two most important people in the operation now are the two gavins the chief whip gavin williamson and may s new chief of staff gavin barwell who lost his croydon central seat at the election allies of boris johnson have been making clear that he has no intention of trying to topple may warning his supporters against making any indication that he is on manoeuvres for lots of reasons the last thing the parliamentary party wants at the moment is a leadership contest said an mp it might be boris it might not be boris but taking two or three months doing that now would not be good and it could still mean a general election and there is a good chance we would lose it others in the party believe may s immediate task is simply to navigate a hard week that includes dealing with the grenfell fallout the beginning of brexit talks finalising a confidence deal with the dup and the queen s speech she has never been as low but i would not underestimate her concept of public service and her determination said one party veteran there is a sizeable proportion of the cabinet who are prepared to bolster her as much as possible another mp was less optimistic the next six weeks will show we cannot do very much it may be she lasts a bit longer but it will be a sheer grinding down people will be fed up with impotence
2016-11-13,0,a senior adviser to donald trump has confirmed that the president elect met uk independence party leader nigel farage saying the two men discussed freedom and winning farage later indicated he and trump had discussed the placing of a bust of sir winston churchill back in the oval office kellyanne conway trump s campaign manager in the last months of the presidential campaign left trump tower in new york two hours after farage had been seen to arrive on saturday all these meetings are incredibly productive conway told the guardian farage had previously spent time with trump who regularly invoked brexit as an example of the success coming his way at a campaign rally and after a presidential debate inside the tower conway told reporters i think they enjoy each other s company the interim ukip leader is the first british politician to meet trump following his election victory the meeting is likely to cause concern in downing street following reports that the special relationship between the us and uk could be more difficult to maintain under the new president britain s prime minister theresa may was only the 11th world leader called by trump after his victory on tuesday on saturday evening farage sent a tweet that was accompanied by a picture of the two men smiling broadly in front of a pair of gold doors he added donald trump s support for the us uk relationship is very strong this is a man with whom we can do business especially pleased at his very positive reaction to idea that sir winston churchill s bust should be put back in oval office farage was referring to a running rightwing sore over the alleged removal by barack obama of a bust that was kept in the oval office by george w bush and whether such an alleged action made the current president anti british foreign secretary boris johnson a leader with farage of the campaign for britain to leave the european union wrote in april that it did saturday s intrigue began at 1 50pm local time when farage walked into the lobby of trump tower the fifth avenue skyscraper in which trump lives and from which he runs his business empire trump and key advisers have been meeting at the building since the president elect s return from washington dc where he met barack obama and republican congressional leaders on thursday asked by reporters seeking news of plans and appointments if trump had invited him and if he was helping with the republican s transition to the white house farage said we are just tourists farage met and served trump on the campaign trail speaking for him at a rally in mississippi in august and working the post debate spin room after the second debate against hillary clinton in st louis in early october his arrival at trump tower came just after film maker michael moore left the building which was surrounded by a heavy new york police presence but open to the public at lobby level moore attracted attention when he walked into the lobby at 1 10pm as a 10 000 strong protest march neared i just thought i d see if i could get into trump tower and ride the famous escalator he said adding that he was broadcasting his visit on facebook live police subsequently stopped the protest march a block away at east 55th street and closed the lobby to the public earlier speaking on fox news farage said trump must meet may to mend fences between the uk and the us farage said may s team had been quite rude about the president elect but that trump had got to meet her trump is an anglophile he said he understands and recognises what our two great nations have done together between us and thank goodness we are coming to the end of an american president who loathed us one of the things we can do between us is a sensible trade relationship cut tariffs we are massive investors in each other s countries there is a brighter future asked to comment on the brexit referendum farage said it had given ordinary little people the chance to say what they thought brexit was the first real kick back against the liberal establishment which has dominated with its friends in big business and the big banks dominated the world for the last couple of decades he said what we have to do is follow the example given to us over 30 years ago by reagan and thatcher they both won counter revolution elections they made the world a better place farage was in florida earlier this week for a private meeting earlier on saturday ukip sources said no firm meeting was scheduled with the president elect but said farage would be delighted if the opportunity arose farage has also suggested that insulting comments senior tories made about trump may have been the reason for may coming so low down on the president elect s list of foreign leaders to call farage s remarks came after it emerged that the prime minister s two joint chiefs of staff had attacked trump on social media before taking up their current posts fiona hill posted last december donald trump is a chump while nick timothy wrote in march american politics was depressing enough before trump took off farage claimed this week to have been the catalyst for trump s rise in turn trump often referred to brexit on the campaign trail likening his predicted victory to the shock result in the referendum on membership of the european union in an interview with talkradio from spain before he left for the us farage said he was the catalyst for the downfall of the blairites the clintonites the bushites and all these dreadful people who work hand in glove with goldman sachs and everybody else have made themselves rich and ruined our countries he also joked about the idea of trump sexually assaulting may when he met her and described outgoing president barack obama as a creature asked about trump s possible future behaviour after he was accused of a series of sexual assaults which he denies farage added if it comes to it i could be there as the responsible adult role to make sure everything s ok a downing street source said farage s activities in the us were an irrelevance to the british government he has no role whatsoever we will not be talking to him the source said meanwhile axel schafer a senior member of angela merkel s social democrat coalition said may was delusional if she thought she could broker a good trade deal with trump schafer told the times that the likelihood of a speedy and preferential trade agreement between the uk and the us had changed even before tuesday the chances were rather low now the hope for this kind of deal seems delusional he said the labour leader jeremy corbyn described trump s election as a global wake up call that showed that britain must take back control from the billionaires bankrolling the tories corbyn accused the president elect of targeting the fears of people who feel left behind by the economic change of globalisation he said that instead of giving them solutions he had shifted the blame to other sections of society we have no idea how donald trump proposes to make america great again and theresa may s tories offer slogans but no solutions for most people in britain he said we will not tackle the damage done by elite globalisation just by leaving the eu we will not take back control unless we take on the corporate vested interests that control our energy our transport and have infiltrated our public services one thing is for sure neither billionaire donald trump nor the billionaire backed tories have any interest in giving people back control or reining in the predatory excesses of a globalised free for all corbyn told labour s south east regional conference in kent
2016-10-16,0,boris johnson said britain s continued membership of the eu would be a boon for the world and for europe in an unpublished newspaper column in which he wrestles with his decision to back or oppose brexit the foreign secretary has since insisted the column was intended merely as a tool for his own thought process calling it semi parodic in tone in a telegraph article written days before a published version in which he backed leaving johnson wrote of the eu this is a market on our doorstep ready for further exploitation by british firms the membership fee seems rather small for all that access why are we so determined to turn our back on it everybody was trying to make up their minds about whether or not to leave the european union and it is perfectly true that back in february i was wrestling with it like i think a lot of people in this country and i wrote a long piece which came down overwhelmingly in favour of leaving he told sky news i then thought i better see if i can make the alternative case for myself so i then wrote a sort of semi parodic article in the opposite sense which has mysteriously found its way into the paper this morning because i think i might have sent it to a friend but i set them side by side and it was blindingly obvious what the right thing to do was and i think the people made the right decision they voted very substantially to leave the european union that is what we are going to do and we are going to make a great success of it the published column which appeared in the sunday times is highly critical of the eu as an institution and the renegotiation deal sought by david cameron we are being outvoted ever more frequently johnson wrote the ratchet of integration clicks remorselessly forward there is going to be more and more of this stuff and i can see why people might just think to hell with it i want out i want to take back control of our democracy and our country if you feel that i perfectly understand because half the time i have been feeling that myself and then the other half of the time i have been thinking hmmm i like the sound of freedom i like the sound of restoring democracy but what are the downsides and here we must be honest the existence of the article in which he also warned that brexit would cause an economic shock and could lead to the breakup of the united kingdom was revealed in the book all out war the full story of how brexit sank britain s political class by the newspaper s sunday times s political editor tim shipman there is the worry about scotland and the possibility that an english only leave vote could lead to the break up of the union johnson wrote there is the putin factor we do not want to do anything to encourage more shirtless swaggering from the russian leader not in the middle east not anywhere the book also claims johnson wanted to punch his brexit ally michael gove after the former justice secretary announced his own bid to become prime minister on the morning of a speech in which johnson was to announce his own candidacy a move that ended up destroying both men s chances and paving the way for theresa may to enter no 10 the book also claims sir lynton crosby told johnson to support brexit once cameron had ignored the election strategist s advice to delay the referendum among the other revelations the remain campaign s digital specialist jim messina apparently described cameron pollster andrew cooper as the worst i ve ever worked with for getting wrong his forecasts about the vote lucy thomas former deputy director of the stronger in campaign said the unpublished column demonstrated how much of johnson s decision to back leaving the eu was about his political career none of it is about the detail none of it is about what life outside the eu looks like there was no thinking about prices going up or what would happen to jobs it is purely was the renegotiation enough is the status quo the right thing she said
2016-12-26,0,this christmas break for anybody steeped in the assumptions that have underpinned non mainstream political thinking needs to be a moment of realisation brexit will happen globalisation will fall apart freedom of movement as an unconditional right in the eu will end the concept of the west as upholder and occasional enforcer of human rights across the world is at the very least on hold it is not pessimism that makes me write this but optimism optimism that if we adapt our thinking to the new reality fast enough we can go on fighting for social justice and human rights on behalf of that generation staring glumly at their touchscreens over the christmas table but that is a big if this holiday season i guarantee that you will hear older relatives repeatedly say the words will never britain will never leave the eu donald trump will never take office fascism will never return to germany and austria since denial is the first stage of grief it is forgivable for people to struggle through from brexit to boxing day saying these things but not beyond when world changing events happen the denial reflex is strong because most rational people configure their principles around existing facts for example the european institutions that guarantee freedom of movement came to embody the principle held by many that borders should be as open as possible no matter that freedom of movement within europe was conditional on a three metre high razor fence between morocco and the spanish enclave at melilla the freedom bit seemed to embody a general principle in future we will have to separate our principles from institutions that once embodied them likewise for that more vaguely defined principle europeanism it took me until the age of 40 to visit the us by then i had travelled by foot air rail and road across europe i was convinced this was an inexhaustible cultural playground a place from which all my values emanated while much of the us was simply flyover country a young generation that spends stag weekends in riga childhood holidays in disney world florida and gap years in thailand is going to be less europeanist than mine but their globalism was built on the assumption that paris or berlin were short hop weekend destinations to be reached with a waft of one s passport towards a friendly border guard this mindset too will have to change to avoid brexit plunging us into the gdp catastrophe predicted by the treasury we have to pursue two outcomes first to minimise our break with the eu single market and if that fails to maximise it unsentimentally for those gripped with the denial instinct the objective of minimising the break comes easy but not the means the means through which we can achieve soft brexit are tough self centred negotiations that put the british national interest first if we fail because europe is a mess ruled by an elite in denial of its own failures it would be logical to pursue a total reconfiguration of our trade industrial base and attitude to globalisation even those like me fighting for the softest possible brexit must contemplate what the social justice agenda might look like after a hard one as for the global power system trump s cabinet choices show he intends to shatter it for the first time in a generation the section of the israeli right prone to the most violent rhetoric about the palestinians will go unrestrained by washington for the first time in a generation human rights campaigners in russia will have to look at the state department and the cia as a kind of informal conduit back to vladimir putin and the fsb security agency not their allies underlying all these changes is the fact that the global system is becoming a negative sum game for more than three generations it was a positive sum game it is the difference between the great british bake off and pass the parcel in gbbo even though only one person wins there is always more cake at the end than at the start in pass the parcel everybody except the winner loses and what is in the parcel is always a disappointment globalisation was a positive sum game even if for the former industrial populations of the west it was barely positive it lasted so long that people began to assume pass the parcel economics had become impossible we are about to find out that is a fallacy you can still fight for social justice wealth redistribution and human rights in a negative sum world but you cannot do it by clinging to principles you assumed were general but are not since free movement as an absolute right will be gone once we leave the eu i would reconfigure migration policy to deliver maximum social justice for two sets of people those who already live here including three million eu nationals and refugees whose right to claim asylum here should be absolute in a globalised world competitiveness meant a race to the bottom low wages and a shrunken welfare state in a negative sum world it means a fight to locate well paid high skill jobs in the uk and not elsewhere the weapons should be active industrial policy tax breaks high welfare spending and free university education paid for by the state being a nuclear armed state whose main ally for more than 70 years is suddenly ruled by an erratic kleptocrat who is morally indebted to the kremlin should prompt the biggest rethink of all for four years at least britain must operate diplomatically on our own we must cease fostering the illusion that we have the power on our own to save the syrian revolution restrain israel in its next assault on gaza or force abdel fattah el sisi to let journalists out of jail we should go on trying of course but with little promise of success these sobering facts will confront the left and the climate movement with hard choices just as they confront the liberal centre all we can do as churchill put it to the us congress on boxing day in 1941 is draw the sword for freedom and cast away the scabbard
2016-11-17,0,boris johnson s approach to brexit has been ridiculed by european ministers after he told italy it would have to offer tariff free trade in order to sell its prosecco in the uk carlo calenda an italian economics minister said it was insulting that johnson had told him during a recent meeting that italy would grant britain access to the eu s single market because you do not want to lose prosecco exports he basically said i do not want free movement of people but i want the single market he told bloomberg i said no way he said you will sell less prosecco i said ok you will sell less fish and chips but i ll sell less prosecco to one country and you will sell less to 27 countries putting things on this level is a bit insulting the italian also attacked the whole government s approach to the brexit negotiations saying the demand by johnson and others for access to the single market was incompatible with curbs on free movement of people somebody needs to tell us something and it needs to be something that makes sense he told bloomberg you cannot say that it is sensible to say we want access to the single market but no free circulation of people it is obvious that does not make any sense whatsoever calenda a former italian envoy to brussels said there is lots of chaos and we do not understand what the position is it is all becoming an internal uk debate which is not ok the british government needs to sit down put its cards on the table and negotiate a second attack was delivered by the dutch finance minister and eurogroup president jeroen dijsselbloem who said johnson s aims of leaving the customs union at the same time as securing immigration controls and maintaining access to the single market were not achievable dijsselbloem told the bbc s newsnight i think he is offering to the british people options that are really not available for example to say we could be inside the internal market but be outside the customs union this is impossible it just does not exist the opposite does exist we have a customs union with turkey but turkey is not part of the internal market he is saying things that are intellectually impossible politically unavailable so i think he is not offering the british people a fair view of what is available and what can be achieved in these negotiations describing brexit as a lose lose situation dijsselbloem added it would be in my country s interests and in european and british interests if the brits would stay in the eu but i do not think it is going to happen the next best option is to have as good an agreement as possible but the uk will be outside the single market and there will be some hindrances angela merkel the german chancellor also appeared to be standing firm on defending the fundamental principle of free movement within the eu on tuesday but conceded there could be room for further discussion around whether welfare benefits should be immediately available for life if an eu citizen moved to another member state theresa may the prime minister has refused to elaborate on her plan for brexit beyond saying she wants a bespoke deal curbs on immigration and as much free trade for uk businesses as possible she told the house of commons on wednesday that being in or out of the eu customs union was not a binary decision as her labour and snp critics attacked her lack of a strategy for brexit may repeatedly insisted she and her ministers were devising a coherent plan for exiting the eu but would not share details before negotiations began jeremy corbyn the labour leader focused his questions almost entirely on brexit and argued that the government was making a total shambles of it the prime minister plans to trigger article 50 notifying the eu of the uk s intention to leave the bloc by the end of march but there are growing concerns that her timetable is too ambitious after a note by a consultant at deloitte suggested the government lacked a plan for brexit and may need to employ up to 30 000 more civil servants to deal with the process sir simon fraser the former permanent secretary at the foreign office told the house of commons brexit committee on wednesday that the note appeared to exaggerate the problems but agreed there was not yet a central plan for leaving the eu my understanding is that it is indeed proving to be a very considerable challenge in whitehall to do this drawing up a brexit plan that the government has not yet reached the point where it is still in information gathering mode and is not yet at the point of integrating that into a central plan and that i assume will have to happen before the triggering of article 50 next year and i agree that this is a huge burden a huge additional load for the civil service this is an extraordinary complex range of activity across a wide range of domestic and international policies and it will definitely impose a great burden on the civil service in response michael gove the former cabinet minister and leading brexit campaigner pressed for the uk to achieve a quickie divorce with the eu regardless of the economic consequences as he raised concerns that civil servants were overcomplicating the process the former justice secretary who led the vote leave campaign with johnson questioned why the uk could not just leave the eu without having settled its future relationship with the bloc after having sorted out housekeeping related to outstanding payments can we simplify gove said what if i were to determine to simply leave the european union to trigger article 50 and to conclude the bare minimum in order to leave what would article 50 actually require me to agree for the purposes of this question i am not worried about transitional arrangements i am prepared to take

2016-12-01,0,the government has been warned that up to 1 million eu citizens living in the uk could be at risk of deportation if it does not come up with a simple way of recognising their status in the country the 3 million a grassroots group lobbying for the rights of non british citizens who have made the uk their home has told the home secretary it would take the home office 47 years to process applications from eu citizens for permanent residency pr we are people with families children friends and work colleagues and we are rightly worried about a very uncertain future said nicolas hatton chair of the 3 million in his letter to amber rudd eu citizens have been feeling very anxious about their future since the referendum and this set of data will not reassure them we call on you to remove the threat of deportation without notice and give us today guarantees that all eu citizens living legally in the uk will be able to exercise their right to remain before the uk leaves the eu theresa may has consistently said that rights for eu citizens were a legitimate part of brexit negotiations but on thursday night the government seemed to go one step further by indicating their rights could be removed if not reciprocated a home office spokesperson said the home secretary has been clear that she wants to protect the status of eu nationals already living here and the only circumstances in which that would not be possible is if british citizens rights in european member states were not protected in return the estimated time it would take the home office to deal with the 3 million eu citizens in the country is based on the latest immigration data which shows a surge in applications for pr since the eu referendum which has caused a backlog of 100 000 applications pr was designed for non eu citizens who wished to settle in the uk and involves an 85 page application form applicants not only have to provide five years of council tax bills bank statements or utility bills to demonstrate residency but also have to document each time they have been in and out of the country since they arrived in the uk monika lutke daldrup from germany who is an executive with a large european firm and lives in watford told the guardian i travel about 20 times a year and i have been here for 18 years it is ridiculous paola rizatto said i am an educated person but i found the 85 page form so overwhelming that i decided to hire an immigration lawyer i have already spent around 1 000 several mothers who have british children say they are not eligible for pr because their household bills are not in their names just to be married to a british person or to have british children is not enough said one another who asked not to be named said she had been told to get her child s school to sign a statement that she had been picking up her child each day for the past five years the 3 million said the home office process for pr is totally inconsistent and depends on what home office adviser you get data published on thursday shows that 30 of applications are rejected with many eu citizens unable to pass the paperwork test despite their legal right of residence as eu citizens if the government requires all non britons to join the non eu immigrants in the permanent residency queue up to 1 million could face deportation the day the uk leaves the eu the home office said there had been no change to the rights and status of eu nationals in the uk as a result of the referendum its guidance was that eu citizens did not need to apply for permanent residence as such there is no requirement to register for documentation to confirm their status a spokesperson said
2016-11-19,0,european leaders have come to a 27 nation consensus that a hard brexit is likely to be the only way to see off future populist insurgencies which could lead to the break up of the european union the hardening line in eu capitals comes as nigel farage warns european leaders that marine le pen leader of the front national could deliver a political sensation bigger than brexit and win france s presidential election next spring a result that would mean it was game over for 60 years of eu integration according to senior officials at the highest levels of european governments allowing britain favourable terms of exit could represent an existential danger to the eu since it would encourage similar demands from other countries with significant eurosceptic movements one top eu diplomat told the observer if you british are not prepared to compromise on free movement the only way to deal with brexit is hard brexit otherwise we would be seen to be giving in to a country that is leaving that would be fatal the latest intervention by farage will only serve to fuel fears in europe that anti eu movements have acquired a dangerous momentum in countries such as france and the netherlands following the precedent set by the brexit vote ukip s interim leader who predicted both the vote for brexit and donald trump s us victory told the observer that while le pen was still more likely to be runner up to an establishment candidate next may she now had to be taken seriously as a potential head of state she will clearly win through to the second round and after what has happened elsewhere only a fool would say she would have no chance of winning overall france is a deeply deeply unhappy country if she were to win it would be game over for the eu le pen has made clear she wants to take france out of the euro and the eu the prospective hardline approach has been agreed by the 27 member states as a bloc acting in concert the remaining eu states will refuse to grant the uk access to the single market unless london agrees to sign up to its rules including free movement of people capital services and labour norbert röttgen chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the german bundestag told the observer that he wanted to help the uk but if there were no willingness to accept eu rules there was no hope i am really ready to come to a result but if the british position is no no no then even i would have to say that there is no common ground the vice president of the centre right european people s party german mep david mcallister added you cannot have 100 control over internal migration say no to european court of justice rulings and that you will not pay anything into the budget this just will not work the british are testing us we all know that they are testing how united europe is so what is important is that europe stays together no bilateral negotiations with the british no cherry picking we are doing this as a bloc trump s sensational victory led some members of the french establishment and politicians in berlin and brussels to worry that le pen could benefit from a similar wave of popular discontent and pose a real threat former french prime minister jean pierre raffarin said reason no longer prevailed in france and that le pen can win farage who has been heavily critical of the front national as a party but admires le pen personally said he had not had time to think about whether he would support her campaign for the elysée it has been too busy he said what i would say is that i have not had anything good to say about the national front but equally not anything bad to say about marine le pen i think the important thing for her is to run as much as possible as an individual as her own person french mep constance le grip said she did not believe le pen could win but admitted there was a danger of bolstering support for her if the uk were given an exit deal that was too favourable if you start to reshape the whole project to be some sort of europe à la carte it is the beginning of the end apart from the fact that le pen will then claim victory wilders in the netherlands and so on more opt outs for the uk would be absolutely incoherent and absurd on 29 october less than two weeks before trump seized the white house farage rejected prevailing opinion and forecast his victory against hillary clinton i am going to predicthere and now that trump is going to win on 1 june 22 days before the brexit vote he said i believe we will win

2016-10-26,0,theresa may privately warned that companies would leave the uk if the country voted for brexit during a secret audience with investment bankers a month before the eu referendum a recording of her remarks to goldman sachs leaked to the guardian reveals she had numerous concerns about britain leaving the eu it contrasts with her nuanced public speeches which dismayed remain campaigners before the vote in june speaking at the bank in london on 26 may the then home secretary appeared to go further than her public remarks to explain more clearly the economic benefits of staying in the eu she told staff it was time the uk took a lead in europe and that she hoped voters would look to the future rather than the past in an hour long session before the city bankers she also worried about the effect of brexit on the british economy i think the economic arguments are clear she said i think being part of a 500 million trading bloc is significant for us i think as i was saying to you a little earlier that one of the issues is that a lot of people will invest here in the uk because it is the uk in europe if we were not in europe i think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say do they need to develop a mainland europe presence rather than a uk presence so i think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms her warning about the importance of the uk s membership of the eu comes in marked contrast to her positioning in recent weeks may said at the conservative party conference that she wanted to prioritise reducing immigration over being part of the single market in her speech she said british companies needed the maximum freedom to trade and operate in the single market but not at the expense of giving up control of immigration again or accepting the jurisdiction of judges in luxembourg at goldman sachs may also said she was convinced britain s security was best served by remaining in europe because of tools such as the european arrest warrant and the information sharing between the police and intelligence agencies there are definitely things we can do as members of the european union that i think keep us more safe she said the disclosures could prove embarrassing for the prime minister who faced criticism for lying low during the referendum campaign and offering only luke warm support for the remain side in april may gave a speech in which she set out some of the reasons for staying in the eu warning that it could have an impact on the development of the single market for the rest of the eu if the uk left but her comments at the goldman sachs event a month later go further in warning about the dangers to the british economy from businesses relocating to continental europe during the referendum campaign may infuriated senior conservative colleagues on the remain side by largely staying out of the day to day arguments in favour of staying in the eu one of her major pro remain interventions was overshadowed by an announcement that she would like to take the uk out of the european convention on human rights which she quickly ditched when running for the party leadership her refusal to participate much in the campaign led craig oliver david cameron s former chief of communications to wonder if she was secretly an enemy agent for the other side however others have suggested she believed in the arguments for staying in but was keeping her powder dry in case of a pro brexit vote may went to goldman sachs as a guest speaker and answered questions from the floor in relaxed exchanges she praised cameron the then prime minister and said he had returned with important concessions from his eu summit earlier in the year she sidestepped a question about whether she wanted to be prime minister and focused on explaining why britain should stay in the eu may said that is one of my messages in terms of the issue of the referendum actually we should not be voting to try to recreate the past we should be voting for what is right for the future goldman sachs confirmed may had spoken to staff but was not paid she accepted an invitation as part of the bank s talks gs programme in which high achievers from all walks of like are given a chance to reflect on their experiences and answer questions previous speakers in the series include double olympic champion dame kelly holmes david benioff the co creator of the game of thrones tv series and loyd grossman the man behind the eponymous sauces some of the speakers are listed online although may is not in the us the democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton made three private speeches to goldman sachs staff in 2013 the contents of which she originally refused to divulge during a bitter primary contest with leftwing rival bernie sanders she was paid 675 000 554 000 and transcripts eventually released by wikileaks show her taking a much softer line on wall street than she had publicly claimed introduced in her private session at the bank as the longest serving home secretary this century may spoke in much more explicit terms than ever before about the need for the uk to act from the front in europe what i do think is that the uk needs to lead in europe she said i think over the years the uk has tended to take a view that europe is something that is done to us we have taken a rather backseat position to europe i think that when we go out there when we can take the initiative and when we lead we can achieve things so i do think we need to make sure we are taking the lead she dismissed concerns of senior figures in the military who had claimed that the eu was making life more difficult for soldiers actually very often when people talk about it i suspect and i have not spoken to them i suspect that they are not talking about the european union but the european convention on human rights and the european court of human rights which is separate from the european union tim farron the lib dem leader said it was disappointing that theresa may lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of brexit he added more disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self harm on the uk economy by pulling britain out of the single market phil wilson a labour mp speaking for the open britain group campaigning for the uk to stay in the single market said it is good to know that privately theresa may thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy now she is prime minister theresa may is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government s negotiating position chuka umunna the labour mp and former shadow business secretary said may was right then and it underlines why single market membership should be her ambition now a no 10 spokesman said britain made a clear choice to vote to leave the eu and this government is determined to make a success of the fresh opportunities it presents david davis made very clear in the house of commons last week the importance the government places on financial services across the uk in the negotiation to come as has the chancellor in recent weeks we want a smooth and orderly exit from the european union which would be in the interests of both britain and the eu
2016-12-06,0,theresa may has been challenged over her decision to wear a 995 pair of leather trousers for a newspaper photoshoot by a reporter on a flight to bahrain but sidestepped the question to insist she was working for everyone in britain the prime minister was interrogated after it emerged she wore the trousers and a pair of 295 burberry trainers when photographed by the sunday times last month may was also questioned about her choice of goose for christmas dinner rather than a traditional turkey but replied that her fashion choices or festive menu did not mean she was distant from the general public giving a look of mild exasperation may responded i stood on the steps of downing street and said what i did about the importance of a country that works for everyone because that is what i have heard from people as i ve gone around the country as i ve met people in a whole variety of circumstances i believe it is important for politicians to get out and about and that is what i continue to it is important we have a country that works for everyone over the weekend nicky morgan the former education secretary who was sacked by may said the trousers had been noticed and discussed in local tory circles i do not have leather trousers i do not think i ve ever spent that much on anything apart from my wedding dress morgan said on tuesday the conservative mp nadine dorries rounded on morgan for criticising may s dress sense implying that a male politician would get no such criticism calling the former education secretary sacked nicky morgan dorries tweeted in her interview with the sunday times in november may said she did not have a stylist but took fashion advice from her husband philip he is good at accessories too she said particularly good at choosing handbags and bracelets for presents and good at flowers on monday the radio times published an interview in which the prime minister revealed that she preferred goose for christmas dinner watching doctor who over the festive season and listening to radio berkshire in the evenings before bed
2016-11-18,0,theresa may and angela merkel have discussed the possibility of agreeing deals with african countries to stem migration into europe following the model of the eu turkey refugee deal as well as the importance of rolling over sanctions against russia in relation to the conflict in eastern ukraine we will support the eu action to work in source countries to deal with the root causes of migration the british prime minister said her attempt at getting in a few words on brexit was rebuffed before the meeting by the german chancellor who said no further detailed discussions could be held until the uk formally submitted its application to exit the trade bloc by triggering article 50 we will not be able to talk about britain s exit from the european union because the prime minister has said she will make the application for britain to leave in accordance with article 50 by the end of march merkel said we accept that and wait for that application may said she would try to make brexit a smooth and orderly process our work is on track we do stand ready to trigger article 50 by the end of march 2017 she said the prime minister also implied that she would raise the possibility of sanctions against russia in relation to bombings in syria saying there was a need to keep up the pressure against russia including the possibility of sanctions on those who breach international humanitarian law earlier merkel had said russian sanctions had only been discussed in relation to ukraine not syria the one to one meeting in berlin came after barack obama used his last get together with european leaders as us president to urge them to work with his successor donald trump and consider further steps to solve the crises in syria and eastern ukraine following lengthy talks with merkel on wednesday and thursday obama and the leaders of britain france italy and spain discussed the humanitarian situation in aleppo and the need to keep working together as part of multilateral bodies such as nato and to press ahead with the transatlantic agenda the white house said in a statement trump said during his presidential campaign that if russia attacked a nato member he would consider whether the targeted country had met its defence commitments before providing military aid the leaders were also expected to talk about the threat posed by the dispersal of seasoned isis fighters who are being pushed out of iraq and syria by coalition attacks and could move to other countries in africa or the middle east or return to europe the issue of the movement of isis fighters was raised at the un general assembly meeting in september and was discussed again as we close down daesh s areas of operation in one part of the world we need to be mindful of the fact that they may regroup in other parts and how we set about tackling that a downing street spokesperson said with the last leg of his farewell tour taking him to berlin obama had made clear that if there had been a special relationship between the us and a european country during his eight years in office it had not been with britain but with germany including an intense three hour dinner on wednesday and a lengthy press conference on thursday in which obama praised merkel as the only figure left among his allies the events of the last days have emphasised a symbolic passing of the baton as if to underline his point even further the us president was scheduled to head back across the atlantic barely two and a half hours after meeting may and other european leaders obama s last official visit to europe has been infused with nostalgia with the american and german leaders at times struggling to hide their concerns over a power shift in global politics obama said trump as president was unlikely to follow exactly our blueprint or our approach though he said he was hopeful that his successor would pursue constructive policies that defend democratic values and the rule of law he said trump should not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest we just cut some deals with russia even if it hurts people or violates international norms or leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long term problems in regions like syria asked whether ongoing sanctions on russia would be discussed in berlin the downing street spokesman said clearly we will seek agreement to maintain the ukraine related sanctions until such time as we see the minsk agreement implemented obviously we will expect to see the quint leaders united in the need to keep up pressure on the syrian regime and their influencers to stop the actions that are taking place there speaking after the friday meetings merkel said she felt a duty to serve her country and europe adding further fuel to rampant speculation that she will seek a fourth term as chancellor asked how she saw her short and long term responsibilities merkel downplayed descriptions of herself as the last great defender of western values following trump s election telling reporters one person alone can never solve everything instead she vowed to perform her task as german chancellor which on the one hand is to serve the people of germany but it also includes working for the cohesion and success of europe merkel is scheduled to hold a news conference late on sunday after meeting senior members of her party
2016-12-29,0,jeremy corbyn will urge the public to join him in taking on the political establishment in 2017 in a new year video message aimed at cementing his reputation as a combative outsider in the video shot at westminster corbyn describes 2016 as a year that will live long in all of our memories and says he understands some of the concerns that led to the brexit vote people did not trust politicians and they did not trust the european union he says i understand that i ve spent over 40 years in politics campaigning for a better way of doing things standing up for people taking on the establishment and opposing decisions that would make us worse off he promises to fight against a brexit deal that would safeguard the interests of city banks or continue corporate handouts to big businesses saying labour was founded to stand up for people and we founded the institutions that do that day in and day out like our nhs we are the party that listens to you and makes britain better let us do that together in 2017 labour strategists have taken a deliberate decision to play to corbyn s strength as an unpolished political maverick who has notoriously refused to toe the party line throughout several decades as an mp the labour leader has appeared more assured since he convincingly saw off owen smith s leadership challenge in september with his opponent admitting that corbyn s performance at the dispatch box has improved corbyn also knows labour will be under intense scrutiny in the months ahead close allies including the shadow home secretary diane abbott have acknowledged that the party needs to try to close the gap with the conservatives in the polls in the video in which he appears in a tailored navy jacket against the south bank skyline of county hall and the london eye corbyn reflects on the past year saying every day i see the political system letting down the people of this country how decisions made in westminster are making people s lives harder he cites rising homelessness the crisis in social care funding and the increasing prevalence of low pay and insecure jobs millions of people cannot plan their lives because whether on temporary or zero hours contracts they do not know what job or what hours they will have from day to day week to week or month to month and for many pay is so low that it does not make ends meet labour is attempting to gear up for a potential snap general election in early 2017 although no candidates have yet been selected for key seats mps with marginal seats in former industrial areas far from corbyn s islington constituency doubt his appeal extends beyond the metropolis the party may have a battle on its hands to maintain the copeland constituency that will shortly be vacated by jamie reed the corbyn critic who is leaving parliament to work for the nuclear site sellafield corbyn was blamed by many of his pro eu mps for failing to fight hard enough to win the referendum but his allies believe that his cautious tone in which he encouraged voters to stick with the eu warts and all better reflected the public mood john mcdonnell the shadow chancellor sparked outrage among some in his own party recently by citing the enormous opportunities brexit could bring corbyn s new year message reiterates his stance that labour accepts and respects the result of the referendum after the shadow brexit secretary keir starmer pushed the government to promise to produce a plan before legislating to invoke article 50 in the new year corbyn hinted that labour might do more to try to influence the process we will not be blocking our leaving the european union but we will not stand by he said corbyn s more combative tone was evident in a guardian interview earlier this week in which he compared theresa may s wish to use the royal prerogative to take britain out of the eu with henry viii the labour leader makes no reference to his own turbulent year which saw him face down scores of shadow cabinet resignations and a vote of no confidence by 172 of his own mps an overwhelming majority most backbenchers believe it is unlikely he will face a fresh threat to his leadership in 2017
2016-11-06,0,in the hall of india and pakistan on the first floor of the offices of the royal over seas league members club a largely male elderly group of about a hundred drank coffee ate chocolate chip cookies and badmouthed the new number one enemies of democracy british judges the occasion was a hastily organised brexit conference near central london s green park a book sale in the corner of the event hosted by the thatcherite bruges group offered a taste of the views held by many in the room anthony scholefield and gerald frost s too nice to be tories how the modernisers damaged the conservative party competed for attention with david brown s end of the english the european superstate once upon a time this gathering would have been dismissed as an irrelevance to modern britain s political culture a get together of fruitcakes to quote david cameron s mocking description of ukip voters in the days before the joke was suddenly on him but such lofty dismissals now belong to another age the rage felt in this room at the high court s decision to insist on parliamentary approval for triggering britain s exit from the european union and give mps a decisive say in the government s general goals is being taken very seriously by the current incumbent of downing street in one corner of the room nigel farage s former spokesman patrick o flynn talking to a tv camera spoke for many the judgment had been a wakeup call to those who had been walking around with smiles on their faces since the referendum he said it had become clear during the conservative party conference that the government was intent on a hard brexit involving the removal of the uk from the customs union and the single market and that it believed the referendum gave it a mandate if not a democratic duty to deliver there had been a period of sniping from the remainers but it had been judged of little consequence flynn suggested but now the phoney war was over or as one senior brexiter a former government minister not at the event told the observer the remainers have won this first battle now we have to win the war it was shortly after 10am on thursday that the high court s ruling was delivered its impact proved to be all the greater due to the assumption that the challenge was a lost cause a last futile attempt to turn the brexit tide there had also been an unusual level of secrecy around the verdict none of the lawyers involved had been given the normal advance drafts of the judgment to check for mistakes and to prepare their submissions the government had argued during a three day hearing that nothing in the european communities act of 1972 restricted the crown s power to withdraw from eu treaties using the royal prerogative without recourse to parliament but the lord chief justice was having none of it the government s arguments had been contrary to fundamental constitutional principles of the sovereignty of parliament the victorian constitutionalist av dicey was quoted the judges know nothing about any will of the people except in as far as that will is expressed by an act of parliament the court concluded the government does not have power under the crown s prerogative to give notice pursuant to article 50 for the uk to withdraw from the european union officials in downing street hastily cancelled their lunch plans and scurried back to the prime minister s side the pound surged to a four week high against both dollar and euro and a vitriolic media backlash began as brexit supporting tabloids went for the throats of the judges who had delivered this outrage the judges who blocked brexit one founded a european law group another charged the taxpayer millions for advice and the third is an openly gay ex olympic fencer screamed mailonline nigel farage was soon stoking the fires of resentment and allegations of betrayal tweeting i now fear every attempt will be made to block or delay triggering article 50 they have no idea level of public anger they will provoke the communities and local government secretary sajid javid a notably reluctant remain campaigner before the referendum stepped outside his brief to condemn the decision as unacceptable and next day s newspapers threw caution to the wind enemies of the people concluded the daily mail the judges versus the people huffed the daily telegraph richard desmond s rarely understated daily express covered its front page with the union flag over which it printed in bold three judges yesterday blocked brexit now your country really does need you we must get out of the eu with characteristic insouciance the foreign secretary boris johnson admitted during a visit to berlin to some sturm und drang back home meanwhile theresa may was hitting the phones a no 10 spokesman said may had explained to european commission president jean claude juncker and german chancellor angela merkel that while the government is disappointed by the judgment we remain of the firm belief that we have strong legal arguments ahead of the case which will be moving to the supreme court next month the prime minister also confirmed that the planned timetable for notification of article 50 remains the same the spokesman added whether that proves to be the case may has promised to trigger article 50 by the end of march is very much open to question the brexit secretary david davis has confirmed that a parliamentary bill will most likely be necessary if the high court s ruling is upheld and such a bill could be amended with stipulations over everything from a second referendum on the terms of the final deal to mere reassurances on general goals the proposed legislation may bounce between the commons and the lords over weeks and months we will make sure that we build into that bill a referendum that will take place before the uk leaves the eu to give us the opportunity to endorse or reject that deal liberal democrat leader tim farron said in a sign of the import of the moment for the first time since the court was established in 2009 all 11 justices of the supreme court will now sit to hear the government s appeal over four days in early december on which way the judges will fall every politician has a view ken clarke the former chancellor and justice secretary said he felt that the verdict was in line with modern constitutional law nobody starts a war nowadays without getting parliamentary approval and nobody should completely break economic and trade links with our closest allies without parliamentary approval he told the observer the referendum was always supposed to be advisory the former cabinet minister john redwood one of john major s famous maastricht bastards who made the then prime minister s attempts to sign that eu treaty such a torture insisted that the decision would be swiftly seen as a piece of shoddy work and rejected i assume the government is right and they will reverse the lower court s decision because it is such a bad decision he said the passage on the referendum is just laughable they just assert that it is advisory when every household was sent a letter making it very clear that we the people are making the decision and parliament will implement it for you it was in the hansard record and the prime minister repeated it the supreme court has every reason to say you have not understood referenda on monday the government will make a statement in parliament on the matter and a cross party meeting of mps who had campaigned for remain concluded that they would wait until the new ruling to take any decisions on the way forward but already even those who say they will not block article 50 out of respect to their constituents are citing an array of reassurances that they will require in any upcoming bill parliament has been jolted back to life central government is dominated by the london perspective and the london economy said andy burnham the mp for leigh who is standing to be the mayor of manchester we cannot have trade deals that protect the city of london but sacrifice other sectors clarke added i will vote against article 50 that should not shock anybody i have believed it is in the national interest to be in the eu for the last 50 years and big events have proved me overwhelmingly right over that period the key thing is where we move on from that to start holding the government to account the referendum decided we would leave but no two ministers are agreed on what steps are and what alternative we are putting in place once the government has agreed on a policy on our economic and trading relations with the wider world it seems to be plain that it is accountable to parliament for that policy the conservative mp stephen phillips who campaigned to leave the eu quit his seat on friday in protest at the government s attempt to sideline parliament s role in shaping brexit but as parliament stirs so have many of the people who voted for leaving the eu but who came to believe last week with encouragement from some in the media and political classes that something undemocratic is afoot it is even believed by some that those who are celebrating last week s victory may come to reap a whirlwind especially if the prime minister feels that she needs a general election to change the nature of parliament in favour of her goals the lib dems think defying the referendum result is an electoral ticket back to the big time said former justice minister dominic raab their antics just look like irresponsible opportunism precisely when the country needs to see some unity of purpose behind the government s brexit negotiations in the country at large the mood has become newly toxic waiting for his wife outside gloucester s historic new inn on friday ray marchmont said he was fed up with politicians politics the judiciary and probably the media gloucester voted leave by 58 5 to remain s 41 5 in june and marchmont supported the winning side my vote s gone out of the window he said they have taken it away from us i did not know anything about this court case it was a shock when i heard about it i could not get my head around it they have just said stuff it we are going to do what we want the 66 year old ukip supporter added i think a lot of it is sour grapes they have said you have your vote now we are going to decide if they do vote to turn it over then i think there could be repercussions jacqui robins who like marchmont lives in the city and was one of the 37 776 people to vote leave in gloucester also expressed bewilderment if it is the people s choice then the politicians should not go against it she said why ask the people if that is what they are going to do it seems like a waste of money and time robins had been intending to vote remain but had changed her mind during the campaign i was going to vote to stay but then i thought change is good but if we are going to go out then out means out she declared echoing the prime minister s brexit utterance back in green park o flynn who since leaving farage s side has become a ukip mep for the east of england said there was no need for the newspapers to apologise for their attacks on the judiciary in fact he wants more of it judges have this particular conceit of themselves that they are so lofty that they are immune to the vulgarity of public opinion i do not think that is true he said and that is why i was delighted by the newspaper coverage we need to harness the public outrage what can ukip do i ve come to the rather happy conclusion that it is our solemn duty to be shamelessly populist
2016-12-28,0,jeremy corbyn has accused theresa may of behaving like henry viii or a similar autocratic monarch because of her refusal to commit to putting a final brexit deal to a vote in parliament in an interview with the guardian the labour leader insisted that the prime minister could not be allowed to use the royal prerogative to bypass the commons over the uk s future relationship with continental europe earlier this month may repeatedly refused to commit to a parliamentary vote during a select committee hearing prompting corbyn to conjure up an image of the prime minister acting as if she was an overbearing tudor it a final brexit deal would have to come to parliament she cannot hide behind henry viii and the divine rights of the power of kings on this one he said pointing out that meps in the european parliament would have a vote on the proposed settlement the idea that on something as major as this the prime minister would use the royal prerogative to bypass parliament is extraordinary i do not know where she is coming from the comments which refer to whatever deal is agreed at the end of the brexit negotiating process in 2019 rather than the trigger of article 50 next year came during a wide ranging interview corbyn also the labour leader said blair had already ruled himself out of the forthcoming byelection in copeland in cumbria triggered by the resignation of jamie reed but asked if he would be happy with another constituency amid rumours that blair was considering a comeback corbyn said i think the nuanced differences of opinion between me and tony blair are quite well known i do not see tony blair and i working together i do not think he does either his frank language about both the prime minister and blair come as labour strategists seek to ramp up corbyn s image as a leftwing populist who is prepared to rail against establishment figures they believe that while the labour leader is already seen in that way by part of the population there are too many voters who may consider the islington mp to be part of the establishment corbyn is expected to appear more frequently on television as an expanded team of advisers work up policies aimed at underlining a willingness to lead a revolt against vested interests despite pressure from labour mps including manchester mayoral hopeful andy burnham to take a tougher line on free movement corbyn did not list immigration among his post brexit priorities instead he spelled out a desire to protect market access as well as maintaining human rights and opposing racism arguing that britain could not be a bargain basement economy on the edge of europe he also claimed that there was a level of exaggeration about any negative impacts of migration on british society corbyn said we should recognise that european workers in britain do contribute massively to the health service education manufacturing industry care work agricultural sector we would be in quite a difficult place if they all went we have to recognise that people do move around the continent do move to work do move to pay taxes and to benefit the economy that they come into they do not have unfettered access to benefits the day they arrive in britain they do not have unfettered access to housing the day they arrive corbyn said he wanted people to think for a moment who treats them when they go to the doctors who treats them when they go to hospital who is doing the technical work often in many places and you will find the same with british people all over the world corbyn argued that companies such as airbus nissan and hitachi needed to be free to move skilled workers around europe and would leave britain if brexit meant higher tariffs to access the single market he also hinted that he believed continued free movement would be necessary to secure labour s priority of economic access claiming that a work visa scheme would be fraught with difficulties because of the high level of integration with europe he also cast doubts on whether labour would support a system in which people could only come if they had a job well then that will work in reverse for british people going abroad which would be difficult to implement and maybe is counter to the principles of the european market however he did set out plans for a policy which he is expected to stress much more frequently in 2017 which could result in migration numbers falling what we need to address is exploitation undercutting and the way in which companies are trying to destroy industrial agreements by ignoring what they should be doing which is paying people properly and not bringing people in to undercut said corbyn the labour leader said he was building alliances with socialist parties in other countries because the final brexit deal hammered out over two years after article 50 is triggered will be put to the european parliament presumably all national parliaments will want a say as well so our relations with socialist groups in every national parliament could be important said corbyn before insisting that british mps also had to be given a vote on the deal it is not clear whether the government is prepared to offer that or not the brexit secretary david davis has hinted that mps could be given a vote but may was unwilling to offer that commitment when she appeared in front of the liaison committee last week corbyn also urged all members of the leftwing campaigning group momentum to join the labour party he also encouraged the hundreds of thousands of people who joined labour to back him to get more involved in campaigning amid claims from mps that new members were failing to turn out he said he wanted all mps to move on from the summer s leadership contest and insisted that the party was in a strong position despite some dire recent poll ratings corbyn said he hoped to gain seats in may s local elections and claimed the media was ignoring labour s successes i cannot pretend the two byelection results were good he said about results in richmond park in london and sleaford lincolnshire but on the same day we gained a ward in telford with a 20 increase in vote and overall majority on council we have never won that ward ever no media reported that we held a ward in lancaster he added results vary i want to do better corbyn dismissed reports that he has told friends he is ready to step down in 2019 because of his age saying friends is obviously a very loose term these days i ve never said that i m very happy doing my campaigning this is the age of the 60s look at trump clinton sanders angela merkel look around you sixties is the new 40s i keep fit
2017-04-03,0,tony blair has accused labour of failing the british people by not being an effective opposition as he slammed the ultra left takeover of the party ask yourself one simple question he said in the prime minister s office in tory high command how much of their time do they spend worrying about the prospect of a labour victory at the present time i would guess zero we have got to make them wake up every morning and fear us the former leader s comments were made in an interview with the labour mps ruth smeeth and wes streeting for progress magazine blair said that the current incarnation of the party under jeremy corbyn s leadership was putting principle before power and that labour has only won when it has been at the cutting edge of modernity a lurch to the left between 1979 and 1983 had cratered the labour party the former prime minister said i do not want to depress you but there is a big difference between the 80s and now in the 1980s the ultra left never took control they tried but they failed the moment when denis healey beat tony benn was the moment when the labour party was saved asked how labour could remain relevant blair replied urgency because politics moves faster today and brexit it is the defining moment in british history we have to say the government s got a mandate to negotiate brexit but we are going to hold them to account that it is not going to damage jobs that it is not going to damage the economy his latest comments follow an attack on labour in february in which he accused a debilitated party of allowing brexit to happen i hate to say that but it is true he said what this means is that we have to build a movement which stretches across party lines and devise new ways of communication in his first major intervention since the referendum blair declared in february that it was his mission to persuade the uk to stay in the eu calling for remain supporters to rise up in defence of what we believe the people voted without knowledge of the true terms of brexit he said as these terms become clear it is their right to change their mind our mission is to persuade them to do so while he was forming an institute to make the case against brexit at any cost blair denied he was considering creating a new centrist political party it was necessary to raise the alarm about the jumble of contradictions in theresa may s arguments for brexit according to blair they are not driving this bus they are being driven he said we will trigger article 50 not because we now know our destination but because the politics of not doing so would alienate those driving the bus the surreal nature of the exercise is enhanced by the curious absence of a big argument as to why this continues to be a good idea blair s position contrasts sharply with that of corbyn who took the decision to order his mps to vote in favour of the government s brexit bill in february four shadow cabinet ministers resigned so they could be among the 47 labour mps to vote against brexit the liberal democrat leader tim farron and nick clegg the former deputy prime minister and now his party s brexit spokesman have welcomed blair s intervention in the debate farron said in february blair s speech shows how badly corbyn s labour has failed as an opposition labour have waved the white flag and given theresa may a blank cheque for a divisive hard brexit
2017-06-25,0,here is our main story about the debate and here is john crace s sketch that is all from me for tonight thanks for the comments nigel farage the former ukip leader is claiming the audience was biased against ukip he also says bbc executives should be sacked because of this although if you watch the video of him saying this on his lbc show instead of just listening you might detect a smile on his face as he is saying this that suggests at least it did to me that he knows he is not really being serious at this point and ukip has put out a press notice headed powerful and courageous performance by ukip leader it quotes the ukip deputy leader peter whittle saying it is clear that paul nuttall showed a resolve courage and leadership that has been lacking from the rest of the westminster establishment paul spoke to people in britain who are living in the real world unlike the others he was honest direct and confident about the future of britain despite a blanket of denial from the other speakers he was prepared to talk about the real threats faced by our society he was prepared to call out islamic extremism for what it is rather than simply restate the platitudes we are so used to he was realistic about the impact of immigration on jobs and our public services the lib dem press statement about the debate is causing much merriment in the wood panelled spin room of the cambridge union the first drama of the night came when labour s emily thornberry burst into an interview with tory cabinet minister damian green live on bbc news the work and pensions secretary was among several high profile tories including brexit secretary david davis and culture secretary karen bradley who paced the room speaking to broadcasters about amber rudd s performance but labour sources said thornberry had been scheduled to be on channel 4 news with green until conservatives had told labour they did not want a two way debate stood down thornberry decided to take matters into her own hands and join green s post debate interview live on air lib dem campaign chiefs declared themselves chuffed with tim farron s performance particularly the audience gleeful reception of his final joke that viewers should switch off for rudd s statement and watch bake off instead he smashed it one source said lib dem president sal brinton said farron had needed to make an impact given how little he was recognised by the wider public however if cheers from the crowd were anything to go by it was corbyn who won labour sources said the labour leader had deliberately held back from criticising the prime minister too incessantly for not turning up intending instead to focus on the message of the party s manifesto while smaller parties tore into rudd he is the only person in that room who could be prime minister and so he behaved like one a source said tory sources pointed out however that the labour leader had not mentioned brexit in his opening or closing statements or in his answer about leadership how can you start the negotiations in 11 days time and not mention the biggest issue facing this country one said labour admitted corbyn had not mentioned the issue but said that was a deliberate attempt to have broad resonance he said we are fighting for the many not the few we want a brexit for the many not the few the source said this is from the bbc s esther webber if you are reading this you are a guardian reader and that means you featured in tonight s debate tim farron the lib dem leader said climate change was not just a matter for hair shirt muesli eating guardian readers he said if it is simply for hair shirt muesli eating guardian readers to solve climate change it ain t going to solve the problem we are all stuffed we can make ourselves energy self sufficient in renewable energy the bbc s jeremy vine says he found this puzzling crikey this is just out this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the debate there is no real consensus and even those who are naming a winner seem to concede it was not clear cut on this one it is a case of you pays your money or not in the case of the guardian online although please do sign up to become a member if you have not already from sky s faisal islam from the sunday times tim shipman from itv s robert peston from sky s adam boulton from the mirror s ben glaze from the spectator s james forsyth from the guardian columnist paul mason from buzzfeed s marie le conte from reaction s iain martin from the independent s john rentoul from rosa prince author of biographies of may and corbyn from the ft s jim pickard from the mail on sunday s dan hodges here is the labour party s statement about the debate this is from a spokesperson for jeremy corbyn tonight s debate highlighted the clear choice at this election between a labour party that will invest in and transform our society to build a britain for the many and a conservative party that has held people back and stand only for the few only jeremy corbyn or theresa may will be prime minister after june 8 but tonight in what was effectively a job interview for number 10 only one of the two candidates bothered to turn up theresa may will not even debate her opponents here in the uk in an election she called how on earth can she be trusted to negotiate in europe and get the best deal for the british people jeremy corbyn clearly won the debate he showed himself as a leader who wants to change the country for the better to make it work for the many not just a few by contrast theresa may s refusal to take part showed her weakness it is a sign of a tory campaign which is treating the public with contempt trying to hide from scrutiny they showed tonight they have no answers to the challenges facing britain and that they would make pensioners and working people worse off tonight proved that jeremy corbyn and labour are the only party that will build a britain for the many not the few like any content rich political event a party conference speech a budget a manifesto a debate offers numerous potential lines and it can be hard to work out immediately which ones if any have any lasting significance and a seven way debate to use a technical term employed by the sunday times tim shipman see 8 44pm is a clusterfuck there were not any stand out winners but most attention was focused on jeremy corbyn and he did well his attack on paul nuttall over food banks was one of the highlights of the debate he was authentic and passionate and increasingly the cchq charge that he is an implausible pm seems to look less convincing the other main figure on the stage tonight was amber rudd in a six against one scenario she seemed to hold up quite credibly and she wins the message discipline prize of the night one derided by the media but important nonetheless for her constant jibes about labour s money tree as for the others tim farron had some of the best soundbites of the evening and his final line about not giving theresa may your time because she is not giving hers to you was one of the best lines of the evening caroline lucas predictably and leanne wood a bit less predictably had some outstanding moments their two pronged attack on rudd over the tories being in coalition with ukip see 8 09pm was particularly effective and wood came out with the best put down of the whole evening when she depicted nuttall as someone who would try to divorce his wife without paying we all know about blokes like you see 8 49am angus robertson was particularly effective when it came to challenging nuttall on migration and even paul nuttall was better than he was in last week s debate although as the only leave voter on the panel it is hard to credit how he ended up representing over 50 of the country there may not have been a winner but there was a loser may herself long after we have all forgotten anything that was said last night we will remember that may did not show up earlier i wrote that it seemed to make sense for a pm with a lead in the polls to avoid a debate like this see 2 57pm now i am not so sure david cameron managed to wriggle out of one of the debates in 2015 but it went ahead without a conservative and they called it a challengers debate as if that was an established constitutional norm no one particularly noticed that cameron had stayed at home but when rudd tried to answer the question about leadership by praising the abilities of someone who was not even there see 8 51pm may s absence was transparent and not particularly explicable perhaps voters will decide they do not mind very much but if may s ratings continue to slide even further this will inevitably be seen as a contributing factor nuttall says tonight was like groundhog day ukip will always be the outsider but it has been proven right on brexit on immigration on grammar schools and on protecting services lucas says the country stands at at crossroads one more mp from the other parties but more green mps would be transformative corbyn says the real choice is between a labour government and a conservative one vote labour for the many not the few robertson says this is about the kind of country we should be the snp will always work with others to make the country better wood says plaid is the only party putting wales on the agenda but plaid mps will stand up for the whole of the uk she urges people to give them the mandate to allow them to stand up for wales farron says rudd is coming up next the pm could not be bothered to turn up bake off is coming up next make yourself a brew you are not worth her time so do not give her yours rudd says the government needs to be at its strongest to take the uk through brexit only may can do that and thats it verdicts reaction and a summary coming up next this is from the sun s matt dathan robertson says may is the u turn queen that is not the leadership we require he says the snp are the third party at westminster and provide the real opposition he says farron says may should have turned up for the debate he says he grew up in preston he saw what it meant when people were brought up in poverty
2017-06-25,0,the russian government is suspected of being behind a cyber attack on parliament that breached dozens of email accounts belonging to mps and peers although the investigation is at an early stage and the identity of those responsible may prove impossible to establish with absolute certainty moscow is deemed the most likely culprit the disclosure follows the release of the first details of the sustained cyber attack that began on friday fewer than 90 email accounts belonging to parliamentarians are believed to have been hacked a parliamentary spokesman said amid fears that the breach could lead to blackmail attempts officials were forced to lock mps out of their own email accounts as they scrambled to minimise the damage from the incident the network affected is used by every mp including theresa may the prime minister and her cabinet ministers for dealing with constituents the british security services believe that responsibility for the attack is more likely to lie with another state rather than a small group of individual hackers the number of states who might mount such an attack on the uk is limited and in addition to russia includes north korea china and iran a security source said it was a brute force attack it appears to have been state sponsored the nature of cyber attacks means it is notoriously difficult to attribute an incident to a specific actor mps contacted by the guardian said the immediate suspicion had fallen upon foreign governments such as russia and north korea both of which have been accused of being behind hacking attempts in the uk before in may russia was linked to the hacking of france s computer systems during the presidential campaign taking data from emmanuel macron s campaign and leaking it to the public us officials have previously said they were seeking to share their experience of the 2016 presidential election where us intelligence agencies concluded that russia hacked and leaked democratic party communications and disseminated fake news with the aim of getting donald trump elected the attack on the houses of parliament sought to gain access to accounts protected by weak passwords the estate s digital services team said they had made changes to accounts to block out the hackers and that the changes could mean staff were unable to access their emails a parliamentary spokesman said those whose emails were compromised had used weak passwords despite advice to the contrary investigations are ongoing but it has become clear that significantly fewer than 1 of the 9 000 accounts on the parliamentary network have been compromised as a result of the use of weak passwords that did not conform to guidance issued by the parliamentary digital service as they are identified the individuals whose accounts have been compromised have been contacted and investigations to determine whether any data has been lost are under way he said it comes just over a month after 48 of england s nhs trusts were hit by a cyber attack britain s national cyber security centre ncsc is understood to have played a leading role in investigating the wannacry malware that affected the nhs and other organisations in may and concluded that a north korean hacking team had been responsible an ncsc spokesperson said the ncsc is aware of the incident and is working around the clock with the uk parliamentary digital security team to understand what has happened and advise on the necessary mitigating actions the ncsc which started its operations in october last year is the public face of the uk s secret surveillance agency gchq which works closely with the us national security agency both are engaged in hacking targets in russia china north korea and elsewhere around the world conservative mp andrew bridgen said such an attack absolutely could leave some people open to blackmail constituents want to know the information they send to us is completely secure he said liam fox the international trade secretary connected the news to reports that cabinet ministers passwords were for sale online we know that our public services are attacked so it is not at all surprising that there should be an attempt to hack into parliamentary emails he said and it is a warning to everybody whether they are in parliament or elsewhere that they need to do everything possible to maintain their own cybersecurity an email sent to all those affected seen by the guardian said earlier this morning we discovered unusual activity and evidence of an attempted cyber attack on our computer network closer investigation by our team confirmed that hackers were carrying out a sustained and determined attack on all parliamentary user accounts in an attempt to identify weak passwords these attempts specifically were trying to gain access to our emails we have been working closely with the national cyber security centre to identify the method of the attack and have made changes to prevent the attackers gaining access however our investigation continues the changes are believed to have stopped mps and their offices from accessing emails on mobile phones and tablets outside westminster access to systems from the westminster estate has not been affected the email said before adding that further disruption was likely the latest attack was publicly revealed by liberal democrat peer lord rennard on twitter as he asked his followers to send any urgent messages to him by text angela rayner labour s shadow education secretary also tweeted if you try and contact me by my parliamentary email address then l will not be able to respond currently this is due to a cyber attack henry smith the tory mp said sorry no parliamentary email access today we are under cyber attack from kim jong un putin or a kid in his mom s basement or something the government s national security strategy said in 2015 that the threat from cyber attacks from both organised crime and foreign intelligence agencies was one of the most significant risks to uk interests the national crime agency said it was working with the ncsc but the centre was leading the operational response
2017-06-10,0,on thursday it will be exactly two years since jeremy corbyn with only minutes to spare secured the backing of the 35 mps required to launch his labour leadership bid so unsure was his small team that he would be able to muster enough parliamentary signatures that they drafted two press releases one in the event that he made the ballot the other that he did not the latter denouncing mps for preventing a proper debate was jettisoned amid much relief a curious mix of old style rallies and online activism by a small team of digital savvy supporters caused his humble campaign to flourish into a political uprising that floored the labour establishment his team were repeatedly told that their plans to win over young voters at a general election with the same mix of town hall campaigning and online activism would deliver only humiliation and a tory landslide while the debate over may s failings and the importance of strong campaigns by labour mps will rage for weeks many of corbyn s fiercest critics are happily admitting he proved them wrong labour did not win the election despite all the doubts however it appears that corbyn s vow to go after the traditionally unreliable electoral support of the young paid off in many areas it was helped by the underestimated skills of a group of aides and supporters who had been battle hardened by almost two years of perpetual campaigning those involved in the campaign who spoke to the observer said young voters were reached with new campaigning techniques both online and on the ground deployed by both labour hq and a merry band of corbyn supporting groups they also all said however that there was one factor that made the whole thing work corbyn s unspun personality and his willingness to be upfront about his beliefs the spirit of that last minute leadership bid is still in the minds of some of those he has energised said one young activist who gave up a day of work to turn out voters in westminster north a marginal seat that labour held he clearly did not want to get into power he spoke about things he cared about because he had nothing to lose he just wanted to broaden the debate and suddenly people felt like someone was being honest for the first time while there is no hard data yet on the turnout of 18 to 24 year olds only 43 of whom voted in 2015 there is already a clear pattern of turnouts increasing significantly in areas with many young voters labour also did best where turnout increased the most they came out for corbyn it is believed that the young had a hand in key victories including in sheffield leeds and canterbury so how was corbyn s unspun outsider appeal to young voters turned into hard votes against all the odds insiders insist there was no magic bullet but two pieces of obscure software developed by labour hq are widely acknowledged to have played a significant role the first helped turn a swollen base of activists into proper campaigners called chatter it allowed labour s growing base of activists to have proper text exchanges with people they canvassed rather than dispatching them blunt campaigning messages it armed campaigners with the ability to actually make people feel like they were being listened to on a local level said a senior labour figure the second was the closest thing labour had to a secret weapon over the last year the party developed a tool called promote its effect was to unleash the power of facebook advertising to local parties across every constituency the tool combined facebook information with labour s voter data but allowed senior activists and candidates to use it to send locally based messages to the right sections of their electorates labour is said to have spent heavily through the tool people were seeing stories about their school and hospital not just national messaging like the tories were doing said a campaign source it has played in to the fact that people felt labour s message was authentic and speaking to them and their lives you see that in things like the polling on what policies people recall they recalled positive offers from the labour party and negative things about the conservatives there was also a successful voter suppression drive a tactic designed to stop supporters of rival parties from turning out labour had been gifted such an issue with the so called tory dementia tax on care costs attack ads on the issue were dispatched far and wide to 200 seats crucial to the online campaign most labour insiders now say was the leaking of the labour manifesto days before it was due to be released in contrast to the dull negativity of the tories it had a packed programme of promises when the manifesto leaked people were talking about the policies and they had wall to wall coverage said matt zarb cousin corbyn s former spokesman and a leading advocate online it was brilliant he was much more recognised as an opposition leader than ed miliband people were interested in the manifesto and it was costed while labour insiders said the leak did not come from the top the communications director seumas milne was seen in a serious panic when news of the leak broke its release was a moment when the campaign switched away from brexit and on to austerity but corbyn s unusual appeal and status as an outsider meant that there was suddenly a huge amount of online coverage the party did not have to pay for it secured a coveted prize of organic sharing online users deciding to pass on campaign material to their friends and family voluntarily the tories spent vast amounts on digital advertising and local newspaper ads but it was so negative that they got hardly any organic sharing no one wanted to be associated with those messages said a senior campaign figure a video of corbyn interjecting during theresa may s facebook live chat on itv received 4 million views corbyn challenging may to a debate reached 1 4 million people a video on may s security record reached 2 3 million people as for the old school rallies corbyn addressed 100 000 voters at 90 events during the campaign it was the symbolism and energy of the events however that gave them significance just before the election there were the six simultaneous rallies very traditional in style said a senior figure clearly that is a few thousand people who are highly committed and go to rallies but then the video of the events reached over 2 million people and then there were the unofficial helpers from momentum the campaign set up out of corbyn s leadership bid during the campaign they were boosted by support given by figures from bernie sanders us presidential bid grayson lookner jeremy parkin kim mcmurray and erika uyterhoeven were sanders staffers who offered advice in activist training sessions focusing on sending activists to the right places and ensuring people turned out training sessions took place in london sheffield hull and elsewhere its mynearestmarginal com site was used by more than 100 000 people we reached out way beyond our own bubble we have 24 000 members said adam klug one of the central momentum team they revamped the phone canvassing app they had used for corbyn s leadership campaign to get people out on the doorstep there was also a volunteer army of film makers and video editors making viral social media content one edgy film daddy why do you hate me received 7m views we are a smaller bureaucracy so we can get things signed off but we ran a clean positive empowering campaign klug said the dual attack of labour s official campaign and corbyn s personal activists was mirrored in labour s london hq on election night while staffers were toiling away on the eighth floor on a diet of tea and pizza more raucous corbyn supporters were already partying on the second floor the get out the vote effort was clearly effective in some areas volunteers signed up online to help and were dispatched to a nearby marginal seat sometimes via the momentum mynearestmarginal com and electiondaypledge com sites it was like clockwork said one volunteer directed to the westminster north marginal she went to the front room of someone who knew she was coming and told her the exact door numbers to knock on and what time to knock several sources said so many volunteers flooded the constituency that some had to be sent elsewhere tariq persaud parkes is an activist and branch secretary in hastings and rye where the home secretary amber rudd s majority dropped from almost 5 000 to 346 we had 10 times more activists than in 2015 he said momentum activists were at the college and the university signing people up left right and centre they got about 2 000 people registered to vote the whole corbyn gamble had been facilitated by a huge voter registration drive while many of the attempts to sign up the young were non partisan the connection between the enthusiasm to sign up and support for corbyn is clear to many of those involved a flurry of interest from leading artists in the grime music scene gave the movement new impetus and a viral outsider appeal that complemented corbyn s non mainstream political message his online interview with the rapper jme was widely shared backing from stormzy and rapper akala followed it led on to endorsements from other parts of the music world nme and kerrang magazine stormzy s endorsement was more of a side effect although it probably did help with turnout said fraser watt a campaigns officer for london young labour structural factors are more important labour appealed to a generation that came of age during the financial crisis josh cole from the non partisan rizeup voter registration campaign said the political landscape has changed a lot and a lot of people probably looked at the result of the eu referendum and wished they had been a part of it we are not falling for that again we are getting involved the choices are also clear an extreme right wing and an extreme left wing the choice on the table was simple to understand simon woolley director and one of the founders of operation black vote said that independent endorsements for corbyn had helped to empower the young and black and ethnic minority communities what we did with some significant success was work on voter registration he said in croydon there was a fantastic turnout an area with a bme voter base of 32 000 in that seat a minister was ousted klug added the word apathy is thrown at young people when really they feel they are not represented jeremy and this manifesto really

2017-03-29,0,this letter sets out the deep and special partnership we hope to enjoy as your closest friend and neighbour with the european union once we leave the dear donald letter begins warmly almost lovingly as the prime minister makes clear she does not want to weaken europe by leaving it the use of the word special usually reserved for trips to washington suggests she wants to emulate the transatlantic alliance but at more of an arm s length distance than before we want to make sure that europe remains strong and prosperous and is capable of projecting its values leading in the world and defending itself from security threats we therefore believe it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside those of our withdrawal from the european union though the language remains constructive this is a much more controversial veiled threat in eliding britain s security responsibilities with its desire for economic gain so explicitly may will be accused of holding a fearful continent to ransom give us your markets or we will leave you at the mercy of terrorists and russians we will of course continue to fulfil our responsibilities as a member state while we remain a member of the european union and the legislation we propose will not come into effect until we leave there is an unspoken climbdown here earlier talk of restricting the residency rights of new eu immigrants as soon as article 50 was invoked has been quietly dropped by postponing any changes to their legal status until march 2019 at the earliest may has avoided inflaming tensions further it is the expectation of the government that the outcome of this process will be a significant increase in the decision making power of each devolved administration there are not many carrots offered to scotland in the letter but this is one of them a reminder that when powers return from brussels many of them will go to holyrood as well as westminster whether the opportunity to make fisheries and forestry policy for example will compensate for losing the single market is another matter if however we leave the european union without an agreement the default position is that we would have to trade on world trade organisation terms may was careful not to repeat her threat of walking away without a deal in her speech to the house of commons but here it is towards the top of the letter as a negotiating gambit it is perhaps essential to show britain has other options but it will raise fears again at home that the government really believes it can walk away with nothing from the talks in security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened just in case the earlier veiled threat was not explicit enough may rams home the point that europe needs britain s spooks and soldiers there are echoes of trump in the hint that the western military and security alliance comes at an economic price less so the founding principles of nato we also know that uk companies will as they trade within the eu have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part just as uk companies do in other overseas markets there were hints of wriggle room here from may on the vexed question on whether the european court of justice has ultimate jurisdiction over free trade within europe the brits seem to be suggesting this can stop at the border in her speech may promised to put an end to the jurisdiction of the european court of justice in britain perhaps this means it can kick in at dover and govern international trade without touching the domestic third rail we will need to discuss how we determine a fair settlement of the uk s rights and obligations as a departing member state in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the united kingdom s continuing partnership with the eu another more emollient sounding message here on the question of the divorce bill with the threat of haggling over the cd collection still contained within we will pay something but not anything the brits seem to be saying do not get clever with the lawyers the point is we are leaving is the kicker the free trade agreement between the united kingdom and the european union should be of greater scope and ambition than any such agreement before it so that it covers sectors crucial to our linked economies such as financial services and network industries may again helps herself to a big slice of cake here with little sign of how she intends to reconcile it with eu priorities the real haggling over trade is still to come but the prime minister again insists she can strike one of the deepest free trade deals in history in one of the shortest time frames imaginable and still have room for cherries and icing on top perhaps now more than ever the world needs the liberal democratic values of europe we want to play our part to ensure that europe remains strong and prosperous and able to lead in the world projecting its values and defending itself from security threats i can help you deal with donald trump europe s security is more fragile today than at any time since the end of the cold war but you also need me to keep vladimir putin at bay the united kingdom s objectives for our future partnership remain those set out in my lancaster house speech of 17 january and the subsequent white paper published on 2 february i really meant that bit about walking way without a deal
2017-06-09,0,jeremy corbyn said the face of british politics had changed and called on theresa may to resign after her snap general election left britain with a hung parliament 11 days before brexit talks begin speaking as he was returned as mp for islington north the labour leader declared politics has changed politics is not going back into the box where it was before what is happened is people have said they have had quite enough of austerity politics corbyn said may had called the election to assert her authority she wanted a mandate well the mandate she is got is lost conservative seats lost votes lost support and lost confidence i would have thought that is enough for her to go the conservative leader appeared crushed as she accepted her victory in the constituency of maidenhead with a shaky speech in which she repeated her resolve to provide the stability the country needed before brexit talks if the conservative party has won the most seats and most votes then it will be incumbent that we will have that period of stability and that is what we will do she said but her long term future remained uncertain by the early hours of friday morning pressure was mounting on the prime minister as tory mp anna soubry broke ranks to say may should consider her position it is bad she is in a very difficult place it was a dreadful night i ve lost some excellent and remarkable friends she said this is a very bad moment for the conservative party and we need to take stock and our leader needs to take stock senior conservative sources said recriminations were already beginning among cabinet ministers with david davis singled out by some of his colleagues for pressing may to gamble on holding the snap poll there are a lot of very very pissed off people in the cabinet and with him in particular said one the former chancellor george osborne described it as a catastrophic result while another conservative mp said she needs to go the tight result first indicated in a shock exit poll on thursday night that showed the conservatives likely to be the largest party in a hung parliament represented a disastrous night for may shortly before 6am on friday labour held two key seats in southampton to bring its total to 258 so far and deny the conservatives the possibility of securing a majority it was projected the tories would end up with fewer than 320 seats the failure of the prime minister s election gamble taken when the party was more than 20 points ahead in the polls triggered uncertainty on the eve of brexit talks causing a drop in the value of sterling speaking from his home in islington north london shortly after midnight the labour leader said whatever the final result we have already changed the face of british politics labour secured a first ever win in the previously safe conservative seat of canterbury and also took control of peterborough which was one of the brexit capitals of the country there were also gains for corbyn s party in battersea stockton south bury north and vale of clwyd a difficult night for the snp delivered one of the biggest scalps with the party s westminster leader angus robertson losing his seat in moray the former lib dem leader and deputy prime minister nick clegg spoke out about the need for the government to be sensitive about huge societal divisions as he was defeated by labour in sheffield hallam the party s leader tim farron hung on to his seat in cumbria while vince cable regained the twickenham seat he lost in 2015 the conservative minister ben gummer a close ally of the prime minister and a key author of the party s manifesto lost in ipswich while the financial secretary to the treasury jane ellison was defeated in battersea south west london the home secretary amber rudd faced a recount in a tight race in hastings but just held on it was a bad night for ukip in which the party s leader paul nuttall came third in boston and skegness and it was crushed in its former seat of clacton the foreign secretary boris johnson said the conservatives had to listen to constituents as his own majority fell but bookies also slashed the odds of him becoming the next tory leader the shock result came after a gruelling seven week battle in which supporters of corbyn flocked to almost 100 rallies across the country in a vibrant and energetic campaign the labour leader ended a tour of several seats starting in glasgow on the final day of campaigning with a speech on the edge of his constituency in islington where he said that labour s anti austerity message represented the new centre ground of british politics corbyn sustained a string of attacks from conservatives and also parts of the media with a number of newspapers calling on their readers to reject him in thursday s poll john mcdonnell the shadow chancellor hit out at the negative and nasty tactics of his opponents insisting labour had stuck to upbeat arguments i think it does change the nature of political discourse i think people have got fed up with the yah boo politics and some of the nasty tactics that have gone on recently earlier he told the guardian that may s general election campaign in which he and corbyn were accused of being terrorist sympathisers was an exact reflection of zac goldsmith s conservative bid to become london mayor which triggered anger and accusations of dog whistle politics may s effort was seen as more turbulent given her u turn over social care plans and the decision to base the entire thrust of the campaign on her character appearing to backfire recriminations focused on the party s manifesto which caused division at the top of the party holding on to his seat with a big majority the labour deputy leader tom watson said it looks likely to be a very bad result for theresa may she said it is a fact that if we lose just six seats we will lose our majority and jeremy corbyn will become prime minister we do not yet know the final result but we intend to hold her to that fears that hung parliament projected would delay brexit negotiations sent the pound plunging in the minutes following the exit poll publication the pound fell as much as 2 to 1 27 the lowest level in six weeks but then stabilised while dealers awaited the first actual results jeremy cook the chief economist at world first said that if the exit poll proved to be correct it could drive sterling to 1 24 although not as low as the levels it plunged to following the brexit vote almost a year ago one insider in labour hq known as south side said an entire floor had been converted into several war rooms scattered with whiteboards television screens and lists of seats gathered there were key figures such as labour s general secretary iain mcnicol and key corbyn advisers including seumas milne his deputy steve howell and the author of the manifesto andrew fisher conservative advisers had appeared relatively confident about winning a majority as they headed into the final 24 hours privately they were discussing the potential for a reshuffle of may s team on friday rather than mulling over the possibility of her exiting downing street may would not be drawn on what scale of majority she would consider a success but said on tuesday that she was feeling good about the campaign the senior election team gathered at party headquarters in matthew parker street in westminster claiming at first that it was early days but later failing to speak out at all the prime minister s election campaign was dominated by visits to labour held seats in areas considered to be the party s heartlands such as the west midlands yorkshire and the north east while david cameron spent much of the 2015 battle in liberal democrat tory marginals may s tour included the ultra safe labour seat of birmingham ladywood launching a battlebus in north shields and unveiling her manifesto in halifax which last turned conservative in 1983 earlier one labour candidate said colleagues were feeling downbeat with fears of a 100 plus majority for may but they later admitted they had been wrong the campaign was heavily affected by the two devastating terror attacks in manchester and london bridge which moved security questions up the agenda with accusations being thrown in all directions the lib dems acknowledged they had faced a difficult campaign in which an expected fightback failed to come to fruition the party s hardline anti brexit position had cut through less than was hoped as domestic issues such as the nhs and schooling and the fallout of two terror attacks dominated however there were some pleasing gains for the party during polling day there were reports of students from keele university being turned away at polling stations in the ultra marginal newcastle under lyme constituency the labour candidate there paul farrelly who was under pressure after ukip stepped aside to help the conservatives defeat him reacted angrily to reports that hundreds could have been affected by a failure to update the registration data the electoral services department here in newcastle is a shambles and there is chaos which is denying people votes on a scale unprecedented in my 30 years fighting and organising elections said farrelly who is defending a majority of just 650 in a seat where ukip won more than 7 000 votes in 2015
2017-01-12,0,fresh legal challenges aimed at preventing a hard brexit will be launched this month as mps craft parliamentary amendments in the hope of securing a second vote on any final deal with the european union ireland s courts will host an ambitious crowdfunded attempt to refer an appeal to the eu s highest tribunal about whether the process of brexit is reversible a letter before action is being sent to the irish government on friday and it is intended that the application will go before judges in dublin in the spring meanwhile the high court in london will hear a claim brought by two sets of claimants arguing that the uk should remain in the european economic area after brexit the challenge is likely to be heard during the week after next no date has yet been confirmed for the supreme court s verdict on the article 50 challenge which the government is widely expected to lose the 11 justices will rule on whether ministers can use their powers under the royal prerogative to inform brussels officially that the uk intends to leave the eu or whether parliamentary sovereignty means that an act is required ministers are understood to be preparing legislation so that parliament can approve triggering brexit it is expected to pass despite europhile opposition in both houses the main claimant before the dublin courts will be jolyon maugham qc a london tax specialist who is coordinating efforts to argue that article 50 of the lisbon treaty which formally begins a country s exit from the eu can be reversed if a country changes its mind and decides not to leave maugham who has rights of audience in dublin said the uk must retain sovereignty over the shape of its future relationship with the eu if we change our minds we must be able to withdraw the notice without needing the consent of the other 27 member states i want to establish clarity for british voters and deliver sovereignty to the british parliament over the question of its future relationship with its biggest trading partner he said elected politicians may join him in the case as plaintiffs in the space of a few days his crowdfunding campaign raised 70 000 largely in donations of 50 or less british judges and claimants have so far been reluctant to refer questions about brexit to eu judges in luxembourg maugham s challenge nominally against the irish government will try to persuade irish judges to refer the question of article 50 s revocability to the european court of justice ecj if the ecj were to rule that article 50 is revocable it would enable the uk to reject the outcome of brexit negotiations should they not prove acceptable to parliament or voters and remain in the eu the high court case in london about staying in the european economic area was initiated by peter wilding and adrian yalland wilding runs the pro single market organisation british influence a group of four anonymous claimants a mix of overseas eu eea and uk nationals have joined the judicial review challenge claiming that separate parliamentary approval is needed to quit the eea article 127 of the eea agreement requires contracting parties which include the uk to give at least 12 months notice before leaving the claimants point out they say that implies a separate departure process from the one set out in article 50 of the eu treaty that has been disputed in the supreme court opponents of hard brexit hope to use defeat for the government in the supreme court as an opportunity to build momentum even if most accept that the invocation of article 50 is inevitable in the house of commons the labour party is confident of tabling a procedural amendment that might attach conditions such as an agreement for parliament to review whatever exit deal is achieved towards the end of the two year process the liberal democrats and scottish nationalist party are expected to attempt more radical amendments a labour source said its aim was to find something that would garner tory support and pass rather than making what it viewed as more symbolic gestures similar discussions are under way in the house of lords where cross benchers and pro european tories have held meetings in recent weeks to discuss whether they would seek amendments of their own these are complicated however by a concern among many peers that any unilateral action in the upper chamber would be branded anti democratic instead the hope is that pressure for another vote among mps before march 2019 will be irresistible particularly if the court has already ruled that they have a right to be consulted at the outset of the process given that the european parliament has demanded that it have a chance to review the deal in good time it would be very hard for the british government to argue that mps should have less say especially since this is all meant to be about returning sovereignty to westminster said hugo young a campaigner for greater transparency in the brexit process

not be the last but our values will prevail shinzo abe the japanese prime minister has offered his condolences a terrorist attack has occurred in the united kingdom i offer my deepest condolences to the victims and extend my sympathy to all those who were wounded terrorism is absolutely intolerable japan stands in solidarity with prime minister may of the united kingdom as well as with its people during this difficult time prime minister may has conveyed the message that the united kingdom is firm in the fight against terrorism japan offers its full support to prime minister may and will combat terrorism in cooperation with the international community the attack outside the houses of parliament in london is the latest in a series of terrorist atrocities involving a vehicle being driven at speed into pedestrians a tactic actively promoted by islamic state in december a man whose asylum claim had been rejected by germany drove a truck into a market in berlin killing 12 last july a stolen truck driven through a bastille day parade in nice killed 86 the strikes appear inspired if not actively commissioned by isis in iraq and syria in november a student used a vehicle and knives to injure 13 on a campus in ohio in the us his motives and allegiance are less clear such attacks are not unprecedented but have become much more numerous in recent years in 2014 the chief spokesman of the group mohammed al adnani issued a call for sympathisers in the west to strike unbelievers especially police officers or soldiers where they were rather than travel to the middle east to fight there if you are not able to find a bomb or a bullet then smash his head with a rock or slaughter him with a knife or run him over with your car or throw him down from a high place or choke him or poison him he said though al adnani who was killed in 2016 pointed a finger specifically at france where there were two vehicle attacks in 2014 he also cited the uk among preferred targets this section of the live blog was amended on 23 march 2017 to clarify a reference to the berlin truck attacker the brother of a british aid worker murdered by isis in syria has appealed for calm in the wake of the westminster attack press association reports david haines was beheaded in syria three years ago by the group after being held prisoner for 18 months his elder brother mike who works with groups to combat extremist indoctrination of young people in the uk said it was vital that communities remain calm and united regardless of the motive mike haines said my thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of the victims of this tragic attack in the heart of our nation s capital in the midst of the hurt and heartache that we are all feeling in this moment it is vital that we as a society remain calm and united no matter who or what was behind this attack terrorism in all its guises seeks to spread fear and divide us in confronting this evil we must stand shoulder to shoulder with confidence that we are all stronger when we stand together the reports of kindness and solidarity amongst those on the scene proves our togetherness whatever the motivations they will not succeed in sewing distrust amongst us i have seen first hand that we are stronger than that it is still early in london but pre dawn travellers are still being advised to avoid the westminster area bbc newsnight reported late on wednesday evening that the car used in the attack could have been rented in birmingham the guardian has not been able to verify this report west midlands police according to a statement cited by the telegraph the daily mail and others has said of the raid that saw a road in southwest birmingham closed for around two hours overnight there is an ongoing police operation no further details are being given at this stage wmp referred media enquiries to the metropolitan police in london which said it would not be commenting for operational reasons londoners have expressed defiance after the terrorist attack at westminster sharing messages of solidarity on social media wearenotafraid was trending in london as users reacted to the deaths of five people including the attacker on wednesday and expressed gratitude and support for the work of emergency services comedian and actor margaret cabourn smith characterised this tenor of the response tweeting wearenotafraid or rather i am but i m damned if i m going to let that stop me doing anything differently i m a bladdy londoner a police raid has taken place in the early hours of thursday morning in birmingham where hagley road in the southwest of the city was cordoned off for a while at this point it is not clear whether this is in any way related to the attack in london i ll have more details here if they emerge the lights of the landmark in paris were turned off at midnight as a mark of respect for the victims of wednesday s terror attack in westminster abc s leigh sales reports that the australian permanent resident caught up in the westminster attack is being treated for injuries sustained when the attacker s car ran over her foot she is originally from germany but now lives in south australia malcolm turnbull and australian labor leader bill shorten are offering condolences to the uk in the canberra parliament now with the british high commissioner menna rawlings looking on turnbull said as prime minister theresa may said earlier this morning the values of the british parliament command the admiration and respect of free people everywhere and so they do because they are our values too we stand all of us with the uk comforted that we share those values they are ours freedom of speech democracy the rule of law we will never give in to terror he said of british mp tobias ellwood who assisted attempts to resuscitate the police officer pc keith palmer who was fatally stabbed this act of heroism is just one of the extraordinary stories that are emerging from this tragedy shorten paid tribute to palmer the murder of the metropolitan police officer reminds us of the risks our security agencies take on our behalf to keep us safe and on behalf of all honourable members i want to acknowledge and thank our australian federal police and the parliamentary security officers for whom this news must strike a particular chord thanks to my colleague gabrielle chan on the australian

london are offering the woman assistance he said he added we stand in solidarity with the people of the united kingdom australian prime minister malcolm turnbull says the injured person lives in south australia thursday s guardian editorial calls for solidarity in the wake of the terror attack on westminster and pays tribute to the officers who intervened the security forces and police have planned for what they call a marauding attack for years the awful choreography of the response to terror was fast and well rehearsed the police officer who later died of his injuries stopped the attacker at the gates off parliament square before the man had gone a pace or two further he himself was shot by an armed officer these two courageous interventions almost certainly saved scores of lives in a busy area thronged with politicians visitors and some of the hundreds of staff who work in the palace there will be many questions to ask in the coming days about what was known of the attacker and his associates but for now there can only be a wholehearted appreciation of the professionalism with which the police did their job
2017-06-08,0,it may be premature but hoo boy that exit poll if accurate it suggests the uk is heading for a hung parliament there is still a long way to go yet but if accurate the snap election looked like it could have backfired spectacularly on theresa may which made people on twitter laugh quite a lot those who had decided to head to bed by now for an early start on friday morning were jolted awake by the shock result and the wheat field jokes just kept on rolling in george osborne seemed pleased some pundits were suggesting there could be another election on our horizon we are all so very very tired but perhaps no one would be more irritated than brenda from bristol
2017-03-22,0,eu chiefs have warned airlines including easyjet and ryanair that they will need to relocate their headquarters or sell off shares to european nationals if they want to continue flying routes within continental europe after brexit executives at major carriers have been reminded during recent private meetings with officials that to continue to operate on routes across the continent for instance from milan to paris they must have a significant base on eu territory and that a majority of their capital shares must be eu owned the development coming days before the triggering of article 50 potentially makes it more likely that the carriers will act to restructure with economic consequences for the uk including a loss of jobs the tough line from the eu may encourage the uk to reciprocate with its own nationality rules which would leave eu owned airlines facing equally difficult choices potentially dampening their investment in the uk in the short term although some may seek in time to establish their own british subsidiaries the ability of companies such as easyjet to operate on routes across the eu has been a major part of their business models and there may be a renewed willingness among airlines to invest outside the uk to maintain market share british airways does not fly intra europe but its parent company iag is likely to need to disinvest shareholders in order to be majority eu owned and allow its other eu registered carriers to continue to operate across europe an iag spokesman said we will continue to comply with the relevant ownership and control regulations some airlines have already started to seek alternative headquarters and to examine how they might ensure that their shareholding is majority eu owned possibly through the forced disinvesting of british shareholders but others have appeared until now to hold out hope that the european commission would be flexible on the rules in the current aviation agreement eu officials in the meetings were clear however about the rigidity of the rules amid concerns at a senior eu level that too many in the aviation industry are in denial about the consequences of the uk s decision to leave the bloc representatives from easyjet along with the british airways owner iag ryanair and the tui group whose portfolio of airlines includes thomson met the eu s brexit taskforce last week that followed a meeting the previous week between the taskforce and executives from air france klm finnair lufthansa and sas as part of the eu s efforts to engage with stakeholders thomas van der wijngaart an aviation expert at the legal firm clyde amp co told the guardian there could be significant economic consequences for the uk with airlines changing their financial and operating structures and building a stronger presence on the continent it might be that carriers choose to have domestic flights on the continent operated by their new european operating licence which would probably mean a reduction in staff in the uk he warned britain is a member of an aviation agreement based on 35 shared pieces of eu legislation a common regulator in the european aviation safety agency and a court acting as a referee on the shared rules the european court of justice ecj however asked during a select committee hearing last week whether the uk would continue to be part of the open skies agreement after brexit the secretary of state for exiting the eu david davis said not that agreement one would presume that would not apply to us does not say anything about whether there would be a successor the industry holds out hope that the uk and the eu will be able to seal an early deal during article 50 negotiations that ensures that damage to the industry is limited however a hurdle on progress on a new agreement is theresa may s intention to remove the uk from the ecj s jurisdiction which currently has the key role in adjudicating over conflicts between parties to the agreement a number of member states may also have interests in standing in the way of britain s attempts to strike a new deal spanish diplomats for example say they will not sign any international aviation agreement that recognises the airport on gibraltar the uk could react to the imposition of eu ownership rules on airlines by developing ownership rules of its own which could prevent carriers such as the ireland based ryanair from flying uk domestic routes as it does today easyjet is establishing an eu operating company on which an announcement is expected within weeks so that it can obtain an eu air operating certificate the company insists however it will continue to be headquartered in the uk it is currently 84 owned by eu nationals but this will drop to 49 after brexit provided the shares of founder stelios haji ioannou who has dual uk and cypriot nationality are classed as eu owned the financial times has reported that haji ioannou s shares are now classed as uk owned to meet the airline s own restrictions on ownership an easyjet spokesman said like other european airlines easyjet regularly engages with the uk and the eu on a wide range of issues which include the impact of brexit on aviation as this was a private meeting we would not comment further on what was discussed ryanair is headquartered in ireland and will not have to relocate but it has been reported that 60 of the dublin registered airline s capital shares are owned by eu nationals this will be reduced to 40 once uk shareholders are excluded making it vital to increase its eu ownership to comply with regulations a spokesman for the airline said the company would adapt however the airline s chief executive officer michael o leary has already warned of the huge dangers to the industry of a cliff edge brexit and criticised the mildly lunatic optimism of the british government a ryanair spokesman said while it appears that we are heading for a hard brexit there is still significant uncertainty in relation to what exactly this will entail this uncertainty will continue to represent a challenge for our business for the remainder of financial year 17 and financial year 18 a british government spokesperson said it will clearly be in the interests of both sides in the brexit negotiation to maintain closely integrated aviation markets the uk aviation industry is the largest in europe handling over 250m passengers and 2 3m tonnes of cargo last year benefiting both consumers and business in the eu and the uk we have engaged extensively with the aviation industry already and will continue to work closely with it to better understand the risks and opportunities ahead to ensure it continues to be a major success story for the british economy
2017-06-21,0,one year ago today we knew so little a yougov poll on referendum day last year predicted a 52 to 48 remain victory and even arch brexiter nigel farage for a moment lost his insufferably oleaginous smirk as he conceded that it looked like remain will edge it in the end leave won by 51 9 to 48 1 on a turnout of 71 8 with more than 30 million people voting and nigel farage got his unacceptable grin back what have we learned in the ensuing year cameron quit as pm the morning after the referendum when it became clear britain had voted to leave the eu and who can blame him his reassuringly expensive 25 000 shed has a wood burning stove dimmer switches sofa bed sheep s wool insulation and is painted in muted shades called clunch mouse s back and old white by contrast the eu negotiating team are semi housetrained polecats even now spitting in french about gnawing their opposite numbers genitals in some hellishly overheated conference room somewhere just awful like brussels probably the slogan on the leave battlebus claimed that brexit would yield 350m a week for the nhs shortly after the referendum one prominent leave campaigner iain duncan smith said i never said that during the course of the election the 350m was an extrapolation of the 19 1bn that is the total amount of money we gave across the european union what we actually said was a significant amount of it would go to the nhs not really leave campaign director matthew elliott tweeted during the referendum campaign let us give our nhs the 350m the eu takes each week and that was not true britain had negotiated a discount paying only 285m a week nor was it clear that all eu fees could be channelled straight into health services the leading claim of the leave campaign then was based on a false prospectus and may have led to the british people voting for something they might well have opposed if they had the facts just saying the eu negotiating team has put all our stuff on the lawn and is yelling from an upstairs window that we were never that good in bed anyway what is i faked all those orgasms in french or polish we had better find out because we are going to be hearing that a lot in the next few months as our menage with the eu comes to a bitter end according to the european commission s president jean claude juncker the exit bill for the uk will be at least 60bn 52 7bn while according to reports in the financial times eu negotiators have since upped the bill to 100bn to cover post brexit farm payments and payments and admin fees in 2019 and 2020 when if you will allow me some caps lock outrage we will not even be members of the eu any more how bitterly ironic did not we choose brexit in part so we did not have to subsidise economically unviable probably drunk off their asses french farmers and faceless brussels bureaucrats you know what we probably did in the spring the trade minister liam fox gave an indication of how britain would emerge post brexit stronger fairer more united and more outward looking nation when he visited the philippines to negotiate a trade deal with rodrigo duerte the filipino president duerte has publicly encouraged civilians to kill drug addicts and lives the career dream i ve been secretly nurturing since primary school namely that of becoming an international pariah at the same time theresa may was in saudi arabia as part of a wider government effort to shore up the uk s trading position after brexit and while there declined to condemn the saudi led bombing in yemen even though it is estimated to have killed more than 10 000 civilians and displaced more than 3 million people there is a real danger that in our desperation to conclude trade deals respect for human rights which is in every eu contract will just go out of the window said senior labour mp harriet harman yes but with respect harriet it is only remoaners like you who give a monkey s about foreigners human rights or lives when britain s trade deficit needs correcting not really yes she did say during the conservative party leadership campaign i was described by one of my colleagues as a bloody difficult woman and i said at the time the next person to find that out will be jean claude juncker but just as the first rule of fight club is that you do not talk about fight club the first rule of being difficult is not to go on about it just do it talking about it ain t gonna make it happen girlfriend remember when everyone s favourite music and movement interpreter of emily brontë s oeuvre kate bush announced that may is wonderful and the best thing that is happened to us in a long time this was during the heady hiatus before may s catastrophic election victory after which she was obliged to ritually crawl up the mall in leather trousers bloodying her hands and knees as passers by hissed who is strong and stable now eh to beg the queen to allow her to form the next government at least that is how i remember it by means of that hubristic electoral disaster may surrendered a parliamentary majority in favour of being obliged to suck up to a bunch of cheerless ulster homophobes no offence to keep her and her cold hearted good ideas free crew in office again no offence all the while proving herself with every breaking news story to be weak and unstable and temperamentally unfit to negotiate brexit how much side eye am i giving kate bush right now so much read michel barnier s following remarks in a sinister accent while stroking an imaginary cat if you like walking in the mountains you have to learn a certain number of rules he said shortly after may had returned from a walking tour of snowdonia to announce a stupid snap election you have to learn to put one foot in front of the other you also have to look at what accidents might befall you you have to have stamina because it could be a long route is it just me or did that sound like moriarty obliquely issuing a death threat to sherlock at the reichenbach falls is barnier planning to kill our prime minister with an ice pick as she trolls around the alps singing happy wanderer with her woody allen clone of a spouse because that is how it sounded to me how scary is the eu s chief negotiator in the olden days the sun would have mercilessly satirised his surname remember when they stuck it to a former eu commission president with their up yours delors splash but have they dared to call him barmy barnier in 72 point capitals no because he will probably put a hit out on them as well if they did he is just that intimidating slowly but surely english is losing its importance in europe said juncker during a speech in italy last month and he said the rest of his speech in french just to clinch the point indeed juncker can probably say i faked all those orgasms in each of the many eu languages what a guy sympathy for jean claude if juncker has any animus to this island nation it is in part because during the referendum campaign our tabloids reported the slur that his father was a nazi it was unjust and disgusting he told the ft just possibly britain is reaping what its post truth hatemongers sowed thanks for that tabloids this is the only good thing that has happened in politics in the past year lord it was hard to write that last sentence was not the happiest thing about may s first administration that she had been able to bin him off but months later he is back as environment secretary proving if nothing else that may cannot hold on to anything for long not a policy not a parliamentary majority not even a grudge just to review she ditched two manifesto pledges in the queen s speech legalising fox hunting and creating more grammar schools but brought her old enemy back into the cabinet what a dithering disappointment she is although i ll say this for her at least she is not gove was it just me who nearly lost their dinner watching footage of gove jogging down the street with a smug grin on his face when it was repeated on have i got news for you last friday of course it was not if may is toppled this summer either on a crevasse above klosters by some of barmy barnier s ski masked lackeys or more likely by the conservatives 1922 committee then amber rudd is tipped replace her even though the home secretary is about as fit for purpose as joey barton is for becoming a galáctico still at least she would be better than the evident clown that is boris johnson better britain is helmed by pm bad murder than this gaffe prone berk johnson lost his wedding ring within an hour of getting married inventor of quotations for which he was fired from the times witless calumniser of scousers witless calumniser of papua new guineans and most inept foreign secretary since lord halifax there is good news we never need use the phrase strewth paul nuttall is on the radio talking cobblers again thanks to ukip s dismal electoral performance plus farage his predecessor has realised his true vocation not making the post truth case for brexit but getting on his knees and smooching when in the vicinity of the 45th us president s probably unspeakable derriere he has called trump amazing and superb and claimed that the president had some good people behind him such as kellyanne conway you remember conway the aide who used the term alternative facts to justify colleague sean spicer s lies fine judge of character reflecting on her party s election loss of 21 westminster seats nicola sturgeon the snp leader looked pleasingly glum as she conceded that her plans for the world s worst neologism indyref2 were undoubtedly a factor in the disappointing results sturgeon had hoped for a second independence referendum in 2019 so scotland could elude the hard brexit she feared may s government would inflict like a sissy sneaky sassenach trick on her proud braveheart like people but when she makes a statement next tuesday on the question she is likely to step back from that fanciful timetable ever since the referendum result the pound has been buying fewer euros or dollars and currency experts believe its value will remain in the long term at least 10 below what it was this time last year which means apart from anything else and totally unacceptably i m paying more for my italian truffle oil than ever it is also why marmite costs more although given that marmite tastes like a sweaty crotch mixed with beef extract i can live with that one obvious corollary is that we must forget florida the côte d azur or umbria this summer and instead embrace the staycation rediscovering our churchillian bulldog spirit for fighting gulls for the last of our chips on windswept north wales beaches as unstoppable gales howl in from the irish sea a hard brexit would be likely to see the uk give up full access to the single market and the customs union with the bonus that we could submit european johnny foreigners to cavity searches at stansted before returning them on the next flight to düsseldorf by contrast soft brexit would entail us getting unlimited quilted toilet rolls and cute puppies in exchange for admitting more immigrants than you can shake a stick at only kidding soft brexit means we might follow a similar path to norway which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result which of these we get hard or soft is unclear but given that the eu negotiating team seems akin to a ruthless spirited and enviably united jamaican 4x100 relay team and their british counterparts resemble a fractious red faced bumbling pta tug of war team called into action after spending too much time in the school fete pimm s tent i would not be anticipating good news that said let me ask this you have read karl ove knausgård s unstoppably self indulgent multi volume memoirs does not that put you off aspiring to emulate norwegians me too may says she is committed to a frictionless seamless border between the republic of ireland and northern ireland this like other maybot tropes such as brexit means brexit or strong and stable or i m absolutely clear about this means less and less at the longer you think about it if there remain no passport checks at the irish border post brexit ireland could become a back door for eu immigrants wishing to come to the uk that would make a mockery of may s aim of getting immigration down to a sustainable level which she defines as being below 100 000 a year this is an aspiration she says she wants to fulfil since it is one lesson she took from the brexit vote if passport checks are instituted at the irish border that would serve to undermine the good friday agreement which ended the troubles almost 20 years ago since then the border has become marvellously invisible rather than dotted with nervous tooled up squaddies in watchtowers which was no way to carry on it is quite the jolly old pickle is not it there is an irish story that is useful here a driver asks a passerby how to get to dublin if i wished to go to dublin comes the reply i would not start from here
2017-03-29,0,like aeneas fleeing from troy on the shore of italy or cortés on the coast of mexico it was a moment for the burning of the boats on wednesday theresa may burned hers but they were our boats too that she burned britain s boats boats in which for half a century postwar britain has tried to reconcile its history and its future in europe and failed for good or ill on both sides of the channel britain will not be returning to the european union it does not get more serious than that for this country yet it ended as it began with more of a whimper than a bang as 1973 dawned the guardian reported that britain had embarked on its membership of europe without fireworks it was difficult to tell that anything of importance had occurred records the paper s front page and a date which will be entered in the history books as long as histories of britain are written was taken by most people as a matter of course forty four years later as britain began packing its bags to leave there was perhaps more excitement among the political and journalistic classes the most predictable front page of the year was the daily mail s single word headline on wednesday freedom but the guardian surely got the wider national mood more accurately britain steps into the unknown politically it was momentous a version of the same resistance to continental encroachment that fired henry viii s break with rome 500 years ago has triumphed again out in the country much as in 1973 or even 1534 people got on with life as usual if they were delighted or anxious they mostly did not show it there were no crowds in the streets this time and no celebrations or protests to speak of either people kept their feelings quiet trains ran the stock market was unmoved rain came in from the west as usual a million people went to the doctor nevertheless it was the most important and the most carefully choreographed day of theresa may s prime ministership and she did her best to rise to the occasion her speech to the commons was consensual and without a single triumphalist note only sir bill cash on the leave side and the snp s angus robertson on remain s managed to raise the emotional temperature in the chamber none of it affected the prime minister however in her letter to donald tusk there was a not so veiled threat to take uk defence and security commitments to europe off the table if the eu forces too hard a bargain on single market access if nothing else that was proof of how badly may wants a deal in her own prescribed timeframe of two years what a gambler the vicar s daughter has turned out to be but in the commons there was no thatcher style warrior talk about days of destiny or independence instead may s chosen tone was soothing and respectful both to the eu and to british voters who support it her audience was in the capitals of europe not the commons chamber she sought a deep and special partnership with europe her peroration contained the word together no fewer than six times at times it was hard to realise that britain is walking away so often did may praise the eu wish it well and invoke its values there was very practical domestic political reason for this emollience too despite her wish for the country to come together on the issue britain is still deeply divided over europe nine months ago 17 4 million britons voted to leave while 16 1 million voted to remain a yougov opinion poll this week suggested that views have not changed much neither side of the arguments regrets the stance it took last year remainers are beginning to accept that there is no way back but may unlike the newspapers that urge her forward and constantly try to make her into a second thatcher does not choose to grind the faces of the 48 who voted remain into the dust leaving the eu is this generation s chance to shape a brighter future for our country said may it offers a chance to step back and ask ourselves what kind of country we want to be that sounds very benign and consensual as it is supposed to until you realise that this generation is in fact not a fixed thing britain is divided not united across its generations including europe in the yougov poll this week 65 of young people aged 18 24 say it was wrong to vote leave against just 12 who think it was right at the other end of the age spectrum the over 65s say the opposite with 62 saying it was right to leave and 31 saying it was wrong so this is not really this generation s chance in fact it is the older generation s chance to break a relationship with europe that the younger generation wants to keep looking backwards has defeated looking forwards or has until the leave voters die out and perhaps leave the new majority more pro european at the end of her speech may invoked a misty eyed vision of a stronger fairer better britain a britain our children and grandchildren are proud to call home the problem though is that leaving the eu is not going to produce that kind of britain as the historian anthony barnett put it brexit is government of the old by the old for the old as she signed the letter triggering britain s exit from the eu on tuesday may had posed beneath a portrait of sir robert walpole often described as britain s first prime minister eurosceptics think highly of walpole because he prioritised getting extremely rich over european entanglements in one of his most quoted remarks walpole boasted to queen caroline in 1734 that there are fifty thousand men slain this year in europe and not one englishman what the eurosceptics always forget though is that walpole served a king george ii who was ruler not just of britain but of hanover and was therefore entangled in europe whether he wanted to be or not it was always thus for this island the guardian s striking front page showed the british jigsaw piece removed from the european whole but real countries do not move they stay where they are britain will be part of europe one way or another until the end of the world
2017-06-09,0,the british prime minister theresa may s gamble in calling an early election spectacularly failed on thursday night when she lost her majority in parliament and was forced to turn to a deal with a smaller party to stay in power may s attempt to forge a deal with northern ireland s democratic unionist party does not put brexit in doubt although negotiations due to start within days may now be even more complex and less predictable the prime minister went to see the queen on friday to confirm that she would form a government and that she was seeking a deal with the dup following extensive talks through the night with the unionists the largest northern irish party in favour of british rule in the country i will now form a government a government that can provide certainty and lead britain forward at this critical time for our country she said this government will guide the country through the crucial brexit talks that begin in just 10 days and deliver on the will of the british people by taking the united kingdom out of the european union she added we will continue to work with our friends and allies in the democratic unionist party in particular may had called the election which did not need to happen until 2020 at a time when she was riding high in the polls and had hoped to increase her small majority of 17 in order she said to strengthen her hand in the imminent brexit talks instead after a campaign in which she was criticised as dull and robotic and a major policy on social care had to be rewritten on the fly the prime minister lost 12 seats and her control of parliament although the tories remain the biggest party with 318 mps with 649 of 650 seats having declared meanwhile the leftwing opposition leader jeremy corbyn of the labour party who had been written off before the campaign as unelectable extreme and incompetent saw his personal ratings and those of his party rise and stunned pundits by gaining 31 seats giving labour a total of 261 mps labour defied the odds to win around 40 of the vote with the tories on 42 corbyn s aides said the jump in the party s share since previous leader ed miliband won 30 in 2015 was the largest between two general elections for any party since 1945 it was also higher than the 35 2 won by labour s tony blair in his third election victory in 2005 corbyn s achievement was credited to a unique alliance of enthused younger voters and previous non voters combined with some older anti establishment united kingdom independence party ukip voters hit by the tories austere economic policies turnout rose about two points from 2015 to 68 7 bernie sanders whose galvansing popularity amongst young progressives foreshadowed corbyn s surge said i am delighted to see labour do so well all over the world people are rising up against austerity and massive levels of income and wealth inequality people in the uk the us and elsewhere want governments that represent all the people not just the 1 i congratulate jeremy corbyn for running a very effective campaign a ferocious campaign from britain s rightwing tabloids culminating in the daily mail branding labour s leadership apologists for terror and the sun hitting out at jezza s corbyn s jihadi comrades appeared to have been largely ignored by the voters two major terrorist attacks during the campaign may have also damaged the tories more than labour in defiance of conventional wisdom i think it is pretty clear who won this election corbyn told the bbc we are ready to serve the people who have given their trust to us may whose self declared reputation as strong and stable may now be gone for good had sounded much less firm overnight if the conservative party has won the most seats and most votes then it will be incumbent that we will have that period of stability and that is what we will do she said after winning her own seat of maidenhead west of london nevertheless may s attempt at a deal with the dup appears to mean she can remain in office although she seems likely to have been seriously wounded by her strategic blunder in calling an election a second election is possible if the dup deal does not come together and a challenge to her leadership from within her own party cannot be ruled out arlene foster the leader of the dup confirmed talks about a deal with the conservatives would take place the union is our guiding star she said the prime minister has spoken with me this morning and we will enter discussions with the conservatives to explore how it may be possible to bring stability to our nation at this time of great challenge the shockwaves are only the latest reframing of the uk political landscape may took office last year after her predecessor david cameron resigned due to a strategic blunder of his own his decision to call a referendum on britain s membership in the european union britain s status within the eu had long split his party which was coming under serious pressure on the right from the fervently anti eu ukip and cameron who personally backed eu membership had hoped to cauterise the issue instead british voters surprised the world by voting for brexit cameron gambled lost may gambled lost tweeted sophia in t veld a member of the european parliament overnight tory party beginning to look like a casino it is unclear what exactly a new deal between the conservatives and the dup will mean for brexit the historically protestant dup backs british rule of the province and one of the party s key figures nigel dodds confirmed that its price for a deal with the tories included a promise that there would be no post brexit special status for northern ireland the dup fears that such special status a key demand of the northern irish nationalist party sinn féin which thinks the province should be part of the republic of ireland would decouple northern ireland from the rest of the uk the dup backed brexit last year but across northern ireland 56 voted to remain in the eu dodds said he was not thinking that the dup s 10 mps would take up cabinet positions in a formal coalition rather they would agree to support may in votes of confidence and support her budgets his party is fiercely opposed to corbyn viewing him as having a history of backing northern irish republicans and a united ireland senior conservatives said pro brexit mps were keen to see may remain in her post to press ahead with negotiating britain s exit from the european union formal talks must be completed by march 2019 guy verhofstadt the european parliament s brexit representative said the election outcome would make already complex negotiations even more complicated i hope the uk will soon have a stable government to start negotiations this is not only about the uk but also about the future of europe european capitals are thought to have hoped may would win a strong majority since her government would then feel confident enough to make concessions diplomats fear she will now run into difficulty with her own mps which will not be a recipe for good talks sterling tumbled as much as 2 5 percentage points on the result while the ftse share index opened higher the pound hit an eight week low against the dollar and its lowest levels in seven months versus the euro senior conservative sources said recriminations against may were already beginning within her own ranks among cabinet ministers with the brexit secretary david davis singled out by some of his colleagues for pressing her to gamble on the snap poll there are a lot of very very pissed off people in the cabinet and with him in particular said one may has cleaved close to donald trump since his victory in november and images of her holding his hand during a trip to the white house were mocked by her opponents and held up as evidence she was unable or unwilling to stand up to the unpopular american president there were calls during the campaign for a planned state visit by trump to be cancelled after he attacked the mayor of london over his response to last weekend s terrorist attack in london bridge taking a quote out of context but the tories seem keen to make sure the visit goes ahead and the relationship with the us remains as strong as possible as britain cuts its ties with the eu a free and independent britain is a blessing to the world and our relationship has never been stronger trump told may during that visit to washington but may herself has never looked weaker additional reporting by rajeev syal henry mcdonald heather stewart daniel boffey and jon henley
2017-03-12,0,ian mcewan has reportedly described the decision to hold a referendum on brexit as reminiscent of nazi germany and likened politicians and newspapers who attack judges scrutinising the process to robespierre during the terror of the french revolution the award winning author made the remarks during a visit to barcelona at the end of last week to promote his latest novel nutshell in comments reported by spanish newspapers and websites mcewan called brexit a real disaster questioned why it had been put to a referendum rather than parliament and lamented the toxic state of the debate in the uk since the vote last june sixteen million britons wanted to stay in the eu and 17 million wanted to leave but there exists a small and very energetic political group made up of opaque and impatient people who are driving the process and who speak as though half the country were the entire country he said according to el país it is also serious because great britain works on the basis of a parliamentary democracy and not through plebiscites which remind me of the third reich according to the newspaper he added that the politicians claiming to speak on behalf of the people tended to react violently to those who did not share their views their militant wing the tabloid press has started to look into the lives of the judges who rule that brexit could result in the loss of human rights to see whether they are homosexual or something it is reminiscent of robespierre and the terror of the french revolution the air in my country is very foul last november the high court upset the government s brexit plans by ruling that mps should have a vote on the formal process for beginning brexit three senior judges concluded that the government could not press ahead with triggering article 50 of the lisbon treaty without first consulting mps and peers in the commons and lords parts of the british press attacked the decision with the daily mail branding the judges enemies of the people in a front page headline and the daily telegraph headlining its report the judges versus the people the mail online went on to describe one of the judges sir terence etherton as an openly gay ex olympic fencer mcewan who has previously referred to the brexit vote as a plebiscite of dubious purpose and unacknowledged status also took the eu and the british government to task over their handling of the refugee crisis it is a really hard test for europe whose behaviour has not been exemplary we should accept more people he said according to el país england for example is only taking in 20 000 over five years and of course the eu should spend millions more euros to welcome them sustainably and integrate them the worrying thing is that the european far right is using it to fertilise a racist field that is already well fertilised however another newspaper el confidencial said he had praised the eu as a heroic project which with all its weaknesses and imperfections has allowed europe to live in peace for 60 years in a state of relative wellbeing the reports of mcewan s comments on brexit originally in english also varied with el mundo saying mcewan had criticised hasty decisions made through a plebiscite which remind me of the third reich while el confidencial reported him saying brexit has been a real disaster and i feel bad because we are a parliamentary democracy and i do not like these decisions adopted by plebiscite which remind me of the third reich writing in the guardian in july mcewan voiced disbelief at the brexit vote from our agriculture to our science and our universities from our law to our international relations to our commerce and trade and politics and who and what we are in the world all is up for a curious unequal renegotiation with our european neighbours he wrote and what was the nation s democratically tendered advice to our lawmakers that we are almost evenly split one third wants to leave fractionally less than a third wants to stay and a third does not know or does not care seventeen million against 16 million each full of contempt for the other and on this basis and unlike any other country in the world we are about to redraft our constitution and much else besides mcewan and his representatives have been asked for comment
2017-06-25,0,here are the main points from the question time leaders special i would do everything i can to ensure that any threat is actually dealt with earlier on by negotiations and by talks so that we do adhere to our obligations under the nuclear non proliferation treaty i think the idea of anyone ever using a nuclear weapon anywhere in the world is utterly appalling and terrible asked it he was saying he would never ever under any circumstances press the red button to launch a nuclear strike corbyn replied i think we have discussed this at some length about the aspirations we all have i do not want to be responsible for the destruction of millions of people neither do you therefore we have to work for a world where they are not available and not used after the programme boris johnson the foreign secretary said i thought it was really spine chilling to hear jeremy corbyn announce that all labour s support for our nuclear deterrent all labour s support for our armed forces was completely meaningless because when it came to the business of defending this country he would not do it in this job i do what i believe is the best for britain i could have stayed on doing that job for another couple of years and not called an election i had the balls to call an election my wage slips from 2009 reflect exactly what i m earning today how can that be fair in the light of the job that we do and a male nurse said i ve had a real terms decrease of 14 since 2010 so do not tell us we are getting a pay rise may replied i recognise the job that you do but we have had to take some hard choices across the public sector in relation to public sector pay restraint we did that because of the decisions we had to take to bring public spending under control because it was not under control under the last labour government and i m being honest with you in terms of saying that we will put more money into the nhs but there is not a magic money tree that we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want abbott wants to wipe the records of criminals and terrorists from the dna database that would mean that we could catch fewer criminals and fewer terrorists abbott used twitter to say may was wrong and abbott retweeted this i have not signed it because i actually have spoken to donald trump and told him that the uk believes in the paris agreement and that we did not want the united states to leave the paris agreement we have a situation at the moment where if jeremy corbyn was to get into no 10 he would be being propped up by the liberal democrats and the scottish nationalists you would have diane abbott who cannot add up sitting around the cabinet table john mcdonnell who is a marxist nicola sturgeon who wants to break our country up and tim farron who wants to take us back into the eu the direct opposite of what the british people want the nhs is an absolute shambles for mental health at the moment i have suffered so much over that year in part because of the work capability assessment let me tell you i am partially sighted i have mental health problems and other issues i went into my assessment and i was asked in detail about suicide attempts and i came out crying because i was so upset because of the way i was treated by that nurse and she came out after me because she had forgotten to measure my eyesight she found time to insult me by asking for all these upsetting details may replied i m not going to make any excuses for the experience you had that is why i think it is so important that we do deal with mental health she also said she wanted to take action to improve work capability assessments there is no place for antisemitism anywhere in our society and certainly not in our party members have been suspended if they have committed any remarks seen to be of an antisemitic nature we have a process that is independent of me within the party which investigates these and makes a decision on it livingstone has been suspended and further investigations may or may not happen after the election he is suspended from membership but he is suspended so that investigation can take place i do not approve of any terrorism of any sort any terrorist act of any sort it only divides communities and kills people i m very sorry this is not a debate this is a series of questions i think it is a shame the prime minister has not taken part in a debate and here is our main story that is all from me good night the audience member who challenged theresa may over her record of broken promises and backtracking during the bbc question time leaders special is chairman of ukip s youth wing at york university the press association reports in a fiery opening exchange abigail eatock told may that she had u turned on her decision not to call an election and on her social care plans and she accused her of ducking debates with labour leader jeremy corbyn who was appearing separately on the programme after the pm refused to go head to head with her rival soon after the back and forth a ukip source confirmed that eatock was the chairman of young independence the party s youth wing at york university where the bbc1 event was being held the times matt chorley has posted this excerpt from a diane abbott interview with andrew marr showing that contrary to what theresa may said abbott does not favour taking the dna of criminals off the dna database on newsnight emily maitlis has just said that theresa may did not use the phrase strong and stable once tonight why not she asked boris johnson the foreign secretary johnson said that may emanated both virtues and here is the official conservative reaction to the question time leaders special it is a statement from patrick mcloughlin the conservative chairman tonight was a clear demonstration of the choice at this election the prime minister showed voters that she has a plan for brexit is in command of her brief and was unafraid to take on the difficult issues jeremy corbyn wilted under pressure he waffled on and on in meaningless soundbites without offering anything of substance it is obvious that corbyn could not secure the good brexit deal that is vital to protect our economy meaning fewer jobs and more debt the only way to get a brighter future for our country is to vote for theresa may on 8 june here is the labour party s official reaction to the question time leaders special it is from a jeremy corbyn spokesperson the question time leaders special showed there is a very clear choice at this election but again the british public were denied the opportunity to see a debate between the only two people who could be prime minister next week jeremy outlined labour s plans to transform britain for the many not the few with a labour government students will not be saddled with tuition fee debt pensioners incomes will be guaranteed by the triple lock and winter fuel allowance and 95 of taxpayers will not pay any more tax theresa may could not defend her record and floundered on the lack of costings in her manifesto what the cap on social care will be and where the money will come from to fund our nhs the prime minister will not even debate in an election she called how on earth can she be trusted to negotiate the best brexit deal for the british people she repeatedly said she was not going to call an election but now she has she does not seem to want to take part in it the verdict from the twitter commentariat panel is finished it is at 9 41pm but you may need to refresh the page to get the whole thing to appear because i ve been updating it generally the view seems to be that jeremy corbyn came over as warmer and more relaxed apart from when he was challenged over whether or not he would be willing to press the nuclear button when his implied unilateralism he came closer than he has done recently to saying no without being explicit and his evasiveness clearly infuriated a section of the audience theresa may was generally robust and marginally more animated than when she appeared on the sky news channel 4 programme on monday but she faced a barrage of hostile and pertinent questions and with many of them her answers were uninspiring or even sometime unsympathetic for example by now she should have developed a better answer on why nurses have not had a proper pay rise and sometimes need to use food banks journalists are always on the look out for the killer blow at events like this but they are as rare as a unicorn and there certainly was not one tonight for my money corbyn had the better night assuming people care more about public services than the nuclear deterrent and if the programme attracted people who have not noticed how much he has improved in recent weeks they will have been impressed may was solid and it is customary for pms on programmes like this to face hostile questions about public services may put up with this with good grace but said little to enthuse wavering voters this is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the question time leaders s special on twitter from the bbc s nick robinson from the sunday times tim shipman from the guardian s matthew d ancona from the daily mirror s jason beattie from the bbc s laura kuennsberg from the daily mirror s jack blanchard from the new statesman s stephen bush from itv s carl dinnen from the spectator s james forsyth from the guardian s paul johnson from sky s beth rigby from the guardian s dan sabbagh from huffpost s paul waugh from the guardian columnist paul mason from the daily mirror s kevin maguire from business insider s adam bienkov from the observer s sonia sodha q why will you spend so much on scrapping tuition fees when there are other things to spend money on dimbleby says it will cost 11bn a quarter of all labour s extra spending corbyn says he had the offer of free tuition he did not take it up but he says in other parts of the world free tuition is normal and that is it verdicts a summary and reaction coming up soon q a few months ago you said you would have a strategic defence review if you won the election why do we need one corbyn

2017-05-27,0,the uk s full participation in european union security and intelligence co operation will be critical to the fight against terrorism after brexit leading british security experts have said as theresa may announced wide ranging new plans to counter extremism the growing demands for the prime minister to face down anti eu forces in the tory party and make membership of bodies such as europol the eu s criminal intelligence agency a top priority came amid fears that brexit could leave the uk with inferior access to key european databases and deprive british police forces of vital tools in high level pan european anti terror probes the calls from senior figures including sir hugh orde former chief constable of the police service of northern ireland and former head of europol max peter ratzel were reinforced on saturday night by dominic grieve the tory chair of the commons intelligence and security committee grieve said full participation even if it meant accepting eu rules and judicial oversight for the european court of justice ecj could not be more crucial he said he believed may was committed to remaining closely involved in eu security but believed that doing so would require compromise that would be hard for some in may s party to accept although our partnership with the us for intelligence sharing is extremely important the fact is that the current terrorist threat is very much a european dimension issue the schengen database and knowing about who has moved where are all intimately dependent on european systems and we have got to try to remain in them he said i think it is going to be very difficult and the government and parliament will have to face up to the fact that it might turn out during the brexit negotiation that some sort of mechanism for the european court is going to be necessary he added after the manchester attack which killed 22 people and left dozens of others grievously injured it was revealed that suicide bomber salman abedi had travelled back to england from libya via turkey and dusseldorf four days before the attack the bomb contained the same kind of explosives as those used in the paris and brussels attacks in 2015 and 2016 prompting speculation that abedi was linked to terror cells on the european mainland uk counter terrorism officials investigating the abedi network are working with europol with separate bilateral inquiries ongoing with german and belgian intelligence agencies orde told the observer that uk membership of eu bodies such as europol and eurojust which brokers judicial co operation in criminal cases not only allowed access to huge amounts of vital data but also meant uk police could set up joint inquiries with german police or those from other national forces without delay european arrest warrants were also essential he said if we do not have all this it makes it a lot more difficult to do this crucial work it it vital that we get to a situation as close to what we have as members of the eu as possible though it is difficult to see how we do that as members of europol and eurojust states are subject to eu rules on data transfers and procedures and ecj jurisdiction in any disputes or appeals over use of tools such as arrest warrants ratzel who led the pan eu crime fighting agency until 2009 warned that britain must accept some of the rulings of the ecj as part of any deal something may has previously ruled out my expectation is that once you have an important role to play you have to be under the european court of justice cherry picking cannot work you have to obey the rules of the club i am personally sure that the europeans will never accept britain having a role in europol without being under the rule of the european court of justice as anti terror policies of the rival parties were placed centre stage in the election campaign may declared on saturday night that more needed to be done she added we need to be stronger and more resolute in standing up to these people spelling out details of a new commission for countering extremism announced in the tory manifesto she said government had to widen its role and approach there is clearly a role for government in tackling extremism where it involves behaviour that is or ought to be criminal but there is also a role for government to help people and build up organisations in society to promote and defend britain s pluralistic values and stand up to the extremists may s initiative came as labour also attempts to boost its security credentials by pledging to appoint 1 000 more intelligence staff jeremy corbyn has already said he would appoint an extra 10 000 police 3 000 firefighters and 3 000 prison officers suggesting that public spending cuts had put people in danger corbyn said that ensuring the safety of communities demands properly resourced action across many fronts it means upholding and enforcing our individual rights promoting community relations supporting our emergency services tackling and preventing crime and protecting us from danger including threats of terror and violence he said the manchester bombing was the worst terror attack to hit britain since the 7 july attacks in london in 2005 a street in manchester s moss side was evacuated by counter terrorism officers and controlled explosives were used in a raid on a property in cheetham hill two men aged 20 and 22 were arrested in the early hours of saturday morning at the cheetham hill address police said neighbours identified yahya and mohamed werfalli as two of the occupants of the raided house they were said to be of libyan descent and part of the same friendship groups as the manchester bomber
2017-05-07,0,the biggest donor to the brexit campaign has called on theresa may to unilaterally guarantee the rights of millions of eu nationals already in britain peter hargreaves the billionaire who donated 3 2m to the leave eu campaign said that the prime minister should reassure the three million eu nationals already in the uk that their current rights would be maintained hargreaves who is now retired after founding the hargreaves lansdown financial services company said he understood the reluctance to guarantee the rights of eu nationals before the delicate negotiations over brexit however he said may should simply make the gesture and not wait until brussels agreed to do the same for uk nationals living in eu states people who are doing great jobs in this country are feeling insecure and i think it would be really good for those people to have the comfort that we are not going to boot them out in 18 months time he told the observer i just think we should make the gesture full stop i do not think there should be a quid pro quo i just think we should make the gesture they would look pretty churlish if they did not reciprocate by guaranteeing the status of uk nationals in the eu his intervention comes after a week in which brussels officials expressed concern over reaching a deal on the status of eu nationals in the uk brussels is insisting that they are allowed to keep all their rights including access to healthcare and the right to bring a spouse to the uk it coincides with concern among some senior brexit backers over may s approach to immigration after brexit simon wolfson the tory peer and next boss who donated 50 000 to vote leave warned that may must not send the signal that britain will pull up the drawbridge after brexit meanwhile paul marshall the hedge fund manager who gave 100 000 to vote leave urged may to remove foreign students from official immigration figures she has refused to back the idea despite pleas from conservative mps and universities hargreaves said he was happy to see eu nationals already here maintain their current rights most of those are in work and adding to our economy he said we are going to be very selective about who we let in in the future but i think there should have been that comfort given because they came under different circumstances wolfson told the recent prosperity uk conference on brexit that foreign workers needed to be seen as an asset to our economy he criticised any attempt to impose arbitrary numbers on the number of migrants the uk should accept each year may has suggested she still wants a reduction of net migration to the tens of thousands wolfson said while it is important and essential that britain controls who comes into this country and it is important that we have the services and infrastructure to deal with an increase in numbers it is vital that we do not pull up the drawbridge we are in a period of record immigration and we have the lowest levels of unemployment on record since the war if we are too draconian on immigration it will have two adverse effects on our economy the first is it will undermine all of our quality of life and undermine growth and the second is it will send the worst of all possible signals to the rest of the world the most important thing to come out of brexit is sending a very clear message to the rest of the world that britain is an open country a free trading country one that embraces the rest of the world and does not reject it marshall said that the government should stop counting foreign students in migration figures arguing that universities must lie at the heart of any strategy for creating a prosperous post brexit economy it is essential that we continue to encourage the free flow of international students and research and it is a no brainer to take students out of the migration numbers he said polling of brexit voters even shows strong support for this change people in the north and midlands fully understand the logic of supporting the university sector they are simply not worried about student migration
2017-01-16,0,the chairman of a commons committee has described donald trump s warning that the us might abandon nato as radical and reckless saying europe would be vulnerable without american military protection julian lewis who chairs the defence select committee expressed the hope that the president elect did not mean what he has said and that his rhetoric was just a negotiating ploy to force european countries to increase defence spending in a lecture at westminster on monday evening the conservative mp said it is as true today as it was when nato was founded in 1949 that the only reliable deterrent to conventional war on the continent is the message broadcast loud and clear that an attack on any nato state means war with america right from the outset lewis was speaking after trump created alarm in european capitals by describing nato as obsolete in an interview published by the times on monday last summer trump also said he would not feel bound by nato s collective doctrine in which an attack on any one of the 28 member countries would be regarded as an attack on all responding lewis said and why is mr trump considering such a radical and reckless move it is because the european nato states especially those which call most stridently for an eu defence identity are investing nowhere near as much in their own armed forces in gdp percentage terms as either our principal ally in washington dc or our principal adversary in moscow the mp who was speaking in a personal capacity and not in his role as the committee chairman said that european countries without the us could deter nuclear blackmail from russia because both the uk and france had nuclear weapons but not an attack by russian conventional forces it is no answer to assert that europe will need to mount its own defence if donald trump s america turns its back on nato if america turns away europe will have little chance of deterring anything other than a nuclear threat from russia lewis said trump s intentions towards nato and russia are hard to gauge given the ambiguity and contradictions in his positions in contrast with the president elect s hints of a rapprochement with russia his pick as next defence secretary general james mad dog mattis has long been a vocal critic of russia and a firm supporter of nato in the same interview in which he called nato obsolete trump described theorganisation as important and called on members to increased their defence budgets lewis is as much in the dark about trump s intentions as just about everyone else but he hopes that trump is bluffing the incoming us president prides himself on being a shrewd negotiator and also the political heir to ronald reagan those of us who remember president reagan with admiration and respect need no reminding of his commitment to the north atlantic alliance and his appreciation of the central role of nato in preventing the third world war given lewis s remarks it seems highly probable the defence committee will hold an inquiry into the us role in europe the german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said trump s criticism of nato had caused great concern i ve spoken today not only with eu foreign ministers but nato foreign ministers as well and can report that the signals are that there is been no easing of tensions he said in response to the us president elect s comments on nato and the strength of the eu the german chancellor angela merkel said we europeans have our fate in our own hands but moscow welcomed trump s vision of an obsolete nato since nato is tailored toward confrontation all its structures are dedicated to the ideals of confrontation you cannot really call it a modern organisation meeting the ideas of stability steady growth and security said dmitry peskov spokesman for the russian president vladimir putin lewis also dismissed the idea of david cameron becoming nato secretary general arguing that he was unsuitable for the role at the end of last year there was media speculation cameron might be a candidate to replace jens stoltenberg when he stands down next year or the year after david cameron is a man of charm and ability he deserves to find a role commensurate with his talents and i am sure that he will said lewis who often found himself at odds with the former prime minister including when he opposed uk intervention in libya but those talents do not include wisely judging strategic issues whether when toppling arab dictators in place like libya increasing military commitments whilst cutting the armed forces predicting a third world war in consequence of brexit or dangerously delaying the renewal of trident for the sake of coalition politics as he did
2017-03-20,0,theresa may has insisted donald trump was simply being a gentleman when he grasped her hand during a visit to the us creating an image that caused widespread embarrassment the prime minister has used an interview with american vogue to praise the meeting with the president who she said had achieved a stunning election victory given his lack of experience in politics i like to think we got on she said adding that she would not reveal the details of private conversations with trump including whether she criticised his previous controversial comments about women all i would say is i ve been very clear i m not afraid to raise issues and the nature of the relationship is such that we should be able to be frank and open with each other her vogue interviewer gaby wood said may laughed when she raised the issue of the hand holding i think he was actually being a gentleman we were about to walk down a ramp and he said it might be a bit awkward she said may also talked about her relationship with her husband philip in which she cooked and he loaded the dishwasher asked what the pair argued about the prime minister responded do you know i think we argue about the same things that most people argue about like who has the remote and what we are watching tonight his history programme no ncis pushed on the regular comparisons made between herself and the conservative s only other female leader she said there can only ever be one margaret thatcher i m theresa may i do things my way wood also described may s vivienne westwood tartan trouser suit worn during her leadership bid in june and at her lancaster house speech setting out the plan for brexit people have described it as a lucky suit i think i m going to stop wearing it now may said on politics the prime minister laid out what she believed in i suppose if i could sum it up in opportunity freedom security she said stressing that protecting the fundamental freedoms that we have remained a crucial part of her counter extremism strategy because if you lose your freedoms then actually the terrorists have started to win she also described what she believed to be the key difference between the conservatives and the labour i think the labour party believes in pulling people down to a level we believe in helping people to rise up to improve their lives and the lives of their children may admitted that being an only child may have meant she was exposed to more adult thinking because the conversation around the breakfast table is more about current affairs and cricket she told wood she decided she wanted to become a member of parliament at 12 and volunteered for the local conservatives stuffing envelopes the interviewer said may was most relaxed when meeting schoolchildren who asked her a series of questions including if you had a superpower what would it be i think i d want to make sure everyone in the world had access to clean water and sufficient food so we did not see people starving said may offering girls who wanted to be prime minister the advice be yourself and if you have any setbacks do not ever think it is because you are a girl the prime minister was also asked how much money do you get paid i get paid two salaries i get paid as a member of parliament and i also get paid as prime minister and if you add those two up i suppose it is public knowledge that it is 142 000 may also addressed the controversial issue of trousergate in which her choice of brown leather trousers worth 1 000 for an interview caused a backlash asked if she was surprised may said look throughout my political career people have commented on what i wear that is just something that happens and you accept that but it does not stop me from going out and enjoying fashion and i also think it is important to be able to show that a woman can do a job like this and still be interested in clothes the fashion has clearly been chosen strategically possibly in response the furore over the 995 leather trousers may wore for a sunday times shoot in december wood who wrote the vogue feature describes the prime minister s style as decidedly no drama the navy dress and coat worn in one picture are from lk bennett a favourite high street haunt of the duchess of cambridge this is an approximation of clothes she is regularly seen in and is there to communicate that may is a woman of the people but the shoot is also clearly something of a personal coup for a woman who said her luxury on desert island discs would be a lifetime subscription to vogue who wears designers including vivienne westwood and amanda wakeley those leather trousers and has had entire articles devoted to her interest in shoes there are then signposts to show off may s fashion credentials to vogue s fashionable readers lk bennett is as those familiar with her style would know where may s leopard print kitten heels come from her red coat and sweater are from egg a cult store in london s belgravia in the sofa image her jacket is propped on her shoulders a style called shoulder robing often seen on street style stars outside of fashion shows wood talks to may about everything from the mays tv choices to feminism and the impact of brexit but this being vogue fashion is also on the list of subjects may is revealed to have no style advisers and to shop at a store in henley near her home she also takes the opportunity to make a political point i also think it is important to be able to show that a woman can do a job like this and still be interested in clothes she says the message here is that may takes fashion and vogue seriously expect to see her indulging in a half tuck 2017 s answer to shoulder robing any day now lauren cochrane
2017-01-24,0,david davis is likely to introduce a straightforward brexit bill on thursday two days after a significant ruling by the supreme court sources have suggested the secretary of state for exiting the eu said he would respond quickly to judges demands to give mps and peers a vote in parliament but warned that the point of no return for brexit had already been passed this does not change the fact that the uk will be leaving the european union he said the government is hoping to publish the bill on thursday but there is a possibility it could slip beyond that davis said the legislation would be narrow focusing only on the question of triggering article 50 and warned that it must not be used as a vehicle for attempts to thwart the will of the people or frustrate or delay the process of our exit from the european union this will be the most straightforward bill possible to give effect to the decision of the people and respect the supreme court s judgment he added stressing that it was not about whether the uk would leave the eu because that had been decided by the june referendum davis said government lawyers were scrutinising the long judgment but made clear that he remained confident article 50 would be triggered by the deadline at the end of march this timetable has already been supported by this house he said saying the legislation would be separate to the great repeal bill davis was urged by brexiters in parliament to issue the legislation quickly and keep it short but was also pressured by opposition figures and mps on his own side to publish the government s brexit plan as a white paper in order to allow further scrutiny ministers have claimed may s brexit speech at lancaster house was an adequate plan the shadow brexit secretary keir starmer said labour accepts and respects the referendum result and will not frustrate the process but we will be seeking to lay amendments to ensure proper scrutiny and accountability throughout the process that starts with a white paper or plan a speech is not a white paper or plan and we need something to hold the government to account throughout the process you cannot have a speech as the only basis for accountability for two years or more starmer was backed on the issue by labour s hilary benn who chairs parliament s brexit committee and a series of conservative backbenchers including ben howlett who said i believe that the government should publish a white paper in order to enable my constituents to have their views heard another tory mp anna soubry said mps should be able to discuss not just the triggering of article 50 but also the decisions to abandon the single market and free movement without debate or a vote what has my honourable friend got to lose with a debate on a white paper she asked davis who had described may s speech on brexit last week as the clearest exposition of a negotiating strategy i have seen in modern times said the prime minister s address was sufficient explanation i m afraid it is very difficult to see how you can leave the european union and still stay inside the single market with all the commitments that go with that said davis julian lewis the conservative mp for new forest east questioned the motives of those pursuing a soft brexit saying they wanted to leave the eu but remain a member in all but name the former cabinet minister iain duncan smith said the fact that it was a split judgment showed it was right for the government to take the case to the supreme court but pushed for no further delays may i urge davis when he brings this in front of us to keep it short to keep it simple and most of all to keep it swift he said aside from demands for a white paper there were also calls for the final vote on the brexit deal to be meaningful the green party co leader caroline lucas asked that the bill be early enough in the process to allow time for a renegotiation if mps and peers rejected it rather than crashing out of the eu without a deal the snp s brexit spokesman stephen gethins asked why the government feared parliamentary scrutiny he said the tories had only one mp in scotland and asked davis to seek consent from the scottish parliament before legislating on areas over which it has responsibility davis argued that despite the court s decision that the government need not obtain approval from the devolved administrations he would consult key figures in scotland wales and northern ireland davis also made clear that the government supported the right of the judges to come to their conclusion after the daily mail argued yet again the elite show their contempt for brexit voters we believe in and value the independence of our judiciary the foundation upon which the rule of law was built he told colleagues that followed a statement from the justice secretary liz truss who faced criticism for not defending the appeal court justices denounced by sections of the media as enemies of the people after they ruled against the government truss said our independent judiciary is the cornerstone of the rule of law and is vital to our constitution and our freedoms the reputation of our judiciary is unrivalled the world over and our supreme court justices are people of integrity and impartiality the shadow attorney general shami chakrabarti argued that it was not enough and that the prime minister should also speak out we have to be absolutely clear the courts have done their job she said they have not made a political judgment but just upheld a principle of parliamentary sovereignty which the brexit supporters said their campaign was all about the three judges in the high court were vilified and put at personal risk and that is unacceptable we need more than a statement from liz truss which is too little too late we need something from mrs may the eagerly awaited ruling routes the protracted brexit process through parliament handing over to mps and peers the authority to sanction the uk s withdrawal the decision sets clear limits on the extent of the government s executive powers rights embedded in the law by the 1972 european communities act which took the uk into what was then the european community cannot be removed by the government s prerogative powers a majority of the justices declared the supreme court made clear that it was up to parliament to decide what form the legislation would take and a very brief statute would not undermine its momentous significance
2017-06-23,0,representatives of eu citizens in britain have branded theresa may s offer to guarantee their rights to remain in the country after brexit pathetic and anything but fair and serious a group representing britons in europe as well as eu citizens in the uk will meet officials in the department for exiting the european union on friday morning to tell them of their anger with the prime minister s spin on the issue when she spoke at a dinner in brussels may made what she described as a fair and generous offer after a meal at the european council summit on thursday but it was met with fury by eu citizens who say it increases rather than eases anxiety particularly because they claim it is cast in the language of immigration law rather than existing eu law they say the offer is also damaging for britons in europe to whom a fortnight ago the eu offered a lifetime guarantee of all their current rights something that the british team in brussels failed to acknowledge on thursday night instead talking of how the uk s offer was only on the table if it was reciprocated by the eu there is something slightly pathetic about the prime minister s proposal which makes no reference to the detailed comprehensive offer tabled by the eu the prime minister described her proposal as fair and serious it is neither fair nor serious said nicolas hatton the founder of the grassroots group the3million which has been campaigning for the rights of those settled in the uk since the referendum last year sue wilson a briton who lives in spain and who chairs the bremain in spain group said one of the main concerns was that the uk s offer did not accept a role for the european court of justice the ultimate legal arbiter of all legal disputes relating to the eu including breaches of eu citizens rights across europe it will remain the arbiter until britain leaves the eu but downing street does not accept it has a role in legacy issues after brexit theresa may is acting as though she is making the first move and we should all be impressed and grateful at her generosity the offer already made by the eu was far more generous for both eu and uk citizens living abroad said wilson while we agree with angela merkel that this is a reasonable first step may is going to have to compromise she is not in the driving seat and we are sick and tired of being used as bargaining chips britons in france also expressed their fears on friday that may s opening move could damage their position in europe we find it bizarre that she expects the eu to reciprocate to her offer which falls short of their own does she expect the eu to water down its offer to match hers said dave spokes a spokesman for the group expat citizen rights in eu spokes added this is not a negotiation to get the lowest possible price it is or should be a negotiation to gain the best support for real people a country s citizens we are not surprised that mr juncker has described theresa may s offer on citizens rights as not sufficient this reflects our own assessment it seems a very odd strategy for the uk to offer less support for citizens than that being offered by the eu should they not be encouraging the eu to give more there was also concern that the british offer referred to building up rights and deals for those living in the country for five years whereas under eu law citizens start to acquire those rights after just three months in another eu country we are all eu citizens with associated rights acquired through eu membership these rights cannot be removed retrospectively wilson said the eu s offer was handed to may on 12 june after consultation with groups representing britons in about a dozen countries but it got little attention and was not publicised by westminster which was reeling from the surprise election result and then the grenfell tower disaster jane golding a british lawyer living in berlin who was involved in the consultations with the eu said eu citizens were not being treated the same as the british in europe at this stage i think the british offer raises more questions than it answers there are some broad lines of the offer set out but whether the status quo and the full bundle of rights that eu citizens in the uk currently have will be safeguarded is not clear from this statement so without answers to those questions we simply do not know yet whether the pm is offering certainty to eu citizens she said one of the main concerns of the3million is that the offer fails to mention the indivisible rights that eu citizens currently enjoy that no country can remove including the right to live work own a business and bring family into the uk nor does it mention the fact that eu freedom of movement rights start to be acquired after three months this in effect means a cut off date of 29 december 2018 three months before the scheduled departure from the eu allowing britons and other eu citizens to continue to migrate within europe until then without having their future rights threatened may s offer refers to an undated cut off point falling anywhere between the day article 50 was invoked 29 march 2017 and brexit day 29 march 2019 in a statement it said the3million finds this proposal unacceptable and calls on the government to revisit its approach and start constructive talks with the eu based on the balanced proposal published by the eu in its negotiating directives last night hatton revealed that david davis the brexit secretary had refused to meet representatives of eu citizens he described the decision as insulting since they had previously had talks with the eu s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier he described the prime minister s offer as the lowest possible position to enter talks it is disgusting they do not want to engage with eu citizens it is like one big game to them but these are people s lives hatton said barnier and the eu they also play political games and like good pr but they have listened to us and redrafted their proposal after they sent it round to the eu27 because of the feedback they got the uk seems to be stuck in this home office policy of creating a hostile environment

photographed sitting opposite trump and alongside his daughter ivanka her husband and senior white house adviser jared kushner and the florida governor rick scott at the president s luxury hotel in washington dc posting the photograph on twitter farage wrote dinner with the donald however onlookers revealed that a place had only been made for him at the table at short notice no 10 was quick to play down the significance of the trump meeting and subsequent dinner at the trump international hotel in washington dc saying that they did not believe the us president would be misled into thinking he was being briefed by farage on official government policy we have an excellent ambassador who has and does meet the administration including president trump a spokesman said we have formal well established processes for communicating with the us administration and those are the ones we use they know we communicate through the existing channels i m 100 certain they are aware of that journalist benny johnson who said the secret service swarmed the place before trump s arrival had been keeping tabs on the group at the trump international hotel johnson the creative director of online news outlet independent journal review wrote on twitter farage was not invited to this dinner squeezed in at last minute in a blog detailing all the events of the evening the journalist said restaurant staff were given word just before trump arrived that an extra place needed to be added to the table farage was seen greeting trump in the lobby who pointed up to his table and appeared to invite him for dinner farage was later found wandering the lobby of the hotel with a large glass of red wine johnson said his teeth are wine stained and the british politician is happily swaying and speaking with anyone who approaches him when he asked what it was like to have the president invite you to dinner he writes that farage told him well it is really quite wonderful but as i ve gotten to know donald it really just does not surprise me you know what amazes me about your president he is a regular bloke truly just a normal chap upstairs at dinner he spoke to the table like any regular guy out to dine with friends and family there is no pretension at all johnson pressed farage for further details on what the president spoke about while eating but he just laughed and said it was nothing that interesting with a smirk and a wink earlier in the day farage had backed trump s treatment of the mainstream media heaping praise on his political ally in a television interview he told fox news they the media are simply not prepared to accept that brexit happened that trump happened they kind of want to turn the clock back and what they do not realise is they are losing viewers they are losing listeners they are losing this battle big time and i m pleased the president is not afraid to stand up to them speaking at the conservative political action conference cpac in washington on friday farage said the brexit vote and trump s election had launched a great global revolution he added and it is not going to stop it is one that is going to roll out across the rest of the great world farage said he was proud to have supported trump in the election and attacked us mainstream media for being in deep denial about trump s victory but said americans as a whole would grow to appreciate their new leader just as brexit becomes more popular by the day president trump will become more popular in america by the day he said as farage made further efforts to align himself with trump back in britain ukip was dealing with the fallout of its defeat to labour in the stoke byelection the party s deputy leader peter whittle admitted it may have been a mistake for the leader paul nuttall to run for the party in stoke on trent central so early in his leadership speaking on bbc1 s andrew marr show the london assembly member said if there was one mistake we made it was that maybe paul should not have run so early he is only been leader for 12 weeks people had not got to know him well enough i think we did not win this time there are many by elections coming up nuttall who whittle said could not appear on the show as he had a holiday booked immediately after the election result came second in stoke barely increasing the party s share of the vote despite ukip s pledge to seize power from labour whittle dismissed threats from arron banks ukip s main donor to set up another party unless he was made chairman saying there were other people who would provide money banks has threatened to pull his funding unless he is made chairman so he can purge members and stop the party being run like a jumble sale asked if he did not want banks as ukip chairman whittle replied it would be a very interesting conversation to have i ve always been very very grateful for arron s contributions if arron does take his money away there are other people obviously i would not want that to happen these sort of interventions are run of the mill they happen all the time within our party it is part of politics i think the difference is with us people tend to see a kind of do or die situation in virtually every controversy
2017-06-12,0,a contrite theresa may bought herself time with conservatives mps by apologising for failing to secure an overall majority while cabinet sources indicated that the prime minister would pursue a more conciliatory approach on brexit to shore up her leadership may addressed a packed session of her party s backbench 1922 committee on tuesday with what was described as an upfront mea culpa she declared i got us into this mess and i m going to get us out of it senior insiders added that one of the ideas actively being considered to win backing across parliament was not to major on the controversial no deal is better than a bad deal position taken by may before the election also under consideration is whether to exclude overseas students from the immigration numbers and even possibly to abandon the target to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands although nothing has been agreed any softening of the position on immigration could maximise the chance of a closer economic relationship with the eu may also admitted that the manifesto promise to make people pay more for their social care had been a mistake and said there would be no weakening of lgbt rights as the tories attempted to secure an electoral pact on tuesday with the socially conservative democratic unionist party the prime minister said more would be done to reach out to young voters and those working in the public sector she was contrite and genuine but not on her knees said one senior mp who attended the meeting adding that may had shown a warmer side there was none of the maybot the person added claiming that any talk of a leadership challenge had been silenced for now at least speaking after the meeting mps made clear that the prime minister had bought herself time with hopes that she could make it to the end of brexit talks in two years a cabinet member admitted that work was under way on how to achieve a deal with the eu27 that could pass through a much more finely balanced parliament involving seeking areas of compromise with other parties reports in the telegraph and evening standard claimed that secret talks had already begun between cabinet ministers and some labour mps any shift in tone will be seen as a coup for advocates of a soft brexit although those who campaigned to leave the eu are also offering their support to the prime minister ruth davidson the conservative leader in scotland who has won more influence after the party took 13 seats in scotland said she was pushing for an open brexit with maximum economic access after a private meeting with may in downing street davidson added that the party needed to reach out i do think that there can be changes in the offer of brexit as we go forward downing street is also preparing to put forward a skeleton version of a queen s speech as the parliamentary mathematics threatens to bring domestic policymaking to a halt unless the tories reach out to opposition parties the annual list of legislation which may be delayed from 19 june will have two big ticket items of brexit and counter terrorism policy but see most of the domestic agenda ditched according to one source may s plans for a sweeping shakeup of education including new grammar schools could be boiled down to a few pilots they said however despite jitters within the party and suggestions that may s days are numbered her performance in front of the 1922 committee appeared to reduce anger about the shock result after the vote stripped the conservatives of their majority and plunged the government into instability and the need for coalition talks with the dup heidi allen the mp for south cambridgeshire said the prime minister would be gone within six months however after the 1922 meeting allen who has fought her own party over disability benefit cuts and tough positioning on brexit said i saw an incredibly humble woman who knows what she has to do and that is be who she is and not what this job had turned her into she has lost her armadillo shell and we have got a leader back anne marie trevelyan the conservative mp for berwick upon tweed who has been an outspoken proponent of brexit said it was very positive to hear her take very firm responsibility for not being able to crystallise some of the seats we would hoped to win i felt she had very deeply considered over the weekend whether she should continue and came to us to say i will continue for as long as you want me to do so and i think that is exactly what we all hoped she would say mps said there was a tacit acceptance of the need to build a better consensus a broader backing for brexit has to be built and i think she recognises that one former minister said she was clear she was responsible she agreed on the need to listen to all the wings of the party on brexit one remainer on the left of the party was teary eyed as they expressed their renewed support for the prime minister while a hardline brexiter agreed describing her as very very humble and saying she has bought herself time she showed a side of her that was very appealing a warmer side at the centre of the debate were concerns about the manifesto mps admitted that it had been a disaster with voters particularly the so called dementia tax and the decision to press ahead with school funding cuts public sector workers felt very strongly about austerity a former cabinet minister said we have to offer a message of aspiration which is a very conservative word jeremy corbyn s massive gains with public sector workers appear to have driven anti austerity into the centre of political debate even among conservatives may acknowledged several warnings from mps who described meeting people who said they could not vote tory because of cuts to hospitals schools or failure to increase public sector wages in real terms anna soubry told the guardian it had been an issue she repeatedly encountered on the doorstep writing in a local newsletter she added we need a kinder conservatism that recognises the very real concerns about reduced school budgets a shortfall in nhs and social care funding and that some of our most valued public servants such as nurses have had their wages cut others argued that it was ok for the tories to keep their position but that they had failed to make the economic argument during the campaign soubry said it was outrageous that the chancellor philip hammond had not been given a bigger role in the campaign several mps told may they had had difficulties rebutting questions over school funding on doorsteps and in local hustings may said that justine greening would address the concerns and sources stressed that the education secretary had been making the case for better funding for schools for some time tories banged on the tables for about 30 seconds as may arrived for the crunch meeting in a roasting hot room packed with members of the house of lords as well as mps may took questions but one mp described them as more like speeches there was no appetite for a leadership election the mp said that is the last thing the country needs she said she would serve us as long as we want her and that she is been a party servant since she was 12 years old stuffing envelopes mps were pleased that the prime minister had removed her joint chiefs of staff fiona hill and nick timothy as she pointed instead to her new top aide the former tory mp gavin barwell and the chief whip gavin williamson one mp said that the party had faith in the two gavins
2017-06-24,0,theresa may did at least get to stay for the dinner of vegetable tart monkfish and macerated cherries before leaving the room as the other leaders digested her proposals for the future of eu citizens in britain over coffee and mints the prime minister is proposing that around 3 million eu nationals in the uk should be able to remain indefinitely after brexit as long as british citizens in europe benefit from an equivalent deal while britain s policy will be laid out in more detail in a government paper on monday may suggested that eu citizens already in the uk and those who arrive during a subsequent grace period will be permitted to build up five years worth of residence the result would entitle them to the special category settled status a new term now thrown into the brexit jargon mix conferring rights to employment education the nhs and other public services and pension rights for life what the prime minister has not yet clarified includes such issues as if may s team had been hoping her fair and serious offer would win over hearts and minds both in brussels and back in the uk then they will have been disappointed after some initially positive sounds from german chancellor angela merkel who called the proposals a good start european council president donald tusk was making it clear by friday that eu leaders regarded the uk s offer as below our expectations and risked worsening the current situation for their expatriate citizens stronger still has been the reaction of uk based eu citizens themselves with their main campaign group the3million describing the british offer as pathetic and lambasting the absence of a lifetime guarantee of the rights that eu citizens currently enjoy individual eu citizens who spoke to the observer also appeared unimpressed at a time when levels of anxiety and mental health disorders among the same group appear to be on the increase according to the campaign group therapists have seen an increase in the number of eu clients in britain visiting them since last year s referendum vote similar reports have come from doctors and psychologists initiatives being launched in response will include an emotional support service for europeans staffed voluntarily by registered psychotherapists and counsellors who will seek to help eu citizens experiencing distress due to uncertainty over brexit all of my own eu citizen clients have problems with sleeping and are anxious said emmy van deurzen a dutch therapist based in the uk and one of those behind the initiative many are depressed or despondent i have had several conversations with eu citizens who were suicidal others have decided to give up on britain and have already left the country back in brussels both sides have said they would like the issue of the status of eu citizens in britain and britons in the eu to be resolved early in the talks may said on friday that eu citizens in britain should take reassurance and confidence from the package telling reporters i want to reassure all those eu citizens who are in the uk who have made their lives and homes in the uk that no one will have to leave we will not be seeing families split apart however the prime minister will not have welcomed a contribution from one of her old cabinet colleagues evening standard editor and former chancellor george osborne who used an editorial in the newspaper to claim that may was the sole cabinet minister to block a unilateral offer to eu citizens in the days following the referendum that they could remain in britain if that is true then it is deeply shocking because it means that all of the proposals from theresa may mean nothing said dr tanja bueltmann a migration historian at northumbria university and a keen watcher of the brexit process from a personal and professional perspective for bueltmann a key question is likely to revolve around who will act as the arbiter and overseer of any final agreed package while the prime minister has reiterated her opposition to the idea of the european court of justice enforcing eu citizens rights european commission president jean claude juncker said it was inconceivable to him that the court could be locked out of such a role the eu s motivation is i think a good one because they do not want there to be the risk of a retrospective change in five years time by authorities in the uk added bueltmann advocates from the3million said that their initial disappointment at the may proposals still stood after it had been in contact with government sources on friday maike bohn a founding member zeroed in on may s use of the term lawful citizens and concerns that the prime minister had not outlined any plans to reform the current system by which the status of permanent resident could be obtained in the uk it is an 85 page form and a very complicated process under which a third of applications are being rejected she said if she is talking about lawful citizens then up a million people could end up being excluded we need clarity on that but like others her other big concern was about enforcement of the final deal if there is no independent body involved then it means we are only protected by uk law and a future government could make major changes added bohn we have faith in the uk courts but not in the government and after a year of hostile migration rhetoric we fear that as soon as the uk leaves the eu they could decide no they do not want us to have access to heathcare or other public services as a matter of right ulrike gupta it was some time after last year s referendum that ulrike gupta said she had found herself making apologies before speaking in public to her children in german speaking to them in your mother tongue is a very normal thing to do because you want them to learn to speak the two languages or in our cases three said gupta who lives in hertfordshire with her indian husband and two children aged three and one now adds gupta an it worker who has been in the uk since 2012 and has previously studied here she feels awkward due to the perception that many britons are not entirely enthusiastic about her presence in the country it is a difficult feeling because we also feel this is home she says we studied here we spent most of our adult life here the kids were born here faced with the uncertainty of brexit and the impact they fear it will have on everything from their mortgage to ulrike s pension part of which is in the netherlands they have begu the process of applying for permanent residency i does not really faze me yes there are lots of documents needed and so on but for us it feels like a must we need to do so for the kids sake she added as for theresa may s attempts to reassure the 3 million eu citizens in the uk that their future is secure gupta is frank i do not trust a word she says i heard a little bit about what she put on the table initially in brussels something like she wants to provide a guarantee the 3 million here but i cannot help but feel that it is just rhetoric and politics maria candela 47 this summer together with her japanese husband and two british born children candela is leaving her home in orpington kent and moving back to spain after being in the uk since 1996 i came to study english she says i loved the country and the countryside and really loved london i got a job and here i am 21 years later a year ago she could feel something was not right in our neighbourhood she says my son asked me the week before the referendum if we would be kicked out of the country i got really nervous about it twelve months on she still feels anxious i m angry and frustrated almost every day she says i have not spoken about anything else for a year the family decided that the time was right to move back to spain after her husband was offered a placement abroad i m taking this as an opportunity to go back and have a different lifestyle i wish i had made the decision a different way i ve been trying to understand what happened here for a year and i just do not get it i see it as an anti immigrant vote candela was not impressed by the proposed deal outlined by theresa may last week it is not just about the right to live and work in a country it is about rights like the erasmus grants or access to the nhs i like my freedom of movement and i did not get a chance to vote i did not feel this way before but now i do feel very european oogoo maia 45 the portuguese teacher first came to britain in 1995 and settled here two years later i ve been here working having a family paying a mortgage that sort of thing but i d noticed a change in the mood towards foreigners towards me since about 2012 he says i could just tell speaking portuguese to my kids in the pub on the train as a foreigner everyone talks to me as if i m some weird gnome he was not shocked at the result of the referendum it was not a surprise to me that there was an outlet for the residual xenophobia he says i did not go into it thinking this is never going to pass i went into it thinking this is the tip of a very dark iceberg following the closure of the department where he worked he has found it impossible to find a job a difficulty he attributes in part to brexit and the changed mood he perceives the impact of brexit on my family has been a total and absolute devastation of dignity and family life i m a highly qualified experienced teacher and i m unemployable i ve applied for hundreds of jobs and the only time i get an interview is when i ve lied about my nationality i ve been unemployed for eight months there is no jobseekers allowance for eu nationals after three months so it is been food banks for me i ve paid national insurance for 20 years but when i need the safety net it is not there recently he has been able to find factory work on a zero hours contract but his disillusionment with britain is now complete it is not the cool britannia i came to he says now this is a cruel cold unpleasant angry country your country is going wrong your country is failing stop thinking that your country is not that kind of country there is a serious thing happening here and you have to take it seriously he said his circumstances as a supply teacher meant he had not always had a regular income which in turn had made it difficult to source all the documentation that was needed for his permanent residency application paulo pinto 33 last year s brexit vote came as a blow to pinto who came to the uk from portugal in 2004 and has happily settled in leeds with his british partner a year on he is exploring options that would take away the doubts which brexit has cast over his future in britain although the road ahead is far from clear when i looked at the application process for permanent residency i just gave up who has got that amount of bank statements going back any number of years or the exact dates when they came and went he said as the drumbeat of brexit has grown louder so too have his concerns about how british society has changed there seems to be a demonisation of people going on the rhetoric has really changed in the last year especially with all the airtime being given to people like nigel farage i find that people now are more likely to generalise and cast aspersions said pinto in particular the notion that foreigners have come to britain to sponge has been a hurtful one for pinto who has worked here ever since his arrival and has bought and sold two properties in the country he now calls home the uncertainty meanwhile continues to reach into other areas such as the investment which he and his partner have put into the property they are renovating together we have invested a lot into it and we are doing a lot of the work ourselves but the pound is already dropping so there is an impact there too he added diana pantoja 31 the feeling that eu citizens in the uk are treated as negotiating chips has taken a particularly heavy toll on pantoja a humanitarian worker based in london a colombian born dutch citizen she moved to the uk last year to be close to her brother as she recovered from a break up with her long term partner in switzerland doubts about her long term ability to reside in britain have resulted in her having to seek psychological support for severe anxiety at a certain point it has started to affect my health said pantoja who is studying for a university diploma as well as working with a british bangladeshi ngo she hopes to stay in the uk but is daunted by the prospect of applying for permanent residence a process she and others regard as labyrinthine pantoja who has recently returned from working with internally displaced persons in iraq also says that as her work requires her to travel and live overseas regularly it complicates the process of proving she has resided in the uk for sufficient periods i returned in february when everything seemed to have changed entirely and the stories had emerged about the difficulties people were experiencing when it came to applying for permanent residency brexit began to feel real she said i want to have the certainty of knowing if i can stay here in two three years but there is a fear now of getting lost in a bureaucratic maze at the same time there is also a frustration knowing that the uk should need people from my background as it shifts towards services jonas lovgren 42 jonas lovgren and his wife have gathered together their family s passports and other identity documents in what they describe as their omg folder ready to be used in case of emergency the couple are worried about what sort of future they will have with their children in the uk it did not take long last year for the campaign to get really nasty in terms of inflammatory language and i ve experienced some very unwelcome comments when i ve been out with my daughters and have spoken swedish to them said lovgren the swedish music teacher lives with his family in wales and works in liverpool it reached a point where my wife put together what we call an omg folder with all the important documents marriage certificate passports so if we need to flee in the middle of the night we can grab it lovgren who came to the uk in 1996 to study before officially moving in 2010 was deeply unimpressed by theresa may s proposals in brussels her fantastic spiel yesterday told us nothing new he said basically it felt like she read out the government website and the details of things we are supposed to be guaranteed to already aside from asking that the bureaucratic obstacles to obtaining permanent residency card be tackled his other wish is for attention to be given to the tensions and divisions which he believes are now rife in british society interviews by dan glaister and
2017-03-15,0,theresa may is expected to refuse a new scottish independence referendum unless it is held after the uk has quit the eu the scottish secretary and other uk government sources indicated on wednesday that the prime minister was prepared for a drawn out battle with nicola sturgeon s government over the referendum s timing and the question that will be asked david mundell told the herald newspaper it would be impossible for people in the timescale suggested by nicola sturgeon to make a reasoned view and therefore have a legal fair and decisive referendum as we did in 2014 on the basis of the facts as they would be aware of them at that point if you are saying you want the referendum because of brexit then you have to know what the arrangement is that the uk has secured in relation to leaving the eu and how that has been delivered and of course you need to know what the snp alternative to that proposal is sturgeon revealed on monday she wants to hold the referendum between autumn 2018 and spring 2019 ideally before the uk formally signs a brexit deal expected in late march 2019 a uk government source added on wednesday that may would wait to respond until she had received formal notification from the first minister setting out precisely how and when the scottish government wants to stage the vote may is expected to argue that it would be premature and misleading to hold the vote before a final deal with details on trade and immigration is signed the prime minister clashed with the scottish national party mp tasmina ahmed sheikh during prime minister s questions over sturgeon s authority to demand the referendum referring to sturgeon s manifesto pledge to stage a referendum if the uk quits the eu ahmed sheikh said the first minister had won the largest vote in holyrood s history in the last scottish election does she agree that governments should stick to their manifesto promises and if so she cannot object to the first minister sticking to hers she asked may retorted that sturgeon headed a minority government and implied she had lost both the scottish independence referendum in 2014 and the one on eu membership in 2016 she said alex salmond the then snp leader had described the first referendum as a once in a generation vote under the scotland act sturgeon must seek the approval of westminster under a section 30 order to allow her to hold a referendum she is waiting until she wins holyrood s support for her plans next wednesday with the snp one seat short of an overall majority she must rely on six scottish green party votes to win the majority she needs with the tories labour and the liberal democrats planning to vote against her no 10 is waiting to see the wording of next week s holyrood motion and the details of sturgeon s request for a section 30 order before setting out its position the critical thing is what nicola is talking about said one source meanwhile two of may s closest downing street advisers fiona hill and nick timothy her joint chiefs of staff are expected to have private meetings in edinburgh with the scottish tory leader ruth davidson and her advisers to plan may s referendum strategy a scottish government source said sturgeon was happy for may to wait to see her proposals before responding we are realistic and hard headed about the mechanics of this the source said if holyrood gives us the green light we are then in a process where the existing bilateral links we have established and our minister to minister channels would then kick in the tories also believe sturgeon is in a far weaker position than polls showing support for independence as high as 49 suggest a yougov poll for the times on wednesday said only 43 of scots would vote yes the lowest figure for 18 months
2017-03-25,0,brexit negotiations are on course to fail unless both britain and the european union ditch their winner takes all approach to the coming talks the former president of the european commission josé manuel barroso has said with just days to go before theresa may formally notifies brussels of the uk s intention to leave the eu jean claude juncker s predecessor said the two sides were playing a dangerous game the uk s prime minister has said she believes no deal is better than a bad deal and some in her cabinet have openly talked up the prospect of walking away from the negotiating table michel barnier the eu s chief negotiator has placed the settlement of britain s 50bn in financial liabilities as the prerequisite for any progress last week the french former minister conjured up a vision of queues of dover nuclear fuel shortages and chaos for citizens as a consequence of britain s failure to live up to its responsibility asked about the coming brexit talks on the margins of saturday s rome summit to mark the 60th anniversary of the eu s founding the french president françois hollande he said he wanted them to be amicable but added we will ensure that it does not happen to europe s detriment that britain remains a partner of the union but that necessarily it will pay the consequences barroso also suggested that extremists on both sides of the channel wanted the uk to break away from the eu entirely i think both sides until now mostly put the issue in terms of a zero sum game and i think this is not helpful he said what they should understand both sides is that we have to work constructively because whether some people like it or not britain will be part of europe some people both on the continent and in the uk do not like the idea that britain is part of europe but it is of course britain not keeping the responsibility of membership cannot expect the privileges of membership that is quite clear having said that i think it is possible to come to a constructive agreement that minimises the negative points and offers some way forward but that requires on both sides strategic thinking and leadership barroso spoke ahead of the publication of a report on monday from the organisation that represents british manufacturers the eef saying it would be unacceptable for the british government to come away without a deal about 52 of all uk manufactured exports by value went to the eu in the 12 months to april 2016 with production processes crossing european borders numerous times estimates in the chemicals sector have shown that a tariff of between 4 and 6 tariff which the eu imposes on non member states would increase direct trading costs by more than 50m for a single company the eef will say that if the uk walk away with no preferential access to the eu market in place the manufacturing sector would bear much of the brunt of an immediate financial loss
2017-06-13,0,the lack of a majority government means the conservatives will probably have to ease austerity plans and boost spending on public services the newly appointed environment secretary michael gove has said gove a surprise addition to theresa may s new cabinet said the party would need to push ahead on brexit with the maximum possible consensus taking into account the views of remain voters discussions between may s team and the democratic unionist party over what concessions the northern ireland party will seek in return for propping up a conservative government are scheduled for later on tuesday the dup leader arlene foster is expected to largely avoid sectarian issues such as orange parades as conditions under which her mps would provide supply and confidence to a minority government and instead focus on budget based matters the dup has opposed some austerity measures including the bedroom tax and mooted changes to some universal benefits for pensioners such as the winter fuel allowance asked whether the conservatives would need to give ground on this gove told bbc radio 4 s today programme that some concessions were inevitable we do not have a majority and one of the things that i do think that we need to do is to make sure that when we bring forward a programme it commands the broadest possible level of confidence he said and we also need to reflect on what the election result told us about the way people want to see the economy managed in the future i think there is an important balance to be struck and we need to get on with the job of reducing the deficit so that we do not saddle the next generation with a burden of debt while may s government would seek sustainable spending gove said we also need to take account of legitimate public concerns about ensuring that we properly fund public services asked whether the conservatives loss of a majority in last week s election could soften brexit plans gove said it was necessary to proceed with the maximum possible consensus and to take into account the views of people who voted for the uk to remain in the eu asked what this might mean in practice gove declined to elaborate and refused to say whether he would support any cross party commission on brexit i do not think that i should specify and i do not want to specify the means by which we should involve everyone in a conversation gove was sacked from the cabinet when may entered no 10 the pair had fallen out when they were the education and home secretaries respectively saying he was naturally flattered to be asked back into government gove said there was no bad feeling between him and the prime minister i m a huge fan of theresa may s and i have been throughout my political career and i think that she was a great home secretary gove briefly and unsuccessfully challenged for the succession to david cameron having suddenly withdrawn his support for boris johnson as he did so scuppering the latter s chances asked on bbc breakfast about his relations with johnson gove said boris and i spoke at the weekend and we had a great friendly conversation he was kind enough to welcome me back to the cabinet with a very generous tweet and we were chatting yesterday in the margins of cabinet in another media appearance on itv s good morning britain gove was asked about a letter written by labour s deputy leader tom watson to may asking if the media boss rupert murdoch had sought gove s return to cabinet gove who writes a column for the murdoch owned times said tom sees rupert murdoch s hand behind everything i think tom believes that rupert murdoch picks the england cricket xi and the rugby first xv as well as decide who is on britain s got talent this is par for the course for tom when it comes to political mischief making in a subsequent interview with lbc gove said that now he was back in the cabinet he would be giving up his column for the times but might still contribute articles without payment i will no longer be writing there for money but if the editor of the times ever wanted to take an article from me i would always be happy to oblige
2017-06-09,0,jeremy corbyn has defied the pundits and the pollsters to restore the labour party as a serious electoral force and deliver a devastating blow to theresa may s political authority but how this remarkable election saw a surge in both conservative and labour votes as the first past the post system amplified the return of the two party system after an absence of nearly 20 years more than anything else it was a night in which britain s younger generation flexed their political muscles to real effect for the first time despite their calamitous campaign the conservatives increased their share of the vote to 42 up five points since 2015 which in any other election in the past three decades would have been enough to build a commanding majority but labour outperformed even that achievement as a unique alliance of enthused younger voters and previous non voters combined with older austerity hit anti establishment ukippers to deliver a 10 point rise in labour s vote compared with two years ago to 40 this is just below the 41 secured by tony blair in his 2001 landslide victory the youthquake was a key component of corbyn s 10 point advance in labour s share of the vote exceeding even blair s nine point gain in his first 1997 landslide no official data exists for the scale of the youth vote but an nme led exit poll suggests turnout among under 35s rose by 12 points compared with 2015 to 56 the survey said nearly two thirds of younger voters backed labour with brexit being their main concern overall turnout was up 2 at 69 the highest since 1997 with 85 of seats seeing an increase in voters the top five seats with the highest turnouts of 78 79 were winchester twickenham st albans wirral west and wirral south the first three featured fierce lib dem tory battles including vince cable s successful fight in twickenham ten seats that saw the largest 10 plus increases in turnout included newcastle upon tyne east ilford south foyle rossendale and darwen lewisham east and staffordshire south it is likely the youth vote had a decisive influence in seats such as manchester central canterbury and cambridge which are also in the top 22 seats for increased turnout london experienced the biggest concentration of seats with above average turnout 39 being above the national 69 benchmark the largest turnout falls came in scotland where 20 snp held seats recorded drops of up to 8 marking a turn in the nationalist tide only two seats in scotland saw increased turnout orkney and glasgow analysis of the local election results led many to conclude that the shift of ukip s 4 million former voters had almost all gone directly back to the conservatives they appeared to be fuelling the massive 15 point plus tory leads when the snap election was called and confirming boris johnson s claim they were a lost tory tribe but the data shows that picture to be a lot more complicated the ukip vote has fragmented with more than a third going to parties other than the conservatives in at least one seat canterbury where labour won for the first time ukip s failure to stand in a constituency where it secured 7 289 votes in 2015 seemed to fuel labour s 12 000 vote increase in wrexham another seat where ukip stood down it appears labour and the tories equally benefited from ukip s former voters keeping the seat labour despite its high leave profile this fragmentation of the ukip vote also enabled labour to hold on to nottinghamshire marginals such as vernon coaker s gedling the much touted tory surge across the midlands the north west and the north east failed to materialise partly as a result of this effect nigel farage claimed the conservatives had made a major miscalculation in assuming ukippers were just disaffected tory voters the new battleground seats include some unfamiliar names such as kensington in london as key marginals in hastings and rye the home secretary amber rudd now sits on a majority of just 346 and may have to spend more time in her constituency if she does not move to safer territory the tories are now defending 40 seats which are vulnerable to a swing of just 2 5 while there are only 29 labour mps sitting on such a slim majority this advantage to labour however may be eroded when the new constituency boundary changes come into effect next year which were expected to benefit the conservatives there were fears during the campaign that the corbyn surge fuelled by big labour leads among voters under 35 would simply stack up bigger majorities in the party s safe seats but labour made gains across the country in unexpected places such as canterbury plymouth and ipswich while the tories saw their more modest but still substantial increase in support concentrated largely in the seats they already held the national swing from conservatives to labour was 1 8 but there was a sharp brexit variation between remain and leave seats the results show an 8 swing from conservatives to labour in those seats that voted remain in last year s referendum in seats that voted leave there was a 1 swing from labour to the conservatives it appears corbyn s fudged brexit stance proved highly effective in minimising defections among leave voters while still proving positive enough for unhappy remain voters especially in london it was also very much a personal triumph for corbyn the conservatives fuelled by a stratospheric 28 point approval rating for may far outstripping her party s standing with voters chose to base their campaign around her the word conservative was reduced to a footnote corbyn s ratings began at 23 points and he faced a campaign of vilification in the tory papers not seen since their 1980s assault on michael foot corbyn minimised the damage through his unplugged style of mass rallies growing in strength through the campaign and eschewing may s itinerary of highly targeted marginal visits he ended the campaign with a remarkable yougov personal rating of 39 may whose wooden leadership and shortcomings became painfully plain to the public in the full glare of the campaign finished on a rating of 6 she was no longer the electoral asset her party had invested in so heavily but the election was not a uniform national story labour gained most in london and produced good results in wales meanwhile the most effective part of the tory surge came in scotland where they won more seats from the snp than labour it was however overwhelmingly a realignment among the parties voters that produced this hung parliament labour gained strongly among younger more affluent urban voters while the conservatives reached working class voters who had never supported them before the big casualties were the minor parties with ukip being the biggest its vote fell from 13 in 2015 to 2 and the party faces implosion after the resignation of its leader paul nuttall it was a happier story for the liberal democrats despite losing nick clegg the party s national vote share was little changed at 7 but its strategy of fighting the campaign as a series of individual byelections paid off increasing the number of seats from eight to 12 its first advance since 2005
2017-04-01,0,a new row has broken out over the so called tampon tax after it emerged that a quarter of a million pounds from a controversial levy on women s sanitary products is to be given to an anti abortion organisation under pressure from campaigners after failing to honour a pledge to scrap the 5 vat on sanitary products former chancellor george osborne said that more than 10m a year would be redistributed from the tax receipts to women s charities but there was consternation on saturday night among women s groups and politicians who had campaigned on the issue after it emerged that 250 000 of that money is going to life a charity that campaigns against abortion and has been at the centre of controversy over the information provided by a network of unregulated pregnancy counselling centres a spokesperson for the end violence against women coalition said we are surprised to see that life is the recipient of a very significant tampon tax grant the government set out clearly that this money would be spent in ways that would address women s specific needs and inequalities it is hard to understand how a service offering counselling based on the fundamental premise that abortion is wrong to vulnerable women can do that the government announced last friday that 70 organisations across the country would share 12m from the tampon tax fund which it said would improve the lives of disadvantaged women and girls across the country rob wilson the minister for civil society gave details of the funding on a visit to the suzy lamplugh trust which is to receive 200 000 to help increase its casework support service for women who are being stalked four other charities ranging from the women s rape and sexual abuse centre cornwall which is getting 179 157 to black country women s aid 240 401 were highlighted in a press notice from the department for culture media amp sport no mention was made of life but the organisation appears on a separate long list which says it will receive 250 000 for housing practical help counselling emotional support and life skills training for young pregnant women who are homeless there has been surprise not just at the award but at its size it is one of the largest donations on the list life describes itself as unique combining pro life advocacy and education work with nationwide services providing positive alternatives to abortion it served notice last year of plans to increase its online presence to compete with established service providers such as marie stopes and the british pregnancy advisory service bpas among others who criticised the grant was labour mp paula sherriff whose successful amendment to last year s budget led to the government pledging to abolish the tax it will seem bitterly ironic to many women if we are taxed for our biology only for the government to hand over that money to organisations that do not even believe we should have control over our own bodies especially when so many are left without basic sanitary protection she said just this thursday i led a commons debate on period poverty and discussed terrible cases like the homeless women who cannot afford tampons and whose health is at risk the girls in leeds who play truant during their periods and a charity that provides free sanitary products to africa now getting requests from schools in britain because so many female pupils cannot afford them tackling these issues would surely be a better use of the tampon tax fund the minister agreed on thursday to look at funding for sanitary protection in schools and homeless shelters and i will be asking the government to review their allocation of the tampon tax fund urgently there was also criticism from the women s equality party its leader sophie walker said we consider any restriction on women s reproductive rights as violence against us and thus it was a shock to learn the government has used the tampon tax fund to support a charity whose mission is anti choice and aims to make abortion a thing of the past while we appreciate the work life does to support homeless pregnant women and care for children with life limiting or terminal illnesses we are very disappointed to see the allocation of such significant funds to this one charity while many others struggle particularly those supporting black and minority ethnic women and disabled women who experience some of the highest rates of violence against them and yet are consistently at the bottom of the list for funding the government had originally faced a potential rebellion over the issue after an amendment tabled by sherriff won the backing of eurosceptics keen to assert britain s power to set its own tax rates osborne had originally pledged to remove the tampon tax in november 2015 but was unable to do so due to regulations applied by the european commission that prevented member states from doing so the government said on friday that it is committed to continuing the fund until eu rules allow a zero rate of vat to be applied to women s sanitary products and that a decision will be made on the future of the fund once this has been achieved wilson said at the launch of the fund from cornwall to dundee the tampon tax fund continues to benefit organisations in every corner of the uk working to improve the lives of disadvantaged women and girls including those who have been affected by violence this fund is helping to improve lives supporting our ambition to create a fairer shared society for everyone i m glad that so many worthwhile organisations will benefit from this money a spokesperson for life said we believe that our support services for women are not a luxury but are essential for them to have the space to look at options for continuing their pregnancies with support
2017-02-21,0,british mps lined up on monday to pour scorn on a racist and sexist donald trump who they said should not be allowed to come to britain for a state visit because of the risk it would embarrass the queen the us president was compared to a petulant child and had his intelligence questioned by mps during a three hour debate triggered after more than 1 8 million people signed a petition urging theresa may to cancel her invitation so many politicians packed into westminster hall for the debate that they had to have their speeches limited to five minutes each alex salmond said he was unsure over whether to be appalled by the morality of the invitation or astonished by its stupidity as an example of fawning subservience the prime minister holding hands with trump would be difficult to match the former scottish first minister said to do it in the name of shared values was stomach churning what exactly are the shared values that this house this country would hope to have labour s paul flynn said that only two us presidents had been accorded a state visit to britain in more than half a century and it was completely unprecedented that trump had been issued his within seven days of his presidency flynn who started the debate because he is on the petitions committee said trump would hardly be silenced by the invitation being rescinded accusing him of a ceaseless incontinence of free speech asked by caroline lucas co leader of the green party if trump s views on climate science should also be taken into account flynn responded that the president had shown cavernous depths of scientific ignorance on the issue they were speaking as thousands of demonstrators descended on parliament square to protest against the visit chanting and waving placards reading no to racism no to trump the shadow home secretary diane abbott addressed the crowds as did lucas who emerged from the debate to describe trump as a bully and a bigot inside the chamber flynn was criticised by a conservative mp when he quoted the observer s andrew rawnsley who has described the visit as the government pimping out the queen for donald trump jacob rees mogg responded that it was out of order to refer to pimping out our sovereign and argued that no one had complained when emperor hirohito came on a state visit to the uk who he said was responsible for the rape of nanking rees mogg was one of a number of tories to defend both the president and may for issuing a state visit nigel evans mp for ribble valley warned against sneering at the 61 million americans who voted for the president describing them as the forgotten people adam holloway conservative mp for gravesham said that while trump s travel ban on people from seven muslim majority countries was absurd it was rather refreshing to see a politician actually do what they had promised crispin blunt who chairs the foreign affairs committee said the queen would be embarrassed if the invitation was now withdrawn edward leigh conservative mp for gainsborough told colleagues that he was going to make a difficult argument and then claimed that trump s racism and misogyny had been overstated which one of us has not made some ridiculous sexual comment at some point in his past he said prompting an angry response from female mps a number of female mps stood up to complain of trump s sexism with paula sherriff labour mp for dewsbury and mirfield quoting his infamous grab her by the pussy comment which she said was sexual assault rushanara ali labour mp for bethnal green and bow urged the prime minister to remove her invitation because of the damage to the queen of the association naz shah labour mp for bradford west said she had once urged trump to come to her constituency to share a curry and meet a muslim chief superintendent headteacher health workers and so on but to do so now that he is president will only reinforce his actions his divisive racist and sexist messages this flies in the face of everything we stand for we cannot support what he is doing she said david lammy the labour mp for tottenham warned that african americans were afraid of the presidency saying trump was supported by the ku klux klan and had white supremacists in his inner circle salmond also said that trump would not have forgotten previous insults of him by the prime minister and said that his experience of dealing with the former reality television star who owns golf courses in scotland showed may was in a difficult position from my experience negotiating with donald trump never ever do it from a weak position because the result will be a total disaster however those close to ministers made clear that there would be no rowing back on the invitation to trump and hit out at mps it would be interesting to see how much time and public money was wasted on today s debate it achieved nothing apart from offering some who have nothing better to do the opportunity to grandstand the british people will be more interested in the important debate in the lords on brexit said a government source
2017-03-20,0,boris johnson will meet key white house figures including donald trump s most powerful aide steve bannon during a trip to the us this week the guardian understands the foreign secretary is also expected to meet stephen miller and kellyanne conway as well as republican congressional leaders and is likely to see the secretary of state rex tillerson the visit first to washington dc then new york comes after of a row over wiretapping claims that threatened to damage relations between the two countries press secretary sean spicer claimed last week that britain s gchq had helped barack obama spy on trump in comments that triggered a withering response from the former british ambassador to the us sir peter westmacott johnson is also expected to meet the president s national security adviser hr mcmaster but sources suggested he was unlikely to raise concerns about the controversy during the sessions a government source indicated that whitehall considered the situation resolved after us figures expressed regret and provided reassurances that it would not be repeated however a suggestion that mcmaster had apologised for the row have been publicly denied by spicer johnson is thought to have got on well with bannon who has courted controversy through his white nationalist views and hardline stance on the media in previous meetings as such he is considered a possible middleman between the british government and the trump administration johnson is not expected to meet the us president during his visit one foreign office source suggested the meetings would be foreign policy heavy with a focus on russia the middle east nato and the fight against islamic state but also include wide ranging talks on domestic policy the foreign secretary is likely to see tillerson at a washington summit on taking on isis during which more than 60 countries will be represented he will then travel to new york to chair a un security council meeting that will discuss the unfolding situations in somalia and south sudan where famine has killed tens of thousands of people
2017-06-06,0,theresa may has declared she is prepared to rip up human rights laws to impose new restrictions on terror suspects as she sought to gain control over the security agenda just 36 hours before the polls open the prime minister said she was looking at how to make it easier to deport foreign terror suspects and how to increase controls on extremists where it is thought they present a threat but there is not enough evidence to prosecute them the last ditch intervention comes after days of pressure on may over the policing cuts and questions over intelligence failures following terror attacks on london bridge manchester and westminster she said but i can tell you a few of the things i mean by that i mean longer prison sentences for people convicted of terrorist offences i mean making it easier for the authorities to deport foreign terror suspects to their own countries and i mean doing more to restrict the freedom and the movements of terrorist suspects when we have enough evidence to know they present a threat but not enough evidence to prosecute them in full in court and if human rights laws stop us from doing it we will change those laws so we can do it the proposed measures appear to be an attempt at strengthening terrorism prevention and investigation measures tpims rather than a complete return to labour s control orders which were repeatedly struck down by the courts and then scrapped by may in 2010 when she was home secretary they could involve further curfews restrictions on association with other known extremists controls on where they can travel and limits on access to communication devices she could even increase the period for which terror suspects can be held without trial currently 14 days a move that provoked clashes with civil liberties campaigners when tony blair attempted it after the 7 july 2005 attacks may told the sun she would consult the intelligence agencies about what they think is needed when we reduced it to 14 days we actually allowed for legislation to enable it to be at 28 days we said there may be circumstances where it is necessary to do this i will listen to what they think is necessary for us to do the conservatives have promised not to withdraw from the european convention on human rights during the next parliament but they could begin to try to replace or amend parts of the human rights act after the uk leaves the eu it is possible may s plans could involve seeking further derogations from the echr this is the way the government is seeking to prevent human rights claims against soldiers in future military situations earlier in the day the prime minister tried to return her election campaign to the issues of brexit and her leadership as the tories poll lead over jeremy corbyn s labour remained narrow but she continued to face a barrage of questions over the impact of cuts to policing sadiq khan the labour mayor of london said planned cuts of 10 40 in london over the next four years would make it harder to foil terrorist attacks on our city may was then repeatedly challenged about how the home office police and intelligence services dealt with the information relating to the attackers after boris johnson her foreign secretary said mi5 had questions to answer one of the attackers khuram butt 27 had been reported to the anti terror hotline in 2015 and a third attacker youssef zaghba 22 had been detained by italian authorities in 2016 zaghba named by police for the first time yesterday was put on an international terrorism database for an attempt to travel to syria in march 2016 which was thwarted after he allegedly told officials at bologna i am going to be a terrorist but this does not seem to have been spotted by uk intelligence agencies his mother valeria collina told the italian news magazine l espresso that her son was friends with the two other men and monitored by italian officials after his failed journey to syria may said she absolutely recognised people s concerns and added that she expected the intelligence agencies to launch a review of the london bridge attack we need to look at how the terror threat is evolving the way that terrorism is breeding terrorism and the increased tempo of attacks we have had three horrific attacks and we have foiled five others the tempo is there in a way we have not seen before she said we will look at how the processes were followed what they did they will want to be looking at that because they will want to learn lessons for the future if there are those lessons to be learned she added the police and security service have done a good job in foiling a number of plots just five in the last three months and a significant number in the last few years as well may declined to say whether zaghba had been monitored or subject to an exclusion order when he returned to the uk after being stopped in italy and declined an opportunity to apologise for any failures by the intelligence agencies despite having previously said she believed the police and security services had the resources they needed to deal with terrorism she went on to announce details of a proposed crackdown on terrorism at a rally of conservative activists in slough her remarks suggested that if she is re elected her government could look to step up the use of orders that restrict the movement of terror suspects there are currently only seven terror suspects considered enough of a threat to be given tpims while there are about 23 000 people considered to have been subjects of interest by the security services tpims which expire after two years can include overnight curfews of up to 10 hours electronic tagging reporting regularly to the police exclusion from certain zones enforced relocation and some limitations on use of a mobile phone and the internet elements of the orders could be strengthened but any attempt to return to the 18 hour a day curfews imposed by control orders would be likely to end up in the courts may s proposals follow criticism from labour and other parties about her cuts to policing and approach to tackling terrorism in the home office which she led for six years corbyn accused the prime minister on sunday night of trying to protect the public on the cheap by implementing 20 000 police cuts the prime minister has also been accused of politicising her response to the london bridge terror attack when she addressed the nation outside downing street on sunday she declared enough is enough as she announced plans tointroduce new anti terror laws without going into details about whatshe would do labour leader jeremy corbyn said you cannot keep our country safe on the cheap theresa may is refusing to put in the resources that are needed she has slashed funding for the police our courts system and border force i will do everything necessary and effective to keep our people safe we will always keep the law under review but do not believe would be terrorists and suicide bombers will be deterred by longer sentences or restricting our rights at home the right response to the recent attacks is to halt the conservative cuts and invest in our police and security services and protect our democratic values including the human rights act it is disgraceful that the conservative government is suppressing its own report into terrorist funding we will not shy away from the difficult conversations about who funds and supports terrorism tim farron the lib dem leader said may was only posturing about being tough on terror he added in her years as home secretary she was willing to offer up the police for cut after cut we have been here before a kind of nuclear arms race in terror laws might give the appearance of action but what the security services lack is not more power but more resources and responsibility for that lies squarely with theresa may the london bridge attack on saturday night left seven people dead and 15 remain in hospital in critical condition raids and searches of properties in east london continue but 12 others arrested as part of inquiries into whether anyone else helped the attackers have been released without charge
2017-02-17,0,britain is beginning to reassess how reliable an ally the us is the scottish conservative party leader ruth davidson has said in comments that contrast starkly with the official policy of the uk government during an interview at the women in the world summit in washington davidson said at the moment from the uk we have always seen america as being a very strong a reliable ally and now even after only 26 days or however long donald trump s tenure has been so far in pennsylvania avenue we are beginning to reassess how reliable an ally the united states is and that is a huge change in europe that is a massive massive shock we are going to want to make sure any deals that are done trump is going to honour we have to be sure of that theresa may was the first world leader to visit trump after he became president and she has been clear that the relationship between the uk and the us will remain strong despite the controversies surrounding the trump administration on the eve of her visit to the oval office in january may told journalists that opposites attract speaking before a press conference on thursday in which trump attacked the media davidson said the trend for politicians to demonise the media should worry us all we have to be very careful about popular nationalists populist strongmen part demagogues using a lot of their political capital at the beginning of their journey to delegitimise public scrutiny which is what demonising the media does she said and i think that if we learn our lessons from history there is a very strategic reason why you would do that and i think that should worry us all davidson said it was only lazy members of the media who thought she was not what you would expect a conservative necessarily to be the idea that i m something completely other is wrong because i worked for 10 years as a journalist for the bbc and for others and was interviewing politicians every day so i was not completely foreign to the world she said it was not like a bunch of one step away from white supremacist bloggers that are living just up the street she added taking a swipe at steve bannon trump s chief strategist and the co founder of far right website breitbart news and it turns out they are completely chaotic davidson expressed reservations about the decision to invite trump on a state visit to the uk the whole point of state visits is that it is about having people who share your philosophy your friends and all the rest of it that is the difference from a bilateral summit or whatever she said and the thing that i had a problem with is that that could go on while there are members of my own country being banned from the us people with joint passports but she concluded i will extend and i m sure the government of the united kingdom will extend every courtesy to the president of the united states when he arrives as you should with any world leader but we are going to want to make sure that any deal we do he is going to honour we have to be sure of that it is not the first time the scottish tory leader has been critical of trump before he was elected davidson was reported by the herald newspaper as saying the billionaire s impetuosity could be dangerous not just for america but for the world a source at the foreign office said the official position on the uk us relationship was well known and had not changed speaking in the commons last month the foreign secretary boris johnson said the uk s alliance with the us was vital on defence intelligence and security we work together more closely than any other two countries in the world that relationship is overwhelmingly to our benefit he said the prime minister s highly successful visit to the white house last week underlined the strength of that transatlantic alliance where we have differences with the unites states we will not quail from expressing them
2017-04-19,0,theresa may has stunned westminster by demanding a snap general election on 8 june that she hopes will turn her party s clear lead in the opinion polls into a healthy parliamentary majority and secure her conservative vision for brexit the prime minister made an unscheduled statement on tuesday morning from behind a lectern outside 10 downing street in which she recanted her repeated promise not to go to the polls before 2020 she accused opposition parties of trying to jeopardise her government s preparations for exiting the eu as she called for what would be a third nationwide poll in three years while the labour leader jeremy corbyn responded by saying he would welcome the opportunity to fight an election opposing tory austerity may said we need a general election and we need one now because we have at this moment a one off chance to get this done while the european union agrees its negotiating position and before the detailed talks begin supporters of the prime minister said she would use the election to crush dissent over brexit with one projection by the election expert michael thrasher suggesting she could secure a majority of 140 on the basis of current polls his estimate suggests the number of tory mps could rise from 331 to 395 with labour potentially slumping from 229 to 164 under the fixed term parliaments act may cannot call an election directly but will lay down a motion in the house of commons requiring two thirds of mps to back it labour the liberal democrats and the scottish national party all promised not to stand in her way allowing for the commons to be dissolved on 3 may mps will vote on whether to dissolve parliament after a 90 minute debate on wednesday after prime minister s questions in a sign of the tone she is likely to adopt during the seven week campaign may quickly focused on her opponents in her address to the nation saying the country is coming together but westminster is not she added in recent weeks labour have threatened to vote against the final agreement we reach with the european union the liberal democrats have said they want to grind the business of government to a standstill the snp say they will vote against the legislation that formally repeals britain s membership of the european union and unelected members of the house of lords have vowed to fight us every step of the way corbyn made clear that labour would back the government in calling for dissolution despite anger from some of his party s mps who are worried about losing their seats in the election the labour leader said i welcome the prime minister s decision to give the british people the chance to vote for a government that will put the interests of the majority first labour will be offering the country an effective alternative to a government that has failed to rebuild the economy delivered falling living standards and damaging cuts to our schools and nhs one shadow cabinet member and ally of the labour leader argued that corbyn could turn around public expectations over the next eight weeks opposition politicians pointed out that may had repeatedly said she would not call a general election the prime minister said she had come to the decision reluctantly and recently but felt it was necessary to secure stability at a time when her party is riding high in the polls sources suggested that advisers believed the argument would resonate with the public may used a television interview with itv s political editor robert peston to suggest she had made her decision during last week s break from parliament before easter i spent a few days walking in wales with my husband i thought about this long and hard and came to the decision that to provide for that stability and certainty this was the way to do it she said but the guardian understands that may had been considering the question for a few weeks and had all but made up her mind before using the holiday to mull it over the idea had been a tightly guarded secret only discussed among a very small group of her closest advisers with senior colleagues in the party only finding out on tuesday sources admitted that a key hope was to boost the tories slim working majority of 17 in order to help pass brexit linked legislation such as the great repeal bill as well as plans for a future immigration system and domestic policies such as may s flagship grammar schools reform they said the prime minister was determined to avoid endless back and forth on important issues key cabinet members including the home secretary amber rudd the brexit secretary david davis and the foreign secretary boris johnson were informed of the decision in individual meetings on tuesday morning the chancellor philip hammond also knew in advance recent polls show a healthy lead for the conservatives a guardian icm survey on tuesday placed the party 21 points ahead of labour despite a policy blitz by corbyn s party it had the tories on 46 compared with 25 for labour and 11 for the lib dems it also suggested there was support for a snap election with 55 of respondents backing the idea compared with 15 opposing it labour sources pointed out that polls had not been consistent with one recently placing the tory lead at just nine points the lib dems made clear that they planned to turn the general election into a referendum on a hard brexit with the leader tim farron telling voters this election is your chance to change the direction of our country writing in the guardian he said there are large numbers of conservative seats where the lib dems are the challengers seats up and down the country where the tories are looking vulnerable where constituents will question this brutal dumb hard brexit the only way to stop theresa may winning a majority the only way to stop a hard brexit is by the lib dems winning in those seats among well known lib dems standing for re election will be the former cabinet ministers vince cable and ed davey the snp was less supportive of the notion of an early election but said it would not stand in the way the party s westminster leader angus robertson claimed that scotland was now a two horse race between the snp and the conservatives adding that he was hopeful of gaining on the 56 of 59 scottish seats won in 2015 senior conservatives suggested that may would focus the election on leadership as well as on completing brexit and key domestic policies such as education the party is also likely to repeat a 2015 tactic to contrast the likelihood of a conservative majority to a corbyn led coalition that included the snp downing street ruled out may appearing in any head to head tv debates despite demands from corbyn i say to theresa may who said this election was about leadership come on and show some he said let us have the debates it is what democracy needs and what the british people deserve but broadcasters are likely to avoid heated clashes with downing street as seen during the 2015 election which ended with david cameron taking part in special election programmes instead of head to heads the election caused nerves among labour mps with some bemoaning the possible loss of colleagues and two of the party s politicians tom blenkinsop and alan johnson saying they would not contest their seats tony blair has called on voters to consider maintaining politicians of any party determined to maintain an open mind on brexit the damage to the country will be huge if we end up with an unrestrained brexit at any cost majority he wrote claiming may was trying to take advantage of labour s difficulties the state of the labour leadership offers such an obvious target that it would be an extraordinary act of political self denial to refuse to put the opposition to the test said blair arguing that the prime minister also wanted a mandate for brexit before the talks ran into inevitable difficulties conservatives were largely supportive of the decision with steve baker a key backbencher who chairs the european research group claiming that labour and the lib dems were trying to scupper brexit i am delighted that the prime minister has decided to ask the parliament to go to the country in pursuit of a mandate for the plans she has set out for leaving the european union this should be great news for a strong and stable government a strong negotiating hand and a good deal he said labour are going to decide if they want a real brexit or a fake one a fake brexit is staying in the customs unions or eea unable to chart our own course on trade policy and services regulation others claimed that may had been driven by controversy facing her party over election expenses in 2015 with the cps still considering charges against dozens of mps but some tories were more nervous with one mp first elected in 2015 with a relatively small majority over the liberal democrats saying he was preparing for a tough battle i m in a better position than some colleagues there is a few who are more panicky than me he said but it is still tricky for me i d have preferred to get more things done before i stood for election again and there is only so much you can do in less than two years five years gives you a chance to make your mark
2017-03-06,0,theresa may will not allow mps and peers a proper veto over her brexit deal in case it gives the eu the incentive to offer the uk bad terms her spokesman has said the prime minister believed the uk must not allow the establishment of a process that encouraged eu countries to scupper brexit he said on monday the warning came on the eve of a house of lords debate about giving mps and peers a meaningful vote at the end of two years of talks with brussels parliament is currently only being offered a take it or leave it vote accept may s brexit deal or leav e the eu with no deal and trade on world trade organisation terms instead however peers are expected to vote on a cross party basis for parliament to have the power to reject may s deal and send her back to the negotiating table if it does not like what she has achieved asked why the government would not accept a more meaningful vote may s official spokesman said the pm believes we should not commit to any process that would incentivise the eu to offer us a bad deal he said any deal that could be rejected by mps would give strength to other parties in the negotiation we believe it should be a simple bill in relation to triggering article 50 and nothing else downing street s position indicates the government will not accept any amendment passed by the lords in relation to a vote at the end of the two years of negotiations it is also sticking to its stance of refusing to guarantee the rights of eu citizens living in the uk until a similar guarantee is achieved for uk citizens in the rest of the eu the house of lords voted by 358 to 256 last week in favour of guaranteeing the rights of eu citizens in the uk as part of its scrutiny of the brexit bill mps are likely to reverse that change when the legislation returns to the commons and peers are expected to back down after that in order not to block the passage of the bill by the end of march when may wants to trigger article 50
2017-01-17,0,theresa may is expected to use the most important speech of her premiership to confirm that britain will be leaving the single market while insisting that it wants to remain the best friend to european partners in remarks that critics will cite as evidence that the government is pursuing a hard brexit the prime minister will say there is no option that leaves britain half in half out as she sets out 12 key priorities for the eu negotiations critically she will insist there will be no compromise over the ability to control borders and regain sovereignty speaking to an audience at lancaster house westminster including ambassadors from across the world may will stress her ambition to reach out beyond the continent to build new trading relationships in a move that suggests the uk will also leave the customs union however the prime minister is likely to restate an argument that she does not see it as an either or choice and say that whatever final deal on trade and customs duties is struck lorries will be able to pass through dover and other ports unhindered despite warnings from others on the issue we seek a new and equal partnership between an independent self governing global britain and our friends and allies in the eu not partial membership of the european union associate membership of the european union or anything that leaves us half in half out may is expected to say we do not seek to adopt a model already enjoyed by other countries we do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave the united kingdom is leaving the european union my job is to get the right deal for britain as we do advisers know the speech could have an impact on the value on sterling by confirming that the uk cannot stay in the single market but may will say that british voters backed brexit with their eyes open in a speech that will delight eurosceptic backbenchers she will avoid talking about soft or hard options but instead promise a clean break from the eu the priorities include control over immigration and removing britain from the jurisdiction of the european court of justice plus securing the rights of eu citizens in britain committing to retain workers rights building a strong trading relationship with the eu and rest of the world making britain an attractive place for investors and students and preserving the union may will say that these negotiating priorities will be driven by four underlying principles certainty and clarity a stronger britain a fairer britain and a truly global britain the prime minister will attempt to offer a more positive vision of the situation to other european countries our vote to leave the european union was no rejection of the values we share the decision to leave the eu represents no desire to become more distant to you our friends and neighbours we will continue to be reliable partners willing allies and close friends she will say we want to buy your goods sell you ours trade with you as freely as possible and work with one another to make sure we are all safer more secure and more prosperous through continued friendship may s words which sources say have had significant input from the foreign secretary boris johnson and brexit secretary david davis is likely to be cheered by mps who support brexit staff in downing street are also said to be positive about the speech which is expected to be long and detailed however many of may s opponents including some within the conservative party will despair at the lack of compromise on migration and sovereignty that will mean britain has no choice but to leave the european single market whitehall sources suggested that may had been urged to take a harder stance over brexit by cabinet colleagues who have argued that a rerun of the referendum would result in an even more emphatic victory for brexit in the region of 60 40 they believe the fact that the predicted economic downturn has not materialised means that voters are increasingly warming to the idea of britain s clean break the scottish national party is likely to react with anger to may s likely decision to ignore their demands to attempt to reach a special settlement for scotland under which it could stay a member of the internal market while retaining free movement of labour the first minister nicola sturgeon has warned that failure to heed the desires of the scottish government in the face of last june s remain vote north of the border could result in a second independence referendum angus robertson the party s leader in westminster said the prime minister should know that the snp and the scottish government are not bluffing we are deadly serious about protecting scotland s place in europe and i would expect to hear that she is taking this seriously if making keynote speech about brexit but i m not holding my breath tim farron the liberal democrat leader also hit out at may highlighting the fact she had been photographed for vogue magazine i assume they are going to change the name to vague for this edition to match her vision of our future trading relationship with europe she could get also a critical response from conservative backbenchers planning to tour radio and television studios on tuesday to respond to the speech meanwhile the swedish foreign minister ann linde told the guardian that it was inevitable that britain would have to leave the single market speaking during a trip to the uk which included a meeting with the brexit secretary the swedish politician said the messages i got from ministers is that there is no political possibility to keep free movement of people and the european court of justice it is not possible to be in the single market if those parameters are not there linde warned that leaving the customs union was not risk free with an official inquiry in sweden finding that 2 000 companies said it was particularly difficult to trade with norway which is outside the customs union she said that negotiations could take time with at least 15 months for exit talks before discussions about a new trade deal after that but linde insisted that she wanted the remaining member states the eu27 to embark on constructive negotiations with britain as it was in everybody s interest she said she hoped that may would strike a different tone on tuesday than in a speech during last september s conservative party conference that may was given an economic boost before the speech when the international monetary fund which had warned during the referendum campaign of a negative impact from a brexit vote upgraded its outlook for the british economy this year the imf said it expected the uk to grow by 1 5 up from a previous forecast of 1 1 however the washington based institution cut its forecast for 2018 from 1 7 to 1 4 owing to uncertainty over britain s unsettled exit terms investors displayed unease on the eve of may s speech with the ftse 100 index ending a record 14 day winning streak on monday the pound dipped below 1 20 at one point as it fell to a three month low reflecting concerns that the prime minister would confirm plans for a hard brexit the government will present tuesday s speech as its plan for exiting the eu as demanded by labour during a parliamentary vote however the shadow brexit secretary keir starmer argued that a one off speech is not the same as a plan for brexit he argued that may s priority should be the economy having spoken to businesses trade unions and communities across the uk it is clear what they need to hear that the prime minister will put jobs and the economy first ensure companies are able to trade without tariffs or additional impediments that there will be no watering down of key employment or environmental rights and that we will form a new cooperative relationship with the eu rupert harrison former chief of staff to george osborne at the treasury said he did not believe may was definitively ruling out leaving the customs union especially in key industries i think there is a possibility the uk will seek to remain in the customs union in some very important sectors where we have integrated supply chains across borders car manufacturing and aerospace harrison now chief macro strategist at blackrock said it was very difficult to imagine how you build an airbus aircraft without being in the customs union in some way or how some of the big car manufacturers who are shipping parts sometimes several times across borders can continue doing so without being in the customs union however prominent remain campaigners including former lib dem leader nick clegg and new labour cabinet minister peter mandelson voiced dismay at the proposals in the speech clegg told the guardian may was sending the signal that the needs and aspirations and interests of 16 1m fellow citizens counts for nothing mandelson said the prime minister was trying to conceal the difficult choices britain would be forced to make outside the single market and the customs union customs barriers add costs and delays which would mean we lose our market share he told bbc radio 4 a hard brexit is when financial and other services cannot access the eu market because regulators do not accept the equivalence of the new uk regulatory regime when staff needed to fill vacancies are not able to come here there are no clicky fingers solutions but not even to acknowledge that there are difficult choices that have to be made i think is very worrying the former eu trade commissioner said may had to make it absolutely clear that the country s interests come first not partisan interests and she is got to be a prime minister for the whole of the country not just those who voted to leave
2017-01-20,0,nigel farage s love affair with donald trump s america has taken another leap forward with news the former ukip leader is to become a commentator on fox news fox announced farage would be joining to provide political analysis on its main news channel and its business network in a short statement during trump s swearing in as the 45th us president fox is owned by rupert murdoch who has attempted to forge ties with trump following his victory and was also a backer of the campaign to leave the eu new york magazine s gabriel sherman has reported that the media mogul who owns the sun and times newspapers in london speaks to trump at least three times a week trump has publicly praised farage posing with him just after his election victory and tweeting that he would make a great ambassador to the us on thursday night farage and his ally aaron banks who bankrolled the leave eu campaign held a party at a washington hotel near the white house during the event farage repeatedly praised trump describing him as the only person i have ever met in my life who makes me feel like an introvert and saying that brexit is great but trump is brexit plus plus plus steve hilton the former adviser to david cameron who was also recently unveiled as a fox contributor was also at the party organised by banks and farage trump did not attend despite the organisers repeatedly suggesting he might it is unclear whether the fox role will affect farage s radio show on lbc which only began two weeks ago or his role as mep for south east england
2017-05-24,0,the first visible signs of the deployment of 984 soldiers on the streets of britain will be on wednesday afternoon outside downing street the houses of parliament and buckingham palace as they backfill guarding duties at key sites currently carried out by armed police officers both the prime minister and home secretary made clear in their announcement of the move that they are extremely wary of the political impact of the sight of armed soldiers patrolling the streets of britain and want to use them for as short a time as possible the threat level has only twice before been raised to critical since the system of official threat levels was introduced on 1 august 2006 it was raised for three days from 10 august 2006 at the time of the transatlantic airliner plot and on 30 june 2007 when the security services uncovered the plot to bomb a nightclub on london s haymarket this was a plot that culminated in the attack on glasgow airport the threat level was reduced to severe three days later on 13 august 2007 after suspects were arrested as far afield as australia however already there are warnings to the police that this time the critical threat may last up to a week the use of troops in aid to the civil power on the streets of britain is a major move by the security chiefs and directly flows from the decision to raise the threat level from severe meaning an attack is likely to critical meaning an attack is expected imminently as theresa may explained when she made the decision public this means that armed police officers responsible for duties such as guarding key sites will be replaced by members of the armed forces which will allow the police to significantly increase the number of armed officers on patrol in key locations you might also see military personnel deployed at certain events such as concerts and sports matches helping the police to keep the public safe in all circumstances members of the armed forces who are deployed in this way will be under the command of police officers sports events are expected to include this weekend s fa cup final the announcement of the move to a critical threat level on tuesday night was unusual in recent years changes in the threat level have been announced by the home secretary alone on a recommendation from the independent joint terrorism analysis centre jtac the decision was also unusual in that mi5 s definition of a critical threat is that an attack is expected imminently may did not say this in her late night statement instead she said only that it was a possibility we cannot ignore that there is a wider group of individuals linked to this attack and that a further attack may be imminent this is different and does not mean that they know an active cell including a potential bomber is at large but that they fear it may be the case and need to be cautious for both may and amber rudd one major reason for their anxiety will be that the sight of armed troops on the streets will provoke accusations of moves towards a french style militarised police state and inevitable speculation that in the middle of a general election campaign the decision comes with political overtones as well as from operational necessity the last time the use of troops under operation temperer was considered was immediately after the terrorist attacks in paris but in the face of defence reservations they were only used covertly as backup for the visible armed police presence at railway stations and airports and so this is the first time the plan has been fully activated both may and rudd will be also be mindful of the reaction to a 2003 decision by tony blair to deploy 400 soldiers and three scimitar armoured cars at heathrow airport in response to an alleged plot for a missile attack on aircraft blair was sharply criticised for his send in the tanks style response to a terrorist threat defence chiefs are also anxious about the use of their troops on the streets they look at france where an initial deployment in the immediate aftermath of the brussels and paris attacks has proved far from temporary indeed their numbers have since been increased and armed soldiers patrolling the streets are now a common sight even in towns in rural france the military has also voiced concerns about overstretch and the morale of the troops being used operation temperer means that up to 3 800 armed troops can be deployed at sensitive sites and events transport hubs and other crowded public places in order to release the armed police for other policing duties they can only be used to augment armed police officers engaged in protective security duties and can only be authorised by a cobra emergency meeting the prime minister went out of her way to stress that the armed troops would be under the direct command of the police who would also determine where and how they are used the home secretary also stressed it was a temporary measure the decision to increase the threat level was taken by jtac which analyses and assesses all intelligence relating to international terrorism in britain and overseas it brings together counter terrorism experts from the police security services and whitehall departments they include charles farr chairman of the joint intelligence committee and mark sedwill national security adviser who both worked very closely with may at the home office as may indicated it met repeatedly on tuesday to assess the level of threat in the morning it decided that the threat level should remain at severe but as the police investigation continued into the associates of the manchester suicide bomber salman abedi they took the decision to raise it to the highest level as the prime minister explained the possibility of a wider network being behind abedi s attack justified their decision the clear implication is that he came from a terrorist jihadi cell some elements of which may well still be active and a real danger
2017-04-01,0,an urgent review of weak and helpless electoral laws is being demanded by a group of leading academics who say that uncontrolled dark money poses a threat to the fundamental principles of british democracy a working group set up by the london school of economics warns that new technology has disrupted british politics to such an extent that current laws are unable to ensure a free and fair election or control the influence of money in politics damian tambini director of the media policy project at the lse who heads the group made up of leading experts in the field said that new forms of online campaigning had not only changed the ways that political parties target voters but crucially had also altered the ability of big money interests to manipulate political debate there is a real danger we are heading down the us route where whoever spends the most money is most likely to win that is why we have always controlled spending in this country but these controls are no longer working its policy brief published on saturday concludes that current laws can no longer ensure the fundamental principle of a level playing field or guard against foreign influence and that parliament urgently needs to review uk electoral law it comes as questions continue to be asked about spending during the referendum campaign in an interview published in sunday s observer new review arron banks the founder of the leave eu campaign says we were just cleverer than the regulators and the politicians of course we were the electoral commission is investigating whether work that the data analytics firm cambridge analytica may have done for leave eu constitutes an undeclared donation from an impermissible foreign donor cambridge analytica is majority owned by the hedge fund billionaire robert mercer who bankrolled donald trump filings from the white house disclosed on friday that steve bannon donald trump s strategy chief was paid 125 333 by the firm last year asked whether he was worried about the electoral commission s investigation into leave eu banks said i do not give a monkey s about the electoral commission banks also claimed that vote leave cheated to get around campaign financing rules by donating money to third party campaigns they cheated they gave 650 grand to a student come on they absolutely 100 cheated a spokesman for vote leave responded the electoral commission gave us a clean bill of health privately the commission admitted that the only penalties it was allowed to impose by law offered no deterrent to political parties particularly in a one off referendum in addition the lse found that loopholes in electoral law mean that spending by political parties during the referendum was almost entirely unregulated or even recorded the real cost of the campaign building databases to target voters via social media occurred almost entirely outside the period regulated by law tambini said we do not have a system that is working any more in this country we have had laws to control spending by political campaigns but online campaigning has changed everything and none of the existing laws cover it the ability to throw around large amounts of cash is almost completely uncontrolled the key costs in campaigning building the databases is happening during the period when campaign spending is not regulated at all there is a real danger that public trust in the democratic process will be lost there is real potential for foreign influence we have now the ability to manipulate public opinion on a level we have never seen before and the current framework is weak and helpless the electoral commission has not yet made any public statement but privately it said we did have this environment that guaranteed a level playing field but with the shift online that has all changed we will not be able to limit the power of money in elections that is what we are very concerned about tambini said it is urgent there could be a wholesale loss of trust in the process as the result of a scandal or swinging of an election though some would argue that has already happened there has to be a principle of transparency the public needs to know where the money is coming from and we do not martin moore director of the centre for the study of media communication and power at king s college london said the machinery of campaigning had changed so rapidly the law has had no chance to catch up the first election where digital made a difference was in 2008 and now it is where pretty much all the spending is it has been a shift that has happened in less than 10 years what we are seeing is exactly the same sort of disruption that we have seen in news and music and other industries that is exactly what is happening in politics the problem is that if you disrupt politics you are also disrupting the democratic process and you are creating a very dangerous or volatile situation in addition the electoral commission said privately that it did not have the resources to monitor campaigns in real time it is just not practical there is some proactive stuff that we can do but we simply do not have the resources the only action it can take is once the campaign is over and then the only penalties are fines which campaigns can simply cost into their spends
2017-06-21,0,theresa may will press ahead with a brexit dominated queen s speech shorn of a series of controversial social policies after failing to complete confidence and supply negotiations with the democratic unionist party the conservative leader will become the first prime minister in decades to lay out a legislative programme without a guaranteed house of commons majority after dup sources said the two party negotiations have not proceeded in the way we would have expected the northern irish party accused downing street negotiators of being chaotic and said the conservative high command ought to stop their backbenchers whingeing about the dup and show our party some respect the dup added that the party cannot be taken for granted no 10 sought to brush off the intervention with may promising on tuesday that she would use the queen s speech to respond with humility and resolve to the message the electorate sent after the snap general election left the tories with 318 seats eight short of an overall majority plans for a new generation of grammar schools will be among a number of high profile policies to be dropped by the pm in a speech which will instead emphasise brexit counterterrorism and the least controversial aspects of the domestic agenda the speech is likely to steer clear of any mention of contentious issues such as gay marriage or abortion ian lavery the chair of the labour party accused may of having no mandate no authority and no programme to even win support in parliament for those areas of policy this is chaos from a weak and wobbly prime minister he said at the moment it looks like the tories are unable to put together even a basic programme for government in the queen s speech or stitch together a stable deal with the dup to stay in office tory sources insisted the government was confident of winning support for its legislative agenda with an agreement with the dup still expected to be signed off on thursday well before next week s crucial parliamentary vote on the queen s speech defeat for may in that vote would mean her government would fall may s own backbenchers including some of her most vociferous critics also made clear that they would back the government at this point although made no promises for continued support in the medium term in order to secure enough parliamentary backing may will have to scrap plans to end free school meals for younger pupils and drop her party s social care policy including means testing of the winter fuel allowance alongside lifting the ban on selective schools she insisted however that she would be pushing ahead with brexit legislation including a great repeal bill to bring eu regulations into uk law and a series of other bills linked to customs trade immigration and agriculture much has been said in recent days about what the general election signified about britain s decision to leave the eu she said responding to a clamour from some for a softer form of brexit given the new parliamentary mathematics the fact is that over 80 of the electorate backed the two major parties both of whom campaigned on manifestos that said we should honour the democratic decision of the british people a cabinet minister said jeremy corbyn s party was essentially in the same position as the tories when it came to ending free movement and leaving the single market despite a number of backbench labour mps questioning the position the shadow chancellor john mcdonnell said labour would seek to create alliances with tory rebels and other parties to reverse some of the most dangerous cuts of austerity there is a whole range of issues around austerity where we think there may well be majorities in parliament now to reverse some of the proposals particularly those brought forward in the last budget he told bbc radio 4 s today programme we will finalise the drafting of amendments over next the next few days we will wait to see the queen s speech today from all the reports it is pretty light but remember most of the austerity that is rolling forwards is from the budget and we will not see another budget until the autumn may said her government would be one that consults and listens as she struck a more conciliatory tone after the election seriously weakened her leadership and resulted in the loss of her two closest advisers nick timothy and fiona hill the election result was not the one i hoped for but this government will respond with humility and resolve to the message the electorate sent may said we will work hard every day to gain the trust and confidence of the british people making their priorities our priorities she will face a tense atmosphere on wednesday with protesters planning a day of rage march on parliament in protest at the government s handling of the grenfell tower tragedy organisers have written on facebook that they hope to bring down the government and shut down london a difficult few weeks for may led to her facing crowds chanting coward after initially failing to meet people affected by the fire as well as the series of brexit bills may is expected to respond to recent attacks in manchester london bridge westminster and finsbury park with beefed up counter terrorism plans including a focus on social media there will also be some uncontroversial domestic moves including a civil liability bill to tackle a rampant compensation culture in which whiplash claims have spiked there will also be a financial guidance and claims bill to help consumers make effective decisions and draft legislation on cracking down on domestic violence particularly where children are involved and pushing ahead with plans to ban letting fees for renters sources said the queen s speech would also include a consultation on social care and a bill on mental health but nothing on the nhs more widely in order to pass the legislation next week may is almost certain to need the support of the 10 dup mps to give her a majority in the commons problems have emerged in the discussions between the tories and the dup with unionist sources saying backbiting from tory backbenchers against their party had stiffened their resolve to dig in they said complaints by tory mps about having to deal with the dup had gone down badly they attempted to bounce us into a deal on saturday night and then we had the backbenchers saying that we were unsavoury etc there is also a concern within the dup that extra spending in northern ireland could trigger a barrage of complaints from english scottish and welsh tories over the special treatment the dup wants to abolish air passenger duty for northern ireland s airports but there are concerns that a special deal could lead to demands for the same elsewhere in the uk the dup deal is likely to be one of confidence through which the party will back the queen s speech and support the government in any confidence votes and supply which refers to support for budgets and financial measures hannah white the director of research for the institute for government thinktank explained how may would have to operate to survive the parliament getting legislation through the commons should be possible with effective whipping she said while government and opposition numbers on public bill committees will be evenly balanced procedural conventions around the way the chair votes when a committee vote is tied mean the conservatives should be able to get bills through committees without any amendments then drawing on the support of the dup or other parties they may be able to make any amendments they need at the report stage may will however face fierce resistance to some of her brexit legislation with a parliament in which opponents of a hard brexit feel emboldened by the general election result frances o grady the tuc general secretary said theresa may failed to win a mandate at the ballot box for her no deal brexit instead we need a brexit deal that puts jobs and rights at work first she said the great repeal bill must not be allowed to get away with eroding the rights that working people got from the eu other campaign groups including global justice now and another europe is possible claimed the legislation could result in a decimation of rights
2017-03-18,0,i moved to bearwood in smethwick in the hot summer of 1976 we were moving up leaving behind the sixth floor of a block on the sprawling lee bank council estate for a house and garden in a safer area with large parks and better schools a few miles from birmingham i grew up there in the 70s and 80s when there was optimism about our future the colour bar experienced by a first generation of immigrants in the 60s in some shops and the bingo hall had been replaced by our own why would i want to go there anyway self induced bar the days when a conservative party candidate could run and win in 1964 on the slogan if you want a nigger for a neighbour vote liberal or labour seemed distant my mother is jamaican and like many of my generation i failed the norman tebbit test completely i did not support any england team i would rehearse long debates about how i might reject a call up for the england rugby team even if my ability meant that call would never come jamaica was great for holidays but did not feel like home everyone there called me english so while i was always a smethwick boy i can still pinpoint the moment i first felt british in 1992 when linford christie won the 100m at the barcelona olympics this most jamaican of men running around the track with the british flag we had grown up hearing songs like there ain t no black in the union jack what christie s gesture said was i m british deal with it a mistrust of foreigners has been singled out as the driving force behind last year s vote to leave europe but why did places where more than 50 of the population have recent origins outside the uk vote for a policy of exclusion smethwick is in many ways typical of the radical changes to britain s racial demographic since the second world war in the 50s and 60s commonwealth citizens from the indian subcontinent and the caribbean emigrated here to alleviate job shortages particularly in the nhs and transport a large number of sikhs moved from the punjab to work in smethwick s foundries later waves of immigration brought asylum seekers students and workers from around the world when i was growing up my white british friends liked the same music played the same games and ate the same food as we did we knew people who joined far right groups but the various gangs were largely multiracial affiliated to the area more than anything else a loose smethwick posse there would be running battles with skinheads from quinton and beyond i cannot remember a saturday night that was not punctuated by someone being glassed or having a pool cue wrapped around their head today smethwick is home to a more diverse range of communities it is still a relatively cheap place to live so new arrivals often start off here you will see eritrean church services in victoria park eastern european supermarkets on cape hill a ghanaian wedding at the community centre alongside the more established sikh temples and african caribbean churches speaking to smethwick friends from white british and second generation immigrant backgrounds you hear support for brexit from a diverse range of perspectives there is the fortress europe argument people of commonwealth origin not being able to move to the uk because preference is given to eu citizens british asian shopkeepers who do not like the polish shops stealing business an objection to the thatcherite capitalist structure enshrined in the eu underlying all these things is a powerful revolt against what is perceived to be a self serving political elite none of the second or third generation immigrants i met on a recent visit to smethwick thought nigel farage would deliver a harmonious society founded on principles of social justice but the supposed social justice champions labour today have far less connection to the people they seek to represent than they once did today s politicians speak relentlessly about engaging and understanding these alienated communities but even their use of the word community is loaded often based on race or religion or class as if there were no diversity of opinion among them what does the future hold for smethwick in a post brexit britain my more pessimistic side worries that inequality will increase as the fight for a share of an ever smaller pie is orchestrated by a privileged few who use alienation fear and loathing to divide and rule but a bigger part of me is optimistic a younger generation has always found ways of creating new relationships with other like minded people be they italian irish ghanaian nigerian or indian it might feel claustrophobic at this moment in time and smethwick will struggle with the macro issues but there are enough people there with goodwill who want to come together who will want to get on with it hamish crooks my little boy and i moved here from birmingham in 2009 i had separated from his father and when i got here we did not know anybody smethwick is an interesting area because the diversity works really well everyone seems to get on where we live but there are some negative aspects of multiculturalism for example there is no non halal butcher around here and i do not want to eat halal meat because they do not always stun the animal before they kill it i feel it is a bit cruel i ve had a row a few times with shops advertising places to rent with signs saying indian family wanted i said you do know that is illegal do not you i remember when they used to have signs up saying no irish no blacks my little boy is the only white english kid in his class and they do not celebrate any english things at all they did not do anything for the queen s jubilee or birthday i do not mind him celebrating jamaica day or whatever i just wish they would also incorporate english things on ve day i took him into birmingham to see the celebrations because he has to celebrate his history as well but he is absolutely oblivious to the fact that other people are a different colour to him i think children of his generation are integrating more a lot of immigrants here say they do not want any more immigrants but i have not heard many white people say they voted brexit because of immigration i do not know whether it is because they are scared of being accused of being racist i voted brexit because of all the money that is wasted on the eu i do not think it will stop free movement and i do not think it means we will not have any trade i just think it means we will have a bit more control a lot of people have had enough of meps making so much money and not doing anything who can name an mep really we do not seem to be getting any more rights out of it why not trim off all that excess spending and use it on things we do need there is a crisis in social care and health services are being cut the schools are constantly fighting cuts when you read about brexit in the paper they say the people who voted for brexit did not know what was going on it is hugely insulting to assume that just because we are poor we do not read newspapers and we are all thick they have got no concept of what it is like to be poor and how miserable people really are i think it was a good result and i think it taught the government to be careful what they wish for because they did all this with no plan whatsoever they were so sure remain was going to win it serves them right i ve lived in smethwick all my life my parents came from north india so my dad could work in the foundry they were invited over just like the europeans were i ve never had an issue with anyone thinking i m less british than they are but when punjabi people came here they could not speak english so they were victimised once my dad took me for a drink in the local pub and this guy at the bar started talking to him inappropriately saying butbut dingding i asked my dad why does he do this and he said he is been doing it for years it is not an issue i took the guy aside and said have you been taking the piss out of my dad for 20 years he said what do you mean he never said anything to this day that guy still buys me a drink in the pub because he remembers that chat i changed the way he thought everybody i know voted leave i voted leave because of my daughters who are 12 and 15 they go to a grammar school and they feel held back because the foreigners coming into the school do not speak english well it makes the classes go slower it was also because polish people are cutting off my work i m a painter and decorator and i m not getting the rates i used to because the polish people are undercutting us that is the case generally in the building trade but i m angry that my parents voted out i m very bitter about that it is the hypocrisy of it because they came over from india and they had an opportunity to integrate and they have not my mum still barely speaks english they have made lives and families for people like me they worked hard everyone else is just trying to do the same as they did i think the way the sikh community voted was hypocritical sometimes i regret voting brexit in hindsight without a shadow of a doubt we did not have enough information it was turned into an immigration issue which it was not and as a whole we are going to lose out other times i stick by my decision i need to think about where my work s coming from i moved to smethwick in 1976 looking for work i also had a pen friend here we belonged to different divorced and separated clubs i was the vice chairman of the one in portsmouth where i lived and they used to have a magazine and she advertised for a pen friend we were writing for two years before i moved here we married in 1977 and were together for 39 years she ended up having two major strokes one of which should have killed her but the hospital brought her round i got another nine months with her smethwick has changed a lot much of the old industry has gone there were dirty factories steel works and car component workshops now they are all new factories or houses so in that way it is better we have got more immigrants than whites the shops are virtually all asian and the well known ones like woolworths and david greig s are gone it is less british because i ve found working with some of them that half the asians do not want to mix a very nice lad used to sit with us during the tea break and he came in one morning and told us that someone in the factory had told his dad he sat with us and his father had said you are not to sit with them you are to sit with your own people it makes you feel what is wrong with us i voted for brexit because i think the common market has got out of hand i think they waste an awful lot of money moving their offices once a month from brussels to strasbourg and back again what we are paying them is unbelievable billions a year which would do our own health service and schools good i d like to see free movement from europe cancelled this country cannot keep on taking people the services cannot cope with the influx and there are not enough houses when we won i thought great let us get on with it i feel more strongly now let us get out i ve been living in smethwick since 2002 when i migrated from bangladesh to study for an mba at birmingham city university after completing my mba i managed to secure a job now i m living here happily with my wife and two children my son is nine and my daughter is seven smethwick has become overpopulated and there are more new faces with a slight increase in antisocial behaviour over the past few years the demand for housing has increased i had heard about that campaign slogan if you want a nigger for a neighbour vote liberal or labour from the 1964 local election and that malcolm x came to visit the year after which is amazing but to be honest i do not think racial tension is a big issue now from my experience people do understand others their religions their values their cultural dimensions and characteristics it could be an isolated judgment but i have not seen the nasty side of community cohesion people get along quite well basically i felt brexit was a protest vote to show a lost trust in politics traditional politicians are failing to deliver people feel european migrants are putting unnecessary undue pressure on public services the nhs school places housing and that if we come out of europe that will ease the pressure these are the day to day issues that people are fed up with i voted and actively campaigned to remain i was really really shattered by the result because in the age of globalisation and connectivity and at such a crucial time this is not the right decision it is going backwards and it was not an informed decision the message we are sending to the rest of the world is that we are not open or collaborative we do not want to work with other people we are detaching ourselves nine months on i do not feel any more positive i ve given up on trying to give reasons to remain because i m in the minority but i know people who regret voting brexit they justify it by saying the politicians misled them i ve lived here my whole life i was born in hamble near southampton but my mother died having me so i was brought here to live with my grandparents smethwick has changed enormously my road used to be full of bank managers and teachers and there were no foreign people of any description i remember seeing men wearing turbans for the first time when i was 10 or 11 and had taken my two cousins out for a walk one of them said hello and i said to my cousins run because i had no idea i d never seen sikh people before my father was very racist but i m definitely not the priest at my church is nigerian and we have 22 other nationalities people of all colours shapes and sizes and we all get on the first foreigners who came were west indians and the others have come gradually i consider them all friends a lady down the road surinder and i were once opposite each other in the hospital and we have been firm friends ever since she called me when i came out asked how i was and said if you need anything at all let me know and my family will get it for you there are lots of kind people about i voted brexit i did not vote for us to go into brussels i voted for the common market and i think we were cheated in that respect we have not only got to trade with europe there is a whole world we can deal with i m looking forward to getting back to how we were running our own farms being able to look after ourselves perhaps i m wrong but this is how i feel that we were not told the full story back in 1975 we were just told it was good to be part of a common market we were not told they would be ruling us i m not really into politics but the vote happened and i get cross when they try to reverse it now i think let us just get on with it i was born in london my parents were from zimbabwe although it was called rhodesia at the time we left the uk in 1977 to go to nigeria my dad was a civil engineer and had a job with the nigerian government building several highways towards the end of 1982 we went to live in zimbabwe in 1995 i moved to brighton where i met my wife catherine and in 2008 we moved to smethwick with our month old daughter i wanted to study mental health nursing at birmingham city university but changed my mind after three weeks i did not think it was something i would cope with emotionally in 2009 i started a course in international business and economics at aston university instead we had three other children they are now eight seven four and two and they all settled in school so we stayed i ve spent the majority of my life in this country and i am british the main change i ve seen here is the people coming from poland i do not think there is a lot of tension between the different communities everybody just gets on what i worry about is the self imposed segregation these monocultural ghettos that are springing up pakistanis in one area polish people in another white working class in another it seems everybody is more comfortable with people who look the same as them which is quite sad whether that is a conscious thing or if it just happens naturally i do not know i was shocked by brexit i voted to remain at university i learned to critically analyse things and i was always arguing against the leave campaign s points of view usually when there is an election i stay up late to find out who my mp is going to be but this time i was confident we would remain it was a big surprise when i spoke to some of the parents at my children s school most had voted to leave i was surprised and upset my point of view has not changed it does not make sense to me that people want to leave the biggest market then try to negotiate a good deal within that market but i have accepted it it is democracy right this project was created in partnership with magnum photos for more pictures go to

2017-05-02,0,there is nothing more traditionally british on a visit to the seaside than eating chips in the open air but during a campaign visit to cornwall on tuesday theresa may looked distinctly uncomfortable while tucking into a cone of them pictured on a walkabout in mevagissey may looked for all the world like she had never eaten chips before or at least not without a knife and fork may was visiting the st austell and newquay constituency that the conservative steve double took from the liberal democrats in the 2015 election one of a number of seats in the south west where the tories ousted their coalition partners over the weekend may was criticised for her robotic and awkward performances on the andrew marr show and peston on sunday and these pictures will do little to dispel the feeling that may can be ill at ease at public events one theory that has emerged however is that may look awkward faced with an unexpected carbohydrate intake she has previously revealed she has type 1 diabetes twitter users were quick to mock the pictures may s campaign has repeatedly been criticised for keeping her away from the general public local people were excluded from campaign speech in leeds and there were accusations that she was hiding while campaigning in scotland when she held a rally in a tiny community hall in aberdeenshire with such poor phone reception that live coverage of the event was impossible on wednesday the may campaign banned cornwall s biggest news website from filming a visit to a factory jacqui merrington digital editor of cornwall live said a number of us have had an experience with david cameron and tony blair visiting this was much more restricted than we have seen in the past eating during a general election campaign can be a minefield for party leaders a photograph of ed miliband attempting to eat a bacon sandwich became one of the iconic images of opposition to the then labour leader during the 2015 election campaign making the front page of the sun the day before the vote
2017-02-25,0,the us billionaire who helped bankroll donald trump s campaign for the presidency played a key role in the campaign for britain to leave the eu the observer has learned it has emerged that robert mercer a hedge fund billionaire who helped to finance the trump campaign and who was revealed this weekend as one of the owners of the rightwing breitbart news network is a long time friend of nigel farage he directed his data analytics firm to provide expert advice to the leave campaign on how to target swing voters via facebook a donation of services that was not declared to the electoral commission cambridge analytica an offshoot of a british company scl group which has 25 years experience in military disinformation campaigns and election management claims to use cutting edge technology to build intimate psychometric profiles of voters to find and target their emotional triggers trump s team paid the firm more than 6m 4 8m to target swing voters and it has now emerged that mercer also introduced the firm in which he has a major stake to farage the communications director of leave eu andy wigmore told the observer that the longstanding friendship between nigel farage and the mercer family led mercer to offer his help free to the brexit campaign because of their shared goals wigmore said that he introduced farage and leave eu to cambridge analytica they were happy to help because nigel is a good friend of the mercers and mercer introduced them to us he said here s this company we think may be useful to you what they were trying to do in the us and what we were trying to do had massive parallels we shared a lot of information the strategy involved harvesting data from people s facebook and other social media profiles and then using machine learning to spread through their networks wigmore admitted the technology and the level of information it gathered from people was creepy he said the campaign used this information combined with artificial intelligence to decide who to target with highly individualised advertisements and had built a database of more than a million people based on advice cambridge analytica supplied two weeks ago arron banks leave eu s founder stated in a series of tweets that gerry gunster leave eu s pollster and cambridge analytica with world class ai had helped them gain unprecedented levels of engagement ai won it for leave he said by law all donations of services in kind worth more than 7 500 must be reported to the electoral commission a spokesman said that no donation from the company or mercer to leave eu had been filed brittany kaiser an employee of cambridge analytica scl appeared on a panel at a leave eu press conference to explain the technology behind the campaign and in documents leave eu filed with the commission it reported that cambridge analytica was a strategic partner the observer reported in december that cambridge analytica had worked on the leave campaign and received a letter from the campaign to say this was untrue it later wrote to say it is a us company based in the us it has not worked in british politics it declined to comment last week on whether it had donated services to leave eu leave eu declined to say why it had not declared any donation of services to the electoral commission mercer and his daughter rebekah are emerging as key figures in the ascendancy of trump and as the observer details today the strategic disruption of the mainstream media a brilliant computer scientist who did pioneering work at ibm in ai mercer made billions with renaissance technologies a hedge fund that specialises in automated trading as well as financing trump s campaign he encouraged trump to take on two key advisers steve bannon and kellyanne conway and on saturday the washington post revealed him as one of the owners of breitbart bannon s role within the trump administration is being increasingly examined but until now mercer s connection has escaped the same sort of close scrutiny particularly with regard to the media breitbart which has become the leading platform for the alt right is only one of a series of investments that aim to change the media landscape and political views not just in the us but also in britain a british version of breitbart was launched in 2014 bannon told the new york times explicitly to try to influence the upcoming general election he and farage have been close friends since at least 2012 and the site has been an important cheerleader for ukip with its editor raheem kassam at one point working as chief adviser to farage until now however it was not known that mercer had explicitly tried to influence the outcome of the referendum drawing on cambridge analytica s advice leave eu built up a huge database of supporters creating detailed profiles of their lives through open source data it harvested via facebook the campaign then sent thousands of different versions of advertisements to people depending on what it had learned of their personalities a leading expert on the impact of technology on elections called the relevation extremely disturbing and quite sinister martin moore of king s college london said that undisclosed support in kind is extremely troubling it undermines the whole basis of our electoral system that we should have a level playing field but details of how people were being targeted with this technology raised more serious questions he said we have no idea what people were being shown or not which makes it frankly sinister maybe it was not but we have no way of knowing there is no possibility of public scrutiny i find this extremely worrying and disturbing
2017-06-03,0,a week before a british election that was meant to be a foregone conclusion theresa may finds herself where no conservative prime minister ever wants to be neck deep in political hot water in the genteel city of bath home to a comfortable tory majority in the 2015 general election this ought to be a parliamentary constituency where the passage of yet more polling should barely cause a murmur may s surprise decision to call another election was intended to raid deep into opposition labour territory and bolster her narrow majority of mps in time for forthcoming brexit negotiations instead the vicar s daughter who inherited the keys to number 10 downing street after the brexit referendum result forced the early departure of david cameron has watched her 20 point lead in the national opinion polls evaporate now she is forced to defend stronghold seats like bath rather than dream of a landslide victory on thursday just why the former home secretary has lost her reputation for being a safe pair of hands is vividly apparent during a visit to an engineering factory just beyond the city s georgian stone splendour despite rehearsing her well drilled message that only a strong and stable tory majority can force a palatable outcome from eu negotiators may is berated by a woman from the company s export office who wants to know how it is going to sell its products without access to the european single market another factory worker demands to know what on earth she was doing proposing a so called dementia tax in the party s disastrously received election manifesto though brexit remains popular nationally and equally problematic for her labour opponent jeremy corbyn he has succeeded in shifting the debate to social issues an hour earlier he decides to upstage the prime minister by agreeing to a televised debate that night a previously supine british press pack is suddenly shouting about why she is not willing to attend the debate outside the factory a crowd has gathered to reprise a hit chant from the end of the last period of conservative dominance in the 1990s when local mp chris patten also lost this seat tories out they shout may s strong and stable mantra looks more and more like a millstone despite its dominance of 20th century british politics the conservative party has a curious knack for shooting itself in the foot sir edward heath a predecessor of may s who was the last to ask the queen to dissolve parliament ahead of time and call a snap election found that his rallying cry who governs britain was met with the wounding answer not you that 1974 election was the first to take place after britain joined the european economic community do you want a strong government which has clear authority for the future to take decisions which will be needed asked heath in an eerie echo of theresa may against the topsy turvy political backdrop following the 2016 referendum to leave the united kingdom is perhaps in even less mood to be taken for granted now whether corbyn really threatens an upset as shocking as the brexit result or the election of donald trump remains to be seen despite a dramatic narrowing of some national polls the same opinion sampling industry which showed him beyond all hope a couple of weeks ago remains almost as loathed and suspect as the political establishment traditional polling companies which weight responses according to historic turnout rates show may with a still comfortable two digit lead upset can only really come if corbyn defies demographic inertia and persuades millions of young people to come out and vote for his message of income redistribution and free university tuition experts brand polls utter tripe blasted the europhobic sun newspaper when may first appeared to stumble for labour the closest political analogy is neither brexit nor trump but corbyn s american political doppelgänger bernie sanders who was coincidentally in britain this weekend for a book signing tour to explain why he lost nonetheless britain s parliamentary system offers some intriguing possibilities even if this year s fiery leftwinger fails to ignite political revolution despite her current majority of 17 mps may called the election to give herself breathing room ahead of tricky brexit talks that start on 19 june with labour in apparent disarray after disastrous local government elections tory strategists had hoped she might even win the sort of three digit lead not seen since margaret thatcher or tony blair now the prime minister is warning voters that the loss of just six seats is all that stands between her and a potentially unstable alliance led by corbyn coalition governments have had a suspiciously foreign feel in britain since the liberal democrats lib dems helped prop up cameron s first government and labour currently insist they would not enter into a formal alliance with either the lib dems or scottish nationalists snp but since both these two smaller parties are passionately committed to remaining in the eu a so called hung parliament could test the resolve of either of the two dominant supporters of brexit britain s ongoing political uncertainty also comes against a backdrop of fading economic growth and rising security fears the national shock following the terror attack in manchester and irritation at the way details of the police investigation were leaked by us security sources has only underlined how dependent britain is on international alliances that have been thrown into turmoil by brexit and trump may s latest political dilemma is how to respond to trump s rejection of the paris climate accord join the g7 outrage and risk offending her last international ally or continue to provide only muted criticism and risk being accused of inheriting blair s role as poodle to a loathed american master the election that was meant to be all about brexit has turned out to be anything but national security social affairs even a surprise tory proposal to bring back fox hunting all are looming almost as large in the minds of voters as they head back to the polls on 8 june may had predicted this would be hunting season she did not expect to find herself in the role of the fox
2017-06-25,0,this blog is wrapping up now our election results live blog manned by andrew sparrow who will be taking you through the night is live now thanks for reading if you thought the offer of a free banksy print subsequently withdrawn as it was warned it could invalidate the results was good with just over an hour until the polls end the actor and comedian david schneider has offered some tongue in cheek i should add in case the electoral commission is reading incentives to get out and vote liz a lib dem supporter in the south london marginal of kingston and surbiton where ed davey is trying to take his old seat back from tory politician james berry has been pounding the street this evening offering lifts to the polling station apparently cleggmania lives on if this picture she sent from the lib dem hq toilets is anything to go by she says the lib dems are hopeful but not confident about davey s prospects she writes a steady stream of volunteers is flowing in and out of the k amps ld hq as we are collecting the names of any potential voters who we think might not have voted yet it has been a long day some were out at 6am dropping election day leaflets and are still going fuelled by orange squash biscuits and bananas and if that is not enough to keep us going the lifesize clegg in the ladies loo should do it we are hopeful but not overconfident ed davey is very popular with the locals but there is a sense that national politics is going back to a two party system and this is impacting how people vote locally not giving up though in 1997 ed won with just 56 votes so we know that every last vote is crucial this is the advice to people affected by the problems in newcastle under lyme another overseas voter has got in touch about problems that stopped him voting james pellington writes from the united states i was told my overseas registration had expired apparently i have to re register every year and then while re registering was told that my identity could not be confirmed this is despite me registering in the exact same address as previously registered i need to find another british voter who is registered overseas to confirm my identity eventually the election office agreed that i was the same person that they had previously registered then i also needed to register to vote by postal ballot and after providing my overseas address was told i needed to provide an address in the uk when they finally agreed to register me at my overseas address they sent the ballot paper so that it arrived on monday despite having registered several weeks before i arrived at the post office first thing on monday morning and they told that to get it there before polls closed would cost 80 62 and they could not guarantee thursday delivery in the end i could not justify such a cost for a vote that may or or may not be counted particularly since my constituency seat is considered safe i m not sure if this experience mirrors other overseas voters but the process is definitely flawed paul farrelly labour s candidate in newcastle under lyme where keele university students have been complaining of being turned away despite having voter cards has been scathing in his criticism of the electoral services department he will be taking up the issues experienced today and in the run up to the election with the electoral commission the electoral services department here in newcastle is a shambles and there is chaos which is denying people votes on a scale unprecedented in my 30 years of fighting and organising elections we have spent the past week firefighting over scores of postal votes which have not arrived and we not only have lots of registration applications that have not been processed but people including students being turned away when they are indeed registered each passing hour is not only spoiling election day but just adding to the issues for complaint which i will be referring tomorrow to the electoral commission and other bodies for an independent outside investigation the reality is that electoral services in newcastle have been all over the place since a licensing fiasco led to the departure of good experienced staff last summer more on the reports that some voters from keele university have been turned away ben anderson a history lecturer at the university who had reached out via our election callout told the guardian there have been students who have not been able to vote because they have not appeared on the registers supplied to officers the polling officers have been doing their best to sort that out but there is clearly an issue there were a number there holding their polling cards so i am sure there were genuine because the assumption is that they registered too late and were not on the list for that reason there are suggestions that hundreds could have been turned away there have been reports of students from keele university being turned away at polling stations despite being eligible to vote the reported problem is in the constituency of newcastle under lyme where labour won by just 650 votes from the conservatives at the last election in 2015 and where ukip is not standing this time in a post directed towards students the university s english department appeared to acknowledge there were problems suggesting it was because some registrations were not on the lists sent out to polling stations more queues building up as people finish work and students get out of bed that is a joke by the way a bad one admittedly before you send me your outraged comments the national federation of cypriots in the uk has been urging members to get out and vote for candidates who support the island the federation which represents more than 300 000 britons of cypriot origin the largest and most significant community of cypriots outside of cyprus itself has listed parliamentary candidates who have signed the federation s cypruspledgecard it says go out and vote for the candidates that have demonstrated real support for cyprus in the past have campaigned for a free united cyprus and have campaigned against the turkish occupation we must ensure that these candidates from all political parties are elected by casting our votes and having our voice heard these candidates have asked questions and spoken about cyprus in parliament attended and supported our events actively shown that they support a free united cyprus based upon a just and viable solution to the cyprus issue and have campaigned against the turkish occupation another reader has written in about voting problems mary hart said both my son and my husband who prefer not to be named were unable to vote today as overseas voters who registered before the deadline my husband sent his signed proxy form to sheffield election office for sheffield hallam constituency on 22 may his proxy turned up to vote for him today and was told he was not on the list my son phoned the elections office at sheffield several times to confirm he was able to vote today he is actually in the uk at the moment turns up at the polling station to be told he has not yet been processed so will be about another two months till he can vote since we will have been living away from britain for over 15 years by the time of the next election presumably that was our last chance i just hope my postal vote made it in time anna piela has written in to say she was initially refused her vote today as a category g eu citizen even though she is a naturalised british citizen she is a dual citizen also with polish citizenship and registered to vote she has blogged about it i approached the table gave my address and was then told that i was category g funny i felt more like category b at that point meaning i was ineligible to vote in this election as a polish citizen i felt everybody s eyes on me do they think i am a fraud i started to feel hot and embarassed she said a lady at the polling station called a number for her after piela had called the leeds electoral commission to no avail she got put through and was told that i was ineligible to vote as a polish citizen well was not i glad to whip out my british passport and wave it in her face and then whoever was at the end of the line started crumbling oh it is a clerical error they say she is indeed a uk citizen so what do i do asked the nice lady give her a ballot and mark a clerical error in your register they said so that was that they said at the station that there had been four other people who were refused the ballot there despite being apparently naturalised and registered but they did not persevere like i did and walked away i voted smiled and left with a very high blood pressure rate for sure well that is how elections are won and lost and citizens categorised as a or b yes those of us who may be a g cumbria s news amp star reports that police are investigating copeland s conservatives after posters for their candidate trudy harrison were put up near polling stations political parties are forbidden from displaying election material near to polling stations harrison said the poster which was on private property was not put up by her or anyone on her campaign team just under five hours to go if you have ever wondered about those people who loiter outside polling stations who ask you for your polling number this is a useful explainer they are not just nosy parkers this is lovely although it is rather dispiriting that the clangers appear not to live in a democracy see how lucky we are you are probably thinking to yourself or perhaps not what is the former ukip leader nigel farage doing today now that he is not standing for parliament well the anti elitist public school educated former city broker is at the global investment forum sponsored by a swiss banking group and global private equity boutique in liverpool the rotunda gym is being used as a polling station so this is what they mean by a ballot box and here is another one
2017-01-23,0,theresa may wants to explore how to boost us uk migration when she meets the us president donald trump this week as part of their talks over an early trade deal according to british government sources the disclosure follows hard on the heels of the confirmation from the australian high commissioner in london that exploratory talks have already begun on a uk australian free trade deal and that greater access for australian businesspeople to britain will have to form part of it this approach linking any future expansion of highly skilled migration to successful trade deals with america and australia contrasts sharply with may s blunt refusal during her visit to india last november to increase the number of uk visas for highly skilled indians despite its potential to boost the prospects of a future trade deal may has yet to make clear how she sees non european immigration policy developing after brexit when she became prime minister in july she rejected the leave campaign s demands for an australian style points based system saying it would leave britain without full control over who enters the uk she also rejected leave campaigners promises that brexit could mean a boost in immigration from india and pakistan to meet the skill needs of the uk curry industry but now it is emerging that may s policy to keep britain open to the brightest and best will be shaped by any early post brexit trade deals that the uk is able to negotiate and it is quickly becoming apparent that those deals are more likely to be done with countries such as america australia canada or new zealand rather than india or china however the danger is that immigration policy for businesspeople and the most highly skilled becomes based on the old kith and kin white commonwealth of australia canada and new zealand by default if not by design in the case of the us british government sources told the telegraph may wants to explore ways to make it easier for us citizens to work in the uk and for britons to work in the us the latest figures show there are 181 000 us born citizens in britain and 758 000 resident britons in the us we can grow those numbers a senior government source was quoted as saying it may well be that as trump implements his america first immigration policy a uk trade deal could guarantee current british access to the us labour market rather than extend it but it could come at the price of increased migration of americans to britain a similar ambition was echoed on saturday by alexander downer the australian high commissioner in london when he told bbc radio 4 s today programme we would want to see greater access for australian businesspeople working in the uk and that is often been a part of free trade negotiations it has not always been by the way but it is often been part of our free trade negotiations it might just make it a bit simpler actually for example an australian company that invests in the uk might want to bring some of its executives to the uk that can be done with what are called tier 2 visas but maybe that could be made a little bit easier downer confirmed that easier visa arrangements were negotiated alongside the last australian us trade deal non eu migration makes up more than half of britain s annual net migration figure which stands at 335 000 may has pledged to bring that down below 100 000 and the warning signs are that future immigration policy could lead to greater numbers of americans australians new zealanders and canadians coming to the uk while ever tighter restrictions are placed on indians pakistanis africans and east europeans
2017-01-28,0,jeremy corbyn is facing a serious revolt by grassroots labour supporters who backed him to be leader as the party s crisis over brexit escalates rapidly with more members of corbyn s frontbench considering resigning shadow welsh secretary jo stevens became the first to quit the shadow cabinet on friday the rebellion is now spreading among local party members who are furious at his support for theresa may s plans for triggering the article 50 process on saturday night a highly critical open letter to the labour leader circulating on facebook had been signed by almost 2 000 members in constituency parties across the country around half of whom are believed to have voted for corbyn as leader the letter organised by a group called labour against brexit accuses corbyn of a betrayal of your socialist values and of backing a policy that will hurt working people one of the organisers jonathan proctor of the north tyneside constituency labour party told the observer that the motive was not to destabilise corbyn but to stand up for labour principles and values he said the response from members since its launch on friday had been overwhelming the letter is the first real sign of grassroots unrest against corbyn in his own power bases in the constituency parties it makes clear that his support had been based on a belief that he would create a more democratic party that would be true to labour values including supporting eu membership in short we are the grassroots that you have always been keen to represent it states all of us share core labour values of equality and opportunity for all and we share a belief in fighting for social justice and while we may differ in our beliefs and feelings with regards to your leadership we are nevertheless united in our belief that you and your leadership team have made the wrong call on the party s policy on brexit it adds additionally many of us voted for you as our leader because of your desire to make the labour party more democratic with policy being set by members at labour party conference 2016 it was resolved that unless the final brexit settlement proves to be acceptable then the option of retaining eu membership should be retained the final settlement should therefore be subject to approval through parliament and potentially through a general election or referendum we believe that this exemplar of democracy within the party should no longer be ignored let us speak with one voice as democratically made by our members corbyn has been struggling to hold the party together after saying that labour mps would be subject to a three line whip instructing them to vote in favour of the parliamentary bill to trigger the brexit process which will be debated in the commons for the first time on tuesday and wednesday tulip siddiq the mp for hampstead and kilburn has left her frontbench post and two whips thangam debbonaire and jeff smith have said they will not vote for the bill another shadow cabinet member rachel maskell is said by colleagues to be considering resigning and clive lewis regarded as close to corbyn early in his leadership now says he will vote against the bill at third reading unless there are a series of safeguards writing on his facebook page lewis says these must ensure that the uk commits to having the closest relationship to europe and the single market as is possible protect worker rights have proper report back mechanisms on the negotiations and have final say over the eventual negotiated deal he adds if the government does not accept these amendments i will vote against triggering article 50 at the third and final vote in the brexit referendum last year an estimated 65 of labour voters backed remaining in the european union but roughly two thirds of the constituencies with labour mps in place voted overall to leave one of the biggest votes for brexit came in stoke where 69 4 of people voted for brexit with corbyn s party facing a crucial byelection in stoke on trent central on 23 february caused by the resignation of tristram hunt and another the same day in copeland in cumbria labour mps believe corbyn s decision to impose a three line whip is driven in part by fear of being defeated by ukip the anti eu party s new leader paul nuttall is standing in the stoke seat and is expected to run labour close in one of it traditional strongholds the official labour line is that while it understands that many labour mps particularly in seats that voted remain are torn over brexit the outcome of the referendum was clear and the will of the people should not be obstructed david lammy the labour mp for tottenham said there was also anger with corbyn over the decision to impose a three line whip on a timeable motion that would cut the debate on the bill to five days labour members are quitting the party in droves as a result referring to corbyn s handling of the issue he said it is shockingly bad politics everyone understands labour voters are split down the middle over brexit north and south middle class and working class young and old but so too are the tories by taking a side and not allowing mps to vote with their conscience labour s leadership is forcing an exodus of remain voters and members a hard brexit of the type that the tories are set on pursuing will hurt labour supporters and people in labour areas so of course there is real concern among colleagues a shadow cabinet member told the observer this is not easy for jeremy and i feel sorry for him but the way it has been handled is corroding our support it is falling away fast alex salmond the snp s international affairs and europe spokesman said labour was running scared of ukip and failing to do its constitutional duty of holding the government to account he added the referendum happened as a result of tory fear of ukip and now it is bulldozed through without proper opposition because of labour s fear of ukip chris leslie labour mp for nottingham east who will vote against the bill said corbyn was losing support over the issue and asked why he had not put the matter to consultation in the wider party there is a very noticeable change of mood among many members who joined recently to support jeremy it is surprising given that he backs giving the membership a say and did so over military action in syria that he does not do the same over article 50
2017-05-26,0,the sight of the army on britain s streets after the manchester suicide bomb attack is a clear sign that the uk s foreign policy and approach to fighting terrorism is not working jeremy corbyn has said the labour leader said there must be more money for law enforcement as he suggested britain s intervention in wars abroad had fuelled the risk of terrorism at home many experts including professionals in our intelligence and security services have pointed to the connections between wars our government has supported or fought in other countries and terrorism here at home he said his comments drew immediate criticism from the conservatives and liberal democrats with sir michael fallon the defence secretary accusing corbyn of very muddled and dangerous thinking that implied blame on britain for somehow bringing the manchester terror attack on itself boris johnson the foreign secretary intensified the attack saying corbyn s comments were absolutely monstrous speaking alongside the us secretary of state rex tillerson he said it was absolutely extraordinary and inexplicable in this week of all weeks that there should be any attempt to justify or to legitimate the actions of terrorists in this way however corbyn pitched his intervention carefully saying he was clear that terrorists were entirely to blame for their own actions but that governments must also examine the effectiveness of their policy decisions no rationale based on the actions of any government can remotely excuse or even adequately explain outrages like this week s massacre he said speaking in westminster but we must be brave enough to admit the war on terror is simply not working we need a smarter way to reduce the threat from countries that nurture terrorists and generate terrorism a labour government would ensure that our foreign policy reduces rather than increases the threat to this country he added he said seeing the army on our own streets today is a stark reminder that the current approach has failed the longtime peace campaigner and former chair of the stop the war coalition also made a direct promise to troops that under a labour government they would only be sent into combat abroad if they were properly resourced and there was a clear need for military intervention and a plan for lasting peace afterwards that is my commitment to our armed services he said this is my commitment to our country i want the solidarity humanity and compassion that we have seen on the streets of manchester this week to be the values that guide our government there can be no love of country if there is neglect or disregard for its people his speech marked the return of labour to national campaigning after a pause following the manchester arena suicide bombing which killed 22 people and injured 116 after an ariana grande pop concert aimed at young girls corbyn s event started with a minute s silence and he did not take questions afterwards as aides said the campaign was being phased in with less than a fortnight until polling day labour is gaining ground on the conservatives who are now just five points ahead according to the latest yougov poll for the times corbyn s speech emphasised that he was only blaming terrorists for the attack and he stressed he did not want to make a narrow party political point but he made clear criticisms of theresa may s record as home secretary when she oversaw cuts to policing he told his audience in london that a government led by his party would provide more resources for law enforcement and the nhs to ensure people were not protected and cared for on the cheap within hours of the speech fallon who has often been used by the tories as an attack dog in elections told the bbc and sky that corbyn was implying this attack might be our fault might be britain s fault as a result of our foreign policy this is a very badly timed speech showing some very muddled and dangerous thinking he seems to be implying that a terrorist attack in manchester is somehow our fault it is somehow britain s fault jeremy corbyn is far too ready to find excuses and far too slow to support the police and the security services this is a man by the way who has opposed every piece of terrorist legislation who thinks we should talk to terrorists and who is even questioned whether police should be right to shoot to kill he said the number of armed officers on the streets had increased and claimed the safety of people was not just about overall numbers of police but frequency of patrols and funding for the intelligence services it also means being tough against terrorism and that is where mr corbyn is weak it is where he lets himself down he said johnson added to the attack after meeting his us counterpart in london this is a moment when we should be coming together uniting to defeat these people and we can and we will not just in iraq and in syria but of course in the battle for the hearts and minds he said they are wrong their view of the world is a corruption and perversion of islam and it can be completely confounded but now is not the time to do anything to subtract from the fundamental responsibility of those individuals that individual in particular who committed this atrocity and i think it is absolutely monstrous that anybody should seek to do so tim farron the liberal democrat leader also criticised corbyn s speech saying a few days ago a young man built a bomb walked into a pop concert and deliberately slaughtered children our children families are grieving a community is in shock jeremy corbyn has chosen to use that grotesque act to make a political point farron added i do not agree with what he says but i disagree even more that now is the time to say it that is not leadership it is putting politics before people at a time of tragedy but shami chakrabarti the shadow attorney general and former liberty campaigner said corbyn had been subject to horrible character attacks and people misinterpreting his speech she told the bbc s world at one i hear the criticism but that is not my reading of the speech jeremy was clear there was absolutely no excuse no justification based in foreign policy for the atrocities we have seen however it is right he says to the military as a pm in waiting it is because there is clear need and there will be a plan you are correct that ill conceived conflicts will be jumped on as an excuse but the reason not to engage in ill conceived conflict is because it is ill conceived corbyn and his close aides have long held the view that british foreign policy including the involvement of troops in iraq and afghanistan which he vehemently opposed has exacerbated the risk of terrorist attacks by destabilising the middle east and fuelling suspicion of the west
2017-04-11,0,vladimir putin is toxifying the image of russia by backing bashar al assad and the g7 must consider fresh sanctions against russia and syria in response to last week s chemical attack on civilians boris johnson has said as downing street revealed that theresa may and donald trump agreed a window of opportunity existed to put on pressure on russia to abandon assad the foreign secretary stepped up the pressure on the russian president amid evidence that the syria had used chemical weapons i think the russians need a way out and a way forward johnson told the bbc in italy ahead of the g7 talks in the tuscan city of lucca if you think about the position of vladimir putin now he is toxifying the reputation of russia by his continuing association with a government which has flagrantly poisoned its own people he called on moscow to do everything possible to bring about a political settlement in syria and work with the rest of the international community to ensure that the shocking events of the last week are never repeated johnson hopes to persuade the g7 to back proposals for new financial sanctions including measures targeted at key military commanders from russia and syria britain and the us believe the g7 should offer russia a choice of continuing to back assad and facing fresh penalties or working more closely with the west to combat the threat of islamic militant groups across the middle east and to rebuild syria theresa may spoke with donald trump on monday night to discuss the syrian regime s chemical attack and the us response a downing street spokesperson said the prime minister and the president agreed that a window of opportunity now exists in which to persuade russia that its alliance with assad is no longer in its strategic interest they agreed that us secretary of state tillerson s visit to moscow this week provides an opportunity to make progress towards a solution which will deliver a lasting political settlement the french foreign minister jean marc ayrault made the same linkage on the sidelines of the summit saying the fight against terrorism cannot be effective if we do not link it to resolving the syrian situation johnson held talks with rex tillerson the us secretary of state before joining the other g7 foreign ministers for the summit the foreign secretary s allies said last week s attack had helped shift opinion in washington towards the necessity of regime change in syria if a diplomatic solution to the long running conflict was to be found donald trump ordered a missile strike on syrian airbases last week after seeing footage of the chemical weapons attack despite repeatedly expressing wariness about intervening in the middle east during his presidential campaign but tillerson subsequently appeared to suggest that defeating the islamic state not removing assad was washington s top priority johnson has been criticised for cancelling a planned visit to moscow on monday in the wake of the devastating syrian attack on the town of khan sheikhun after saying last week s events had changed the situation fundamentally the labour leader jeremy corbyn said on monday that the foreign secretary was displaying a cold war mentality by withdrawing from the trip rather than continuing to pursue dialogue with moscow he warned that johnson s backing for the american missile strike risked sparking something utterly disastrous but johnson believes last week s retaliatory action by the us could open the door to a fresh diplomatic effort to remove assad from power tillerson will travel to moscow on tuesday to deliver the g7 s message to the russian foreign secretary sergei lavrov russia reacted furiously to the us intervention in the conflict and has questioned the account of the chemical weapons attack given by the us and other western countries
2017-03-31,0,britain could be forced to accept eu law immigration controls and budget payments after it formally leaves the bloc in 2019 if it wants a transitional period to cushion the blow of brexit the eu s draft negotiating guidelines suggest published by the european council president donald tusk the guidelines contained a number of demands that could be difficult for theresa may to sell to the public and the pro brexit element of her party including an extended transitional deal that could spill into a 2020 general election they offered a softened proposal to allow talks on britain s future relationship with the eu to begin after sufficient progress has been made on negotiating a withdrawal agreement which would include settling the uk s bills and citizens rights but the eu also argued a trade deal could only be concluded once britain had formally left and become a third country a jurisdiction outside the european economic area contradicting the prime minister s claim to be confident it can be completed before brexit day on 30 march 2019 the guidelines make clear the bloc s primary objective is to preserve the integrity of the single market which excludes participation based on a sector by sector approach two senior uk sources with knowledge of whitehall and brussels said the document clearly suggested the eu only believed there would be a framework for a future trade deal ready by march 2019 and the actual negotiations would take longer this could necessitate some kind of transitional arrangement during which the uk would remain subject to the jurisdiction of the eu which would be difficult for theresa may to sell to the right of the conservative party and the electorate going into an election in 2020 the draft text says to the extent necessary and legally possible the negotiations may also seek to determine transitional arrangements which are in the interest of the union and as appropriate to provide for bridges towards the foreseeable framework for the future relationship any such transitional arrangements must be clearly defined limited in time and subject to effective enforcement mechanisms should a time limited prolongation of union acquis be considered this would require existing union regulatory budgetary supervisory and enforcement instruments and structures to apply rather than transitional arrangements may and her brexit secretary david davis use the term implementation phase for a process which has been demanded by businesses to avoid taking the uk to an economic cliff edge on the day of departure they would be likely to fight the idea of remaining under eu jurisdiction beyond the uk s formal exit from the eu speaking as the eu s draft negotiating guidelines pdf were sent to national capitals on friday tusk said the eu27 were united talks would be difficult complex and sometimes confrontational but the bloc would not seek to punish britain brexit itself is already punitive enough he said the guidelines make clear it will be for the council to decide when sufficient progress has been made on the withdrawal deal the priorities of which will include the rights of eu citizens in the uk and british citizens on the continent and agreement on britain s legal and budgetary commitments and liabilities tusk rejected the description of a brexit bill and said it was simply a case of the uk having to pay for what successive british governments had signed up to fund it is only fair towards all those people communities scientists farmers and so on to whom we all the 28 promised and owe this money the uk s only land border with the eu between northern ireland and the republic will also be a key priority in the withdrawal deal with the eu calling for flexible and imaginative solutions with the aim of avoiding a hard border speaking alongside tusk joseph muscat the prime minister of malta said the negotiations would undoubtedly be tough but it will not be a war and the two sides needed to remain friends the draft guidelines may be revised over the next month but are as likely to be strengthened as they are weakened tusk will chair a summit of eu27 leaders at the end of april to finalise the bloc s negotiating position the european commission will then draft its more detailed negotiating directives which are expected to be adopted at a meeting of european ministers on 22 may after which formal talks between davis and the eu s chief negotiator michel barnier can begin the guidelines say the uk must accept eu rules such as the four freedoms including free movement continuing budget contributions and the judicial oversight of the european court of justice during a transitional period likely to follow its departure in 2019 and before any free trade pact can be finalised may has said britain aims to leave the single market and most of the customs union in favour of agreeing a bespoke free trade deal for individual industrial sectors such as the automotive and pharmaceuticals industries but a non member cannot have the same rights and enjoy the same benefits as a member and there can be no cherry picking the guidelines say separate negotiations between individual eu states and the uk are also ruled out the guidelines specify that any trade deal must be on a level playing field in terms of competition and state aid with safeguards against unfair competitive advantages through fiscal social and environmental dumping downing street sources said the the government was relatively relaxed about the guidelines with one source saying there were no surprises really a no 10 spokesman said these are draft guidelines and we look forward to beginning negotiations once they have been formally agreed by the 27 member states it is clear both sides wish to approach these talks constructively and as the prime minister said this week wish to ensure a deep and special partnership between the uk and the european union but owen smith the former labour leadership candidate said tusk s statement showed how may s lofty rhetoric is colliding with hard reality the guidelines underlined the difficulty the government would have in keeping its brexit promises he said ministers and leave campaigners have presented brexit as a cost free option it is not there will be a cost to brexit we just do not know how deep it will be it is time for the government to start levelling with the british people barnier has said he hopes the main outlines of the withdrawal agreement will be clear by autumn enabling a broad agreement to be reached at a summit in december he has said he hopes to start talks with the uk on a future relationship in january 2018 but there are lingering fears the talks could collapse the draft text says the eu wants an agreement but it will prepare itself to be able to handle the situation also if the negotiations were to fail a senior eu official said the european commission took little notice of may s claim that no deal was better than a bad deal with the eu noting that the uk was four or five times more dependent on exporting to the eu than the other way around he said threats are never a good instrument in a negotiation and empty threats are even poorer instruments in a negotiation the official said that if the uk walked away without a deal it will be bad for the union but i think it would be fair to say it would be very bad for the uk on citizens rights the commission said it was presumed that uk promises to protect the rights of eu nationals already in the country would include the right for those who have previously lived there to return and for current and future spouses and dependents to join those already in the country
2017-05-30,0,theresa may set the tone for the final phase of the general election campaign with her strongest personal attack on jeremy corbyn on tuesday claiming the labour leader s performance in the previous night s live tv debate showed he would be naked in the negotiating chamber when brexit talks start next month the outspoken remarks represent an attempt by conservative strategists to refocus the prime minister s message on a direct comparison between herself and the labour leader as the party seeks to shore up its opinion poll lead with little more than a week before voters go to the ballot box in a speech to party activists and journalists in wolverhampton may launched a series of strongly worded attacks on corbyn s character and leadership style she said monday s television debate in which the two leaders faced questions from a live audience and from jeremy paxman on channel 4 and sky news had revealed corbyn as unfit to lead britain through the tough talks ahead jeremy corbyn s minders can put him into a smart blue suit for an interview with jeremy paxman but with his position on brexit he will find himself alone and naked in the negotiating chamber of the european union she said as the audience of tory activists laughed awkwardly she added now i know that is an image that does not bear thinking about but actually this is very serious with the brexit negotiations due to begin just 11 days after polling day he is not prepared for those negotiations but i am prepared prepared to take the difficult decisions that leadership demands prepared to do what is necessary to protect and defend our country the use of naked in the phrase appeared to be a dig at corbyn s anti nuclear stance the word was famously used in 1957 by labour s nye bevan against unilateralists on the left of his party when he warned that stripping britain of nuclear weapons would send a future foreign secretary naked into the conference chamber corbyn had been questioned by paxman during the channel 4 debate on whether he would use nuclear weapons or launch a drone strike against a suspected terrorist may said what last night s television debate brought home in technicolor was that only we have the will and the plan to make a success of brexit he is not prepared to use the nuclear deterrent he is not prepared to take action against terrorists he is not prepared to give the police the powers they need to keep us safe she said she described brexit as the defining issue of the election and claimed the labour leader had lurched chaotically from half baked plan to half baked plan she added i am prepared i am ready to go jeremy corbyn is not everything depends on and will be defined by the outcome of these next five years this is no time for a weak leader to be making it up as they go along labour issued no formal response to may s remarks because corbyn s team has made a deliberate decision not to respond to personal attacks although the conservatives remain comfortably ahead in the polls the party s lead has been slipping the guardian s latest icm poll still gives the conservatives a 12 point lead putting them on a 45 share of the vote down two points from last week with labour unchanged at 33 a separate seat by seat projection by polling company yougov released late on tuesday predicts that the uk is on course for a hung parliament according to its estimates may could lose 20 seats and her majority while labour could gain 28 seats such a result would see the tories 330 seats reduced to 310 and labour s 229 become 257 the figures are from the polling model s central estimate which acknowledges a large range of variation but it predicts that even a good night for the tories would give them only 15 more seats than may now has the tories poll lead has narrowed significantly since the start of the campaign in particular in the wake of the party s manifesto launch which led to days of damaging headlines about the controversial social care policy the backlash prompted may to announce that she would cap the total costs of elderly care to prevent wealthier pensioners seeing too much of the value of their homes set aside to pay for their care though she has still not revealed at what level such a cap will be set as the focus of the conservatives campaign narrows in the remaining few days labour will seek to switch the debate away from brexit and back to the state of britain s public services on wednesday with a press conference in london underlining the likely impact of another five years of spending cuts over the last seven years the tories have starved the public services we rely on of resources running them down and pushing them into disrepair corbyn is expected to say patients are suffering ever longer waits and overcrowded wards those who need care have been left without it children are crammed into overcrowded and crumbling classrooms it has to change one senior tory said may s renewed stress on her leadership qualities was a return to the strategy mapped out by her campaign adviser lynton crosby and based on polling and focus group findings the strategy from the beginning was always him or me specifically him and me on brexit what is happened is turbulence and events have thrown it about a bit we are going back to that core message he said may s rhetoric against the labour leader appeared to have toughened significantly underlining the conservatives determination to exploit what they regard as corbyn s weaknesses one insider suggested that by making a speech last friday drawing a link between terrorist attacks such as the deadly bombing in manchester and britain s foreign policy the labour leader had made himself fair game unlike at events in the early days of the campaign the bright blue backdrop to may s speech prominently included her party s name urging voters to back theresa may and the conservatives her speech to tory activists also touched on many of the running themes of her premiership renewing the pledge to put government at the service of ordinary working people may s claims came as a group of independent experts based at kings college london warned that none of the parties is being honest with voters about the full implications of brexit the report from the uk in a changing europe group is called red yellow and blue brexit the manifestos uncovered pdf it warns that the kind of brexit deal that britain secures will affect everything from trade to foreign policy and its impact has been underplayed by all the major party manifestos what is striking is that while all three parties view brexit as a major event the manifestos treat it largely in isolation from other aspects of policy rather than the defining issue of the next parliament said prof anand menon who chairs the group asked about may s comments he added no prime minister goes in naked because that is what the civil service is for but the big question is whether the civil service will be given sufficient resources for the scale of the task ahead
2017-04-15,0,the eu is set to inflict a double humiliation on theresa may stripping britain of its european agencies within weeks while formally rejecting the prime minister s calls for early trade talks the observer has learned that eu diplomats agreed their uncompromising position at a crunch meeting on tuesday held to set out the union s strategy in the talks due to start next month a beauty contest between member states who want the european banking and medicine agencies currently located in london will begin within two weeks with selection criteria to be unveiled by the president of the european council donald tusk the european banking authority and the european medicines agency employ about 1 000 people many of them british and provide a hub for businesses in the uk it is understood that the eu s chief negotiator hopes the agencies will know their new locations by june although the process may take longer cities such as frankfurt milan amsterdam and paris are competing to take the agencies which are regarded as among the eu s crown jewels meanwhile it has emerged that britain failed to secure the backing of any of the 27 countries for its case that trade talks should start early in the two years of negotiations allowed by article 50 of the lisbon treaty the position will be announced at a brussels summit on 29 april despite a recent whistlestop tour of eu capitals by the brexit secretary david davis diplomats concluded unanimously that the european commission was right to block any talks about a future comprehensive trade deal until the uk agrees to settle its divorce bill which some estimate could be as high as 60bn and comes to a settlement on the rights of eu citizens may will have hoped that draft european council guidelines leaked last month which took a tough line on the negotiations including a clause ruling out a trade deal within two years would have been softened during consultation with the member states however the lack of any questioning of the european commission s position on the timeline surprised brussels veterans wearily used to displays of eu disunity senior eu sources claimed that britain s aggressive approach to the talks including threats of becoming a low tax low regulation state unless it was given a good deal had backfired however realistic the threats were or not they were noticed one senior eu source said the future prosperity of the single market was challenged that had an impact it pushed people together another senior diplomat said initial sympathy with britain had fallen away in many capitals due to the approach of theresa may s government of course we want to protect trade with britain but maintaining the single market keeping trade flowing there is the priority and so we will work through the eu s chief negotiator michel barnier the source said britain used to be pragmatic that does not seem to be the case any more and we need to protect our interests it is understood that diplomats representing the right wing polish government voiced concerns about the rigid timetable for the talks in the private meeting on tuesday suggesting there were grounds for flexibility even then the intervention fell far short of backing the uk s position that there could be parallel negotiations on the terms of withdrawal and the future relationship a senior eu source said no one questioned the phased approach in a further sign of britain s isolation spain s right of veto over any future eu uk deal applying to gibraltar was not discussed on tuesday despite the uk s anger over the issue eu sources said the contentious position is set to be waved into the final eu negotiating position by consensus french diplomats instead spent part of the meeting warning member states to help companies on the continent prepare for a scenario in which the uk crashes out of the eu without any deal or even transitional arrangement in place for after the country leaves the bloc in 2019 leading to tariffs and customs checks keir starmer the shadow brexit secretary accused the government of wasting an opportunity where ministers should have been building bridges as it approaches what have been billed as the most important negotiations the uk has ever faced he said it is deeply concerning that the prime minister is now so isolated from our eu partners i have emphasised in parliament on a number of occasions that the tone adopted so far by the government is unlikely to get the talks off to a good start the prime minister should have spent the last nine months building alliances across europe not pandering to those in her cabinet and her party who want to sever all links with the eu and retreat from our closest allies and most important trading partners liberal democrat leader tim farron said april is set to be a humiliating month for may her choice to pursue a hard brexit is starting to hit with reality and we are starting to see the impact that is going to have on britain the european commission said earlier this month that talks about a potential trade deal would occur only once sufficient progress had been made on britain s 60bn divorce bill and the position of eu citizens in the uk and british citizens on the continent it is understood diplomats representing the eu27 did discuss a definition of sufficient progress but ultimately left it to the leaders to decide an eu source said it was hoped that scoping talks on a deal and a transitional arrangement on access to the single market could start in the autumn the eu s negotiating position detailed in the european council s so called draft guidelines will also be redrafted to include mention of the european parliament s role in a sign that meps are angling to play a greater part in shaping the talks tusk s team will fine tune the guidelines ahead of a final meeting of diplomats on 24 april an eu source said a one day summit of leaders will take place on 29 april in brussels to sign off on the document
2017-06-17,0,senior business figures have heaped further pressure on theresa may to change course for a softer brexit in the wake of the election amid fresh warnings of the impact of immigration controls and leaving the single market stuart rose the tory peer and chairman of online grocer ocado who backed remain said the election had been a proxy re referendum against hard brexit karan bilimoria the founder of cobra beer and remain backer said the prime minister had zero credibility and that britain could now rethink leaving and brian mcbride chairman of asos and wiggle has raised concerns about access to labour and customs checks business groups are pressing downing street for a change in tone as well as a formal role in the brexit process they also want an end to may s repeated mantra that no deal is better than a bad deal josh hardie the cbi s deputy director general said it is a time for reflecting on how businesses are feeling it is absolutely clear that for the new government the priority has got to be putting the economy first the intervention comes on the eve of brexit talks that begin even before may has finalised a governing deal with the dup or navigated a curtailed queen s speech through parliament the chancellor philip hammond who had been in line for the sack before the election result is also signalling he wants a softer brexit that could include a more comprehensive transitional deal in comments putting him at odds with the prime minister s determination to go for a hard brexit that includes leaving the single market customs union and slashing immigration he will today assert that the majority of britons want a deal that protects jobs economic growth and prosperity david davis the brexit secretary says on sunday that he would head into monday s brexit talks aiming to secure a deal that works for all parts of the united kingdom but signalled that the plan was still to leave the customs union and reduce immigration we will soon introduce bills for new immigration and customs arrangements and the great repeal bill will transpose all eu law into uk law he said the bill which could be hit by a series of parliamentary rebellions will be introduced as part of the queen s speech on wednesday the government also risks accusations of weakness by announcing that the parliamentary session will be extended to two years effectively avoiding another queen s speech next year insiders insisted the move would give mps time to consider crucial legislation on brexit they said it will still be a substantial legislative programme designed to tackle social injustice meanwhile british businesses have sounded the alarm over damaging labour shortages after brexit with thousands warning that they will be hurt by even a modest move away from the eu s free movement rules almost a quarter of the business community say that restricting entry to britain to eu migrants with a job offer would have a negative impact on them rising to 30 of companies in low wage industries the warning is contained in a comprehensive analysis of business views on migration by the chartered institute of personnel and development cipd and the national institute of economic and social research to be published on monday the report contains alarming findings revealed exclusively to the observer over the number of companies who believe they will be damaged by a move away from freedom of movement rules it includes a poll of more than 1 000 companies weighted to represent britain s business community which finds that 23 believe allowing in an unlimited amount of eu migrants with a job offer would have a negative impact on their organisation more than a third 35 of businesses in low wage industries said they recruited eu nationals because they cannot fill the positions with uk born applicants signalling that labour shortages could result from a clampdown there was even more disquiet about stricter schemes among the 91 of companies that expected to hire eu migrants some 28 warned that giving skilled eu workers five year visas would hurt them more 30 said that one year visas for unskilled workers would do damage a 10th of businesses warned that the numbers of eu nationals they were hiring was already falling in the wake of brexit peter cheese chief executive of the cipd said businesses are clearly sounding the alarm on the impact that constraints on immigration could have on the economy the shifting political landscape has led some remain supporting business figures to speak out rose said i believe the election this was a proxy re referendum i think it was the public s way to demonstrate that all was not all as they wanted is this an opportunity to have a rethink i think the single market and customs union should still be on the table who is going to tell the man on the clapham omnibus and when will they tell him that he is not going to be better off bilimoria said we have a prime minister who has zero credibility with the country with her party and in parliament she was the driving force in pandering to the brexiters in her party who were in the driving seat
2017-02-22,0,people just ain t no good this is the refrain of the moment is not it everywhere you look people are becoming more selfish insular nasty and uncaring the coarsening of public discourse often online reveals anger alienation and a dangerous kind of apathy that feeds on low level anxiety and perpetual disappointment political rhetoric has normalised expressions of hatefulness almost nothing is unsayable prejudice is not a subtext it is out and it is proud no wonder amnesty has spoken out about this toxic language the rhetoric around refugees and migrants has been deliberately dehumanising we end up now with a government that can shirk its basic responsibility of taking in unaccompanied children internationally we have seen open viciousness tirana hassan amnesty s director of crisis research talked of how many leaders have propagated the dangerous idea that some people are less human than others we all know which leaders she means rightwing leaders specialise in conjuring visions of chaos in our peripheral vision donald trump does this literally the world outside his gated existence is a vision of hell murder rape terror the authoritarian worldview depends on a fear of the anarchy and destruction about to be unleashed at any second the enemy without thatcher used to do this with the enemy within remember the legitimisation of dread is a powerful thing it is also extremely polarising the constant summoning of darkness it is exhausting it depends on constantly feeding the idea that everything is broken that there are no longer basic standards of how to behave if you live online this is easy to maintain everything is awful all the time there is no dialogue no law just a cacophony of screams and then and then do something fairly normal go into a primary school queue for a cash machine stop at a traffic light and you see something different society has not completely broken down there are basic rules and even some civility and agreement about what these are from spitting to taunting someone over their race gender or sexuality discouraged by good old political correctness certain behaviour in classrooms is not allowed in doctors surgeries and on public transport there are signs saying such abuse will not be tolerated of course i witness appalling behaviour but i also witness good behaviour seats are given up on buses people queue at cash machines small talk is made in the supermarket this is not to say that life is not extremely hard for many people but somehow the world that many politicians conjure up of constant division is their world for the decline in basic civility and treating each other as human comes often from the top down it is not just politicians such as nigel farage who spew out lies and hostility to migrants what does theresa may mean when she says citizens of nowhere how can a supposed christian go back on the dubs amendment how can it be ok for a tory grandee to start woofing at a female politician when she stands up to speak these people are not meeting the standards of behaviour required in a primary school classroom their we are going to hell in a handcart mentality depends entirely on displacing antisocial behaviour to the lower orders migrants mexicans muslims this fear is maintained further by reporting the public space as something that is always dangerous again where we do share public space it may well be fraught but our experience is not only bad watching the bbc2 series hospital one cannot but be struck by how hard so many people work in the nhs an ethos of kindness and cohesion may seem idealistic at the moment but to say that it exists nowhere takes us into a spiral of despair i hear many parents saying they no longer know how to talk to their children about sharing and bullying or simple respect because the kinds of behaviour we see from public figures is so out of control the bullying is top down a lack of empathy or compassion is flaunted as glinting iconoclasm in the face of this to insist on kindness in public may seem wishy washy but kindness is hardcore that is what i thought when i heard brendan cox talk about it to insist on kindness togetherness and unity to say that atomisation and fear will not destroy us and to hear it said by jo cox s husband is moving in her memory he wants everyone to get together in june for street parties bake offs or whatever they fancy maybe this sounds a little old fashioned in a world of monster trolls and hate speech well we are always told that solidarity is old fashioned that there is no such thing as society but as jo said we have far more in common than that which divides us as the neocon journey morphs into full blown conservative nihilism it is critical now to say that sometimes we rub along in our shared spaces that we make society as well as break it for if we truly believe hell is other people we are really lost
2017-06-23,0,theresa may made a fair and serious offer to european union leaders over the contentious issue of the future rights of eu citizens offering those who arrive lawfully before brexit the chance to build up the same rights to work healthcare and benefits as uk citizens speaking at the end of a dinner at an eu leaders summit in brussels after formal brexit talks kicked off on monday may set out the uk s opening offer on the rights of eu citizens an issue both sides have said they would like to be resolved early in the talks the prime minister told them the uk was willing to agree to a cutoff point between 29 march this year when may formally triggered article 50 and the later date of march 2019 as preferred by the european commission eu citizens already in the uk and those who arrive lawfully during a subsequent grace period expected to be up to two years will be given the opportunity to build up five years worth of residence the grace period could start at any point up to the date of brexit and would allow eu citizens time to regularise their status that will entitle them to a special category of settled status conferring the same rights to work pensions nhs care and other public services as british citizens which they will maintain for life the offer which is contingent on a reciprocal pledge about the rights of the 1 2 million british citizens currently living elsewhere in the eu falls short of the eu s demand for its citizens living in the uk to maintain all eu rights in perpetuity but the prime minister told eu leaders that she did not want to see anyone already in the uk forced to leave or families split up the uk s position represents a fair and serious offer and one aimed at giving as much certainty as possible to citizens who have settled in the uk building careers and lives and contributing so much to our society may said but the uk is not prepared to concede to the eu s demand to allow the european court of justice to be the guarantor of those rights a government source said the commitment we will make will be enshrined in uk law and enforceable through our highly respected courts may s proposal came in response to the eu s own offer on the future rights of uk citizens living in other eu countries according to eu sources may s presentation was accepted as a reasonable opening offer by leaders but there was no discussion the eu negotiating team will now open a technical review of the offer it is understood angela merkel the german chancellor called may s offer a good start but said many other issues related to britain s departure from the bloc still need to be resolved theresa may made clear to us today that eu citizens that have been in britain for five years will retain their full rights that is a good start merkel told reporters but there are still many many other questions linked to the exit including on finances and the relationship with ireland so we have a lot to do until the next eu summit in october the government s insistence that it would not guarantee the rights of eu citizens unilaterally has created uncertainty about the future of those already living in the uk in the year since the referendum result and sparked a vociferous campaign from individuals and groups including the grassroots campaign the3million after the grace period has elapsed newly arriving eu citizens will be subject to whatever immigration system replaces freedom of movement after brexit campaigners for eu citizens living in the uk branded the prime minister s offer as disgraceful nicolas hatton founder of the3million said they have gone for the worst scenario possible this is just negotiation tactics and it is disgusting they do not want to engage with eu citizens and they think it is just this big game the3million along with a coalition of 13 campaign groups lobbying for the rights of 1 2 million britons living in europe have met the eu s chief brexit negotiator michel barnier and brexit ministers across europe and said the eu officials have at least listened to them and put in virtually everything they asked for in the eu proposal he said they would raise their objections at a scheduled meeting with officials at the department for exiting the eu on friday the group has a further meeting with ministers on monday but hatton disclosed that the brexit secretary david davis refused to meet us which we also find insulting earlier jane golding a british lawyer living in berlin said it was legally untenable for britain not to preserve the rights of any eu citizens who were exercising their eu freedoms by living and working in britain she said the eu had pledged to give the british living on the continent their full rights and called on the prime minister to reciprocate golding said campaigners in germany had met officials from the german foreign ministry including their brexit lead as well as officials from four other german ministries the eu have made a huge effort and have listened to us she said but theresa may s outline she claimed raised more questions than it answered whether the status quo and the full bundle of rights that eu citizens in the uk currently have will be safeguarded is not clear from this statement keir starmer the shadow secretary of state for exiting the eu said labour has been clear that people should not be bargaining chips in the brexit negotiations the prime minister s offer is too little too late and falls far short of the full and unilateral guarantee labour would make we believe there must be a clear commitment that there will be no change to the status of eu nationals in the uk this is not only the right thing to do but it will also help deliver a reciprocal agreement for the 1 2 million uk nationals living in the eu tim farron the liberal democrat leader said these proposals are frankly too little too late and leave millions of people still facing unanswered questions over their futures here it is simply not good enough after may s departure the 27 remaining eu leaders took just four minutes to take the next step in the process for choosing new host cities for the two eu agencies being removed from london the european medicines agency and the european banking authority based in canary wharf and employing 1 050 people will move to other eu cities after brexit eu leaders have now decided on the contest rules for choosing new host cities paving the way for decisions on locations in the autumn an immigration bill was among the eight brexit focused pieces of legislation set out in wednesday s queens speech and no 10 has stressed that it remains committed to the target of reducing net immigration to the tens of thousands the prime minister also promised to streamline the administration of the new system replacing the current cumbersome application form with simpler digital tools may s account of the broad principles underlying the government s offer left a number of key questions unanswered including what would happen to the children of those granted the new status full details will be published in a paper to be laid before parliament on monday but her emollient tone chimed with the government s less adversarial approach to the talks since the snap general election wiped out may s majority six weeks ago the prime minister stood outside no 10 and accused unnamed figures in brussels of issuing threats claiming there are some in brussels who do not want these talks to succeed who do not want britain to prosper but with may now forced to govern with a minority in the commons she is under pressure including from within her own cabinet to take a less combative approach philip hammond the chancellor has said the government will make the economy the top priority in talks and could agree to transitional arrangements lasting up to four years to avoid the country being driven over a cliff edge as a result of the talks meanwhile senior labour figures including the mayor of london sadiq khan are pressing for the government to put the possibility of britain remaining a member of the european single market back on the agenda after outlining her proposals may left the dinner to allow her fellow leaders to continue discussions earlier at the summit the lithuanian president dalia grybauskaitė suggested that there was wriggle room in the eu position on citizens rights brussels has insisted that all eu nationals who move to britain before the uk s withdrawal retain all their current freedoms and have them protected by the european court of justice grybauskaitė said we need to think about the future and the sooner we settle the future the better for all of us for us the cutoff date is not so important it is up to britain to decide how much they they involve the eu judiciary however merkel indicated that there would be intense negotiations over the issue she said my tendency is to offer the most far reaching guarantees for eu citizens as possible but i can not pre empt the discussion
2017-01-29,0,divisive unhelpful and wrong that was how theresa may described donald trump s suggestion that muslims should be banned from the us in december 2015 when he was still fighting to be the republican candidate for the presidency and she was home secretary it was always too much to hope that as prime minister she might choose her first meeting with the new leader of the united states for a historic love actually moment in which she reminded the world about those views after all downing street has made very clear that pragmatism will rule when it comes to uk us and may trump relations this trip was not about calling things out but about securing a love in that might take advantage of the potential benefits to britain of a trump presidency namely his promise to propel a post brexit uk from the back to the front of the trade queue the aim was to build an image of the us and the uk hand in hand although i m sure even the prime minister s advisers cringed when they saw trump physically grasp hold of the prime minister that awkwardness aside downing street saw the visit as a strategic coup and yet even as the prime minister boarded a plane headed to philadelphia there was growing hope that she might use the visit to express british disquiet about some of trump s first moves as president already there was a clamour from mps to express british alarm at his latest comments in support of extreme interrogation techniques such as waterboarding to be fair to the prime minister it was not until after her meeting that trump made his next highly controversial move to stop people from seven countries entering the us but her decision not to condemn the decision during the second leg of the tour in turkey quickly turned any focus on the visit from warm words on trade and strong language on nato to mounting anger about a failure to speak out by then may had the choice to either line up with those such as the controversial ukip donor arron banks defending trump or to agree with the many conservative mps joining the likes of jeremy corbyn sadiq khan and tim farron in criticising the policy the tory critics included the party s leader in scotland ruth davidson and the former chair sayeeda warsi heidi allen mp said i do not care how special the relationship is some lines just should not be crossed and her tory colleague sarah wollaston demanded that trump not be allowed to address mps in westminster hall for a state visit later this year and then there was the question of british nationals with another tory mp nadhim zahawi facing being banned alongside olympic star and british hero sir mo farah government aides spent sunday trying to tackle the crisis their late night statement about disagreeing with the policy was followed by public interventions from the chief secretary to the treasury david gauke and then foreign secretary boris johnson who said it was wrong to stigmatise because of nationality quickly arranged conversations between johnson and amber rudd and their us counterparts followed but the headache lingers for may as other world leaders are much clearer in their condemnation of trump while downing street insists that the state visit invite is not being rescinded that is despite even davidson questioning how it could occur on monday may perhaps via her foreign secretary will need to field questions about what she knew and when and if she raised any concerns in private labour will demand to know why canada was able to offer reassurances on saturday that britain could not and meanwhile a government petition is growing at pace the prime minister now faces a thorny dilemma how to remain dignified alongside her desire to build an economic relationship with the us that can help britain navigate its post brexit journey
2017-06-12,0,the labour deputy leader tom watson has written to theresa may asking if rupert murdoch asked her to reappoint michael gove to the cabinet or face bad press in his newspaper titles gove s shock return as environment secretary comes a little over a year after may fired him as justice secretary following his ill fated attempt to lead the conservative party he was immediately rehired by rupert murdoch s times where he had worked as a columnist and book reviewer from 1996 to 2005 on a reported 150 000 a year gove became embroiled in scandal earlier this year over reports that murdoch was in the room when donald trump gave his first post election foreign newspaper interview in the uk to him i am writing to ask you about any influence rupert murdoch may have sought to exert over cabinet appointments said watson in a letter to may published on monday specifically it has been suggested to me that rupert murdoch asked you to appoint gove to the cabinet watson questioned whether the tories failure to secure a parliamentary majority may have led her to consider currying favour with the murdoch press it might be tempting to allow yourself to be influenced by powerful media proprietors who can shape the way your government is covered said watson he called on may to answer three questions relating to murdoch had he ever made suggestions about ministerial or staff appointments had he ever specifically suggested that gove should be given a ministerial position and had he ever said there might be consequences in the pages of his papers if she did not take his advice a downing street spokesperson said the letter has been received and we will respond in due course gove has shown his admiration for murdoch over the years telling the leveson inquiry into press ethics in 2012 that the media mogul was one of the most impressive and significant figures of the last 50 years another insight into their relationship was exposed when a personal email from gove s wife sarah vine a columnist for the daily mail was accidentally leaked in it she discussed whether murdoch would support his leadership bid may s relationship with the media faces further scrutiny over whether the government presses ahead with proposals in its manifesto regarding the regulation of the newspaper industry the conservative manifesto said the party would scrap leveson 2 a proposed investigation into the relationship between the media and the police and repeal section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 which would force newspapers to pay the legal costs of both sides in libel privacy and harassment cases if they did not accept an approved regulator section 40 was a key plank of the recommendations by lord justice leveson in his first inquiry into the press however david davis the brexit secretary said on monday that parts of the manifesto may be pruned away after the conservatives failed to win a parliamentary majority in the election labour s manifesto pledged to implement the recommendations of leveson including section 40 and press ahead with part two of the inquiry the tories are in negotiations with the democratic unionist party about a deal that will allow key legislation such as the queen s speech and the budget to pass through parliament the dup manifesto does not make any reference to press regulation but calls for the tv licence fee to be scrapped and for a reform of the bbc following an independent review the manifesto says the tv licence fee is a highly regressive tax which was designed for a different era and a world of communication that no longer exists the success of netflix and amazon streaming services shows that subscription based media can and does work an independent commission should be established to conduct a review of how the bbc is structured and the services it provides and to examine alternative funding models identify the opportunities for competitive tendering of key services and produce a plan that will either significantly reduce the licence fee or abolish it
2017-04-23,0,on 9 march 2017 an ordinary thursday morning ian stubbings a 35 year old londoner was walking down the street near his office in south kensington when he spotted a familiar face he turned and saw a man entering the redbrick terrace which houses the ecuadorian embassy where the wikileaks founder julian assange has been holed up since 2012 and the familiar face it was nigel farage the man who spearheaded britain s exit from the european union i thought hang on a moment stubbings says that looks a bit dodgy i knew the building was the embassy because i often see camera crews outside but there was no one else around i was the only person who d seen him and i did not know what the significance was and i still do not actually but i thought that is got to be worth telling and i was the only person who d witnessed it so at 11 22am he tweeted it his handle is custardgannet and he wrote genuine scoop just saw nigel farage enter the ecuadorian embassy moments later a reporter from buzzfeed who happened to follow him on twitter picked it up and tweeted him back and stubbings told her no press or cameras around no press or cameras around that is until buzzfeed turned up just in time to catch farage leaving 40 minutes later nigel farage just visited the ecuadorian embassy in london the headline said asked by buzzfeed news if he would been visiting julian assange the former ukip leader said he could not remember what he had been doing in the building and that was how the world found out by accident that the founder of wikileaks the organisation which published hillary clinton s leaked emails a decisive advantage for donald trump s campaign and farage a friend of donald trump were mutually acquainted in britain we routinely treat farage as if he were widow twankey in the national pantomime that is ukip politics and widow twankey dropping by on the man who lives in the ecuadorian embassy s broom cupboard seemed just one more weird moment in the weird times in which we now live six weeks on it had faded into yet another episode in the surreality show that now passes for normality but in a week that saw two major developments on both sides of the atlantic regarding the respective roles that assange and farage played in the us election and the eu referendum the same week in which a uk general election was announced it is an attitude that needs urgent re examination for if you were to pick three individuals who had the most decisive impact on that most decisive of years 2016 it would be hard to see beyond trump assange and farage what was not known until ian stubbings decided to go for an early lunch is that there is a channel of communication between them last week brought this more clearly into focus because in a shock development last thursday the us justice department announced it had prepared charges with a view to arresting assange a day later the electoral commission announced it was investigating leave eu the brexit campaign farage headed significantly the commission said its investigation was focused on whether one or more donations including of services accepted by leave eu was impermissible one of the grounds on which a donation can be deemed impermissible is that it comes from abroad a fundamental principle of british democracy and our electoral laws is that foreign citizens and foreign companies cannot buy influence in british elections via campaign donations robert mercer the billionaire hedge fund owner bankrolled the trump campaign and his company cambridge analytica the observer has revealed donated services to leave eu if this issue forms part of the electoral commission investigation this is not just a case of possibly breaking rules by overspending a few pounds it goes to the heart of the integrity of our democratic system did leave eu seek to obtain foreign support for a british election and if so does this constitute foreign subversion what did or did not happen on 9 march may perhaps reveal clues to understanding this to unravelling the links between wikileaks the uk and the trump administration an administration embroiled in ever deeper connections to the russian state between trump whose campaign was funded by mercer and who came to power with the help of the same analytics firm now under investigation for its work with leave eu and brexit and 9 march was the day that all these worlds came together when the cyber libertarian movement that assange represents collided headfirst with the global rightwing libertarian movement that farage represents when nigel farage tripped down the steps of the ecuadorian embassy a visit that he did not expect to be photographed or documented a beam of light was shone on a previously hidden world a political alignment between wikileaks ideology ukip s ideology and trump s ideology that is not necessarily just an affinity it is also potentially a channel of communication david golumbia an associate professor at virginia commonwealth university in the us who has studied wikileaks describes it as the moment when the lines suddenly become visible he says it was like the picture suddenly came into focus there is this worldwide rightwing nationalistic movement that is counter to the eu and this is present in the us and europe and russia and we are just starting to understand how they do all seem to be in communication and co ordination with each other in many ways it was not a surprise there are clear ideological similarities between assange and farage they have both been regulars on rt russia s state sponsored news channel they have both been paid indirectly by the russian state to appear on it ben nimmo a defence analyst with the atlantic council s digital forensic research lab points out that farage has voted systematically in favour of russian interests in the european parliament there is very very strong support for the kremlin among the far right in europe and farage is squarely in that bloc with the likes of the front national in france and jobbik in hungary in february when i started my investigation into leave eu and cambridge analytica i met andy wigmore its director of communications for a coffee and he told me that farage was in the us where he was going to be making a big platform speech at cpac the us conservative conference and it is not going to be his normal mr brexit speech he said he is going to be talking about the need for closer relations with russia really i said that sounds odd what no way farage has been across the subject for years in the european parliament it did not make much sense at the time and in fact that was not the speech that farage made on 24 february he told the crowd our real friends in the world speak english the next evening he had dinner with trump at the washington trump hotel and tweeted a photo of him with the donald in the early hours of the morning eleven days later he headed off to the ecuadorian embassy buzzfeed s story dropped at 1 31pm and 57 minutes later at 2 28pm wikileaks made an announcement it would host a live press conference by julian assange about his latest leak vault 7 the timing of this was lost in the is not that bizarre tone of the coverage and maybe also it is only with distance that it raises significant questions not least because the complex web of connections between the trump administration is a challenge for even hardened us newshounds to follow nearly every day of 2017 has brought forth some new nugget of fact about trump russia but this was a tough week for trump even by his standards the witch hunt as he is termed it was gathering pace on 2 march his attorney general jeff sessions recused himself from the trump russia investigation and on 4 march trump retaliated in a tweetstorm which accused obama of wiretapping him and then on 7 march he finally caught a break some other news came along to knock him off the front page for more than a month wikileaks had been periodically issuing cryptic tweets about vault 7 a month passed before it finally landed a leak that whether by accident or design embarrassed the cia wikileaks data trove had come from what it called the cia s global hacking force its center for cyber intelligence cia scrambles to contain damage from wikileaks documents said the headline in what trump calls the failing new york times the documents apparently showed that the cia had the capability to hack a huge number of devices not just phones but also tvs in the midst of the most serious investigation of foreign cyber interference in a current administration in us history vivid revelations about the us s similar capacity to interfere abroad had hit the headlines a highly placed contact with links to us intelligence told the observer when the heat is turned up and all electronic communication you have to assume is being intensely monitored then those are the times when intelligence communication falls back on human couriers where you have individuals passing information in ways and places that cannot be monitored when asked about the meeting in the embassy farage said i never discuss where i go or who i see in october roger stone a republican strategist whose links to russia are currently under investigation by the fbi told a local cbs reporter about a back channel communication with assange because we have a good mutual friend that friend travels back and forth from the united states to london and we talk asked directly by the observer if nigel farage was that friend his spokesman said definitely not and in some ways this may not be the point a channel exists in the perfect storm of fake news disinformation and social media in which we now live wikileaks is in many ways the swirling vortex at the centre of everything farage s relationship with the organisation is just one of a whole host of questions to which we currently have no answer some of those questions dog arron banks the bristol businessman who bankrolled leave eu and who announced last week that he is standing for election in clacton when i interviewed him last month he said not a single penny of russian money has been put into brexit though that was not a question i had asked him he is however openly pro putin and anti democracy it is not possible to run that entire country russia as a pure democracy he said when asked about the investigation into leave eu s campaign finances he told me i do not give a monkey s about the electoral commission on friday night he released a letter saying that he would no longer co operate with the commission a body mandated by parliament to uphold uk electoral law and said he would see them in court as britain hurtles towards a general election to choose a government that will take us out of the european union this may be the moment to realise that nigel farage is not widow twankey and that this is not a pantomime farage s politics and his relationships are more complicated than we the british press have previously realised his relationship to mercer and cambridge analytica the same firm that helped trump to power is now under official investigation every day more and more questions are being asked about that administration yet here in britain we plunge blindly on real hard questions need to asked about what exactly these relationships are and what they mean do not they
2017-03-29,0,theresa may has told parliament that she accepts brexit will carry consequences for the uk as a letter delivered to brussels began a two year countdown to britain s departure from the eu the prime minister made a speech on triggering article 50 minutes after the european council president donald tusk confirmed he had received notification he declared that the uk has delivered brexit nine months after a bruising referendum campaign we understand that there will be consequences for the uk of leaving the eu we know that we will lose influence over the rules that affect the european economy we know that uk companies that trade with the eu will have to align with rules agreed by institutions of which we are no longer a part just as we do in other overseas markets we accept that she said a number of mps congratulated the prime minister on the tone of her letter to tusk which stressed britain s commitment to the continent as a close friend and ally but others accused her of issuing a blatant threat to withdraw security cooperation if the eu27 fail to deliver on a trade agreement the letter suggests that the government hopes to roll the separate issues together claiming no deal will mean wto rules but also that our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened may s spokesman repeatedly insisted placing security and trade relations alongside each other in the letter to tusk was not intended as a threat it is a simple statement of fact that if we leave the eu without a deal then the arrangements we have as part of our eu membership will lapse he said the prime minister said wednesday was a day of celebration for some and disappointment for others a point underlined as passionate campaigners on either side of the debate rose after her statement to put forward their arguments the referendum last june was divisive at times not everyone shared the same point of view or voted in the same way the arguments on both sides were passionate she said may said her government accepted repeated warnings from european leaders that britain could not cherrypick during eu negotiations and that was why it would not remain a full member of the single market she urged her european counterparts to help secure a bold and ambitious free trade agreement as she promised to approach the talks constructively respectfully and in a spirit of sincere cooperation may stressed a number of times that she wanted a new deep and special partnership with the rest of the eu she made clear that in her eyes there was now no way to stop brexit adding that her government was acting on the democratic will of the british people this is an historic moment from which there can be no turning back britain is leaving the european union we are going to make our own decisions and our own laws we are going to take control of the things that matter most to us and we are going to take this opportunity to build a stronger fairer britain a country that our children and grandchildren are proud to call home she said that security in europe was more fragile than at any time since the cold war warning that any weakening of cooperation would be a costly mistake the need for close cooperation on that issue had been reinforced by the abhorrent attack on westminster bridge and this place last week the labour leader jeremy corbyn responded by promising that the government would be held to account at every stage of the negotiations the british people made a decision to leave the european union and labour respects that decision he told mps the next steps along this journey are the most crucial and if the prime minister is to unite the country the government needs to listen consult and represent the whole country not just hardline tory ideologues on her own benches he promised to oppose any threats to turn britain into a low wage tax haven minutes before may began her statement tusk announced that he had received the british government s letter with a tweet the six pages starting britain s exit from the eu and handed over by the uk s eu ambassador sir tim barrow set seven key principles for britain as it entered the talks including may was heckled when she declared that she would fight for the liberal democratic values of europe and insisted that the uk was not leaving europe and would remain a close friend and ally the prime minister stressed her desire to strengthen the union of the four nations of the uk in comments that led to a response from snp mps she said the government would negotiate for all parts of the country arguing that the devolved administrations would have more powers after brexit in response to comments by the snp s angus robertson about scotland s vote to remain in the eu may stressed that her own maidenhead constituency had voted to stay within the union but that she had to honour the overall vote in prime minister s questions before the statement the former snp leader alex salmond stressed disunity across the country as he urged the government to delay the triggering of article 50 after nine months of this prime minister s approach to brexit northern ireland is deadlocked the welsh are alienated scotland is going for a referendum the english are split down the middle and brexit mps are walking out of committees because they do not like home truths he said tim farron the lib dem leader later said it is shameful that theresa may has threatened to withdraw security cooperation from our closest neighbours and allies with growing terrorist threats from around the world it is imperative that we work together with european allies for our mutual security she is prepared to put the safety of british and european citizens on the line just so she can deliver her hard brexit yvette cooper labour chair of the home affairs select committee suggested it would be dangerous to wrap the issues together she should not be trying to use this as a bargaining chip in the negotiations this is not a threat to the rest of europe it would be a serious act of self harm she should rule out now walking away with no security deal as our national security and public safety depend on it asked by labour mp catherine mckinnell may denied making a threat i go on to make very clear in the letter that not having arrangements not having agreements on these issues would not be in the interests of the uk and european union and we should work to ensure that we secure a deal she said earlier in the day mps were given details of the article 50 letter during a special cabinet meeting senior conservative mps ended the session by banging the table enthusiastically including those who had backed remain according to someone who was present however it appeared that there may still be tensions across the cabinet table when philip hammond said britain accepted it could not have its cake and eat it when negotiating with the eu in comments that may be seen as a dig at boris johnson who said late last year that the government s policy was to have it all the chancellor said britain s position to leave the single market and full customs union had sent a clear signal that we understand we cannot cherrypick we cannot have our cake and eat it a whitehall source retorted we should not be downbeat today and we can absolutely have the best deal claiming that hammond might

2017-04-27,0,the german government is encouraging britain to agree a mathematical formula for calculating its european divorce settlement rather than settling on a precise figure in an attempt to avoid a looming clash that risks derailing brexit talks the chancellor angela merkel put the eu on a potential collision course with theresa may on thursday by insisting it made no sense to negotiate a future uk eu relationship without first reaching agreement on the uk s financial commitment to the eu in her first big brexit speech since may triggered article 50 merkel told the german parliament that british politicians were still living under an illusion that the uk would retain most of its rights and privileges once it left the eu countries with a third country status and that is what great britain will be cannot and will not have the same or even more rights as a member of the european union she said you may think that all this is self evident but i have to put this so clearly because i get the impression that some in great britain still have illusions about this and that is a waste of time there are mounting fears that the intransigent position of european leaders is encouraging the hardliners in britain who are threatening to walk away with no deal britain s cbi german carmakers and the irish government all sounded the alarm on thursday at the dire prospects for uk eu trade if there was no agreement privately officials in berlin are looking for creative solutions to the problem which might avoid the prime minister being forced to write a politically unpalatable 60bn 51bn cheque before she even gets to start negotiating future trade relations german government sources suggest that a constructive solution mentioned in merkel s blunt statement could take the form of the uk agreeing to a formula by which britain s future contributions in specific areas such as pensions eu budget growth funds would be calculated thus avoiding coming up with concrete sums the idea was met with a mixture of bemusement and scepticism in london where the tory government remains determined to try to negotiate its future trade relationship at the same time as separation talks eurosceptic critics in the media are likely to calculate an implied cost of brexit whether or not politicians are willing to acknowledge it publicly uk government sources pointed to earlier speeches by merkel where she suggested there was merit in parallel talks they suggested that the looming german election could be responsible for a hardening of language which they hoped would be temporary german taxpayers are likely to end up footing the largest bill for filling any eu budget shortfall after brexit leading to domestic pressure not to be seen to let britain off the hook in the uk parliament david jones the brexit minister told mps that the government was willing to leave the eu with no deal if necessary the ambition and intention of the government is to achieve the best possible free trade agreement with our eu partners however our position also is this we expect to negotiate toughly and unlike the opposition our position will be made clear to the european union that we are prepared to walk away from the negotiating table if it is not possible to achieve a deal that suits us merkel was speaking shortly before european affairs ministers met in luxembourg to finalise the negotiating guidelines eu leaders are due to adopt at a special summit on saturday the first ministerial talks without a british presence since 1973 these guidelines flesh out the core principles of the eu s negotiating strategy preserving the single market and stopping the uk from cherrypicking the eu s advantages as well as a ban on talks about a future trade deal until the uk agrees its eu divorce including paying the brexit bill with the text largely agreed the meeting served as a show of unity before brexit talks it was an unprecedented signal of trust unity and consensus of the 27 eu member states declared louis grech the deputy prime minister of malta who chaired the meeting all delegations agreed with the overall thrust of the guidelines and expressed their full support we made it very clear in the guidelines that the single market is indivisible and there will not be cherrypicking responding to a question about the uk contributions to the eu budget he said the financial settlement had not been discussed in detail
2017-04-12,0,foreign governments such as russia and china may have been involved in the collapse of a voter registration website in the run up to the eu referendum a committee of mps has claimed a report by the commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee pacac said mps were deeply concerned about the allegations of foreign interference in last year s brexit vote the committee does not identify who may have been responsible but has noted that both russia and china use an approach to cyber attacks based on an understanding of mass psychology and of how to exploit individuals the findings follow repeated claims that russia has been involved in trying to influence the us and french presidential elections ministers were forced to extend the deadline to register to vote in the eu referendum after the collapse of the government s website on 7 june 100 minutes before the deadline the collapse resulted in concerns that tens of thousands of people could have been disenfranchised at the time the government said it was the result of an unprecedented spike in demand with more than 500 000 people trying to register on the final day the report published on wednesday said there were clues that a distributed denial of service attack ddos using botnets a network of computers infected with malicious software was used to overwhelm the site the crash had indications of being a ddos attack we understand that this is very common and easy to do with botnets the key indicants are timing and relative volume rate the committee s report said while the incident had no material effect on the outcome of the referendum the committee said it was crucial that lessons were learned for future votes that must extend beyond purely technical issues the report noted the us and uk understanding of cyber is predominantly technical and computer network based for example russia and china use a cognitive approach based on understanding of mass psychology and of how to exploit individuals the implications of this different understanding of cyber attack as purely technical or as reaching beyond the digital to influence public opinion for the interference in elections and referendums are clear pacac is deeply concerned about these allegations about foreign interference the report concluded britain is being hit by dozens of cyber attacks a month including attempts by russian state sponsored hackers to steal defence and foreign policy secrets gchq s new security chief ciaran martin said in february the chancellor philip hammond said the national cyber security centre which martin heads had blocked 34 550 potential attacks on government departments and members of the public in the six months to february about 200 cases a day the committee which is chaired by the senior backbencher bernard jenkin was also highly critical of the way david cameron held the referendum to call the bluff of his critics and then resigned when he lost it said that in future referendums the prime minister of the day should be prepared to carry on in office and to implement the result whatever the outcome there was no proper planning for a leave vote so the eu referendum opened up much new controversy and left the prime minister s credibility destroyed it said it should be reasonable to presume that the sitting prime minister and his her administration will continue in office and take responsibility for the referendum result in either eventuality according to the report there were many occasions in the run up to the vote when it appeared officials were being drawn into referendum controversy damaging the civil service s reputation for impartiality a cabinet office spokeswoman said there was no evidence to support the committee s claim of possible interference from foreign governments we have been very clear about the cause of the website outage in june 2016 it was due to a spike in users just before the registration deadline there is no evidence to suggest malign intervention she said we conducted a full review into the outage and have applied the lessons learned we will ensure these are applied for all future polls and online services
2017-03-05,0,michael gove and other tory brexit campaigners on sunday called on theresa may to unilaterally guarantee the rights of 3 2 million eu citizens to remain in the uk as they back a parliamentary report that brands the government policy as unacceptable gove is one of several pro brexit tories on the all party select committee on exiting the eu who say that may s approach is causing great anxiety and uncertainty to people who work hard in the uk pay their taxes and deserve immediate reassurance about their futures the committee says in a report published on sunday that eu citizens should not be used as bargaining chips in negotiations over brexit the report piles yet more pressure on may following a vote in the house of lords last week in which peers defeated the government by 358 to 256 over the rights of eu citizens the peers backed an amendment to the brexit bill urging ministers to ensure within three months of article 50 being triggered that the eu citizens living in the uk be given the right to stay while ministers have vowed to reverse the defeat and strike out the amendment when the bill returns to the commons next week the report is evidence that concerns expressed by labour snp and liberal democrat mps are widely shared in tory ranks even among those who have advanced the case to leave the eu as well as gove other hardline leave supporters on the committee who unanimously approved the report include former tory ministers dominic raab and peter lilley so far may has insisted she will not guarantee the rights of eu citizens until the other 27 member states make similar pledges that the rights of uk nationals living in their countries are also assured the attempt to turn their futures into a negotiating weapon has angered many senior conservatives including viscount hailsham who told peers last week that guaranteeing the rights of eu citizens was a matter of principle as many eu citizens had made career changing and life changing decisions to move to the uk which could not easily be reversed the committee report states the result of the referendum and subsequent debate in the uk and across the eu have created a great deal of anxiety and uncertainty for eu citizens resident in the uk and for uk citizens in the eu eu nationals in the uk did not have a vote in the referendum they came to the uk legally and have contributed to the uk economically and culturally and enriched uk society the vast majority have worked hard paid their taxes integrated raised families and put down roots it is difficult to see what more the uk could have asked of them the result of the referendum however has made them very unsure of their future although the government has said it wants eu citizens to be able to remain the committee notes that this has not offered sufficient reassurance that the rights and status that they have enjoyed will be guaranteed the mps add eu nationals in the uk and uk nationals in the eu are aware that their fate is subject to the negotiations they do not want to be used as bargaining chips and the uncertainty they are having to live with is not acceptable notwithstanding the assurance given by the home secretary we recommend that the uk should now make a unilateral decision to safeguard the rights of eu nationals living in the uk the committee also calls for the system by which eu nationals can apply for permanent residence after having lived in the uk for five years to be drastically simplified eu nationals currently have to fill in an 85 page form that the mps say is so complex and onerous that it will cause huge bureaucratic logjams the labour chair of the committee hilary benn mp said the permanent residence application process is disproportionately burdensome and involves collection of information which goes far beyond what is required to prove residence over a five year period while there will always be complex cases that require detailed consideration it should be possible to clarify the status of the vast majority of individuals already here by simply using a streamlined system labour s brexit spokesman keir starmer said on saturday this just emphasises how isolated the prime minister is now on this whether you campaigned to remain or leave there is a growing consensus including now the house of lords and the cross party brexit select committee that eu nationals should not be used as bargaining chips the prime minister needs to listen to this and act now friends of gove and raab said they still expected them to vote against the lords amendment when it returned to the commons on the grounds that the concession should be made separately and should not have to be included in the actual brexit bill to trigger article 50 labour while insisting that it will not seek to block or hold up brexit will continue to support the lords amendment in the commons on tuesday the government is facing the prospect of a second defeat on the brexit bill when peers vote on an amendment that would require a proposed deal on brexit to be put to a vote in both houses of parliament before it is agreed with the eu or voted on in the european parliament the amendment has strong cross party backing and is expected to be passed by a large majority
2017-04-28,0,when barack obama banks the cheque for 400 000 he will receive for talking to an audience of wall street bankers and their most important clients in september the former president might like to quietly thank the statesman who did so much to pioneer the idea of the celebrity political speaker winston churchill more than 70 years ago in march 1946 churchill recently ousted as prime minister turned up at westminster college in fulton missouri to present his views on the state of the world the audience in fulton certainly got more than it bargained for because churchill used his lecture to coin the phrase that came to describe the cold war britain s wartime premier with us president harry truman in the audience described how an iron curtain had descended across europe from stettin on the baltic sea to trieste on the adriatic these days former us presidents are the biggest draw on the international speaker circuit their speeches can command hundreds of thousands of dollars from banks hedge funds and corporations the reasons behind inviting esteemed guest speakers have changed little down the years hosts are looking for political insight information that makes them think they are in the know or simply some juicy gossip by the standards of american chief executives occupants of the white house are poorly paid obama will earn as much for his speech at cantor fitzgerald on the sensitive theme of healthcare issues as he earned in a year as president his predecessors bagged far bigger fees bill clinton once received 750 000 for addressing the telecoms company ericsson in hong kong but speaking for big bucks can have its pitfalls hillary clinton quickly joined the speaking circuit after leaving office as secretary of state in 2013 for a minimum of 225 000 per speech but a series of talks paid for by goldman sachs including one at the bank s builders and innovators conference held in marana arizona were cited by her political rivals as examples of how out of touch with ordinary voters she had become david cameron and george osborne have faced similar problems after presiding over a period of falling real wages that is unprecedented since victorian times the pair command more for a speech than their erstwhile constituents could make in a year neither appears especially bothered however cameron has reportedly told friends that it is time to put some hay in the barn following his departure from politics osborne who only resigned as an mp when the snap election was announced said he was just doing what his predecessors had done osborne s speeches were given in private but the fees he received had to be disclosed while he remained an mp in just one week in november five months after he was fired by theresa may he received 187 474 for speeches at banks and hedge funds in london and new york among those payments was 34 109 from blackrock the world s biggest fund manager which has since hired him to work one day a week for 650 000 a year he has also been paid to speak by wall street bank jp morgan and at the annual meeting of the rich and powerful in davos in january where he was pictured socialising with george and amal clooney the former chancellor received 51 829 from hsbc at hsbc s annual meeting on friday the bank s chairman douglas flint was challenged about osborne s role and said the former chancellor had talked about global political issues alistair darling osborne s predecessor at the treasury takes issue with the idea that all ex politicians are raking it in the americans seem to pay very large sums of money darling says but i do not do the after dinner circuit and and i ve never spoken in america some former politicians have earned a reputation as accomplished after dinner speakers notably william hague the former foreign secretary who has been dubbed the david beckham of witty toasts by hillary clinton american audiences were especially interested in what thatcher had to say about the lifting of the iron curtain and in john major s take on the first gulf war against saddam hussein in 1990 tony blair s decision to join george w bush in the 2003 invasion of iraq meant he was the most sought after british politician since thatcher the hot topics these days are brexit about which alistair darling says he has done quite a few at conferences and seminars insight into european and us politics and trade wars cameron spoke at a tourism conference in bangkok this week the lack of a referendum was poisoning british politics and so i put that right he said he also tailored his words for his audience telling delegates that the biggest threat to our world and also to your industry is the threat of islamist extremism andrew honnor of greenbrook communications which advises hedge funds says people engage speakers to help manage and understand political risk everyone is trying to get their head around it and how to factor it into their models many of the events like osborne s are held in private with invitation only audiences of either staff or clients often on the understanding that speakers will not be quoted in the hope that politicians will spill the beans but even so one city executive says this does not necessarily make the politicians less cautious the speakers are still aware that something they say could get out of the room hedge funds always desperate for information are among the biggest users of political speakers possibly just to stay in touch with the real world do not underestimate the bubble that some of some of these guys live in says honnor they crawl over financial models and think very differently to the way a politician thinks
2017-03-04,0,the embattled leader of the democratic unionists in northern ireland arlene foster will remain in her post despite her party losing 10 seats in thursday s election to the devolved assembly in belfast one of her mps has said jeffrey donaldson insisted that instead of seeking her resignation the focus should be on arlene and the party getting a government up and running again at stormont sinn féin is now only one seat behind the dup after a bruising and divisive election caused by foster s refusal to temporarily stand down as northern ireland s first minister following a botched green energy scheme scandal which has the potential of costing taxpayers 500m gerry adams sinn féin s president said late on saturday that the election result which saw his party move up to 27 seats showed the notion of a perpetual unionist majority has been demolished in northern ireland speaking earlier in west belfast adams described sinn féin s performance as a watershed moment the dup remain the largest party in the new assembly with donaldson stressing that foster would still be their nominee as first minister if and when a power sharing government is restored donaldson said i am not aware of any election in the past where the leader of the largest party resigns because they have won the election we need to learn the lesson and understand what people were saying in this election and what the key messages are we have been given the responsibility as the main party to take the lead at stormont and that is what we intend to do so we are not going to get bogged down on what some people want to focus on which is personalities the election results mean the dup and sinn féin will once again lead the negotiations aimed at creating a new power sharing government in belfast when they take place on monday however the prospect of the parties reaching agreement in the three week timeframe imposed by the northern ireland secretary james brokenshire appears remote if that deadline passes the government would be obliged to call yet another snap election but it may instead opt to put stormont in cold storage and reintroduce direct rule before the negotiations start on monday the irish government has been contacting all of the parties over the weekend to persuade them to reach a deal in a statement on saturday night ireland s foreign minister charlie flanagan said the high 65 turnout at the election demonstrated that people in the north cared about the institutions set up under the 1998 good friday agreement and the devolved government flanagan said as co guarantors of the good friday agreement and subsequent agreements the irish and british governments stand ready to provide whatever support or engagement may be necessary to re establish the devolved institutions in this regard i plan to be in touch with the parties in northern ireland and with secretary of state brokenshire over the next 24 hours earlier on saturday the northern ireland secretary also claimed that the election results proved that people in the region wanted cross community devolved government back in place brokenshire called for intensive negotiations between the parties to begin on monday morning he insisted his prime goal was to see power sharing devolution restored rather than the imposition of direct rule northern ireland has made great strides forward over the past two decades he said all of us must continue the work of building a stable peaceful and prosperous northern ireland that works for everyone based on the strong foundations of the belfast agreement and its successors it is with positive intent that the uk government approaches the days ahead i will be speaking to party leaders during the course of today and remaining in contact with the irish government the dup took a major electoral hit over the controversy around a renewable heat incentive scheme that became known as the cash for ash scandal owing to poor accounting the incentive resulted in farmers and small businesses making 1 60 for every 1 they invested in boilers fired with wood pellets and other recyclable materials it will now cost taxpayers in northern ireland an estimated 500m the dup was criticised first for championing the scheme through foster and then for defending the project despite the spiralling cost to the public purse all 90 seats were declared on saturday morning with 28 to the dup sinn féin on 27 the sdlp with 12 the ulster unionists falling to 10 the cross community alliance party with eight the green party securing two the hardline traditional unionist voice coming back with one seat and the leftwing people before profit party going down to one the independent unionist and justice minister in the last coalition clare sugden was also re elected this article was amended on 6 march 2017 an earlier version stated the potential cost of the green energy scheme as both 500 000 and 500m the latter is correct
2017-02-18,0,the eu fears millions of its nationals living in the uk will be left stranded in a legal no man s land after the country leaves the eu because of the weaknesses of the british immigration system a document obtained by the observer reveals meps and senior european diplomats fear that chaos will ensue as the home office does not have the information or systems in place to select who can stay once the uk restricts access to nationals from the other 27 eu member states it is widely assumed that at an early stage of the article 50 negotiations britain and the eu will agree a cut off date after which foreigners who have settled in the country will not have an automatic right to remain but a leaked document drawn up by meps on the european parliament s employment committee to aid the eu s brexit negotiations warns the uk has no population register in practice it would be difficult to determine which eu27 citizens were residing legally in the uk before the brexit would have taken effect if all 3 3 million eu citizens were to initiate procedures aimed at proving the exercise of treaty rights the administrative system would be overburdened an opinium poll for the observer published today finds that a large majority of britons believe eu nationals living in the uk should be given the automatic right to stay just 5 said they should be asked to leave but eight months after last june s referendum uncertainty about the future has become a source of deep anxiety among european citizens living in the uk responding to the brussels report one senior diplomat from an eastern european state said it came as a surprise to me that the uk was unable to monitor comings and goings they will have to find a workable solution quickly tony blair s government was forced to drop plans for a national id card and population register in 2007 because of concerns over the security of citizens data not least from david davis now secretary of state for exiting the eu the cabinet office advises that eu nationals do not need to register for any documentation in order to enjoy free movement rights and responsibilities in the uk the government does not track eu nationals as they enter and leave the country the databases of the department for work and pensions hm revenue and customs and the home office do not share information the government could use the national insurance number system to help distinguish between those who were in the country before and after brexit but it would not cover those who neither work nor claim benefits allowing the right of residence to anyone who has registered for a national insurance number before a particular date would also give a right to stay to potentially millions of people who are no longer in the country including those who were in the uk only briefly and have little or no connection to the uk it would also not deal with the question of the rights of family members of those with national insurance numbers to join their relatives in the country last week theresa may stressed the importance of an early deal on eu citizens rights after brexit during talks with the french prime minister bernard cazeneuve at downing street amid growing criticism of the government s refusal to give early and absolute assurances some ministers have suggested that the issue will be a bargaining chip in the talks responding to the leaked document keir starmer shadow secretary of state for exiting the eu told the observer that the government had not done enough he said this report reinforces the need for the pm to take decisive action to support eu nationals in the uk for months labour has called for the pm to show a lead on this and to end unnecessary uncertainty for eu nationals not only has theresa may failed to do so but we now hear of real concern that the immigration system she presided over for six years may not be able to properly process eu nationals cases the pm needs to act swiftly to address this both by unilaterally granting residency rights for eu nationals already in the uk and by ensuring the home office has the necessary resources in place the home office declined to offer any guidance on how the government planned to distinguish between claims of eu nationals claiming that work on the problem was ongoing we are currently considering the various options as to how eu migration might work once we have left it would be wrong to set out further positions at this stage it said european citizens resident in the uk make a vital contribution both to our economy and our society that is why we will be making securing their status as well as that of british nationals in the eu a priority as soon as we trigger article 50 and the negotiations begin a spokesman said eu nationals who have lived in the uk for five years can gain automatic permanent residency status although there have been numerous cases of bosses asking for their foreign employees to acquire permanent residency cards in order to guarantee their jobs there has been almost a 50 increase in the number of eu citizens applying for permanent residency documentation since the vote on 23 june eu nationals say that to obtain permanent residency cards they have to complete an 85 page form requiring huge files of documentation including p60s for five years historical utility bills and a diary of all the occasions they have left the country since settling in the uk some have received letters inviting them to prepare to leave the country after failing to tick a box on a form the liberal democrats are confident that an amendment to the article 50 bill giving eu nationals a right to stay irrespective of the coming negotiations and the number of years people have lived in the uk will be successful in the house of lords placing may in a position of having to vote it down when the legislation comes back to the commons the european parliament is also due to debate the rights of eu nationals in both the uk and on the continent on 1 march two of the parliament s committees are to host joint hearings to which home office ministers are set to be called to give evidence lord newby the lib dem leader in the lords said the government is generating real fear and uncertainty amongst large numbers of people
2017-01-15,0,theresa may will aim to strike a defiant tone in her upcoming brexit speech on the risks to the rest of the eu of giving britain a raw deal echoing the combative approach taken by the chancellor in a speech by the prime minister on tuesday that will be watched closely in eu capitals downing street is keen to impress that there are potentially lucrative economic opportunities elsewhere weeks before the uk is expected to trigger article 50 philip hammond in an interview with german newspaper welt am sonntag warned that britain would do whatever we have to do to regain competitiveness and appeared to accept that the uk was prepared to become a tax haven if necessary the chancellor was responding to a suggestion that the impression on the european continent is that your government sees the future business model of the uk as being the tax haven of europe hammond said most of us who had voted remain would like the uk to remain a recognisably european style economy with european style taxation systems european style regulation systems etc i personally hope we will be able to remain in the mainstream of european economic and social thinking but if we are forced to be something different then we will have to become something different the labour leader jeremy corbyn said the comments suggested the threat of some sort of trade war with britain s eu partners and accused hammond of wanting to turn the uk into a bargain basement economy it really does not seem to me to be a very sensible way forward he said brexiters in the cabinet believe the government would be better placed to reach ambitious trade deals with countries outside the eu including the us if it were not tied into existing arrangements the pound hit a fresh 31 year low in the wake of reports on may s speech falling below 1 20 in trading on sunday night one analyst warned that sterling will go on a market roller coaster following claims that the uk will seek a hard brexit so far eu leaders have been united in saying there will be no cherry picking of legislation suggesting that may will not be able to impose strict limits on immigration while retaining the economic benefits of eu membership in his interview on sunday the chancellor reiterated the government s view that the brexit vote was a signal that voters would like to see tougher controls on immigration we are aware that the message from the referendum is that we must control our immigration policy he said hammond s intervention came after mark carney the bank of england governor told the treasury select committee the greatest risks to financial stability from an unruly brexit were for other eu members the prime minister s speech at lancaster house in london on tuesday will be analysed carefully in financial markets for signs that the government has abandoned the idea of remaining in the single market sterling fell sharply after may s party conference speech in october in which she appeared to signal a hard brexit the pound which hit a 31 year low against the dollar after the referendum will be under further pressure if may rules out staying in the single market there has been no decision about whether to publish a document setting out may s approach to brexit negotiations or let the prime minister s speech stand as the plan as she promised to mps over the weekend the brexit select committee chaired by the labour mp hilary benn but including the key leave campaigning conservatives michael gove and dominic raab called for the government to publish a formal white paper setting out its priorities for when talks begin the government is awaiting the result of the supreme court appeal on whether it must consult parliament before triggering article 50 beginning the formal divorce process with the eu a verdict is expected within a fortnight may is likely to emphasise britain s enthusiasm for pressing ahead with negotiating trade deals with countries including the us in his interview hammond said the brexit vote was not a sign that britain has chosen to take a more isolationist stance and rejected the comparison with the forces that swept donald trump into the white house i cannot speak for what is going on in the us that is a different political movement but in my judgment it would be a mistake to read the brexit vote as being part of the same strand of thinking that has formed in the us if you look at the media and the reporting during the brexit referendum campaign there was no anti trade rhetoric it was the exact opposite he said
2017-01-01,0,scotland looks set to be the first part of the uk to pilot a basic income for every citizen as councils in fife and glasgow investigate trial schemes in 2017 the councillor matt kerr has been championing the idea through the ornate halls of glasgow city chambers and is frank about the challenges it poses like a lot of people i was interested in the idea but never completely convinced he said but working as labour s anti poverty lead on the council kerr says that he kept coming back to the basic income kerr sees the basic income as a way of simplifying the uk s byzantine welfare system but it is also about solidarity it says that everyone is valued and the government will support you it changes the relationship between the individual and the state the concept of a universal basic income revolves around the idea of offering every individual regardless of existing welfare benefits or earned income a non conditional flat rate payment with any income earned above that taxed progressively the intention is to provide a basic economic platform on which people can build their lives whether they choose to earn learn care or set up a business the shadow chancellor john mcdonnell has suggested that it is likely to appear in his party s next manifesto while there has been a groundswell of interest among anti poverty groups who see it as a means of changing not only the relationship between people and the state but between workers and increasingly insecure employment in the gig economy kerr accepts that while he is hopeful of cross party support in glasgow there are months of work ahead including first arranging a feasibility study in order to present a strong enough evidence base for a pilot but if there is ever a case to be made then you need to test it in a place like glasgow with the sheer numbers and levels of health inequality if you can make it work here then it can work anywhere the idea has its roots in 16th century humanist philosophy when it was developed by the likes of thomas more but in its modern incarnation it has lately enjoyed successful pilots in india and africa despite its utopian roots champions believe that this is an idea whose time has come particularly in scotland where the governing snp voted in support of a basic income at their spring conference although the proposal has yet to make it into their manifesto at the heart of any experiment with basic income is money how much should people get and where will it come from kerr says his instinct is to base the amount on similar calculations to those made for the living wage it is about having more than just enough to pay the bills but part of the idea of doing a pilot is to make mistakes and also find out what is acceptable to the public there will be a lot of resistance to this we should not kid ourselves part of the problem is we are working against a whole discourse of deserving and undeserving poor as for where the money comes from the funding question is always the big one and really will depend upon the approach a pilot takes says jamie cooke head of rsa scotland which has been spearheading research on the subject across the uk drawing on the experience of similar projects ongoing in finland utrecht in the netherland and ontario in canada cooke suggests it could be funding from particular trusts it could be individual philanthropic funding as we have seen in the states or it could be a redirection of the existing welfare spend obviously the latter is much harder to do in a pilot although that will be happening in finland next year where the experiment is being taken forward by the national government as the scottish government consults on what it has described as the biggest transfer of powers since devolution began the devolution of around 2 7bn or 15 of the total scottish benefits bill affecting 1 4 million people both kerr and cooke believe that this is an ideal moment to consider the basic income seriously it is a time to be testing out new or rather old ideas for a welfare system that genuinely supports independence says kerr cooke likewise believes that cross party support is key pointing to the fact that the leader of the conservative group on fife council has joined forces with the fairer fife commission the council s independent poverty advisory group which initially recommended the trial with the aim of designing a pilot within the next six months scotland was recently added to the list of places to watch for basic income activity by the basic income earth network founded by the radical economist guy standing whose hugely influential book the precariat identified an emerging social class suffering the worst of job insecurity and most likely to be attracted to rightwing populism the thing about scotland is that they really understand the precariat says standing who recently visited the country to meet civil servants local authorities and campaigners to discuss a basic income the sense of insecurity the stagnating living standards all of those things are clear in scotland and the fact that so many within the snp are supportive means there is a real opportunity to do a pilot in scotland the momentum is there he says and once it is framed around a desire for greater social justice then you get away from the stale debate about whether if you give people the basic income then they will be lazy people relate to the idea that everyone should have a social dividend everywhere i go it is the communities that feel left behind by globalisation that are most interested in the idea of a basic income we have seen a sea change in attitudes this sense of alarm about populist rightwing politics has brought more people to thinking we need to do something to provide better security for people we are risking our economic and political stability if we do not do something about it
2017-05-14,0,the human rights group cage is preparing to mount a legal challenge to uk anti terrorism legislation over a refusal to hand over mobile and laptop passwords to border control officials at air terminals ports and international rail stations cage which campaigns on issues such as torture discrimination and wrongful imprisonment is planning to fight the issue as a surveillance v privacy test case the move comes after its international director muhammad rabbani a uk citizen was arrested at heathrow airport in november for refusing to hand over passwords rabbani 35 has been detained at least 20 times over the past decade when entering the uk under schedule 7 of terrorism legislation that provides broad search powers but this was the first time he had been arrested he said he had cooperated as usual and handed over his laptop and mobile phone on previous occasions when asked for his passwords he said he had refused and eventually his devices were returned to him and he was allowed to go but there was a new twist this time when he refused to reveal his passwords he was arrested under schedule 7 provisions of the terrorism act and held overnight at heathrow polar park police station before being released on bail he expects to be charged on wednesday the case comes against the backdrop of a campaign gathering momentum in the us against proposals by the trump administration to require travellers to the us to hand over social media account passwords as a condition of entry the flydontspy campaign is backed by a host of groups including the american civil liberties union and amnesty international jim killock executive director of the uk based open rights group expressed sympathy for rabbani using general terrorism powers to compel people to hand over passwords is inappropriate killock said the police should have a specific reason to acquire a password investigations should take place when there is actual suspicion and the police should be able to justify their actions on that basis rather than using wide ranging powers designed for border searches killock said the issue raises parallels with david miranda partner of journalist glenn greenwald who mounted a successful court challenge last year after being held at heathrow under the same terrorist legislation in 2013 in the wake of the edward snowden whistleblowing story rabbani who said he is prepared to go to jail said forcing someone to hand over their passwords is like a digital strip search it is more pervasive than a physical strip search with a digital strip search it is not merely the possessions you carry that are searched it is all your personal and professional life that is online he said he could not hand over his passwords because material in his laptop documentation relating to a legal case being built around alleged torture involving the us intelligence agencies which will eventually be made public was privileged and it was up to the person involved to give permission that person declined and rabbani said he was tied by this rabbani who studied economics at the school of oriental and african studies university of london joined cage five years ago as managing director in august last year he became international director a role that includes helping investigations of torture victims he argues that the real objective of schedule 7 is not stopping terrorists entering the uk but as a tool to build up a huge data bank on thousands of uk citizens cage calculates that more than 500 000 british nationals mainly muslims have been detained since the legislation was introduced but only 0 2 resulted in arrests it says and of these an even smaller percentage were charged rabbani is one of about 30 000 british nationals detained last year under schedule 7 of these he said only five resulted in arrests and he is one of them the metropolitan police without naming rabbani confirmed that a 35 year old had been arrested at heathrow on 20 november and placed on bail
2017-01-11,0,cabinet ministers have privately conceded that they are very likely to lose a landmark legal case on brexit in the supreme court and have drawn up at least two versions of a bill that could be tabled after the ruling sources have told the guardian that senior government figures are convinced seven of the 11 judges will uphold the high court s demand that theresa may secure the consent of mps and peers before triggering article 50 it is understood that more than one possible bill has been prepared so that the ministers are ready to respond to any detailed guidance from the judges into what the legislation should look like it is not yet clear when the decision is likely but the guardian has been told that the government has asked the supreme court for early sight of the judgment to allow contingency planning however a spokesperson for the supreme court made clear on wednesday that would not happen saying it is just too sensitive ministers hope the court will allow may to put together a short three line bill or even just a motion which is narrowly focused on article 50 itself and difficult for parliamentarians to amend however lady hale deputy president of the court gave a lecture in november suggesting it was possible for the judges to go much further and demand a comprehensive replacement of the 1972 european communities act dominic raab a conservative mp and former minister who campaigned for brexit told the guardian he and colleagues were not too worried about the case i hope we get some common sense from the supreme court but i do not expect the ruling to hold up triggering article 50 and the vast majority of people whichever way they voted now want us to get on and deliver brexit he said however some remain supporting mps and peers are hoping there will be an opportunity to amend legislation for example to demand that the prime minister pursue the closest possible economic relationship with the eu the liberal democrats plan to lay down amendments demanding a brexit deal be put to the public in a second referendum and that 16 and 17 year olds get a vote some pro brexit mps have been urging the prime minister to adopt a keep it simple strategy a phrase borrowed from management theory ensuring any bill is as brief as possible to minimise the risk it could be derailed mark harper the former tory chief whip who backed remain in the referendum said he believed the supreme court would only be able to demand that the government either produce a motion or a bill but not demand any level of detail beyond that he suggested may s government would probably try to publish something very tight that gives authority to ministers to trigger article 50 before the end of march harper said that while it was not possible to avoid any amendments at all a short and focused bill would make it difficult for mps to cause trouble for may by constraining her room for manoeuvre during brexit negotiations he said that if he was still chief whip he would not be complacent about the process but was cautiously optimistic that the legislation would be passed any attempt by the government or the claimants to obtain advance notice of the supreme court decision has been stymied in most cases it is normal practice for the lawyers involved to be sent the judgment on an embargoed basis beforehand in cases as sensitive as the article 50 appeal the judgment is kept secret until the last moment to ensure that it does not leak out a supreme court spokesperson said in view of the potential sensitivity of the case there will be no copies of drafts available to anybody before the day of hand down ministers are planning to move quickly after a judgment to avoid the days of speculation and anger that followed the high court ruling which took the government by surprise the first step is likely to be a statement to the house of commons by the brexit secretary david davis he is proving popular among mps since taking up his role with friends in the conservative party planning a drinks reception this month to belatedly welcome him back to the frontbench his ally andrew mitchell has joked that it is time for a celebration now it is clear that davis who stepped down as an mp in 2008 is not going to resign from this role one rumour circulating in westminster is that the government plans to publish a press release claiming a win of sorts if four judges rule in favour of the government while seven are against that is the outcome that ministers believe is most likely and while they think they are likely to lose the case being brought by gina miller which would require them to publish an act of parliament they are more confident about other aspects in particular they do not think it is likely that the judges will order may to seek agreement from the scottish and welsh devolved administrations before starting the brexit process the prime minister will give a speech setting out her approach later this month and she will later publish a plan for brexit after signing up to a motion put forward by the labour party moderate conservative mps had urged the government to table a formal white paper setting out its priorities as it negotiates brexit including the answer to key questions such as whether may hopes to keep britain in the single market or the customs union but they now expect may to publish a less definitive menu of options amid fears that a detailed white paper could constrain her room for manoeuvre in the coming months the government is still very concerned that if it puts forward a white paper it will be subject to amendment said one backbencher separately the scottish national party snp is seeking to use the political crisis in northern ireland to ramp up the pressure on the government over its decision to table article 50 by the end of march northern ireland like scotland voted to remain in the eu and the government has promised to take formal account of opinion in other parts of the uk through regular meetings of a joint ministerial committee as it enters talks deirdre brock the snp s spokeswoman on northern ireland challenged james brokenshire on monday she asked the secretary of state for northern ireland now that there is no effective administration at stormont who can speak up for northern ireland in the joint ministerial committee and remembering that northern ireland voted to remain can he tell us what he is doing to ensure that the interests of the people of northern ireland are being looked after when brexit negotiations are considered
2017-06-17,0,concern is growing within the conservative party over theresa may s handling of the grenfell tower fire with some fearing it could become her poll tax moment several of the prime minister s allies defended her response to the tragedy on saturday after she was criticised for her initial failure to meet residents and stilted interviews that left many questions unanswered they said there was an unfair narrative that did not reflect efforts she had been making behind the scenes there is a story out there and facts are selected to fit it said one there is concern however among tory mps that the disaster has again placed the spotlight on may s difficulties in demonstrating empathy and responding on her feet weaknesses that were exposed during the election campaign it is an extraordinary tragedy and there will be a lot of questions to ask but i cannot help feeling that in some people s minds this might be her poll tax moment said one former minister you can see real anger labour may not be able to form a government without an election but they could get people out on the streets we have a really difficult problem inside the commons and tough times with this sort of emergency coming up outside margaret thatcher s plan to introduce the poll tax officially called the community charge was eventually abandoned following riots in 1990 another tory mp compared may to gordon brown whose mechanical style and insistence to be across all detail allowed him to be a successful chancellor but did not translate well once he was prime minister she is a bit like brown what appear to be her strengths actually contain her weaknesses as well and she finds it very difficult to publicly display her emotions the mp said that is not to say she does not have a sense of humour or that she cannot cry but she is adrift at present after the shock of the election result and the grenfell disaster may now faces a difficult week that will also see the government announce a stripped down queen s speech with plans to introduce new grammar schools change the education funding formula and cut winter fuel payments expected to be ditched or diluted there is a febrile atmosphere inside the parliamentary conservative party there is little appetite for an immediate leadership challenge or an election which many mps are convinced they would lose but mps believe it could soon become obvious that the party has no scope to pass significant new laws with may now more damaged than ever they fear the conservative party conference will be the stage for an october beauty contest to select a new leader it is almost overwhelming said one tory mp things are changing so quickly the assumption is theresa may has weeks or months william hague s definition of the tory party was that it was an autocracy tempered by regicide i think if you look back over 150 years that is exactly so the departure of may s joint chiefs of staff nick timothy and fiona hill in the wake of the election has also left the prime minister without her two most trusted advisers some tories are convinced she is still in touch with the pair the two most important people in the operation now are the two gavins the chief whip gavin williamson and may s new chief of staff gavin barwell who lost his croydon central seat at the election allies of boris johnson have been making clear that he has no intention of trying to topple may warning his supporters against making any indication that he is on manoeuvres for lots of reasons the last thing the parliamentary party wants at the moment is a leadership contest said an mp it might be boris it might not be boris but taking two or three months doing that now would not be good and it could still mean a general election and there is a good chance we would lose it others in the party believe may s immediate task is simply to navigate a hard week that includes dealing with the grenfell fallout the beginning of brexit talks finalising a confidence deal with the dup and the queen s speech she has never been as low but i would not underestimate her concept of public service and her determination said one party veteran there is a sizeable proportion of the cabinet who are prepared to bolster her as much as possible another mp was less optimistic the next six weeks will show we cannot do very much it may be she lasts a bit longer but it will be a sheer grinding down people will be fed up with impotence
2016-11-13,0,a senior adviser to donald trump has confirmed that the president elect met uk independence party leader nigel farage saying the two men discussed freedom and winning farage later indicated he and trump had discussed the placing of a bust of sir winston churchill back in the oval office kellyanne conway trump s campaign manager in the last months of the presidential campaign left trump tower in new york two hours after farage had been seen to arrive on saturday all these meetings are incredibly productive conway told the guardian farage had previously spent time with trump who regularly invoked brexit as an example of the success coming his way at a campaign rally and after a presidential debate inside the tower conway told reporters i think they enjoy each other s company the interim ukip leader is the first british politician to meet trump following his election victory the meeting is likely to cause concern in downing street following reports that the special relationship between the us and uk could be more difficult to maintain under the new president britain s prime minister theresa may was only the 11th world leader called by trump after his victory on tuesday on saturday evening farage sent a tweet that was accompanied by a picture of the two men smiling broadly in front of a pair of gold doors he added donald trump s support for the us uk relationship is very strong this is a man with whom we can do business especially pleased at his very positive reaction to idea that sir winston churchill s bust should be put back in oval office farage was referring to a running rightwing sore over the alleged removal by barack obama of a bust that was kept in the oval office by george w bush and whether such an alleged action made the current president anti british foreign secretary boris johnson a leader with farage of the campaign for britain to leave the european union wrote in april that it did saturday s intrigue began at 1 50pm local time when farage walked into the lobby of trump tower the fifth avenue skyscraper in which trump lives and from which he runs his business empire trump and key advisers have been meeting at the building since the president elect s return from washington dc where he met barack obama and republican congressional leaders on thursday asked by reporters seeking news of plans and appointments if trump had invited him and if he was helping with the republican s transition to the white house farage said we are just tourists farage met and served trump on the campaign trail speaking for him at a rally in mississippi in august and working the post debate spin room after the second debate against hillary clinton in st louis in early october his arrival at trump tower came just after film maker michael moore left the building which was surrounded by a heavy new york police presence but open to the public at lobby level moore attracted attention when he walked into the lobby at 1 10pm as a 10 000 strong protest march neared i just thought i d see if i could get into trump tower and ride the famous escalator he said adding that he was broadcasting his visit on facebook live police subsequently stopped the protest march a block away at east 55th street and closed the lobby to the public earlier speaking on fox news farage said trump must meet may to mend fences between the uk and the us farage said may s team had been quite rude about the president elect but that trump had got to meet her trump is an anglophile he said he understands and recognises what our two great nations have done together between us and thank goodness we are coming to the end of an american president who loathed us one of the things we can do between us is a sensible trade relationship cut tariffs we are massive investors in each other s countries there is a brighter future asked to comment on the brexit referendum farage said it had given ordinary little people the chance to say what they thought brexit was the first real kick back against the liberal establishment which has dominated with its friends in big business and the big banks dominated the world for the last couple of decades he said what we have to do is follow the example given to us over 30 years ago by reagan and thatcher they both won counter revolution elections they made the world a better place farage was in florida earlier this week for a private meeting earlier on saturday ukip sources said no firm meeting was scheduled with the president elect but said farage would be delighted if the opportunity arose farage has also suggested that insulting comments senior tories made about trump may have been the reason for may coming so low down on the president elect s list of foreign leaders to call farage s remarks came after it emerged that the prime minister s two joint chiefs of staff had attacked trump on social media before taking up their current posts fiona hill posted last december donald trump is a chump while nick timothy wrote in march american politics was depressing enough before trump took off farage claimed this week to have been the catalyst for trump s rise in turn trump often referred to brexit on the campaign trail likening his predicted victory to the shock result in the referendum on membership of the european union in an interview with talkradio from spain before he left for the us farage said he was the catalyst for the downfall of the blairites the clintonites the bushites and all these dreadful people who work hand in glove with goldman sachs and everybody else have made themselves rich and ruined our countries he also joked about the idea of trump sexually assaulting may when he met her and described outgoing president barack obama as a creature asked about trump s possible future behaviour after he was accused of a series of sexual assaults which he denies farage added if it comes to it i could be there as the responsible adult role to make sure everything s ok a downing street source said farage s activities in the us were an irrelevance to the british government he has no role whatsoever we will not be talking to him the source said meanwhile axel schafer a senior member of angela merkel s social democrat coalition said may was delusional if she thought she could broker a good trade deal with trump schafer told the times that the likelihood of a speedy and preferential trade agreement between the uk and the us had changed even before tuesday the chances were rather low now the hope for this kind of deal seems delusional he said the labour leader jeremy corbyn described trump s election as a global wake up call that showed that britain must take back control from the billionaires bankrolling the tories corbyn accused the president elect of targeting the fears of people who feel left behind by the economic change of globalisation he said that instead of giving them solutions he had shifted the blame to other sections of society we have no idea how donald trump proposes to make america great again and theresa may s tories offer slogans but no solutions for most people in britain he said we will not tackle the damage done by elite globalisation just by leaving the eu we will not take back control unless we take on the corporate vested interests that control our energy our transport and have infiltrated our public services one thing is for sure neither billionaire donald trump nor the billionaire backed tories have any interest in giving people back control or reining in the predatory excesses of a globalised free for all corbyn told labour s south east regional conference in kent
2016-10-16,0,boris johnson said britain s continued membership of the eu would be a boon for the world and for europe in an unpublished newspaper column in which he wrestles with his decision to back or oppose brexit the foreign secretary has since insisted the column was intended merely as a tool for his own thought process calling it semi parodic in tone in a telegraph article written days before a published version in which he backed leaving johnson wrote of the eu this is a market on our doorstep ready for further exploitation by british firms the membership fee seems rather small for all that access why are we so determined to turn our back on it everybody was trying to make up their minds about whether or not to leave the european union and it is perfectly true that back in february i was wrestling with it like i think a lot of people in this country and i wrote a long piece which came down overwhelmingly in favour of leaving he told sky news i then thought i better see if i can make the alternative case for myself so i then wrote a sort of semi parodic article in the opposite sense which has mysteriously found its way into the paper this morning because i think i might have sent it to a friend but i set them side by side and it was blindingly obvious what the right thing to do was and i think the people made the right decision they voted very substantially to leave the european union that is what we are going to do and we are going to make a great success of it the published column which appeared in the sunday times is highly critical of the eu as an institution and the renegotiation deal sought by david cameron we are being outvoted ever more frequently johnson wrote the ratchet of integration clicks remorselessly forward there is going to be more and more of this stuff and i can see why people might just think to hell with it i want out i want to take back control of our democracy and our country if you feel that i perfectly understand because half the time i have been feeling that myself and then the other half of the time i have been thinking hmmm i like the sound of freedom i like the sound of restoring democracy but what are the downsides and here we must be honest the existence of the article in which he also warned that brexit would cause an economic shock and could lead to the breakup of the united kingdom was revealed in the book all out war the full story of how brexit sank britain s political class by the newspaper s sunday times s political editor tim shipman there is the worry about scotland and the possibility that an english only leave vote could lead to the break up of the union johnson wrote there is the putin factor we do not want to do anything to encourage more shirtless swaggering from the russian leader not in the middle east not anywhere the book also claims johnson wanted to punch his brexit ally michael gove after the former justice secretary announced his own bid to become prime minister on the morning of a speech in which johnson was to announce his own candidacy a move that ended up destroying both men s chances and paving the way for theresa may to enter no 10 the book also claims sir lynton crosby told johnson to support brexit once cameron had ignored the election strategist s advice to delay the referendum among the other revelations the remain campaign s digital specialist jim messina apparently described cameron pollster andrew cooper as the worst i ve ever worked with for getting wrong his forecasts about the vote lucy thomas former deputy director of the stronger in campaign said the unpublished column demonstrated how much of johnson s decision to back leaving the eu was about his political career none of it is about the detail none of it is about what life outside the eu looks like there was no thinking about prices going up or what would happen to jobs it is purely was the renegotiation enough is the status quo the right thing she said
2016-12-26,0,this christmas break for anybody steeped in the assumptions that have underpinned non mainstream political thinking needs to be a moment of realisation brexit will happen globalisation will fall apart freedom of movement as an unconditional right in the eu will end the concept of the west as upholder and occasional enforcer of human rights across the world is at the very least on hold it is not pessimism that makes me write this but optimism optimism that if we adapt our thinking to the new reality fast enough we can go on fighting for social justice and human rights on behalf of that generation staring glumly at their touchscreens over the christmas table but that is a big if this holiday season i guarantee that you will hear older relatives repeatedly say the words will never britain will never leave the eu donald trump will never take office fascism will never return to germany and austria since denial is the first stage of grief it is forgivable for people to struggle through from brexit to boxing day saying these things but not beyond when world changing events happen the denial reflex is strong because most rational people configure their principles around existing facts for example the european institutions that guarantee freedom of movement came to embody the principle held by many that borders should be as open as possible no matter that freedom of movement within europe was conditional on a three metre high razor fence between morocco and the spanish enclave at melilla the freedom bit seemed to embody a general principle in future we will have to separate our principles from institutions that once embodied them likewise for that more vaguely defined principle europeanism it took me until the age of 40 to visit the us by then i had travelled by foot air rail and road across europe i was convinced this was an inexhaustible cultural playground a place from which all my values emanated while much of the us was simply flyover country a young generation that spends stag weekends in riga childhood holidays in disney world florida and gap years in thailand is going to be less europeanist than mine but their globalism was built on the assumption that paris or berlin were short hop weekend destinations to be reached with a waft of one s passport towards a friendly border guard this mindset too will have to change to avoid brexit plunging us into the gdp catastrophe predicted by the treasury we have to pursue two outcomes first to minimise our break with the eu single market and if that fails to maximise it unsentimentally for those gripped with the denial instinct the objective of minimising the break comes easy but not the means the means through which we can achieve soft brexit are tough self centred negotiations that put the british national interest first if we fail because europe is a mess ruled by an elite in denial of its own failures it would be logical to pursue a total reconfiguration of our trade industrial base and attitude to globalisation even those like me fighting for the softest possible brexit must contemplate what the social justice agenda might look like after a hard one as for the global power system trump s cabinet choices show he intends to shatter it for the first time in a generation the section of the israeli right prone to the most violent rhetoric about the palestinians will go unrestrained by washington for the first time in a generation human rights campaigners in russia will have to look at the state department and the cia as a kind of informal conduit back to vladimir putin and the fsb security agency not their allies underlying all these changes is the fact that the global system is becoming a negative sum game for more than three generations it was a positive sum game it is the difference between the great british bake off and pass the parcel in gbbo even though only one person wins there is always more cake at the end than at the start in pass the parcel everybody except the winner loses and what is in the parcel is always a disappointment globalisation was a positive sum game even if for the former industrial populations of the west it was barely positive it lasted so long that people began to assume pass the parcel economics had become impossible we are about to find out that is a fallacy you can still fight for social justice wealth redistribution and human rights in a negative sum world but you cannot do it by clinging to principles you assumed were general but are not since free movement as an absolute right will be gone once we leave the eu i would reconfigure migration policy to deliver maximum social justice for two sets of people those who already live here including three million eu nationals and refugees whose right to claim asylum here should be absolute in a globalised world competitiveness meant a race to the bottom low wages and a shrunken welfare state in a negative sum world it means a fight to locate well paid high skill jobs in the uk and not elsewhere the weapons should be active industrial policy tax breaks high welfare spending and free university education paid for by the state being a nuclear armed state whose main ally for more than 70 years is suddenly ruled by an erratic kleptocrat who is morally indebted to the kremlin should prompt the biggest rethink of all for four years at least britain must operate diplomatically on our own we must cease fostering the illusion that we have the power on our own to save the syrian revolution restrain israel in its next assault on gaza or force abdel fattah el sisi to let journalists out of jail we should go on trying of course but with little promise of success these sobering facts will confront the left and the climate movement with hard choices just as they confront the liberal centre all we can do as churchill put it to the us congress on boxing day in 1941 is draw the sword for freedom and cast away the scabbard
2016-11-17,0,boris johnson s approach to brexit has been ridiculed by european ministers after he told italy it would have to offer tariff free trade in order to sell its prosecco in the uk carlo calenda an italian economics minister said it was insulting that johnson had told him during a recent meeting that italy would grant britain access to the eu s single market because you do not want to lose prosecco exports he basically said i do not want free movement of people but i want the single market he told bloomberg i said no way he said you will sell less prosecco i said ok you will sell less fish and chips but i ll sell less prosecco to one country and you will sell less to 27 countries putting things on this level is a bit insulting the italian also attacked the whole government s approach to the brexit negotiations saying the demand by johnson and others for access to the single market was incompatible with curbs on free movement of people somebody needs to tell us something and it needs to be something that makes sense he told bloomberg you cannot say that it is sensible to say we want access to the single market but no free circulation of people it is obvious that does not make any sense whatsoever calenda a former italian envoy to brussels said there is lots of chaos and we do not understand what the position is it is all becoming an internal uk debate which is not ok the british government needs to sit down put its cards on the table and negotiate a second attack was delivered by the dutch finance minister and eurogroup president jeroen dijsselbloem who said johnson s aims of leaving the customs union at the same time as securing immigration controls and maintaining access to the single market were not achievable dijsselbloem told the bbc s newsnight i think he is offering to the british people options that are really not available for example to say we could be inside the internal market but be outside the customs union this is impossible it just does not exist the opposite does exist we have a customs union with turkey but turkey is not part of the internal market he is saying things that are intellectually impossible politically unavailable so i think he is not offering the british people a fair view of what is available and what can be achieved in these negotiations describing brexit as a lose lose situation dijsselbloem added it would be in my country s interests and in european and british interests if the brits would stay in the eu but i do not think it is going to happen the next best option is to have as good an agreement as possible but the uk will be outside the single market and there will be some hindrances angela merkel the german chancellor also appeared to be standing firm on defending the fundamental principle of free movement within the eu on tuesday but conceded there could be room for further discussion around whether welfare benefits should be immediately available for life if an eu citizen moved to another member state theresa may the prime minister has refused to elaborate on her plan for brexit beyond saying she wants a bespoke deal curbs on immigration and as much free trade for uk businesses as possible she told the house of commons on wednesday that being in or out of the eu customs union was not a binary decision as her labour and snp critics attacked her lack of a strategy for brexit may repeatedly insisted she and her ministers were devising a coherent plan for exiting the eu but would not share details before negotiations began jeremy corbyn the labour leader focused his questions almost entirely on brexit and argued that the government was making a total shambles of it the prime minister plans to trigger article 50 notifying the eu of the uk s intention to leave the bloc by the end of march but there are growing concerns that her timetable is too ambitious after a note by a consultant at deloitte suggested the government lacked a plan for brexit and may need to employ up to 30 000 more civil servants to deal with the process sir simon fraser the former permanent secretary at the foreign office told the house of commons brexit committee on wednesday that the note appeared to exaggerate the problems but agreed there was not yet a central plan for leaving the eu my understanding is that it is indeed proving to be a very considerable challenge in whitehall to do this drawing up a brexit plan that the government has not yet reached the point where it is still in information gathering mode and is not yet at the point of integrating that into a central plan and that i assume will have to happen before the triggering of article 50 next year and i agree that this is a huge burden a huge additional load for the civil service this is an extraordinary complex range of activity across a wide range of domestic and international policies and it will definitely impose a great burden on the civil service in response michael gove the former cabinet minister and leading brexit campaigner pressed for the uk to achieve a quickie divorce with the eu regardless of the economic consequences as he raised concerns that civil servants were overcomplicating the process the former justice secretary who led the vote leave campaign with johnson questioned why the uk could not just leave the eu without having settled its future relationship with the bloc after having sorted out housekeeping related to outstanding payments can we simplify gove said what if i were to determine to simply leave the european union to trigger article 50 and to conclude the bare minimum in order to leave what would article 50 actually require me to agree for the purposes of this question i am not worried about transitional arrangements i am prepared to take

2016-12-01,0,the government has been warned that up to 1 million eu citizens living in the uk could be at risk of deportation if it does not come up with a simple way of recognising their status in the country the 3 million a grassroots group lobbying for the rights of non british citizens who have made the uk their home has told the home secretary it would take the home office 47 years to process applications from eu citizens for permanent residency pr we are people with families children friends and work colleagues and we are rightly worried about a very uncertain future said nicolas hatton chair of the 3 million in his letter to amber rudd eu citizens have been feeling very anxious about their future since the referendum and this set of data will not reassure them we call on you to remove the threat of deportation without notice and give us today guarantees that all eu citizens living legally in the uk will be able to exercise their right to remain before the uk leaves the eu theresa may has consistently said that rights for eu citizens were a legitimate part of brexit negotiations but on thursday night the government seemed to go one step further by indicating their rights could be removed if not reciprocated a home office spokesperson said the home secretary has been clear that she wants to protect the status of eu nationals already living here and the only circumstances in which that would not be possible is if british citizens rights in european member states were not protected in return the estimated time it would take the home office to deal with the 3 million eu citizens in the country is based on the latest immigration data which shows a surge in applications for pr since the eu referendum which has caused a backlog of 100 000 applications pr was designed for non eu citizens who wished to settle in the uk and involves an 85 page application form applicants not only have to provide five years of council tax bills bank statements or utility bills to demonstrate residency but also have to document each time they have been in and out of the country since they arrived in the uk monika lutke daldrup from germany who is an executive with a large european firm and lives in watford told the guardian i travel about 20 times a year and i have been here for 18 years it is ridiculous paola rizatto said i am an educated person but i found the 85 page form so overwhelming that i decided to hire an immigration lawyer i have already spent around 1 000 several mothers who have british children say they are not eligible for pr because their household bills are not in their names just to be married to a british person or to have british children is not enough said one another who asked not to be named said she had been told to get her child s school to sign a statement that she had been picking up her child each day for the past five years the 3 million said the home office process for pr is totally inconsistent and depends on what home office adviser you get data published on thursday shows that 30 of applications are rejected with many eu citizens unable to pass the paperwork test despite their legal right of residence as eu citizens if the government requires all non britons to join the non eu immigrants in the permanent residency queue up to 1 million could face deportation the day the uk leaves the eu the home office said there had been no change to the rights and status of eu nationals in the uk as a result of the referendum its guidance was that eu citizens did not need to apply for permanent residence as such there is no requirement to register for documentation to confirm their status a spokesperson said
2016-11-19,0,european leaders have come to a 27 nation consensus that a hard brexit is likely to be the only way to see off future populist insurgencies which could lead to the break up of the european union the hardening line in eu capitals comes as nigel farage warns european leaders that marine le pen leader of the front national could deliver a political sensation bigger than brexit and win france s presidential election next spring a result that would mean it was game over for 60 years of eu integration according to senior officials at the highest levels of european governments allowing britain favourable terms of exit could represent an existential danger to the eu since it would encourage similar demands from other countries with significant eurosceptic movements one top eu diplomat told the observer if you british are not prepared to compromise on free movement the only way to deal with brexit is hard brexit otherwise we would be seen to be giving in to a country that is leaving that would be fatal the latest intervention by farage will only serve to fuel fears in europe that anti eu movements have acquired a dangerous momentum in countries such as france and the netherlands following the precedent set by the brexit vote ukip s interim leader who predicted both the vote for brexit and donald trump s us victory told the observer that while le pen was still more likely to be runner up to an establishment candidate next may she now had to be taken seriously as a potential head of state she will clearly win through to the second round and after what has happened elsewhere only a fool would say she would have no chance of winning overall france is a deeply deeply unhappy country if she were to win it would be game over for the eu le pen has made clear she wants to take france out of the euro and the eu the prospective hardline approach has been agreed by the 27 member states as a bloc acting in concert the remaining eu states will refuse to grant the uk access to the single market unless london agrees to sign up to its rules including free movement of people capital services and labour norbert röttgen chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the german bundestag told the observer that he wanted to help the uk but if there were no willingness to accept eu rules there was no hope i am really ready to come to a result but if the british position is no no no then even i would have to say that there is no common ground the vice president of the centre right european people s party german mep david mcallister added you cannot have 100 control over internal migration say no to european court of justice rulings and that you will not pay anything into the budget this just will not work the british are testing us we all know that they are testing how united europe is so what is important is that europe stays together no bilateral negotiations with the british no cherry picking we are doing this as a bloc trump s sensational victory led some members of the french establishment and politicians in berlin and brussels to worry that le pen could benefit from a similar wave of popular discontent and pose a real threat former french prime minister jean pierre raffarin said reason no longer prevailed in france and that le pen can win farage who has been heavily critical of the front national as a party but admires le pen personally said he had not had time to think about whether he would support her campaign for the elysée it has been too busy he said what i would say is that i have not had anything good to say about the national front but equally not anything bad to say about marine le pen i think the important thing for her is to run as much as possible as an individual as her own person french mep constance le grip said she did not believe le pen could win but admitted there was a danger of bolstering support for her if the uk were given an exit deal that was too favourable if you start to reshape the whole project to be some sort of europe à la carte it is the beginning of the end apart from the fact that le pen will then claim victory wilders in the netherlands and so on more opt outs for the uk would be absolutely incoherent and absurd on 29 october less than two weeks before trump seized the white house farage rejected prevailing opinion and forecast his victory against hillary clinton i am going to predicthere and now that trump is going to win on 1 june 22 days before the brexit vote he said i believe we will win

2016-10-26,0,theresa may privately warned that companies would leave the uk if the country voted for brexit during a secret audience with investment bankers a month before the eu referendum a recording of her remarks to goldman sachs leaked to the guardian reveals she had numerous concerns about britain leaving the eu it contrasts with her nuanced public speeches which dismayed remain campaigners before the vote in june speaking at the bank in london on 26 may the then home secretary appeared to go further than her public remarks to explain more clearly the economic benefits of staying in the eu she told staff it was time the uk took a lead in europe and that she hoped voters would look to the future rather than the past in an hour long session before the city bankers she also worried about the effect of brexit on the british economy i think the economic arguments are clear she said i think being part of a 500 million trading bloc is significant for us i think as i was saying to you a little earlier that one of the issues is that a lot of people will invest here in the uk because it is the uk in europe if we were not in europe i think there would be firms and companies who would be looking to say do they need to develop a mainland europe presence rather than a uk presence so i think there are definite benefits for us in economic terms her warning about the importance of the uk s membership of the eu comes in marked contrast to her positioning in recent weeks may said at the conservative party conference that she wanted to prioritise reducing immigration over being part of the single market in her speech she said british companies needed the maximum freedom to trade and operate in the single market but not at the expense of giving up control of immigration again or accepting the jurisdiction of judges in luxembourg at goldman sachs may also said she was convinced britain s security was best served by remaining in europe because of tools such as the european arrest warrant and the information sharing between the police and intelligence agencies there are definitely things we can do as members of the european union that i think keep us more safe she said the disclosures could prove embarrassing for the prime minister who faced criticism for lying low during the referendum campaign and offering only luke warm support for the remain side in april may gave a speech in which she set out some of the reasons for staying in the eu warning that it could have an impact on the development of the single market for the rest of the eu if the uk left but her comments at the goldman sachs event a month later go further in warning about the dangers to the british economy from businesses relocating to continental europe during the referendum campaign may infuriated senior conservative colleagues on the remain side by largely staying out of the day to day arguments in favour of staying in the eu one of her major pro remain interventions was overshadowed by an announcement that she would like to take the uk out of the european convention on human rights which she quickly ditched when running for the party leadership her refusal to participate much in the campaign led craig oliver david cameron s former chief of communications to wonder if she was secretly an enemy agent for the other side however others have suggested she believed in the arguments for staying in but was keeping her powder dry in case of a pro brexit vote may went to goldman sachs as a guest speaker and answered questions from the floor in relaxed exchanges she praised cameron the then prime minister and said he had returned with important concessions from his eu summit earlier in the year she sidestepped a question about whether she wanted to be prime minister and focused on explaining why britain should stay in the eu may said that is one of my messages in terms of the issue of the referendum actually we should not be voting to try to recreate the past we should be voting for what is right for the future goldman sachs confirmed may had spoken to staff but was not paid she accepted an invitation as part of the bank s talks gs programme in which high achievers from all walks of like are given a chance to reflect on their experiences and answer questions previous speakers in the series include double olympic champion dame kelly holmes david benioff the co creator of the game of thrones tv series and loyd grossman the man behind the eponymous sauces some of the speakers are listed online although may is not in the us the democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton made three private speeches to goldman sachs staff in 2013 the contents of which she originally refused to divulge during a bitter primary contest with leftwing rival bernie sanders she was paid 675 000 554 000 and transcripts eventually released by wikileaks show her taking a much softer line on wall street than she had publicly claimed introduced in her private session at the bank as the longest serving home secretary this century may spoke in much more explicit terms than ever before about the need for the uk to act from the front in europe what i do think is that the uk needs to lead in europe she said i think over the years the uk has tended to take a view that europe is something that is done to us we have taken a rather backseat position to europe i think that when we go out there when we can take the initiative and when we lead we can achieve things so i do think we need to make sure we are taking the lead she dismissed concerns of senior figures in the military who had claimed that the eu was making life more difficult for soldiers actually very often when people talk about it i suspect and i have not spoken to them i suspect that they are not talking about the european union but the european convention on human rights and the european court of human rights which is separate from the european union tim farron the lib dem leader said it was disappointing that theresa may lacked the political courage to warn the public as she did a bunch of bankers in private about the devastating economic effects of brexit he added more disappointing is that now she is supposedly in charge she is blithely ignoring her own warnings and is prepared to inflict an act of monumental self harm on the uk economy by pulling britain out of the single market phil wilson a labour mp speaking for the open britain group campaigning for the uk to stay in the single market said it is good to know that privately theresa may thinks what many of us have been saying publicly for a long time leaving the single market would be bad for businesses and for our economy now she is prime minister theresa may is in an unrivalled position to act on her previous concerns starting by putting membership of the single market at the heart of her government s negotiating position chuka umunna the labour mp and former shadow business secretary said may was right then and it underlines why single market membership should be her ambition now a no 10 spokesman said britain made a clear choice to vote to leave the eu and this government is determined to make a success of the fresh opportunities it presents david davis made very clear in the house of commons last week the importance the government places on financial services across the uk in the negotiation to come as has the chancellor in recent weeks we want a smooth and orderly exit from the european union which would be in the interests of both britain and the eu
2016-12-06,0,theresa may has been challenged over her decision to wear a 995 pair of leather trousers for a newspaper photoshoot by a reporter on a flight to bahrain but sidestepped the question to insist she was working for everyone in britain the prime minister was interrogated after it emerged she wore the trousers and a pair of 295 burberry trainers when photographed by the sunday times last month may was also questioned about her choice of goose for christmas dinner rather than a traditional turkey but replied that her fashion choices or festive menu did not mean she was distant from the general public giving a look of mild exasperation may responded i stood on the steps of downing street and said what i did about the importance of a country that works for everyone because that is what i have heard from people as i ve gone around the country as i ve met people in a whole variety of circumstances i believe it is important for politicians to get out and about and that is what i continue to it is important we have a country that works for everyone over the weekend nicky morgan the former education secretary who was sacked by may said the trousers had been noticed and discussed in local tory circles i do not have leather trousers i do not think i ve ever spent that much on anything apart from my wedding dress morgan said on tuesday the conservative mp nadine dorries rounded on morgan for criticising may s dress sense implying that a male politician would get no such criticism calling the former education secretary sacked nicky morgan dorries tweeted in her interview with the sunday times in november may said she did not have a stylist but took fashion advice from her husband philip he is good at accessories too she said particularly good at choosing handbags and bracelets for presents and good at flowers on monday the radio times published an interview in which the prime minister revealed that she preferred goose for christmas dinner watching doctor who over the festive season and listening to radio berkshire in the evenings before bed
2016-11-18,0,theresa may and angela merkel have discussed the possibility of agreeing deals with african countries to stem migration into europe following the model of the eu turkey refugee deal as well as the importance of rolling over sanctions against russia in relation to the conflict in eastern ukraine we will support the eu action to work in source countries to deal with the root causes of migration the british prime minister said her attempt at getting in a few words on brexit was rebuffed before the meeting by the german chancellor who said no further detailed discussions could be held until the uk formally submitted its application to exit the trade bloc by triggering article 50 we will not be able to talk about britain s exit from the european union because the prime minister has said she will make the application for britain to leave in accordance with article 50 by the end of march merkel said we accept that and wait for that application may said she would try to make brexit a smooth and orderly process our work is on track we do stand ready to trigger article 50 by the end of march 2017 she said the prime minister also implied that she would raise the possibility of sanctions against russia in relation to bombings in syria saying there was a need to keep up the pressure against russia including the possibility of sanctions on those who breach international humanitarian law earlier merkel had said russian sanctions had only been discussed in relation to ukraine not syria the one to one meeting in berlin came after barack obama used his last get together with european leaders as us president to urge them to work with his successor donald trump and consider further steps to solve the crises in syria and eastern ukraine following lengthy talks with merkel on wednesday and thursday obama and the leaders of britain france italy and spain discussed the humanitarian situation in aleppo and the need to keep working together as part of multilateral bodies such as nato and to press ahead with the transatlantic agenda the white house said in a statement trump said during his presidential campaign that if russia attacked a nato member he would consider whether the targeted country had met its defence commitments before providing military aid the leaders were also expected to talk about the threat posed by the dispersal of seasoned isis fighters who are being pushed out of iraq and syria by coalition attacks and could move to other countries in africa or the middle east or return to europe the issue of the movement of isis fighters was raised at the un general assembly meeting in september and was discussed again as we close down daesh s areas of operation in one part of the world we need to be mindful of the fact that they may regroup in other parts and how we set about tackling that a downing street spokesperson said with the last leg of his farewell tour taking him to berlin obama had made clear that if there had been a special relationship between the us and a european country during his eight years in office it had not been with britain but with germany including an intense three hour dinner on wednesday and a lengthy press conference on thursday in which obama praised merkel as the only figure left among his allies the events of the last days have emphasised a symbolic passing of the baton as if to underline his point even further the us president was scheduled to head back across the atlantic barely two and a half hours after meeting may and other european leaders obama s last official visit to europe has been infused with nostalgia with the american and german leaders at times struggling to hide their concerns over a power shift in global politics obama said trump as president was unlikely to follow exactly our blueprint or our approach though he said he was hopeful that his successor would pursue constructive policies that defend democratic values and the rule of law he said trump should not simply take a realpolitik approach and suggest we just cut some deals with russia even if it hurts people or violates international norms or leaves smaller countries vulnerable or creates long term problems in regions like syria asked whether ongoing sanctions on russia would be discussed in berlin the downing street spokesman said clearly we will seek agreement to maintain the ukraine related sanctions until such time as we see the minsk agreement implemented obviously we will expect to see the quint leaders united in the need to keep up pressure on the syrian regime and their influencers to stop the actions that are taking place there speaking after the friday meetings merkel said she felt a duty to serve her country and europe adding further fuel to rampant speculation that she will seek a fourth term as chancellor asked how she saw her short and long term responsibilities merkel downplayed descriptions of herself as the last great defender of western values following trump s election telling reporters one person alone can never solve everything instead she vowed to perform her task as german chancellor which on the one hand is to serve the people of germany but it also includes working for the cohesion and success of europe merkel is scheduled to hold a news conference late on sunday after meeting senior members of her party
2016-12-29,0,jeremy corbyn will urge the public to join him in taking on the political establishment in 2017 in a new year video message aimed at cementing his reputation as a combative outsider in the video shot at westminster corbyn describes 2016 as a year that will live long in all of our memories and says he understands some of the concerns that led to the brexit vote people did not trust politicians and they did not trust the european union he says i understand that i ve spent over 40 years in politics campaigning for a better way of doing things standing up for people taking on the establishment and opposing decisions that would make us worse off he promises to fight against a brexit deal that would safeguard the interests of city banks or continue corporate handouts to big businesses saying labour was founded to stand up for people and we founded the institutions that do that day in and day out like our nhs we are the party that listens to you and makes britain better let us do that together in 2017 labour strategists have taken a deliberate decision to play to corbyn s strength as an unpolished political maverick who has notoriously refused to toe the party line throughout several decades as an mp the labour leader has appeared more assured since he convincingly saw off owen smith s leadership challenge in september with his opponent admitting that corbyn s performance at the dispatch box has improved corbyn also knows labour will be under intense scrutiny in the months ahead close allies including the shadow home secretary diane abbott have acknowledged that the party needs to try to close the gap with the conservatives in the polls in the video in which he appears in a tailored navy jacket against the south bank skyline of county hall and the london eye corbyn reflects on the past year saying every day i see the political system letting down the people of this country how decisions made in westminster are making people s lives harder he cites rising homelessness the crisis in social care funding and the increasing prevalence of low pay and insecure jobs millions of people cannot plan their lives because whether on temporary or zero hours contracts they do not know what job or what hours they will have from day to day week to week or month to month and for many pay is so low that it does not make ends meet labour is attempting to gear up for a potential snap general election in early 2017 although no candidates have yet been selected for key seats mps with marginal seats in former industrial areas far from corbyn s islington constituency doubt his appeal extends beyond the metropolis the party may have a battle on its hands to maintain the copeland constituency that will shortly be vacated by jamie reed the corbyn critic who is leaving parliament to work for the nuclear site sellafield corbyn was blamed by many of his pro eu mps for failing to fight hard enough to win the referendum but his allies believe that his cautious tone in which he encouraged voters to stick with the eu warts and all better reflected the public mood john mcdonnell the shadow chancellor sparked outrage among some in his own party recently by citing the enormous opportunities brexit could bring corbyn s new year message reiterates his stance that labour accepts and respects the result of the referendum after the shadow brexit secretary keir starmer pushed the government to promise to produce a plan before legislating to invoke article 50 in the new year corbyn hinted that labour might do more to try to influence the process we will not be blocking our leaving the european union but we will not stand by he said corbyn s more combative tone was evident in a guardian interview earlier this week in which he compared theresa may s wish to use the royal prerogative to take britain out of the eu with henry viii the labour leader makes no reference to his own turbulent year which saw him face down scores of shadow cabinet resignations and a vote of no confidence by 172 of his own mps an overwhelming majority most backbenchers believe it is unlikely he will face a fresh threat to his leadership in 2017
2016-11-06,0,in the hall of india and pakistan on the first floor of the offices of the royal over seas league members club a largely male elderly group of about a hundred drank coffee ate chocolate chip cookies and badmouthed the new number one enemies of democracy british judges the occasion was a hastily organised brexit conference near central london s green park a book sale in the corner of the event hosted by the thatcherite bruges group offered a taste of the views held by many in the room anthony scholefield and gerald frost s too nice to be tories how the modernisers damaged the conservative party competed for attention with david brown s end of the english the european superstate once upon a time this gathering would have been dismissed as an irrelevance to modern britain s political culture a get together of fruitcakes to quote david cameron s mocking description of ukip voters in the days before the joke was suddenly on him but such lofty dismissals now belong to another age the rage felt in this room at the high court s decision to insist on parliamentary approval for triggering britain s exit from the european union and give mps a decisive say in the government s general goals is being taken very seriously by the current incumbent of downing street in one corner of the room nigel farage s former spokesman patrick o flynn talking to a tv camera spoke for many the judgment had been a wakeup call to those who had been walking around with smiles on their faces since the referendum he said it had become clear during the conservative party conference that the government was intent on a hard brexit involving the removal of the uk from the customs union and the single market and that it believed the referendum gave it a mandate if not a democratic duty to deliver there had been a period of sniping from the remainers but it had been judged of little consequence flynn suggested but now the phoney war was over or as one senior brexiter a former government minister not at the event told the observer the remainers have won this first battle now we have to win the war it was shortly after 10am on thursday that the high court s ruling was delivered its impact proved to be all the greater due to the assumption that the challenge was a lost cause a last futile attempt to turn the brexit tide there had also been an unusual level of secrecy around the verdict none of the lawyers involved had been given the normal advance drafts of the judgment to check for mistakes and to prepare their submissions the government had argued during a three day hearing that nothing in the european communities act of 1972 restricted the crown s power to withdraw from eu treaties using the royal prerogative without recourse to parliament but the lord chief justice was having none of it the government s arguments had been contrary to fundamental constitutional principles of the sovereignty of parliament the victorian constitutionalist av dicey was quoted the judges know nothing about any will of the people except in as far as that will is expressed by an act of parliament the court concluded the government does not have power under the crown s prerogative to give notice pursuant to article 50 for the uk to withdraw from the european union officials in downing street hastily cancelled their lunch plans and scurried back to the prime minister s side the pound surged to a four week high against both dollar and euro and a vitriolic media backlash began as brexit supporting tabloids went for the throats of the judges who had delivered this outrage the judges who blocked brexit one founded a european law group another charged the taxpayer millions for advice and the third is an openly gay ex olympic fencer screamed mailonline nigel farage was soon stoking the fires of resentment and allegations of betrayal tweeting i now fear every attempt will be made to block or delay triggering article 50 they have no idea level of public anger they will provoke the communities and local government secretary sajid javid a notably reluctant remain campaigner before the referendum stepped outside his brief to condemn the decision as unacceptable and next day s newspapers threw caution to the wind enemies of the people concluded the daily mail the judges versus the people huffed the daily telegraph richard desmond s rarely understated daily express covered its front page with the union flag over which it printed in bold three judges yesterday blocked brexit now your country really does need you we must get out of the eu with characteristic insouciance the foreign secretary boris johnson admitted during a visit to berlin to some sturm und drang back home meanwhile theresa may was hitting the phones a no 10 spokesman said may had explained to european commission president jean claude juncker and german chancellor angela merkel that while the government is disappointed by the judgment we remain of the firm belief that we have strong legal arguments ahead of the case which will be moving to the supreme court next month the prime minister also confirmed that the planned timetable for notification of article 50 remains the same the spokesman added whether that proves to be the case may has promised to trigger article 50 by the end of march is very much open to question the brexit secretary david davis has confirmed that a parliamentary bill will most likely be necessary if the high court s ruling is upheld and such a bill could be amended with stipulations over everything from a second referendum on the terms of the final deal to mere reassurances on general goals the proposed legislation may bounce between the commons and the lords over weeks and months we will make sure that we build into that bill a referendum that will take place before the uk leaves the eu to give us the opportunity to endorse or reject that deal liberal democrat leader tim farron said in a sign of the import of the moment for the first time since the court was established in 2009 all 11 justices of the supreme court will now sit to hear the government s appeal over four days in early december on which way the judges will fall every politician has a view ken clarke the former chancellor and justice secretary said he felt that the verdict was in line with modern constitutional law nobody starts a war nowadays without getting parliamentary approval and nobody should completely break economic and trade links with our closest allies without parliamentary approval he told the observer the referendum was always supposed to be advisory the former cabinet minister john redwood one of john major s famous maastricht bastards who made the then prime minister s attempts to sign that eu treaty such a torture insisted that the decision would be swiftly seen as a piece of shoddy work and rejected i assume the government is right and they will reverse the lower court s decision because it is such a bad decision he said the passage on the referendum is just laughable they just assert that it is advisory when every household was sent a letter making it very clear that we the people are making the decision and parliament will implement it for you it was in the hansard record and the prime minister repeated it the supreme court has every reason to say you have not understood referenda on monday the government will make a statement in parliament on the matter and a cross party meeting of mps who had campaigned for remain concluded that they would wait until the new ruling to take any decisions on the way forward but already even those who say they will not block article 50 out of respect to their constituents are citing an array of reassurances that they will require in any upcoming bill parliament has been jolted back to life central government is dominated by the london perspective and the london economy said andy burnham the mp for leigh who is standing to be the mayor of manchester we cannot have trade deals that protect the city of london but sacrifice other sectors clarke added i will vote against article 50 that should not shock anybody i have believed it is in the national interest to be in the eu for the last 50 years and big events have proved me overwhelmingly right over that period the key thing is where we move on from that to start holding the government to account the referendum decided we would leave but no two ministers are agreed on what steps are and what alternative we are putting in place once the government has agreed on a policy on our economic and trading relations with the wider world it seems to be plain that it is accountable to parliament for that policy the conservative mp stephen phillips who campaigned to leave the eu quit his seat on friday in protest at the government s attempt to sideline parliament s role in shaping brexit but as parliament stirs so have many of the people who voted for leaving the eu but who came to believe last week with encouragement from some in the media and political classes that something undemocratic is afoot it is even believed by some that those who are celebrating last week s victory may come to reap a whirlwind especially if the prime minister feels that she needs a general election to change the nature of parliament in favour of her goals the lib dems think defying the referendum result is an electoral ticket back to the big time said former justice minister dominic raab their antics just look like irresponsible opportunism precisely when the country needs to see some unity of purpose behind the government s brexit negotiations in the country at large the mood has become newly toxic waiting for his wife outside gloucester s historic new inn on friday ray marchmont said he was fed up with politicians politics the judiciary and probably the media gloucester voted leave by 58 5 to remain s 41 5 in june and marchmont supported the winning side my vote s gone out of the window he said they have taken it away from us i did not know anything about this court case it was a shock when i heard about it i could not get my head around it they have just said stuff it we are going to do what we want the 66 year old ukip supporter added i think a lot of it is sour grapes they have said you have your vote now we are going to decide if they do vote to turn it over then i think there could be repercussions jacqui robins who like marchmont lives in the city and was one of the 37 776 people to vote leave in gloucester also expressed bewilderment if it is the people s choice then the politicians should not go against it she said why ask the people if that is what they are going to do it seems like a waste of money and time robins had been intending to vote remain but had changed her mind during the campaign i was going to vote to stay but then i thought change is good but if we are going to go out then out means out she declared echoing the prime minister s brexit utterance back in green park o flynn who since leaving farage s side has become a ukip mep for the east of england said there was no need for the newspapers to apologise for their attacks on the judiciary in fact he wants more of it judges have this particular conceit of themselves that they are so lofty that they are immune to the vulgarity of public opinion i do not think that is true he said and that is why i was delighted by the newspaper coverage we need to harness the public outrage what can ukip do i ve come to the rather happy conclusion that it is our solemn duty to be shamelessly populist
2016-12-28,0,jeremy corbyn has accused theresa may of behaving like henry viii or a similar autocratic monarch because of her refusal to commit to putting a final brexit deal to a vote in parliament in an interview with the guardian the labour leader insisted that the prime minister could not be allowed to use the royal prerogative to bypass the commons over the uk s future relationship with continental europe earlier this month may repeatedly refused to commit to a parliamentary vote during a select committee hearing prompting corbyn to conjure up an image of the prime minister acting as if she was an overbearing tudor it a final brexit deal would have to come to parliament she cannot hide behind henry viii and the divine rights of the power of kings on this one he said pointing out that meps in the european parliament would have a vote on the proposed settlement the idea that on something as major as this the prime minister would use the royal prerogative to bypass parliament is extraordinary i do not know where she is coming from the comments which refer to whatever deal is agreed at the end of the brexit negotiating process in 2019 rather than the trigger of article 50 next year came during a wide ranging interview corbyn also the labour leader said blair had already ruled himself out of the forthcoming byelection in copeland in cumbria triggered by the resignation of jamie reed but asked if he would be happy with another constituency amid rumours that blair was considering a comeback corbyn said i think the nuanced differences of opinion between me and tony blair are quite well known i do not see tony blair and i working together i do not think he does either his frank language about both the prime minister and blair come as labour strategists seek to ramp up corbyn s image as a leftwing populist who is prepared to rail against establishment figures they believe that while the labour leader is already seen in that way by part of the population there are too many voters who may consider the islington mp to be part of the establishment corbyn is expected to appear more frequently on television as an expanded team of advisers work up policies aimed at underlining a willingness to lead a revolt against vested interests despite pressure from labour mps including manchester mayoral hopeful andy burnham to take a tougher line on free movement corbyn did not list immigration among his post brexit priorities instead he spelled out a desire to protect market access as well as maintaining human rights and opposing racism arguing that britain could not be a bargain basement economy on the edge of europe he also claimed that there was a level of exaggeration about any negative impacts of migration on british society corbyn said we should recognise that european workers in britain do contribute massively to the health service education manufacturing industry care work agricultural sector we would be in quite a difficult place if they all went we have to recognise that people do move around the continent do move to work do move to pay taxes and to benefit the economy that they come into they do not have unfettered access to benefits the day they arrive in britain they do not have unfettered access to housing the day they arrive corbyn said he wanted people to think for a moment who treats them when they go to the doctors who treats them when they go to hospital who is doing the technical work often in many places and you will find the same with british people all over the world corbyn argued that companies such as airbus nissan and hitachi needed to be free to move skilled workers around europe and would leave britain if brexit meant higher tariffs to access the single market he also hinted that he believed continued free movement would be necessary to secure labour s priority of economic access claiming that a work visa scheme would be fraught with difficulties because of the high level of integration with europe he also cast doubts on whether labour would support a system in which people could only come if they had a job well then that will work in reverse for british people going abroad which would be difficult to implement and maybe is counter to the principles of the european market however he did set out plans for a policy which he is expected to stress much more frequently in 2017 which could result in migration numbers falling what we need to address is exploitation undercutting and the way in which companies are trying to destroy industrial agreements by ignoring what they should be doing which is paying people properly and not bringing people in to undercut said corbyn the labour leader said he was building alliances with socialist parties in other countries because the final brexit deal hammered out over two years after article 50 is triggered will be put to the european parliament presumably all national parliaments will want a say as well so our relations with socialist groups in every national parliament could be important said corbyn before insisting that british mps also had to be given a vote on the deal it is not clear whether the government is prepared to offer that or not the brexit secretary david davis has hinted that mps could be given a vote but may was unwilling to offer that commitment when she appeared in front of the liaison committee last week corbyn also urged all members of the leftwing campaigning group momentum to join the labour party he also encouraged the hundreds of thousands of people who joined labour to back him to get more involved in campaigning amid claims from mps that new members were failing to turn out he said he wanted all mps to move on from the summer s leadership contest and insisted that the party was in a strong position despite some dire recent poll ratings corbyn said he hoped to gain seats in may s local elections and claimed the media was ignoring labour s successes i cannot pretend the two byelection results were good he said about results in richmond park in london and sleaford lincolnshire but on the same day we gained a ward in telford with a 20 increase in vote and overall majority on council we have never won that ward ever no media reported that we held a ward in lancaster he added results vary i want to do better corbyn dismissed reports that he has told friends he is ready to step down in 2019 because of his age saying friends is obviously a very loose term these days i ve never said that i m very happy doing my campaigning this is the age of the 60s look at trump clinton sanders angela merkel look around you sixties is the new 40s i keep fit
